5000|$|Cranial sutures are {{indicators}} of skull function and morphologies {{can be linked}} to specific feeding modes. <b>Transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> changes can be observed by examining cross sectional morphology of a suture in taxa of the fish-tetrapod transition. [...] Comparing positionally comparable sutures in extant fish allows {{for the creation of a}} sutural morphospace. The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth. There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in Polypterus, a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod Phonerpeton, there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. Acanthostega fossil records demonstrate that no strain pattern was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The load compression is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment.|$|E
40|$|Background: Many preterm {{neonates}} display difficulty establishing suck-feeding {{competence in}} the weeks following birth. Ineffective management of <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> issues may cause patient complications, and can contribute to increased length of stay. Aims: Given that many neonatal nurseries appear to vary in their neonatal feeding management practices, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate and document the routine level of support and intervention currently provided for preterm neonates with <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> issues across the various level II (special care) nurseries (SCNs) in Queensland, Australia. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to all Queensland SCNs in 2005 (n = 36). The questionnaire contained a series of closed-choice and short-answer questions designed to obtain information from each SCN regarding their current practices for managing <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> issues in preterm neonates. Results were confirmed during a follow-up phone call. Results: Responses were obtained from 29 SCNs (80. 6 %). None of these nurseries reported having any formal, written policies regarding the management of <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> issues in preterm neonates. Wide variations were reported in relation to the suck-feeding assessments and interventions used by staff within the various SCNs. Of the 29 nurseries, 4 (13. 8 %) reported using checklists or assessments to judge readiness for suck-feeds, and 5 (17. 2 %) reported using pulse oximetry to judge tolerance of suck-feeding attempts. Eighteen SCNs (62. 1 %) reported offering some form of active intervention to assist neonates with <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> issues, with the most common intervention techniques reported being non-nutritive sucking during tube feeds, pre-feeding oral stimulation, and actively pacing suck-feeds. Twenty-two SCNs (75. 4 %) reported having access to a lactation consultant to assist mothers with breastfeeding issues. Conclusions: Differences were reported in the routine management of <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> issues in preterm neonates across the various SCNs in Queensland. It is suggested that evidence based guidelines need to be developed, and that, in order to do this, further research studies are required to determine current best practice, as well as to answer remaining questions. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{the establishment of}} healthy feeding practices early in life to promote lifelong healthy eating patterns protective against chronic disease such as obesity. Current early childhood obesity prevention interventions are built on extant understandings of how feeding practices relate to infant 2 ̆ 7 s cues of hunger and satiety. Further insights regarding factors that influence feeding behaviors in early life may improve program designs and outcomes. Four electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed qualitative studies published between 2000 to 2014 with <b>transitional</b> infant <b>feeding</b> practice rationale from developed countries. Reporting transparency and potential bias was assessed using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research quality checklist. Thematic synthesis of 23 manuscripts identified three themes (and six sub-themes) : Theme 1. Infant (physical cues and behavioural cues) focuses on the perceived signs of readiness to start solids and the feeding to influence growth and “health happiness. ” Theme 2. Mother (coping strategies and knowledge and skills) focuses on the early survival of the infant and {{the family and the}} feeding to satisfy hunger and influence infant contentment, and sleep. Theme 3. Community (pressure and inconsistent advice) highlights the importance of generational feeding and how conflicting feeding advice led many mothers to adopt valued familial or culturally established practices. Overall, mothers were pivotal to feeding decisions. Satisfying infant 2 ̆ 7 s needs to reach “good mothering” status as measured by societal expectations was highly valued but lacked consideration of nutrition, obesity, and long term health. Maternal interpretation of healthy infant feeding and successful parenting need attention when developing strategies to support new families...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{multiscale}} modeling {{in biology}} {{is to use}} structurally based physico-chemical models to integrate across temporal and spatial scales of biology and thereby improve mechanistic understanding of, for example, how a single mutation can alter organism-scale phenotypes. This approach may also inform therapeutic strategies or identify candidate drug targets that might otherwise have been overlooked. However, in many cases, it remains unclear how best to synthesize information obtained from various scales and analysis approaches, such as atomistic molecular models, Markov state models (MSM), subcellular network models, and whole cell models. In this paper, we use protein kinase A (PKA) activation {{as a case study}} to explore how computational methods that model different physical scales can complement each other and integrate into an improved multiscale representation of the biological mechanisms. Using measured crystal structures, we show how molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with atomic-scale MSMs can provide conformations for Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations to <b>feed</b> <b>transitional</b> states and kinetic parameters into protein-scale MSMs. We discuss how milestoning can give reaction probabilities and forward-rate constants of cAMP association events by seamlessly integrating MD and BD simulation scales. These rate constants coupled with MSMs provide a robust representation of the free energy landscape, enabling access to kinetic and thermodynamic parameters unavailable from current experimental data. These approaches have helped to illuminate the cooperative nature of PKA activation in response to distinct cAMP binding events. Collectively, this approach exemplifies a general strategy for multiscale model development that is applicable {{to a wide range of}} biological problems...|$|R
40|$|This work {{develops}} a generalized modeling framework using several techniques {{for assessing the}} feasibility of an eco-industrial network or ‘eco-park’ in order to demonstrate the environmental and economic benefits of industrial facilities with cooperative goals to conserve energy and materials. The work takes advantage of three distinct types of modeling techniques (linear programming, mixed-integer linear programming and mixed-integer non-linear programming) to incorporate increasingly complex circumstances for designing eco-industrial networks. The purpose {{of this research is}} to provide policy-makers and facility designers with an approach to optimize construction of facilities based upon economic and environmental incentives. This framework allows for optimizing the material and energy efficiency of a network of facilities to reduce emissions, waste, and input of materials and energy while maintaining production levels. Major contributions from this thesis are to examine the potential for alternative-fuel vehicles within the concept of a hydrogen economy and exploration of eco-industrial networks, utilizing the tools of life cycle analysis and system optimization. Life-cycle assessment is utilized as a tool for decision-making throughout this thesis and is an invaluable asset in making environmentally-conscious decisions. This type of assessment evaluates the emissions of a product from virgin material extraction through to final disposition in the aquatic, terrestrial or atmospheric domain. The use of life-cycle assessment techniques shows clear impacts on society over the entire lifecycle of the products and processes considered herein. Development of a dual-objective function to account for economics and environmental performance of industrial facilities is developed and utilized to aid in the decision process for policy-makers and facility designers. The concept of eco-industrial networks is further extended by including additional components, such as transportation modes, within the model. To this end, preliminary work examines the practical possibility of shifting automobile propulsion technologies to alternative fuels with emphasis on the criteria air contaminants considered herein of greenhouse gases, volatile organic compounds, and oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. The scenarios presented are based on a model of the electricity system in the province of Ontario, Canada and energy pathway analysis to assess the supportable market penetration of, and emissions from, alternative vehicle technologies. The recommendation of this work is that a transition to electric vehicles in the near-term followed by a transition to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will yield the largest reduction in criteria air contaminants in both the urban centre of Toronto, Ontario and in the province as a whole. The consideration of transportation and <b>transitional</b> technologies <b>feeds</b> directly into the concept of eco-industrial parks and the benefit to society of their implementation. The reduction in transportation distance between relatable chemical manufacturers has been hailed as a major benefit of implementing eco-industrial park topology. This work {{develops a}} generalized modeling framework for eco-industrial parks based on a dual objective of societal and industrial requirements. The nodes considered in this work include: energy generation via hydrocarbon gasification or reforming, carbon capture, carbon sequestration, pressure-swing adsorption in addition to the manufacture of ammonia and urea within the context of refueling a fleet of 1000 hydrogen vehicles. Life-cycle assessment is applied to form the societal benefits of operating facilities within an eco-industrial framework and the long-term economics of the processes are considered to form the economic portion of the objective. Modeling is carried out in three distinct types: linear programming, mixed-integer linear programming and mixed-integer non-linear programming. Each of these types represents a different modeling framework developed to assess various complexities in the eco-industrial network and yet they share common goals, themes and analysis methods. Using each of these approaches, a case study eco-industrial park is analyzed using the three types of modeling methodologies mentioned. The simpler LP model is unable to account for some of the complexities inherent in an eco-park network and thus the results from this model are subsequently viewed as an upper boundary on the benefits of eco-industrial integration for the case study mentioned. The subsequent efforts of mixed-integer linear and non-linear programming serve to refine the model and provide more realistic investigation of the benefits of such a network. In order to achieve a reduction in emissions of harmful substances to the air, water and land to meet national targets, analysis of the interactions between humans and the environment must be explored to unlock new avenues of production and consumption to reduce the impact that society is having on the environment. This work is completed within the larger context of the potential hydrogen economy with the supposition that such a scenario will be enabled by increasingly effective technology. The transition of our current infrastructure to the hydrogen economy shows benefits to air quality from reduced emissions of vehicles and also from a reduced industrial contribution. 4 month...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of larval fishes is a chronically understudied, critically important field, which offers broad insight into a defining {{period in the}} life history of fishes. Examinations of development {{shed light on the}} behavior and ecology of fishes at a stage wherein they are difficult to observe directly. We cleared and stained 36 specimens of the soft sculpin, Psychrolutes sigalutes, in an effort to link morphological development to preexisting studies on their behavioral shifts with growth. Rapid {{development of}} feeding structures suggests a fish that quickly grows into a highly capable hunter, well-suited to its lengthy <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> period in the plankton. Given the intense focus of development on hunting, we believe that transforming P. sigalutes may be the apex predators in their habitat, possibly responsible for the top-down control of local ichyhtoplankton...|$|E
40|$|Given the lifelong {{associations}} between infant diet and weight, understanding maternal transitional infant feeding decisions can assist efforts to establish healthy eating habits early in life. Feeding experiences were explored using semi-structured interviews with 15 first-time mothers who were {{selected based on}} their concerns about their infants 2 ̆ 7 weight in an infant feeding survey. Thematic synthesis of the interview transcripts identified three main themes: (1) Expectations of a "responsible mother", (2) Trusting oneself and trust in others, and (3) From stress to successful feeding. Dominant social ideals of motherhood and infant behaviour influenced feeding practices, {{some of which are}} associated with obesity. Judgments of mothers 2 ̆ 7 infant feeding practices and infant size alongside feeding and weight gain 2 ̆ 7 checklists 2 ̆ 7 undermines maternal <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> knowledge.

40|$|Infant dietary {{patterns}} {{tend to be}} insufficient {{sources of}} fruits, vegetables, and fiber, as well as excessive in salt, added sugars, and overall energy. Despite the serious long-term health risks associated with suboptimal fruit and vegetable intake, {{a large percentage of}} infants and toddlers in the U. S. do not consume any fruits or vegetables on a daily basis. Since not all fruits and vegetables are nutritionally similar, guidance on the optimal selection of fruits and vegetables should emphasize those with the greatest potential for nutrition and health benefits. A challenge is that the most popularly consumed fruits for this age group (i. e., apples, pears, bananas, grapes, strawberries) do not closely fit the current general recommendations since they tend to be overly sweet and/or high in sugar. Unsaturated oil-containing fruits such as avocados are nutritionally unique among fruits in that they are lower in sugar and higher in fiber and monounsaturated fatty acids than most other fruits, and they also have the proper consistency and texture for first foods with a neutral flavor spectrum. Taken together, avocados show promise for helping to meet the dietary needs of infants and toddlers, and should be considered for inclusion in future dietary recommendations for complementary and <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding...</b>|$|E
40|$|Limited data on {{cervical}} auscultation (CA) sounds {{during the}} <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> period of 4 – 36 months in healthy children exist. This {{study examined the}} acoustic and perceptual parameters of swallowing sounds in children aged 4 – 36 months over a range of food and fluid consistencies. Using CA, swallowing sounds were recorded from a microphone as children ate or drank. Acoustic parameters of duration, peak frequency and peak intensity were determined. Perceptual parameters of swallowing/breath sounds heard pre-, during and post-swallow were rated (‘present’, ‘absent’, ‘cannot be determined’) for each texture. 74 children (35 males; mean age = 17. 1 months [SD 10. 0]) demonstrated mean swallow durations of < 1 s. Increasing age correlated to reduced peak frequency on puree (r = − 0. 48, 95 % CI − 0. 66, − 0. 24). Age correlated to peak amplitude when swallowing puree (r = 0. 27, 95 % CI 0. 02, 0. 49), chewable solids (r = 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 02, 0. 56) and thin fluids (r = 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 27, 0. 64). The bolus transit sound was present in all swallows. A majority of children had normal breathing sounds and coordinated swallows.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the serum protein electrophoretic pattern of growing calves with changing nutrition, in order to evaluate the concentrations of serum protein fractions for different age groups. One hundred and eleven clinically healthy calves of a Slovak spotted breed, low-land black spotted breed, or their crossbreeds were included into this study. They were divided into three groups according to their age and nutrition: Group I – calves at the age of 1 - 2 weeks (milk period, n= 30); Group II – calves at the age of 1 - 2 months (<b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> period, n= 32); Group III – calves at the age of 3 - 5 months (solid feeding period, n= 49). Blood samples were taken by direct puncture of v. jugularis. Blood serum was analysed for total serum protein concentrations, and for the relative values of protein fractions – albumin, α 1 -, α 2 -, β 1 -, β 2 - and γ-globulins. The results showed a significant effect of age on the serum total protein concentrations and the most of protein fractions. In younger calves significantly higher relative concentrations of α 1 -, α 2 - and β 1 -globulins compared with older animals were recorded (P< 0. 05). On the other hand, the relative values of β 2 -, γ-globulins, and total proteins in younger calves were significantly lower than those measured in older ones (P< 0. 05). It is concluded that there are marked age-dependent differences in serum protein fractions in growing calves, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting serum protein profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{embryonic}} and larval {{development of}} hatchery-reared silver therapon Leiopotherapon plumbeus are described to provide essential {{information on the}} early life history of this species. Egg size, larval size at hatching, yolk resorption rate, onset of feeding and development of some morphological characters were examined. Fertilized eggs (430 â€“ 610 Âµm in diameter) were spherical, yellowish, demersal and slightly adhesive. First cleavage occurred 6 min post-fertilization and embryos hatched 21 â€“ 24 h post-fertilization under ambient temperature of 27. 5 Â± 0. 1 Â°C. Newly hatched larvae [1. 79 Â± 0. 04 mm in total length (TL) ] with yolk volume of 0. 579 Â± 0. 126 mm 3 had no functional or pigmented eyes, mouth or digestive tract. The eyes became fully pigmented and mouth opened [31 and 36. 5 hours post-hatching (hph) ] shortly before yolk resorption at 39 hph and when larvae had grown to 2. 65 Â± 0. 14 mm in TL. Some morphological characters such as total length, pre-anal length and eye diameter decreased following yolk resorption, which also coincided {{with the development of}} foraging capacities shortly before exogenous feeding was initiated. L. plumbeus larvae initiated exogenous feeding at 54 hph, indicating a short (15 h after yolk resorption) <b>transitional</b> <b>feeding</b> period. Larval growth at the early stages of development (54 â€“ 72 hph) was rapid and steadily increased from 288 to 720 hph, when larvae, 12. 05 Â± 4. 02 mm in TL, closely resembled the external characteristics of their adult conspecifics. The study was funded by the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department (Study Codes Nr- 04 -F 2010 B and Nr- 01 -F 2013 B) and UP Natural Sciences Research Institute (Project Codes BIO- 09 - 2 - 06 and BIO- 13 - 2 - 04).
