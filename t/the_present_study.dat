40|$|Collectivism is a {{cultural}} value {{that focuses on the}} interdependence and harmony within an in-group. Previous research has identified that collectivistic values are associated with positive social outcomes. One reason why collectivists enjoy positive social outcomes is because they engage in behaviors that foster closer relationships. In <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>studies,</b> expressions of emotions were examined as another potential behavior that collectivistic individuals engage in to foster closeness. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>studies</b> hypothesized that collectivistic individuals would report more relationship satisfaction and social support from their close friends and that this will be mediated by the expressions of happiness, surprise, and sadness. Two online studies in the United States were conducted to test this hypothesis. Consistent with the hypotheses, expressions of these emotions partially mediated the relationship between collectivism and social outcomes. The effect can be attributed to collectivistic values because <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>studies</b> directly assessed collectivism. These results suggest that expressions of happiness, surprise and sadness are beneficial toward relationships for collectivists...|$|R
