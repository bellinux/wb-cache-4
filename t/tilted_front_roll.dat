40|$|A {{new design}} of <b>front</b> <b>rolls</b> in ring {{spinning}} frame is offered to improve properties of the yarn. Perforated bottom <b>front</b> <b>roll</b> accompanied by modification {{in the shape of}} the roller and its flutes is considered for better bounding of the fibers into yarn structure. Then, modified rollers are constructed and mounted in front of the prior <b>front</b> <b>rolls.</b> Sample ring yarns with count of 15 and 20 Ne were spun separately by means of new system with air suction (M. S. R. Y), without air suction (M. R. Y) and also, by means of ordinary <b>front</b> <b>rolls</b> (T. R. Y) to assess the effects of proposed design on the properties of the yarn. This paper presents the comparison of mechanical and qualitative characteristics of the spun yarns. Study shows that, new design of <b>front</b> <b>rolls</b> had positive influence on improving properties of the samples. Yarn samples were the same in terms of tenacity in 0. 05 level of significance but different in 0. 01. The elongation at break of M. S. R. Y was the highest but, the yarn sample was the lowest in terms of mass variations (CV%), imperfections and hairiness in comparison with the M. R. Y and T. R. Y samples...|$|R

40|$|Near- and {{far-field}} beam profiles {{were measured}} for THz pulses generated in LiNbO 3 by optical rectification of 200 fs pulses with a <b>tilted</b> pulse <b>front.</b> The {{variation of the}} THz beam size and a dramatically increasing divergence angle with increasing pump fluence were observed in the (horizontal) plane of the pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt.</b> No significant variation was observed in the vertical direction. The reason for the observed nonlinear beam distortion is the shortening of the effective interaction length for THz generation caused by the combined effect of pump spectral broadening and angular dispersion in the <b>tilted</b> pulse <b>front</b> geometry.

50|$|Rolling, first {{demonstrated}} by Ken Westerfield in 1975, is performed when the disc rolls across {{any part of}} the body. The most common roll is the chest or <b>front</b> <b>roll,</b> which is performed when the disc rolls from one hand, across the chest, to the second hand in order to be caught or released for more maneuvers.

40|$|Shaping light {{fields in}} both {{space and time}} {{provides}} new degrees of freedom to manipulate light-matter interaction on the ultrafast timescale. Through this exploitation of the light field, a greater appreciation of spatio-temporal couplings in focusing has been gained, shedding light on previously unexplored parameters of the femtosecond light pulse, including pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> and wavefront rotation. Here, we directly investigate the effect of major spatio-temporal couplings on light-matter interaction and reveal unambiguously that in transparent media, pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> {{gives rise to the}} directional asymmetry of the ultrafast laser writing. We demonstrate that the laser pulse with a <b>tilted</b> intensity <b>front</b> deposits energy more efficiently when writing along the tilt than when writing against, producing either an isotropic damage-like or a birefringent nanograting structure. The directional asymmetry in the ultrafast laser writing is qualitatively described in terms of the interaction of a void trapped within the focal volume by the gradient force from the <b>tilted</b> intensity <b>front</b> and the thermocapillary force caused by the gradient of temperature. The observed instantaneous transition from the damage-like to nanograting modification after a finite writing length in a transparent dielectric is phenomenologically described in terms of the first-order phase transition...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{rectification}} with <b>tilted</b> pulse <b>fronts</b> in {{lithium niobate}} crystals {{is one of}} the most promising methods to generate terahertz (THz) radiation. In order to achieve higher optical-to-THz energy efficiency, it is necessary to cryogenically cool the crystal not only to decrease the linear phonon absorption for the generated THz wave but also to lengthen the effective interaction length between infrared pump pulses and THz waves. However, the refractive index of lithium niobate crystal at lower temperature is not the same as that at room temperature, resulting in the necessity to re-optimize or even re-build the <b>tilted</b> pulse <b>front</b> setup. Here, we performed a temperature dependent measurement of refractive index and absorption coefficient on a 6. 0 mol% MgO-doped congruent lithium niobate wafer by using a THz time-domain spectrometer (THz-TDS). When the crystal temperature was decreased from 300 K to 50 K, the refractive index of the crystal in the extraordinary polarization decreased from 5. 05 to 4. 88 at 0. 4 THz, resulting in ~ 1 ° change for the tilt angle inside the lithium niobate crystal. The angle of incidence on the grating for the <b>tilted</b> pulse <b>front</b> setup at 1030 nm with demagnification factor of − 0. 5 needs to be changed by 3 °. The absorption coefficient decreased by 60 % at 0. 4 THz. These results are crucial for designing an optimum <b>tilted</b> pulse <b>front</b> setup based on lithium niobate crystals...|$|R

This applies to backward running and the backroll as it does to front running and the <b>front</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|R

40|$|A newly {{designed}} UV spectrometer {{will replace the}} current 351 nm, full aperture backscatter (FABS) spectrometer that {{is used in the}} OMEGA laser system. The FABS spectrometer has a time resolution of 270 ps. The new spectrometer will improve the temporal resolution to 10 ps, while maintaining signal throughput by superimposing 27 separate spectra onto the detector. This is accomplished by placing a 27 -element roof mirror array between two identical diffraction gratings operating at opposite orders. The retro-reflecting property of the roof mirror array breaks the 270 ps pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> into 27 10 ps pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilts.</b> FRED, an optical design program, was used to model the spectrometer. Image rotation, pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt,</b> and images from other grating orders were analyzed. It was found that image rotation can be corrected by rotating the input slit. The separation between the roof mirror array and the gratings was chosen to prevent images from other grating orders from reaching the detector.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} limits of 800 -nm-to-terahertz (THz) energy conversion in lithium niobate at room temperature driven by amplified Ti:sapphire laser pulses with <b>tilted</b> pulse <b>front.</b> The influence of the pump central wavelength, pulse duration, and fluence on THz generation is studied. We achieved a high peak efficiency of 0. 12 % using transform limited 150 fs pulses and observed saturation of the optical-to-THz conversion efficiency at a fluence of 15 [*][*]mJ/cm 2 for this pulse duration. We experimentally identify two main limitations for the scaling of optical-to-THz conversion efficiencies: (i) the large spectral broadening of the optical pump spectrum in combination with large angular dispersion of the <b>tilted</b> pulse <b>front</b> and (ii) free-carrier absorption of THz radiation due to multi-photon absorption of the 800 nm radiation...|$|R
