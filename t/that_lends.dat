5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E

25|$|The main {{theological}} {{issue in}} these texts {{is that of}} the consequences of the Fall of Man, of which sickness and death are mentioned. Other themes include the exaltation of Adam in the Garden, the fall of Satan, the anointing with the oil of the Tree of Life, and a combination of majesty and anthropomorphism in the figure of God, involving numerous merkabahs and other details that show a relationship with 2 Enoch. While the idea of resurrection of the dead is present, there is no idea of Messianism, a fact <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> strong support to the theory of a Jewish origin. The Life of Adam and Eve is also important {{in the study of the}} early Seth traditions.|$|E

500|$|A tenor recitative, [...] "" [...] (Lament then, O {{destroyed}} city of God), {{is accompanied}} by the recorders and the strings. The recorders play [...] "five-note mourning figures" [...] which may depict the tears of Jesus mourning the fall of Jerusalem. Mincham notes that [...] "Bach′s experiments with instrumentation in a way <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> colour and expressive depth", adding that [...] "it is equally likely that these iridescent twinkles are symbolic; flickering feelings of uncertainty within a demolished world".|$|E
500|$|In 1946, Fortune {{magazine}} illustrated a {{cover story}} on [...] "Fundamental Science" [...] with {{a representation of the}} thermodynamic surface that Maxwell had built based on Gibbs's proposal. [...] Rukeyser had called this surface a [...] "statue of water" [...] and the magazine saw in it [...] "the abstract creation of a great American scientist <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> itself to the symbolism of contemporary art forms." [...] The artwork by Arthur Lidov also included Gibbs's mathematical expression of the phase rule for heterogeneous mixtures, as well as a radar screen, an oscilloscope waveform, Newton's apple, and a small rendition of a three-dimensional phase diagram.|$|E
500|$|The type species Corythosaurus casuarius {{was named}} by Barnum Brown in 1914, {{based on the}} first {{specimen}} collected by him in 1912. AMNH 5240 is thus the holotype. In 1916, the original author, Brown, published a more detailed description which was also based on AMNH 5338, which specimen is therefore the plesiotype. Corythosaurus is among many lambeosaurines that possess crests, {{and it was the}} crest <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> Corythosaurus its name. The generic name Corythosaurus is derived from Greek κόρυθος, korythos, [...] "Corinthian helmet", and means [...] "helmeted lizard". The specific name casuarius refers to the cassowary, a bird with a similar skull crest. The full binomial of Corythosaurus casuarius thus means [...] "Cassowary-like reptile, with a Corinthian helmet crest".|$|E

500|$|Andrew Adamson {{described}} {{the film as}} being darker, as it takes place [...] "another 1300 years later, [...] Narnia has been oppressed by Telmarines for a large period of that time, so it's a dirtier, grittier, darker place than the last world was". He added, [...] "This one {{is more of a}} boy's movie. It's a harsher world. The villains are human, and <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> a more realistic attitude." [...] Creatures were designed by veteran horror and monster concept artist Jordu Schell and supervised by Howard Berger, who said that Prince Caspian would be more medieval than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Alongside Adamson, Berger's children critiqued his designs, aiding the process: his son thought the werewolf's ears were silly, so they were made smaller.|$|E
500|$|Edge called Blek [...] "a {{thing of}} elegant, {{intuitive}} beauty". They {{compared it to}} a [...] "modernist, freeform, touchscreen" [...] Snake, albeit much calmer, and described Blek as less a puzzle game than [...] "pure intuition" [...] and [...] "an act of freeform creation" [...] that privileged the process of experimentation over the goal of solving puzzles. The magazine wrote that the trial and error, muddling process of refining one's stroke led to delightful discoveries that turned [...] "maddening" [...] complex prospects into [...] "natural" [...] solutions. In a piece for Polygon, Rod Green compared Blek to Tetris and Threes! as a [...] "simple premise, beautifully executed" [...] <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> towards imitation, and added that the game would be harder to [...] "clone" [...] than the others due to its handmade levels. Kotaku Mike Fahey called it [...] "the most brilliant iPad game" [...] he played in 2013.|$|E
500|$|A Green Lantern and Hal Jordan's mentor. Strong {{affirmed that}} the film will follow the origin story, [...] "the film closely follows the early comics. Sinestro starts out as Hal Jordan’s mentor, {{slightly}} suspicious and not sure of him because obviously Hal is the first human being who’s made into a Green Lantern. He's certainly very strict and unsure of the wisdom of Hal becoming a Green Lantern". Strong said, the character [...] "is a military guy but isn't immediately bad. It's {{the kind of person}} <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> himself to becoming bad {{over the course of the}} comics being written, but initially he’s quite a heroic figure." [...] He also revealed that the outfit and other aspects of the character very closely follow the character's early days, [...] "That widow's peak and thin mustache was for some reason originally based on David Niven... So I would like to do justice to the Sinestro that was conceived for the comic books".|$|E

500|$|Glenn Erickson {{discussed}} Danger: Diabolik {{twice on}} DVD Talk (in 1998 and 2005); describing {{the film as}} a guilty pleasure, he praised Bava's stylized visuals, noting his use of bright colours, elaborate sets and wide lenses, [...] "giving almost every shot a distorted depth <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> the film a consistent comic book dynamism". While noting the minimal characterization of Diabolik himself (describing him as [...] "the final distillation {{of the idea that}} we love criminals because we secretly admire the transgressions they represent"), he felt that Marisa Mell's portrayal of Eva presented her as loving Diabolik [...] "on a romantic plane of surprising believability. [...] adoring faithfulness is so physical and pure that the sincerity of their farewell ("You'll not be alone while I live!") is tenderly affecting." [...] Erickson also admired Terry-Thomas' campy portrayal of the Minister of Interior, describing his news conference as [...] "easily outdo TV's Batman." [...] Thematically, he has noted that Diabolik's desire to steal for himself and Eva [...] "represent the ultimate end of materialist consumerism", as well as [...] "the rollercoaster Italian politics of the time, which seemed to flip-flop from conservative to socialist and back again on a weekly basis;" [...] Erickson also mentions that [...] "Diabolik's world stresses strangely fetishistic surfaces and textures, backing up film theorist Raymond Durgnat's assertion that the psychic land of pulp fantasy is fundamentally a sexual one." ...|$|E
500|$|During his campaign, Biden {{focused on}} the war in Iraq and his support for the {{implementation}} of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy. Despite speculation to the contrary, Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, [...] "I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates' comments that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, [...] "I think he can be ready, but right now I don't believe he is. The presidency is not something <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> itself to on-the-job training." [...] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas. Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of Republican then-frontrunner Rudy Giuliani at the debate on October 30, 2007, in Philadelphia, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] Overall, Biden's debate performances were an effective mixture of humor, and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments.|$|E
500|$|The first song, [...] "Anything Goes", was {{recorded}} by Bennett for his 1959 collaboration with Count Basie and his Orchestra, Strike Up the Band, and Gaga {{first came to}} know about it when she was 13 years old. Gaga thought that [...] "Anything Goes" [...] was a funny track with a [...] "real sexy, powerful vibe to it, and it's just because we're having fun singing it." [...] The version on Cheek to Cheek finds Bennett and Gaga swapping the lyrics between themselves, and was described by Bobby Olivier, from The Star-Ledger, as [...] "smooth as silk". The syllables are pronounced strongly by Gaga in syncopation while her vibrato complemented Bennett's characteristic jazz vocals and swing. Olivier added, [...] "Gaga's voice, when stripped of its bells and whistles, showcases a timelessness <b>that</b> <b>lends</b> itself well to the genre." [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" [...] was originally written in 1928 by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields for the Broadway revue, Blackbirds of 1928. The version on Cheek to Cheek opens with the sound of high-hat and an electronic organ. Gaga alters the lyrics to sing [...] "Gee, I'd like to say you're looking swell, Tony", who later rejoins with the line [...] "Diamond bracelets won't work, doesn't sell, Gaga". [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was first released as a single in 1948 by Cole, and it became a commercial success for him. Written by eccentric songwriter eden ahbez, the song about a [...] "strange enchanted boy" [...] features instrumentation from flutes and drums, and has an orchestral arrangement. A loungier version, Gaga sings in a Liza Minnelli inspired voice with a breathy range, followed by Bennett complimenting her with the story of meeting the titular character.|$|E
30|$|Even more {{important}} for credit supply and bank risk-taking, we find that in good times loan spreads for private sector employees are identical to those for borrowers who do not work (whereas in bad times there are substantial differences, both statically and economically speaking).
