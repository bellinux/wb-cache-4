At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth.

The combustion or respiration of organic carbon releases it rapidly into the atmosphere.

Carbon stored in soil can remain there for up to thousands of years before being washed into rivers by erosion or released into the atmosphere through soil respiration. Between 1989 and 2008 soil respiration increased by about 0.1% per year. In 2008, the global total of [...] released from the soil reached roughly 98 billion tonnes, about 10 times more carbon than humans are now putting into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuel.

However, the proportions of carbonates in soil total carbon are usually small (Chatterjee et al. 2009), thus the method without the direct measurement of SIC could produce a large relative error. Therefore, studies focused on SIC based on measured data help us to reduce the uncertainties of previous studies and to predict {{response of}} soil carbon to global changes (Shi et al. 2012). SIC pools exchange C with the atmosphere through a series of physical and chemical reactions, such as C sequestration by carbonate formation or CO 2 release by acidification and leaching (Ouyang et al. 2008 : Shi et al. 2012). <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>biospheres</b> are the largest carbon pools, a small change in soil carbon cause a significant alteration of atmospheric CO 2 concentration (Trumbore and Czimczik 2008; Shi et al. 2012).

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in biologically based ecosystem {{models of the}} coupled terrestrial, hydrological, carbon, and nutrient cycles have provided new perspectives on the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>biosphere’s</b> behavior globally, over a range of time scales. We used the terrestrial ecosystem model Century to examine relationships between carbon, nitrogen, and water dynamics. The model, run to a quasi-steady-state, shows strong correlations between carbon, water, and nitrogen fluxes that lead to equilibration of water/energy and nitrogen limitation of net primary productivity. This occurs because as the water flux increases, the potentials for carbon uptake (photosynthesis), and inputs and losses of nitrogen, all increase. As the flux of carbon increases, the amount of nitrogen that can be captured into organic matter and then recycled also increases. Because most plant-available nitrogen is derived from internal recycling, this latter process is critical to sustaining high productivity in environments where water and energy are plentiful. At steady-state, water/energy and nitrogen limitation “equilibrate,” but because the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles have different response times, inclusion of nitrogen cycling into ecosystem models adds behavior at longer time scales than in purely biophysical models. The tight correlations among nitrogen fluxes with evapotranspiration implies that either climate change or changes to nitrogen inputs (from fertilization or air pollution) will have large and long-lived effects on both productivity and nitrogen losses through hydrological and trace gas pathways. Comprehensive analyses {{of the role of}} ecosystems in the carbon cycle must consider mechanisms that arise from the interaction of the hydrological, carbon, and nutrient cycles in ecosystems...|$|R

In this study, we develop and apply two new ecological sensitivity metrics, analogs of climate sensitivity, to investigate the potential degree of plant community changes {{over the next three}} centuries. We use ten climate simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, with climate sensitivities from 2 – 4 °C. The concept of climate sensitivity depends upon the continuous nature of the temperature field across the Earth’s surface. For this research, the bridge between climate change and biospheric change predictions is provided by the Equilibrium Vegetation Ecology model (EVE), which simulates a continuous description of the Earth’s terrestrial plant communities as a function of climate. The ecosensitivity metrics applied to the results of EVE simulations {{at the end of the}} twenty-first century result in 49 % of the Earth’s land surface area undergoing plant community changes and 37 % of the world’s terrestrial ecosystems undergoing biome-scale changes. EVE is an equilibrium model, and, although rates of ecological change are not addressed, the resultant ecological sensitivity projections provide an estimate of the degree of species turnover that must occur for ecosystems to be in equilibrium with local climates.

Ice-core samples from the Upper Fremont Glacier (UFG) in Wyoming, Taylor Dome, an East Antarctic ice-dome, and Taylor Glacier, the outlet glacier for Taylor Dome, are investigated here. In the UFG, we found that samples reveal anthropogenic influences. Variability in dust sources and pathways indicates a transition from far to near-range transport due to land-use changes associated with agricultural activity and livestock grazing expansion during 1700 – 1975 A. D. Samples from Taylor Dome and Taylor Glacier, spanning the time period 1, 800 – 55, 000 years before present, indicate a shift from long-range transported dust to a more variable local input during the transition out of the last glacial period when global temperatures rose 4 - 7 degrees C.

To detect a deep biosphere in the Martian basement, drilling is a requirement. However, near future Mars sample return missions are limited by the mission’s payload, which excludes heavy drilling equipment and restrict the missions to only dig the topmost meter of the Martian soil. Therefore, the sampling and analysis of Martian impact ejecta has been suggested as a way of accessing the deeper Martian subsurface without using heavy drilling equipment. Impact cratering is a natural geological process capable of excavating and exposing large amounts of rock material from great depths up to the surface. Several studies of terrestrial impact deposits show the preservation of pre-impact biosignatures, such as fossilized organisms and chemical biological markers.
