40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} main {{strategies}} automotive companies adopt {{to address the}} issue of dealing with end-of-life vehicles and spare parts. Furthermore, it investigates the reasons behind take-back strategies, i. e how and why automotive companies undertake initiatives in reverse logistics. The research findings indicate that companies are trying to respond to the end-of-life legislation based on cost-effective approaches as well as corporate environmental responsibility. Outsourcing is used when expertise is found to extract value from scrap and there is cooperation with suppliers and vendors <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> the <b>dismantling</b> of cars and recycling of parts...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{prevention}} {{is based on}} four pillars. Firstly, the aim is the reduction of hazardous substances in vehicles to minimize their release to the environment. Secondly, vehicles should be designed <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> proper <b>dismantling</b> and <b>to</b> allow components and materials to be reused, recycled and/or recovered. Thirdly, the producers (both vehicle and component) shall increase the demand for recycled material. Finally, certain materials (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium) are forbidden {{except for a few}} applications with defined phase-out dates. These exemptions are cataloged in the Annex II to the ELV Directive.Since technology is subject to constant change, the Annex II is revised on a regular basis to account for new technical developments making certain materials in specific applications no longer necessary or allow for reduction of thresholds. As of today, 5 revisions have already been conducted with revision 6 under preparation.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} {{discourse}} over what constitutes successful Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy implementation, {{there is an}} on-going debate over the ability of programme design to include an appropriate incentive mechanism to stimulate producers to improve the design of their products for reduced life cycle impacts, and especially the impacts and costs from the end-of-life management. At {{the centre of the}} debate is the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) which has the explicit goal to encourage the design and production of electrical and electronic products which <b>facilitate</b> <b>dismantling,</b> recovery and in particular the reuse and recycling of WEEE. Individual Producer Responsibility (IPR) is the main mechanism to achieve this goal, whereby each producer is responsible for financing the waste from his own products. This thesis presents an account of the transposition outcome of the WEEE Directive into EU Member State legal text and the practical implementation that has emerged as a result. It explores the factors that have led to the current impasse regarding IPR implementation in Europe, and together with the investigation of more successful IPR implementation and industry practice, suggests a characterisation of possible ways of implementing IPR given today’s reality...|$|R
