5|$|The Korean War was an {{escalation}} {{of a civil}} war between two rival Korean regimes, each of which was supported by external powers, with each of <b>the</b> <b>regimes</b> trying to topple the other through political and guerrilla tactics. The conflict was expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950, until the armistice (ceasefire agreement) was signed on July 27, 1953.|$|E

Castro {{supported}} Allende's socialist reforms, but warned him of right-wing elements in Chile's military. In 1973, the military led a coup d'état and established a military junta led by Augusto Pinochet. Castro proceeded to Guinea to meet socialist President Sékou Touré, praising him as Africa's greatest leader, and there received the Order of Fidelity to the People. He then went on a seven-week tour visiting leftist allies: Algeria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, where he was given further awards. On each trip, he was eager to visit factory and farm workers, publicly praising their governments; privately, he urged <b>the</b> <b>regimes</b> to aid revolutionary movements elsewhere, particularly those fighting the Vietnam War.|$|E

In July 1832, the Parsi riots took place in consequence of a Government order for the destruction of pariah dogs which infested the city. The Asiatic Society of Bombay (Town Hall) was completed in 1833, and the Elphinstone College was built in 1835. In 1836, the Chamber of Commerce was established.|$|E

The businessmen bought the US dollars from the Saigon treasury with their South Vietnamese piasters at half the official exchange rate; they then used this cheaply acquired American currency to import US goods.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} information manipulation and political regime change. There is a regime that can be overthrown but only if enough citizens par-ticipate in an uprising.

This coordination game with endogenous information manipulation has a unique equilibrium and the paper gives a complete analytic characterization of the equilibrium’s comparative statics. Holding fixed the number of signals available to citizens, if the per-unit signal precision is suf-ficiently high then <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> is harder to overthrow.

While overthrowing <b>the</b> <b>regimes</b> in Egypt and Tunisia was a relatively quick process, Gaddafi's campaign posed significant stalls on the uprisings in Libya. The first announcement of a competing political authority appeared online and declared the Interim Transitional National Council as an alternative government. One of Gaddafi's senior advisors responded by posting a tweet, wherein he resigned, defected, and advised Gaddafi to flee. By 20 February, the unrest had spread to Tripoli. On 27 February 2011, the National Transitional Council was established to administer the areas of Libya under rebel control. On 10 March 2011, France became the first state to officially recognise the council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people.|$|E

40|$|The present project {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> and civil society organisations in Jordan, {{and the influence of}} this relationship on the stability of <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> Through an empirical analysis of different types of civil society organisations, involving charity, human rights, youth, royal, independent and Islamic organisations, the project considers how independent the organisations are of <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> and to what extent they accept the control of <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> A theoretical examination of Jordan’s regime type and society structures, results in a characterisation of a neo-patrimonial rentier state, which is governed like a linchpin monarchy and a liberalising autocracy. This characterisation is consequently utilized in an analysis of the relation between the civil society – <b>regime</b> relationship and <b>the</b> stability of <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> <b>The</b> conclusion is that <b>the</b> relationship between <b>regime</b> and civil society organisations results in a greater stability for <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> This is due to the strategy of <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> when controlling <b>the</b> civil society organisations, mainly being based upon strategies supported by the neo-patrimonial characteristics of Jordan, among others divide-and-rule. The use of wasta – personal connections - by the civil society organisations to increase their scope of influence is inherent in the relationship, and increases the stability since all parties benefit...|$|R

Except in Romania, the popular upheavals against the pro-Soviet regimes were all peaceful (see Revolutions of 1989). The loosening of Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe effectively ended the Cold War, and for this, Gorbachev was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold in 1989 and the Nobel Peace Prize on 15 October 1990.|$|E

25|$|Tin {{production}} in Bolivia {{came to be}} concentrated {{in the hands of}} Bolivian nationals, although <b>the</b> <b>regimes</b> encouraged foreign investment. At first, foreign interests and Bolivians with foreign associations took the major share. This changed, however, when Bolivian tin-mining entrepreneurs realized that smelters in competing countries depended on Bolivian tin. Simón Patiño was the most successful of these tin magnates. Of poor mestizo background, he started as a mining apprentice. By 1924 he owned 50% of the national production and controlled the European refining of Bolivian tin. Although Patiño lived permanently abroad by the early 1920s, the two other leading tin-mining entrepreneurs, Carlos Aramayo and Mauricio Hochschild, resided primarily in Bolivia.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>regimes</b> of Sarit and Thanom were {{strongly}} {{supported by the}} US.

The Vietnamese retaliated by supporting the Communist Party of Thailand's insurgency in the north, northeast, and sometimes in the south, where guerrillas co-operated with local discontented Muslims. In the postwar period, Thailand had close relations with the US, which it saw as a protector from communist revolutions in neighboring countries. The Seventh and Thirteenth US Air Forces were headquartered at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} the full blown {{revolution}} began in Poland in 1989 and continued in Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Romania. One feature common to most of these developments was the extensive use of campaigns of civil resistance, demonstrating popular opposition to the continuation of one-party rule and contributing to the pressure for change. Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country whose people overthrew its Communist regime violently, whereas <b>the</b> <b>regimes</b> in Romania and in some other countries inflicted violence on the population. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 failed to stimulate major political changes in China, but influential images of courageous defiance during that protest helped to spark a precipitation of events {{in other parts of}} the globe. On the same day, 4 June, the trade union Solidarity won an overwhelming victory in a partially free election in Poland, leading to the peaceful fall of Communism in that country in the summer of 1989. Hungary dismantled its section of the physical Iron Curtain, leading to a mass exodus of East Germans through Hungary, which destabilised East Germany. This led to mass demonstrations in cities such as Leipzig and subsequently to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, which served as the symbolic gateway to German reunification in 1990.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> international <b>regime</b> of <b>the</b> prohibition of biological weapons. It theoretically delimits <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> by defining <b>the</b> terms international <b>regime</b> and biological weapon. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to evaluate the effectivity of <b>the</b> international <b>regime</b> of <b>the</b> prohibition of biological weapons and to delineate its presumable evolution in the future. The thesis presents the historical development {{and the use of}} biological weapons, their prohibition until the completion of <b>the</b> international <b>regime</b> of <b>the</b> prohibition of biological weapons in its narrowest form. It also focuses on the analysis of the normative pillars which support <b>the</b> narrowly defined <b>regime.</b> <b>The</b> pillars are the Geneva Protocol (1925) and the Biological Weapons Convention. This thesis summarizes the most important events that occurred during the negotiations over the lifetime of <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> It provides an assessment of <b>the</b> international <b>regime</b> of <b>the</b> prohibition of biological weapons based on the criteria of efficiency, which in this case is seen as the ability to enforce compliance with <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> verify that it is respected and if not, as the ability to punish the violators. Given <b>the</b> current <b>regime</b> condition and <b>the</b> ongoing discussions relevant to the topic, the presumable evolution of <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> in <b>the</b> future is delineated. In conclusion, based on the chosen methodology, <b>the</b> international <b>regime</b> of <b>the</b> prohibition of biological weapons seems to be rather ineffective, however, in the future there may be an improvement...|$|R
