40|$|Although {{the neural}} {{mechanisms}} responsible for <b>the</b> orderly <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> motor units {{have been investigated}} extensively, {{the flexibility of the}} underlying neural circuitry remains unclear. For example, the effects of electrical stimulation on <b>the</b> <b>recruitment</b> order <b>of</b> motor units is not well understood. This project was designed to study <b>the</b> <b>recruitment</b> order <b>of</b> motor units in man during different stimulation protocols. Examination of the compound-twitch characteristics of electrically evoked responses allowed an indirect determination <b>of</b> motor-unit <b>recruitment</b> order. <b>The</b> results demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>recruitment</b> order <b>of</b> quadriceps femoris and triceps surae motor units differs according to the stimulation protocols used. Analysis of the compound-twitch characteristics indicated that <b>the</b> <b>recruitment</b> order <b>of</b> motor units during Hoffmann reflexes {{is similar to that of}} volitional muscle contractions but effectively the reverse of that during direct-motor responses. Moreover, the results suggest that cutaneous-afferent stimulation alters <b>the</b> <b>recruitment</b> thresholds <b>of</b> different motor unit types during the Hoffman reflex...|$|R

5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by <b>the</b> <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions.
