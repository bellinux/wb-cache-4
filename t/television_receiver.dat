5|$|DuMont Laboratories {{was founded}} in 1931 by Dr. Allen B. DuMont with only $1,000, and a {{laboratory}} in his basement. He and his staff were responsible for many early technical innovations, including the first consumer all-electronic <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> in 1938. The company's television receivers soon became the gold standard of the industry. In 1942, DuMont worked with the Army in developing radar technology during World War II. This brought in $5 million for the company.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. IV {{was used}} in the front lines for only a short period. The {{introduction}} of the cavity magnetron in 1940 led to rapid progress in microwave-frequency radars, which offered far greater accuracy and were effective at low altitudes. The prototype Mk. VII began to replace the Mk. IV at the end of 1941, and the AI Mk. VIII largely relegated the Mk. IV to second-line duties by 1943. The Mk. IV's receiver, originally a <b>television</b> <b>receiver,</b> was used as the basis of the ASV Mk. II radar, Chain Home Low, AMES Type 7, and many other radar systems throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Government {{television}} and radio broadcasting centers, and the headquarters of numerous private stations are located in Antananarivo. Eighty percent of households in Antananarivo own a radio; the medium is popular across social classes. Stations like Fenon'ny Merina appeal to Merina listeners of all ages by playing traditional and contemporary music of the highlands region. Youth-oriented stations play a blend of Western artists and Malagasy performers of Western genres, as well as fusion and coastal musical styles. Evangelical broadcasts and daily international and local news are available in Malagasy, French and English. Forty percent of Antananarivo residents own a <b>television</b> <b>receiver.</b> All major Malagasy newspapers are printed {{in the city and}} are widely available. Communications services in Antananarivo are the best in the country. Internet and mobile telephone networks are readily available and affordable, although disruptions in service occur periodically. The national postal service is headquartered in Antananarivo, and private international shipping companies like FedEx, DHL Express and United Parcel Service provide services to the city.|$|E

25|$|A {{television}} set, {{also called}} a <b>television</b> <b>receiver,</b> television, TV set, TV, or telly, is {{a device that}} combines a tuner, display, and speakers {{for the purpose of}} viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as VHS and later DVD. In the late 2000s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced cathode ray tubes. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a USB device.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{receiver}} {{turned out to}} be a more difficult problem. Early on they decided to use the same basic receiver system as the earlier Mk. IV radar. This had originally been a <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> designed by Pye Ltd. to pick up BBC transmissions on 45MHz. It was adapted to the MK. IV's ~200MHz by using it as the intermediate frequency stage of a superheterodyne system. To do this, they had added another tube that stepped down the frequency from the radar's 193MHz to 45MHz. In theory this should be just as easily adapted to the AIS's 3GHz, using a similar solution. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency tended to drift, in small amounts pulse-to-pulse, and much greater amounts as it heated and cooled. Any sort of fixed-frequency step-down like the one used in the Mk. IV wouldn't work. After trying a variety of designs based on klystrons and older-style magnetrons, they eventually gave up.|$|E

25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an elastomeric connector, which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E

500|$|Marketed {{under the}} name [...] "Muntz" [...] by his company Muntz TV, Inc., the {{simplified}} units were the first black and white TV receivers to retail in the U.S. for less than $100. Muntz {{was also the first}} retailer to measure his screens from corner to corner rather than by width. The receivers sold well and were reliable partly because fewer tubes created less heat. The sets worked well in metropolitan areas that were close to television transmission towers where signals were strong. They worked poorly with weaker signals, as most of the components that Muntz had removed were intended to boost performance in fringe areas. This was a calculated decision: Muntz preferred to leave the low-volume, high-performance <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> market to firms such as RCA and Zenith Electronics, as his intended customers were primarily urban dwellers with limited funds. Additionally, many urban apartment buildings had rules prohibiting external television aerials, and installation of an aerial, even if allowed, cost as much as $150. Muntz solved this problem by adding a built-in aerial to his receivers. In 1952, Muntz TV Inc. grossed $49.9million ($ in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Originally, CC {{information}} {{was included in}} the picture ("line 21") via a composite video input, but there is no equivalent capability in digital video interconnects (such as DVI and HDMI) between the display and a [...] "source". A [...] "source", in this case, can be a DVD player or a terrestrial or cable digital <b>television</b> <b>receiver.</b> When CC information is encoded in the MPEG-2 data stream, only the device that decodes the MPEG-2 data (a source) has access to the closed caption information; there is no standard for transmitting the CC information to a display monitor separately. Thus, if there is CC information, the source device needs to overlay the CC information on the picture prior to transmitting to the display over the interconnect's video output.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, [...] "intelligent" [...] {{television}} receivers {{were introduced in}} Japan. The addition of an LSI chip with memory and a character generator to a <b>television</b> <b>receiver</b> enabled Japanese viewers to receive a mix of programming and information transmitted over spare lines of the broadcast television signal. A patent was published in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an [...] "intelligent" [...] television system, linked with data processing systems, {{by means of a}} digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. The mass acceptance of digital television in late 2000s and early 2010s greatly improved smart TVs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for their middle-end to high-end TVs in 2015. Smart TVs are expected to become the dominant form of television by the late 2010s. At the beginning of 2016, Nielsen reported that 29 percent of those with incomes over $75,000 a year had a smart TV.|$|E
