5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is {{probably due to the}} great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Olivia and Peter learn Greg {{was being}} treated for a sleep disorder, and that his dreams had {{involved}} demons until they stopped several months ago. Another hallucinating victim turns up in Seattle and dies. The Fringe team discover that both victims had a brain–computer interface chip attached to their thalamus, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> controlling dreams. Broyles (Lance Reddick) and Nina (Blair Brown) reveal new information leading to the sleep researcher Dr. Nayak (Ravi Kapoor) who implanted the chips. Another victim named Diana (Jovanna Huguet) hallucinates at a restaurant and kills a coworker before similarly dying of exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|Path {{integration}} in mammals {{makes use of}} the vestibular organs, which detect accelerations in the three dimensions, together with motor efference, where the motor system tells {{the rest of the}} brain which movements were commanded, and optic flow, where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes. Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The hippocampus is <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.|$|E
5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also {{substantial}} differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas {{at the edge of the}} neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{that plays}} the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region {{at the base}} of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E

5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries {{on the left side of}} the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss ({{on one side of the}} visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E

25|$|Reticular reflex {{myoclonus}} {{is thought}} to be a type of generalized epilepsy that originates in the brainstem, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that connects to the spinal cord and controls vital functions such as breathing and heartbeat. Myoclonic jerks usually affect the whole body, with muscles {{on both sides of the}} body affected simultaneously. In some people, myoclonic jerks occur in only a part of the body, such as the legs, with all the muscles in that part being involved in each jerk. Reticular reflex myoclonus can be triggered by either a voluntary movement or an external stimulus.|$|E
25|$|Alzheimer's Disease: A study {{published}} in Archives of Neurology in February 2003 suggested that the intake of both trans fats and saturated fats promote the development of Alzheimer disease, although not confirmed in an animal model. It {{has been found that}} trans fats impaired memory and learning in middle-age rats. The trans-fat eating rats' brains had fewer proteins critical to healthy neurological function. Inflammation in and around the hippocampus, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> responsible for learning and memory. These are the exact types of changes normally seen at the onset of Alzheimer's, but seen after six weeks, even though the rats were still young.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{activity}} {{has a significant}} influence on the hippocampus, since this is <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{that is responsible for}} encoding information into memory. With physical activity having such an impact on the hippocampus this can regulate {{other parts of the body}} as well like weight, memory, daily function, and many more processes that are necessary for the body to work. Since physical activity impacts all of these important parts of the brain, this form of exercise keeps the neural networks functioning well. Neural networks allow information to process and pass to the hippocampus in order to retain memory. This lets the brain be more efficient in processing and more memories are stored this way.|$|E

25|$|Although SDN is much {{related to}} sexual partner {{preferences}} in males, {{it does not}} show the same relationship to partner preferences in females. Evidence shows that SDN in medial preoptic area is not the prerequisite {{for the expression of}} male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preferences in females. One piece of evidence comes from the study on female Japanese macaque, which routinely court, mount (with pelvic thrust), compete for, and even prefer certain female sexual partners over certain males. <b>The</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> examined is the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc), a homologue of SDN-POA.

25|$|N - Neuroticism/Stability: Neuroticism or emotionality is {{characterized}} by high levels of negative affect such as depression and anxiety. Neuroticism, according to Eysenck's theory, is based on activation thresholds in the sympathetic nervous system or visceral brain. This is <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> {{that is responsible for}} the fight-or-flight response in the face of danger. Activation can be measured by heart rate, blood pressure, cold hands, sweating and muscular tension (especially in the forehead). Neurotic people — who have low activation thresholds, and unable to inhibit or control their emotional reactions, experience negative affect (fight-or-flight) in the face of very minor stressors — are easily nervous or upset. Emotionally stable people — who have high activation thresholds and good emotional control, experience negative affect only in the face of very major stressors — are calm and collected under pressure.|$|E
25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots are able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown that some are able to {{associate}} words with their meanings and form simple sentences. Along with crows, ravens, and jays (family Corvidae), parrots are considered the most intelligent of birds. The brain-to body size ratio of psittacines and corvines is {{comparable to that of}} higher primates. One argument against the supposed intelligent capabilities of bird species is that birds have a relatively small cerebral cortex, which is <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> considered the main area of intelligence in other animals. However, birds use {{a different part of the}} brain, the mediorostral HVC as the seat of their intelligence. These species tend to have the largest hyperstriata, and Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who studied bird physiology, has discovered that the lower part of the avian brain is functionally similar to that in humans. Not only have parrots demonstrated intelligence through scientific testing of their language-using ability, but also some species of parrots such as the kea are also highly skilled at using tools and solving puzzles.|$|E

500|$|After TBI, {{abnormalities}} {{exist in}} the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals used by brain cells {{to communicate with each}} other; these abnormalities {{may play a role in}} the development of PTE. [...] TBI may lead to the excessive release of glutamate and other excitatory neurotransmitters (those that stimulate brain cells and increase the likelihood that they will fire). This excessive glutamate release can lead to excitotoxicity, damage to brain cells through overactivation of the biochemical receptors that bind and respond to excitatory neurotransmitters. Overactivation of [...] glutamate receptors damages neurons; for example it leads to the formation of free radicals. [...] Excitotoxicity is a possible factor in the development of PTE; [...] it may lead to the formation of a chronic epileptogenic focus. An epileptic focus is <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> from which epileptic discharges originate.|$|E
500|$|Wilson's {{disease may}} be {{suspected}} {{on the basis}} of any of the symptoms mentioned above, or when a close relative has been found to have Wilson's. Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as a raised aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and bilirubin level. If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure. If there are neurological symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is usually performed; this shows hyperintensities in <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> called the basal ganglia in the T2 setting. MRI may also demonstrate the characteristic [...] "face of the giant panda" [...] pattern.|$|E
500|$|People whose PTE {{does not}} respond to {{medication}} may undergo surgery to remove the epileptogenic focus, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brain</b> that is causing the seizures. However surgery for PTE may be more difficult {{than it is for}} epilepsy due to other causes, and is less likely to be helpful in PTE than in other forms of epilepsy. It can be particularly difficult in PTE to localize the epileptic focus, in part because TBI may affect diffuse areas of the brain. Difficulty locating the seizure focus is seen as a deterrent to surgery. However, for people with sclerosis in the mesial temporal lobe (in the inner aspect of the temporal lobe), who comprise about one third of people with intractable PTE, surgery is likely to have good outcome. [...] When there are multiple epileptic foci or the focus cannot be localized, and drug therapy is not effective, vagus nerve stimulation is another option for treating PTE.|$|E
