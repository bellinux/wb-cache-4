5|$|<b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> {{the euro}} {{has led to}} {{extensive}} discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in {{the population of the}} eurozone that <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the euro. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the euro to do so.|$|E
5|$|The last {{surviving}} raphine species, the Rodrigues solitaire, probably became extinct before 1778. The dodo survived until 1662 or 1690.

Although the dodo became extinct earlier, the causes of extinction are related and involve <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> animals and hunting.|$|E
