5|$|For instance, {{when one}} cell of a {{spreadsheet}} changes, {{it is necessary}} to recalculate the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level computer program optimization.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in <b>the</b> manifest refractive error (ΔM), <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power (ΔACP) and initial corneal asphericity (Q) in overnight orthokeratology (ortho-K). Methods: One hundred and twenty-eight clinical records of children undergoing ortho-K from a university optometry clinic were reviewed. The refractive and topographical data at baseline and at two-week visit of 58 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and analysed. Results: Significant differences (p < 0. 001) between <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error and <b>changes</b> in <b>the</b> apical corneal power or <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power (ΔMCP) within the treatment zone were found. Linear regression {{analysis was used to}} describe <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error and <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power, and <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error and <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power, with the equations: ΔM = 0. 91 ΔACP + 0. 57 (r = 0. 78, p < 0. 001) and ΔM = 0. 93 ΔMCP + 0. 01 (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 001) respectively. On average, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power underestimated <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error by 0. 34 ± 0. 57 D; whereas on average, <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power overestimated <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error by 0. 23 ± 0. 57 D (paired-t-tests, p < 0. 001). A low but significant correlation between initial corneal asphericity and <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error (Spearman r = - 0. 33, p = 0. 01) was observed. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power underestimates <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error in ortho-K, whereas <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power overestimates this parameter. Compared with retinoscopy and autorefraction, <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power is still useful for estimation of <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error. Although <b>the</b> maximum <b>change</b> in corneal power appears to give a closer estimation of <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error than <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in apical corneal power, there is no advantage in the use of maximum corneal power (manually located) instead of apical corneal power (a default given by the topographer) to estimate <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error, as there is {{no significant difference in the}} estimations by either parameter. Initial corneal asphericity measured by the Medmont E 300 corneal topographer has limited usage in predicting <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in manifest refractive error in overnight ortho-K.

5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began to adapt to <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> economic situation. The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply. Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|Though slavery persisted, {{some aspects}} of the {{relationship}} changed with the French administration.

Some were willing to agree to remain in servitude if they received control over their family life and some land to pass to their children. In addition, the French administration actively worked to end slave raiding and the most clear manifestations of the slave trade, greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves. However, for many decades after the 1905 abolition of slavery, the practice continued in much of French Sudan.|$|E

Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker.

5|$|Preceded by the {{publication}} of the re-mastered editions of their first four albums, Girlschool released the studio album Believe in July 2004. The wish to explore new territories is obvious in some tracks of the album, which is the first one entirely composed by the new line-up at Chambers’ home studio. <b>The</b> <b>changed</b> line-up brought a new balance in the band, with Chambers involved in the composition of all songs. Moreover, the chance to use again two lead singers led to improvements in the vocal and choral parts. Unfortunately, the album was poorly distributed and remained unknown to large parts of its potential audience. In 2005, the band re-released Believe in a new package with a DVD containing footage taken from concerts of the 2000s and sold it through their official website. A US and European tour followed Believe first release, but the project for releasing in 2004 a live DVD tentatively titled Girlschool Live at the Garage never materialised. In June 2005, Girlschool did a UK tour with Vixen and another one in November–December with old pals Motörhead, celebrating Lemmy's band 30th anniversary. During the same year, they were also on stage at summer festivals in the Netherlands and England and opened for Alice Cooper in Spain.|$|E

5|$|White's kicking {{accuracy}} was {{of particular}} note for a ruckman—his goal-kicking accuracy finished at {{slightly less than}} 60%. He was a consistent exponent of the spectacular mark, preferring to take chest marks high over packs. He was nominated on several occasions for the Mark of the Year, but he never won the award. His ball-skills and work around the ground remained one of his greatest strengths throughout his career. He effected 5000 hit-outs in his AFL career, the most by any one player since records began in 1987, with a career-high game total of 47 during a resounding round-22 win over West Coast Eagles in 2000. Testament to his durability and consistency, he was {{ranked in the top}} five in the AFL in total number of hit-outs for nine consecutive seasons from 1999. At 195cm, White is relatively short for a ruckman, and operated more as a ruck-rover than as a traditional ruckman. He was noted for his athleticism and vertical-leap, which helped him overcome his lack of height in comparison to other ruckmen. His approach to ruck-work—with greater emphasis on possessing the ball and working around the ground—helped him adapt to <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> centre-circle rules, and compensated for his lack of height and diminished ability at stoppages. Following the departure of Jim Stynes from Melbourne, White later worked on his game with former ruckman Sam Newman. Percy Johnson, Stynes and finally Newman guided and influenced White's ruck-work during his career.|$|E
5|$|Word of William's {{defeat at}} Gerberoi stirred up {{difficulties}} in northern England. In August and September 1079 King Malcolm of Scots raided {{south of the}} River Tweed, devastating the land between the River Tees and the Tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month. The lack of Norman response appears to have caused the Northumbrians to grow restive, and {{in the spring of}} 1080 they rebelled against the rule of Walcher, the Bishop of Durham and Earl of Northumbria. The bishop was killed on 14 May 1080, and William dispatched his half-brother Odo to deal with the rebellion. William departed Normandy in July 1080, and in the autumn William's son Robert was sent on a campaign against the Scots. Robert raided into Lothian and forced Malcolm to agree to terms, building a fortification at Newcastle-on-Tyne while returning to England. The king was at Gloucester for Christmas 1080 and at Winchester for Whitsun in 1081, ceremonially wearing his crown on both occasions. A papal embassy arrived in England during this period, asking that William do fealty for England to the papacy, a request that William rejected. William also visited Wales during 1081, although the English and the Welsh sources differ on the exact purpose of the visit. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that it was a military campaign, but Welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to St Davids in honour of Saint David. William's biographer David Bates argues that the former explanation is more likely, explaining that the balance of power had recently shifted in Wales and that William would have wished to take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>changed</b> circumstances to extend Norman power. By the end of 1081, William was back on the continent, dealing with disturbances in Maine. Although he led an expedition into Maine, the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal legate.|$|E
