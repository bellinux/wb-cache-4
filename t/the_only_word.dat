In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>word</b> that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E
25|$|Duktė 'daughter' is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>word</b> of {{the fifth}} declension, not having an ending uo. A word moteris 'woman, female' often has a genitive móters; the plural genitive of moteris is moterų (not palatalized -ių); {{it is the only}} normal form for the fifth declension and one of the two (the main is -ių) for the third. The more two words, obelis f – apple tree and dieveris m – (older) brother-in-law, are the same declensional case as moteris, but dieveris, being {{masculine}} possibly has a sg. inst. -iu. Dieveris is also the only -er- masculine case.|$|E

[...] He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him. Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick, as Williams' miss meant that in the event Crane also missed, the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue.

So, for example, a four-word burst access to any column address from four to seven will return words four to seven. The ordering, however, depends on the requested address, and the configured burst type option: sequential or interleaved. Typically, a memory controller will require one or the other. When the burst length is one or two, the burst type does not matter. For a burst length of one, the requested word is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>word</b> accessed. For a burst length of two, the requested word is accessed first, and the other word in the aligned block is accessed second.

2500|$|Chamberlain deeply disliked Cheltenham, {{and felt}} lonely {{and out of}} place there. The young Chamberlain was [...] "a {{compulsive}} dreamer", {{more interested in the}} arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-mystical sense of self. Chamberlain's major interests in his studies at Cheltenham were the natural sciences, especially astronomy. Chamberlain later recalled: [...] "The starlight exerted an indescribable influence on me. The stars seemed closer to me, more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic – for that is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>word</b> which describes my feelings – than any of the people around me in school. For the stars, I experienced true friendship". During his youth, Chamberlain – while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism – became influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution. Bemoaning the loss of [...] "Merry Old England", this view argued for a return to a highly romanticized view of a mythic, bucolic period of English history that had never existed, with the people living happily in harmony with nature on the land overseen by a benevolent, cultured elite. In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities, doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class.|$|E

However, he did supervise the first foreign production of the opera, which appeared at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels on 9 January 1907. This was followed by foreign premieres in Frankfurt on 19 April of the same year, New York City at the Manhattan Opera House on 19February 1908, and at La Scala, Milan with Arturo Toscanini conducting on 2 April 1908. It first appeared in the United Kingdom at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 21 May 1909.|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{according}} to Coleridge's account, is {{a fragment of}} what it should have been, amounting {{to what he was}} able to jot down from memory: 54 lines. Originally, his dream included between 200 and 300 lines, but he was only able to compose the first 30 before he was interrupted. The second stanza is not necessarily part of the original dream and refers to the dream in the past tense. The rhythm of the poem, like its themes and images, is different from other poems Coleridge wrote during the time, and it is organised in a structure similar to 18th-century odes. The poem relies on many sound-based techniques, including cognate variation and chiasmus. In particular, the poem emphasises the use of the [...] "æ" [...] sound and similar modifications to the standard [...] "a" [...] sound to make the poem sound Asian. Its rhyme scheme found in the first seven lines is repeated in the first seven lines of the second stanza. There is a heavy use of assonance, the reuse of vowel sounds, and a reliance on alliteration, repetition of the first sound of a word, within the poem including the first line: [...] "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan". The stressed sounds, [...] "Xan", [...] "du", [...] "Ku", [...] "Khan", contain assonance in their use of the sounds a-u-u-a, have two rhyming syllables with [...] "Xan" [...] and [...] "Khan", and employ alliteration with the name [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and the reuse of [...] "d" [...] sounds in [...] "Xanadu" [...] and [...] "did". To pull the line together, the [...] "i" [...] sound of [...] "In" [...] is repeated in [...] "did". Later lines do not contain the same amount of symmetry but do rely on assonance and rhymes throughout. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>word</b> that has no true connection to another word is [...] "dome" [...] except in its use of a [...] "d" [...] sound. Though the lines are interconnected, the rhyme scheme and line lengths are irregular.|$|E
