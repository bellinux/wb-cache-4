The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that,</b> in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E

He recalled, [...] "And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> those people {{that were on the}} side of Germany, that they never thought of German victories or the German glory. What they really liked was the idea of the Blitzkrieg, of London being on fire, of the country being destroyed. As to the German fighters, they took no stock in them. Then I thought, well now Germany has lost, now America has saved us from this nightmare, but since nobody can doubt on which side I stood, I'll see what can be done from a literary point of view in favor of the Nazis. And then I created the ideal Nazi." ...|$|E

60|$|That {{day was the}} longest, bitterest, I {{had ever}} known, for the reason that, mixed with my grief, my sense of remorse, was a feeling of utter helplessness. In desperate desire for haste I could only lumpishly wait. Another day of agony, another interminable night of pain must pass before I could reach the shadowed Homestead.

60|$|Surely I was thick-headed on that afternoon, {{for even}} after Pierre had made full {{explanation}} of Uncle 'Rasmus's intended movements, {{it was a}} good five minutes before the whole scheme came plain in my mind, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> this old negro of ours was about to do more toward regaining possession of Silver Heels, if indeed she ever did come into my possession again, than all of us lads with our noisy talk.|$|E

Here's the song, let me play it for you. It goes like this. Okay, theres a change here, let's do it and he would sing it. I'd hear the melodies and I'd think, okay, he's gonna write words or {{whatever}} and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> later <b>that</b> he actually had written the words right there.

5000|$|In his {{official}} website, Voltaire explains why {{he decided to}} make a country album:I had spent my adult life saying I disliked country music. That is, until one day when in a karaoke bar was reacquainted with a Johnny Cash song called [...] "Folsom Prison Blues". [...] "I LOVE that song", I exclaimed. It was followed by a Hank Williams song, a Merle Haggard song, songs by Kenny Rogers, Willie Nelson, Buck Owens and more. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't hate country music after all. I hated what it had become. In my somewhat drunken state, I thought: [...] "Wouldn't it be interesting to make a record of old-school country music, the kind of record that could have been released 40 years ago?".|$|R
60|$|Throughout the {{afternoon}} the fight, kept on, {{the little black}} boats coming and going. I saw a mast totter and fall {{on one of the}} ships. I saw the flag shot away from the fort, and reappear again. But now the puffs came from her walls slowly and more slowly, so that my heart sank with the setting sun. And presently it grew too dark to see aught save the red flashes. Slowly, reluctantly, the noise died down until at last a great silence reigned, broken only now and again by voices in the streets below me. It was not until <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been all day without food--that I was alone in the dark of a great house.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> it {{was more}} than {{possible}} we might never come out from beneath these timbers alive because of having been killed by our own friends. The triumph which had been mine was sadly marred by the timorousness which came over me, as I understood that death might be nearer at hand than when we were in old Mary's cabin, with Abel Hunt roaming around the village in search of us.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> this inopportune {{flirting with}} fate must stop; that I must give over dallying with sensations, {{or it would}} soon be all over with me. I was falling a prey to the native Lorelei--for all these spots in Japan have their {{familiar}} devils--subjectively, as befits a modern man. I numbed sensibility as best I could and cared only to make each step secure. Between the Nirvana within and the Nirvana below, it was a sorry hell.|$|E
60|$|Then {{instantly}} I {{discovered the}} cause of the bird's alarm. At first I fancied that this strange figure was at some little distance. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> his stature had misled me, and that he could not be more than twenty or thirty yards away. Standing there, with fixed, white face and black hair, under a flowering blackthorn, he remained as motionless and as intent as I. He was not more than a few inches, apparently, superior in height to myself.|$|E
40|$|When I {{began my}} study of {{architecture}} ten years ago, I honestly believed that architecture {{could change the}} world. As I look back at how the American landscape has changed since <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> architecture has changed the world, but not necessarily in the way I imagined. As our population has grown architecture has reflected the increasing emphasis on consumerism, a decreased interest in public life and even less interest in the natural environment. Consequently terms like suburban sprawl have adequately been coined to describe the spreading wave of decentralized settlement that characterizes our landscape. Even though over 80 % of the new homes schools and shopping facilities are now located in the suburbs, many designers still do not consider the suburbs to be {{within the field of}} architectural practice. I do not hold to this view and believe that this is where architecture can make the biggest difference and where the greatest opportunity for architects to shape the world may be found. What defines architecture today is not just a question of good or bad aesthetics, but is how the design impacts our culture. With each building, landscape or urban plan we create we have the opportunity to reinforce current values or to establish new values which can lead us to explore more sustainable solutions. This thesis looks at a site in suburban Miami and demonstrates how we can redirect our growth toward the protection of our natural resources and contribute important public space that celebrates the value of our environment.

6000|$|For {{another week}} nothing of moment happened, {{and then we}} spent an hour one morning with the {{surveyor}} and a gray-haired gentleman from Winnipeg.

60|$|I {{noticed that}} she lay very still in my arms now, and as my eyes became {{accustomed}} to the light I {{saw that she was}} smiling--a very contented, happy smile.

Slowly they came up and stole about my neck, and then she drew my lips down to hers once more and held them there for a long time. At last she spoke.|$|E
60|$|The Ghost {{suddenly}} {{changed her}} course, keeping away, {{and it came}} to me with a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue as impossible. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he was preparing to heave to, and dropped to the deck to be in readiness. We were now dead before the wind, the boat far away and abreast of us. I felt an abrupt easing of the schooner, a loss for the moment of all strain and pressure, coupled with a swift acceleration of speed. She was rushing around on her heel into the wind.|$|E

For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the sun's disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her, and didn't quite realize. She looked too far into me, my wits were gone. She glanced round. Then {{she looked at}} me shrewdly. She drew a letter from her pocket, and handed it to me. It was {{addressed}} from France to Lance-Corporal Goyte, at Tible. I took out the letter and began to read it, as mere words. 'Mon cher Alfred'--it might have been a bit of a torn newspaper. So I followed the script: the trite phrases of a letter from a French-speaking girl to an English soldier. 'I think of you always, always. Do you think sometimes of me?' And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> vaguely <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was reading a man's private correspondence. And yet, how could one consider these trivial, facile French phrases private! Nothing more trite and vulgar in the world, than such a love-letter--no newspaper more obvious.|$|R

"Today, on {{the morning}} of 2nd April, 1893, which is 14th of the month of Ramadan 1310 Hijrah, in a state of slight drowsiness, I saw myself sitting in a large house with some friends, when a robust and frightful man, who seemed to be in a terrible rage, {{appeared}} before me. I looked up and saw that {{he was a man of}} an unfamiliar creation and disposition. He seemed not a man but one of the terrible and awe-inspiring angels, and his terror seized the hearts. As I looked at him, he asked, 'Where is Lekhram?' He also named another person and asked of his whereabouts. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> this man had been appointed for the chastisement of both Lekhram and the other person whose name I do not recollect.

60|$|The chauffeur {{started the}} car off again. What with the shock I had had and the luxury of riding in a motor-car, I was a little distrait, and I could not say how far we went. But {{it must have been}} miles and miles, for it seemed a long time {{afterwards}} that we stopped at the biggest house I have ever seen. There were smooth lawns and flower-beds, and men in overalls, and fountains and trees, and, away to the right, kennels with about a million dogs in them, all pushing their noses through the bars and shouting. They all wanted to know who I was and what prizes I had won, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> I was moving in high society.|$|E

Then several things happened simultaneously: an agonized cry behind me, distant shouts from the shore, a sudden upward lunge of the bow, and the torture of being submerged, inch by inch, in the icy, yellow water. Despite the splashing behind me, I sat as though paralyzed until I was waist deep and the boards turned under me, and then, with a spasmodic contraction of my whole being I struck out--only to find my feet on the muddy bottom. Such was the inglorious end of the good ship Petrel! For she went down, with all hands, {{in little more than}} half a fathom of water....

I delighted in mere divisions of time; I liked eating fish on Friday. But then I like fish; and the fast was made for men who like meat. Then I came to Hoxton and found men who had fasted for five hundred years; men who had to gnaw fish because they could not get meat--and fish-bones when they could not get fish. As too many British officers treat the army as a review, so I had treated the Church Militant {{as if it were the}} Church Pageant. Hoxton cures that. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> for eighteen hundred years the Church Militant had not been a pageant, but a riot--and a suppressed riot. There, still living patiently in Hoxton, were the people to whom the tremendous promises had been made. In the face of that I had to become a revolutionary if I was to continue to be religious. In Hoxton one cannot be a conservative without being also an atheist-- and a pessimist. Nobody but the devil could want to conserve Hoxton.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his earlier}} books Markides seems content {{to see any}} psychic {{phenomenon}} as of interest and value in itself and is also quick to draw (apparent) parallels between different religions or to gesture towards [...] "the perennial philosophy". However, he has gradually moved away from these assumptions. Speaking to Kevin Allen he avers: [...] "... it was a revelation {{to me that there}} might be something over and beyond the physical material universe.
