5|$|Hail to the Thief was {{produced}} by longtime Radiohead collaborator Nigel Godrich in Los Angeles. To avoid the protracted recording sessions of previous albums, Radiohead recorded Hail to the Thief quickly and focused on recording live takes rather than overdubs. Songwriter Thom Yorke wrote many of the lyrics in response to <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> the resurgence of right-wing politics in the west {{at the turn of}} the millennium.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead's sixth album, Hail to the Thief (2003), mixed {{rock and}} {{electronic}} music with lyrics inspired by <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror,</b> <b>and</b> was the band's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could {{set their own}} price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded {{the powers of}} law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, Osama bin Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011.|$|E
40|$|This wide-ranging, {{multidisciplinary}} {{collection of}} original papers explores {{the link between}} globalisation, citizenship and <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror.</b> Ideas from sociology, criminology, political science and development studies are incorporated into the contributors examination {{of the nature of}} globalisation and <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror.</b> Using theoretical frameworks, analysing current issues and reflecting on existing literature and past events, they illustrate how the processes of globalisation and <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror</b> are shaping and defining citizenship both globally and within nation states...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> {{has demanded}} <b>the</b> {{acceptance}} of ridiculous propositions. But is it funny—can we laugh {{at such a}} destructive endeavour? Considering this, the paper reads <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> as a text of magical realism—a literary genre which utilises juxtapositions between the fantastic supernatural and the modern rationalist paradigm. Thinking about <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> as a magical realist text allows us to engage with the fantasy (and humour) of counter-radicalisation policies which require us to believe in ideological contagion and witchcraft-like possession, and the extension of ever-more technologically sophisticated risk-management algorithms which draw upon and necessitate a fear of a coming apocalypse to function. Similar clashes of paradigm are used within magical realist literature to contest the supposedly secure boundaries of rationalism, and to open a place that Homi Bhabha calls ‘third space’ through the creative potential of juxtaposition. In reading <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> as a magical realist text, the paper argues that contemporary security policy narrates its own third space—one that can be extremely funny in the juxtapositions it employs. <b>The</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> undermines itself by narrating a liminal space where its claims of security appear ridiculous. Drawing on the thought of Luce Irigaray, the paper argues that this space of laughter is not only useful for resisting the practices of <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror,</b> but also that a failure to laugh consolidates <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> discourse and <b>the</b> joke it is playing on us by taking it seriously...|$|R

5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during the Cold War and <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend. Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E
5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 {{attacks on}} the United States, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf {{announced}} {{his support for the}} US-led War on Terror. This declaration sparked conflict with the Lal Masjid, whose leadership was openly pro-Taliban. Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid denied having any links to banned terrorist organisations but were vehemently opposed to <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> the conflict in Afghanistan. They openly condemned Musharraf and opposed Pakistani security forces, including the Pakistan Rangers and Islamabad Capital Territory police. The mosque became a source for speeches calling for the assassination of Musharraf. One of these speeches was delivered by Masood Azhar, whose Jaish-e-Mohammed group members were later involved in failed attempts to kill the president. In July 2005, Pakistani authorities attempted to raid the mosque in connection with their investigation into the July 7, 2005 London bombings, but the police were blocked by baton-wielding female students. After the raid, authorities apologised for the behaviour of the police.|$|E
25|$|Some {{newspaper}} editorials in Iran blamed the bombing on British or American authorities seeking to further justify <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror,</b> <b>and</b> {{claimed that the}} plan that included the bombings also involved increasing harassment of Muslims in Europe.|$|E

500|$|Amid <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> <b>and</b> {{threat from}} Al Qaeda, Livingstone sought to build closer {{ties to the}} London's Muslim community, {{controversially}} agreeing to meet with Islamist groups like the Muslim Association of Britain alongside moderate organisations. In July 2004, he attended a conference discussing France's ban on the burka at which he talked alongside Islamist cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Livingstone described al-Qaradawi as [...] "one of the most authoritative Muslim scholars in the world today" [...] and argued that his influence could help stop the radicalisation of young British Muslims. The move was controversial, with Jewish and LGBT organisations criticising Livingstone, citing al-Qaradawi's record of anti-Semitic and homophobic remarks, with the meeting leading to a publicised argument between Livingstone and his former supporter Peter Tatchell. Livingstone continued to champion the Palestinian cause in the Israel-Palestine conflict, in March 2005 accusing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of being a [...] "war criminal" [...] responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre.|$|E

Walter Lippmann believed Willkie's nomination to have been crucial to Britain's survival, [...] "second only to the Battle of Britain, the sudden rise and nomination of Willkie was the decisive event, perhaps providential, which made it possible to rally the free world when [...] was almost conquered. Under any other leadership but his the Republican party in 1940 would have turned its back on Great Britain, causing all who resisted Hitler to feel abandoned". Charles Peters wrote that [...] "it is arguable that [...] impact on [...] and the world was greater than that of most men who actually held the office [...] At a crucial moment in history, he stood for the right things at the right time." [...] When Georgia Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat, gave the keynote address at the 2004 Republican National Convention, he urged unity instead of partisan strife in <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror,</b> <b>and</b> recalled Willkie's actions, [...] "He gave Roosevelt the critical support he needed for a peacetime draft, an unpopular idea at the time.
