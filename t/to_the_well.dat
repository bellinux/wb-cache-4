Bok went to the local police {{department}} to seek help, and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> tying them, and leaving them behind as {{he walked into the}} crowded marketplace.|$|E

5|$|As {{these forces}} gather, the god Heimdallr will stand and blow into his horn, Gjallarhorn, which will awaken the gods. The gods will meet {{and hold a}} thing. Odin will ride <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> Mímisbrunnr and will consult Mímir on behalf of himself and his people. Yggdrasil, the cosmological tree, will shiver and all beings will be fearful. The gods and the einherjar will don their war gear and advance to Vígríðr. Odin, wearing a golden helmet, a coat of mail, and brandishing his spear Gungnir, will ride in the front.|$|E
5|$|Come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Well</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by American {{contemporary}} Christian band Casting Crowns, released on October 18, 2011 through Beach Street and Reunion Records. The album, which has a predominantly pop rock and rock sound, {{was based on the}} Biblical story of the woman at the well. In writing the album, lead vocalist Mark Hall collaborated with songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the album's songwriting, and received the award for Top Christian Album at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.|$|E

Additional vocals were recorded by Billy Lord at Eagle's Landing Studio in McDonough, Georgia, while additional recording was conducted at Lifesong Studio in McDonough. The string tracks on the album, which were arranged by David Davidson, were recorded at Ocean Way Studio in Nashville, Tennessee by Bobby Shin. It was mastered by Andrew Mendelson at Georgetown Masters in Nashville. The album was submixed by Shin at ShinShack Studio in Nashville.|$|E
5|$|The 19thcentury saw {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} the castle. In 1826 repairs were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> in the keep. At {{the same time a}} survey was carried out by A. W. N. Pugin and he excavated around the keep, investigating how it was built. He descended into the well in a bucket in an unsuccessful search for treasure. Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, leased the castle to the Corporation of Rochester in 1870 for use as a public park; when it opened to the public in 1872, Rochester Castle was presented as a picturesque ruin, with trees planted in the enclosure and the walls overgrown with ivy. In 1884 the Corporation bought the castle for £6,572 (equivalent to £3.4million in 2009 terms). Between 1896 and 1904, George Payne carried out repairs. In {{the first quarter of the}} century the gardens acquired a German field gun and a tank from the First World War, and a bandstand, though they were removed by 1961. Ivy was removed from the keep between 1919 and 1931 and the planting in the castles scaled back. In 1960 the origin of Boley Hill was investigated archaeologically, but the excavations failed to provide firm dating evidence.|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus {{natural gas}} trend, which {{encompasses}} 104,000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York, {{is the largest}} source of natural gas in the United States, and production was still growing rapidly in 2013. The Marcellus {{is an example of}} shale gas, natural gas trapped in low-permeability shale, and requires the well completion method of hydraulic fracturing to allow the gas to flow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> bore. The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E

Casting Crowns has also released a holiday album, Peace on Earth, which has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E
5|$|The head {{today is}} used {{for a variety of}} reasons. Firstly it is a tourist spot where country walks can be taken all over the head due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> defined gravel paths, some of which form part of the Bournemouth Coast Path. In 2008, many paths were resurfaced, making more (though not all) parts of the head {{wheelchair}} accessible. For example, it is now possible to gain wheelchair access to Quarry Pool. Regular field trips to the site are made by students of all ages and there are occasional guided tours or meetings around the head covering a wide variety of subjects.|$|E

The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> Urðarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>well</b> Mímisbrunnr.
