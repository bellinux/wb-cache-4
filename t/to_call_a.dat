5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Although {{calls for}} a special session of the {{legislature}} {{had been made in}} February and March, Governor Stanley was not initially receptive to the idea at the beginning of April. In mid-April, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Gi Stevens urged Stanley <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special session of the General Assembly to reconsider the Gray Commission proposals. In May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into special session.|$|E

5|$|By 1987, {{unemployment}} was falling, {{the economy}} was stable and strong and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E
5|$|Harper's Cabinet was {{defeated}} in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in contempt of parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the Governor General <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> general election. This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing {{the confidence of the}} lower house on the grounds of contempt of parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.|$|E

40|$|Background: An {{immediate}} ambulance call {{offers the}} greatest opportunity for acute stroke therapy. Effectively using ambulance services requires strengthening {{the association between}} knowledge of early stroke symptoms and intention <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> ambulance at stroke onset, and encouraging the public to use ambulance services. Methods: The present study utilized data from the Acquisition of Stroke Knowledge (ASK) study, which administered multiple-choice, mail-in surveys regarding awareness of early stroke symptoms and response to a stroke attack before and after a 2 -year stroke education campaign in two areas subject to intensive and moderate intervention, {{as well as in}} a control area, in Japan. In these three areas, 3833 individuals (1680, 1088 and 1065 participants in intensive intervention, moderate intervention, and control areas, respectively), aged 40 to 74 years, who responded appropriately to each survey were included in the present study. Results: After the intervention, the number of correctly identified symptoms significantly associated with intention <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> ambulance (P < 0. 05) increased (eg, from 4 to 5 correctly identified symptoms), without increasing choice of decoy symptoms in the intensive intervention area. Meanwhile, in other areas, rate of identification of not only correct symptoms but also decoy symptoms associated with intention <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> ambulance increased. Furthermore, the association between improvement in the knowledge of stroke symptoms and intention <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> ambulance was observed only in the intensive intervention area (P = 0. 009). Conclusions: Our results indicate that intensive interventions are useful for strengthening the association between correct knowledge of early stroke symptoms and intention <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> ambulance, without strengthening the association between incorrect knowledge and intention <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> ambulance...|$|R

Later that month, Magoffin {{sent a letter to}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis asking that he recognize and honor Kentucky's neutrality.

5|$|One of the governor's most {{important}} political powers {{is the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special session of the General Assembly. During a two-year period, the assembly can meet on its own {{for no more than}} 91 days, and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to. This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him or her in exchange for a special legislative session.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposal}} was made <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special session {{to repeal the}} law, and Bradley {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} a year in office, Cook was forced <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> new election, the first double dissolution. Labor won back its {{majority}} in the House, and Fisher returned for a third term as prime minister. He struggled with the demands of Australia's participation in World War I, and in October 1915 resigned in favour of Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66. In total, Fisher served as prime minister for just under five years; Bob Hawke is {{the only member of the}} Labor Party to have served for longer.|$|E

5000|$|Of his {{professional}} career in newspapers, LeDuff states: [...] "I’m not a journalist, I’m a reporter.

You can’t <b>call</b> <b>an</b> undertaker a mortician- too high falutin’; you got <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him <b>an</b> undertaker. You can’t <b>call</b> <b>a</b> lawyer an attorney, you have <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him <b>a</b> lawyer. But somehow, since we control it, and we’re very self-important people, you can <b>call</b> <b>a</b> reporter a journalist." ...|$|R

He was angered that Hoover refused <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7.

Maria Theresa's ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and GeorgeII declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen {{was once again}} {{in need of help}} from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding to all of their demands. She had already won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she showed her gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|E
