It is {{some of the people in}} that regime. Pray for peace in the Middle East, a just peace." [...] Graham had earlier said that [...] "there come <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have to fight for peace." [...] He went on to say that out of the war in the Gulf may [...] "come a new peace and, as suggested by the President, a new world order." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{one stage}} of his childhood, {{he lived in a}} hostel as his mother had nowhere to live. Johnson credits his mother with helping him develop a {{football}} career, saying, [...] "She had a tough time, bringing up three kids as a single parent with no help apart from the goodwill of close friends, and there were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had nowhere to stay. At one point we were homeless and staying in a hostel, but once mum got herself on her feet after a few hard years, and passed her driving test so she could take me to football every week, that gave us a fresh start." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} of Captain Moroni plays {{a significant role}} in how members of the LDS Church understand and justify the political realities of war and violence. [...] In this context, important aspects of Moroni’s narrative include that he “did not delight in the shedding of blood”, that his warfare was strictly defensive, that he sought the guidance of prophets before battle, and that he did not seek for power. When the U.S.-led War in Afghanistan commenced during the LDS Church's October 2001 General Conference, Gordon B. Hinckley announced commencement and referenced the story of Captain Moroni saying, “There are <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> must stand up for right and decency, for freedom and civilization, just as Moroni rallied his people in his day to the defense of their wives, their children, and the cause of liberty.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Growing up, Cho recounted {{that life}} was financially {{difficult}} as an undocumented immigrant, stating, [...] "My parents left for work before I woke up and came back home after I went to sleep. We had financial difficulties and there were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had no water or electricity {{for a few days}} because we weren't able to pay the bills. Other daily activities that others take for granted such as having a drivers’ license was difficult for my father". [...] Due to a display of skill in speed skating, his parents sold their business and spent their savings to move to Salt Lake City to train Cho for the sport after he graduated from junior high school. Simon Cho now resides in Rockville, Maryland and when he is not coaching, he enjoys watching sports, documentaries and attending concerts.|$|E
2500|$|All of {{a sudden}} we had two Australian teams on one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I was waiting in a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had other people who were barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting {{on the use}} of the Oslo Session String Quartet, Rygg said, [...] "We {{worked a}} lot with {{simulating}} stringed instruments, so it's always good for us to get some people in and play the real thing. I suppose strings and piano are our instruments of preference; those are the sounds we like to work with. That timbre, you know? In terms of writing music — not that we really write music per se, but say we did write music, we'd write it for strings and piano." [...] Adding, [...] "A lot of <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get musicians into the studio we just get them to play along with preliminary ideas or themes. We can record hours of music and end up using one minute of it. But this time we had the body of the songs before the string quartet came, and we wrote down a part for them. It was a little more disciplined than before." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease {{played a}} crucial role in winning the war:On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [...] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were [...] "discussing freely" [...] among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.|$|E

60|$|With {{regard to}} time, our feeling of {{duration}} {{or of the}} lapse of time is notoriously an unsafe guide as to the time that has elapsed by the clock. <b>Times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are bored or suffering pain pass slowly, <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are agreeably occupied pass quickly, and <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are sleeping pass {{almost as if they}} did not exist. Thus, in so far as time is constituted by duration, there is the same necessity for distinguishing a public and a private time as there was in the case of space. But in so far as time consists in an order of before and after, {{there is no need to}} make such a distinction; the time-order which events seem to have is, so far as we can see, the same as the time-order which they do have. At any rate no reason can be given for supposing that the two orders are not the same. The same is usually true of space: if a regiment of men are marching along a road, the shape of the regiment will look different from different points of view, but the men will appear arranged in the same order from all points of view. Hence we regard the order as true also in physical space, whereas the shape is only supposed to correspond to the physical space so far as is required for the preservation of the order.|$|E
