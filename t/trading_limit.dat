50|$|Beginning in 2008, Adoboli {{started using}} the bank's money for {{unauthorised}} trades. He entered false information into UBS's computers {{to hide the}} risky trades he was making. He exceeded the bank's per-employee daily <b>trading</b> <b>limit</b> of US$100 million, and failed to hedge his trades against risk. He also used his personal funds on two spread betting accounts, IG Index and City Index, where he lost around £100,000. In mid-2011, UBS launched an internal investigation into Adoboli's trades. On 14 September 2011, Adoboli wrote an e-mail to his manager admitting to booking false trades. His trades cost the bank $2 billion (£1.3 billion) and wiped off $4.5 billion (£2.7 billion) from its share price. The trading losses he incurred while trading for his bank were the largest unauthorised trading losses in British history.|$|E

40|$|Auction" or "call" trading {{systems are}} used in many stock exchanges. An {{essential}} problem {{in the application of}} these systems is that orders in one security cannot be conditioned on prices of other securities. This paper proposes and analyzes the feasibility of an index-contingent trading system. In this system, limit orders may be conditioned on an index (any weighted average of the security prices that is determined simultaneously with the prices) in addition to the asset price. Without any assumptions about traders' behavior it is shown that under a reasonable restriction on the structure of the limit orders, there is a unique solution (vector of prices) to any set of orders in all securities. Moreover, the paper presents a quick and simple algorithm that converges to the solution. This algorithm is based on an extension of the current mechanisms; therefore it can be implemented easily in any computerized auction system. stock exchanges, trading systems, call <b>trading,</b> <b>limit</b> orders, security indexes, market micro-structure...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{determinants}} of order aggressiveness and traders ’ order submission strategy in an open limit order book market. Using order book data from the Australian Stock Exchange, we model traders ’ aggressiveness in market <b>trading,</b> <b>limit</b> order trading {{as well as in}} order cancellations {{on both sides of the}} market using a six-dimensional autoregressive intensity model. The information revealed by the open order book plays an important role in explaining the degree of order aggressiveness in the individual processes. Moreover, evidence for significant dynamic interdependencies between the individual processes confirms the usefulness of the multivariate setting. Overall, our empirical results confirm theoretical findings on limit order book trading and show that a trader’s decision of when and which order to submit is significantly influenced by the queued volume, the market depth, the inside spread, recent volatility, as well as recent changes in both the order flow and the price...|$|E
