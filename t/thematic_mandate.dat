5000|$|The titles special rapporteur, {{independent}} expert, {{and working}} group member {{are given to}} individuals working {{on behalf of the}} United Nations (UN) within the scope of [...] "special procedure" [...] mechanisms who have a specific country or <b>thematic</b> <b>mandate</b> from the United Nations Human Rights Council. The term [...] "rapporteur" [...] is a French-derived word for an investigator who reports to a deliberative body. The mandate by the United Nations has been to [...] "examine, monitor, advise, and publicly report" [...] on human rights problems through [...] "activities undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, psychological operations and manipulation via the controlled media and academia, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities." [...] However, the manual Internal Advisory Procedure to Review Practices and Working Methods (25 June 2008) of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures simply calls these individuals mandate-holders. Other applications of the role include [...] "special representative of the secretary-general" [...] or [...] "independent expert", or a working group usually composed of five members, one from each region of the planet.|$|E

LSE alumna Anri van der Spuy, now a fellow at the UN Secretariat of the IGF and her colleague Carl Gahnberg (who both write here in a personal capacity that does not reflect the views of the IGF) evaluate the contemporary relevance of this <b>thematic</b> <b>mandate</b> in light of a sampling of other recent developments that may have a bearing {{on the future of the}} Internet and human rights...|$|E

5000|$|... "Special procedures" [...] is {{the general}} name given to the {{mechanisms}} established by the Human Rights Council to gather expert observations and advice on human rights issues {{in all parts of}} the world. Special procedures are categorized as either <b>thematic</b> <b>mandates,</b> which focus on major phenomena of human rights abuses worldwide, or country mandates, which report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories. Special procedures can be either individuals (called [...] "Special Rapporteurs" [...] or [...] "Independent Experts"), who are intended to be independent experts in a particular area of human rights, or working groups, usually composed of five members (one from each UN region). As of September 30, 2016 there were 43 thematic and 14 country mandates.|$|R

40|$|As {{the scope}} of the Special Procedures {{mandates}} grows, the system is achieving more and more coherence as a whole. In this article, the author proposes a strategic positioning of the system of Special Procedures mandates. Starting with a survey of the development of the geographic and <b>thematic</b> <b>mandates,</b> the author identifies the imbalances within this system. After examining its merits and limitations, he asserts that these imbalances give cause for a strategic positioning of the system as a whole. The author argues, amongst others, that an overall strategy will make the system less vulnerable to political influences, which will allow for more continuing mandates. In this way, the system of Special Procedures mandates would be able to protect human rights more effectively. This article gives compelling reasons for a strategic positioning and translates them into elements that should be incorporated in this overall strategy...|$|R
