5|$|The UK Anime Network had Andy Hanley {{review the}} first four episodes and he {{expressed}} a much more positive outlook than previous reviewers. Hanley wrote about how fast the series was in setting up its premise and described it as an in at <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>end</b> experience. Hanley cited the ruination of Tokyo {{at the end of}} the first episode and the countless deaths that occur by episode four to support this. Hanley argued that while this pace leaves the series open to being labelled as shallow, it's actually very effective in keeping the viewer engaged.|$|E

25|$|McManaman's {{performances}} {{in his first}} season in 1991–92 established him as a regular first team player, making 51 appearances in total, a result of both his form and his being thrown in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>end</b> after his mentor, Barnes, suffered a career threatening Achilles Tendon injury. He created and scored several goals that year and collected a winner's medal in the 1992 FA Cup Final as Liverpool triumphed 2–0 against Sunderland and was named as the man of the match having set up the winner for Michael Thomas despite being the youngest player on the pitch. He also featured heavily in their run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. His performances saw McManaman described by Ian Rush as the most promising young player at Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>end,</b> to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

500|$|... in 1993, Off <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was {{nominated}} for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. However, the album lost to Peter Schickele's Music for an Awful Lot of Winds and Percussion.

500|$|Critical {{response}} to Off <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was generally positive. Many critics praised not only Yankovic's parodies, {{but also his}} originals. Barry Weber, of Allmusic, wrote, [...] "In addition to re-establishing his satirical craftsmanship, Deep End showcases some of Yankovic's best originals ever; [...] "Trigger Happy," [...] "When I Was Your Age," [...] and [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] {{prove to be the}} album's greatest songs." [...] Christopher Thelen, of the Daily Vault, wrote, [...] "In fact, it's strange to admit, but the originals on Off <b>The</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> actually are, at times, stronger than the parodies." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Off <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was awarded 3.5 stars out of 5, denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent. Not all reviews were so positive, however. Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne noted that the video for Off <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> lead single [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] was [...] "an old-fashioned laugh riot", but that half of Yankovic's humor was merely visual, meaning that the songs without videos were not as funny.|$|E
500|$|The {{cover for}} Off <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> parodies the famous cover of Nirvana's album Nevermind, which depicts an infant in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>end</b> of a pool chasing after a dollar bill {{on a hook}} and line. The Off <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> cover shows Yankovic in the baby's place {{apparently}} chasing after a doughnut on a string. While the Nirvana cover has a fully nude baby, Yankovic instead wore a bathing suit {{in a way that}} his body position hid it; he later jokingly noted, [...] "I never really anticipated going full-frontal on any of my album covers." [...] The CD, liner notes, and artwork continue the parody of Nirvana's album, borrowing the same blue, wave-light graphics from the printed surface of Nevermind.|$|E
30|$|The postseismic slip {{distribution}} {{also shows}} a large slip patch at <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> model source region. Probably, {{this can be}} attributed to shallow crustal aftershocks (M 5.6 and M 5.7) in the Ibaraki prefecture, since these earthquakes seem too small to explain the observed deformation signal. Some large seismic events might occur in the shallow crust, leading to the anomalously active normal faulting activities in this region. A more detailed analysis of the geodetic data is necessary to investigate such a possibility.|$|R
5000|$|The {{series was}} created in early 2013 and premiered on YouTube with one episode called [...] "Noko & the Famous Venda Tree" [...] - an episode about a mythological tree from <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>ends</b> of Venda, South Africa, which {{supposedly}} extends men’s penises if planted in the right manner. The series first went viral over the internet {{after the release of}} the episode called [...] "Noko in High School".

500|$|Off <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> is {{the seventh}} studio album by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic, {{released}} in 1992. This album {{was the first}} album self-produced by Yankovic, after six albums with Rick Derringer. Recorded between June 1990 and January 1992, the album was a follow-up to the unsuccessful soundtrack to Yankovic's 1989 film UHF. Off <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> and its lead single [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] helped to revitalize Yankovic's career after a lull in the late 80s.|$|E
