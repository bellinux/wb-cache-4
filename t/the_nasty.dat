5|$|At the October 13, 1992 Wrestling Challenge taping, Money Inc. faced The Natural Disasters in {{a rematch}} for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The match {{originally}} pitted the Disasters against <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys, {{who were also}} managed by Hart, {{but at the last}} minute, Hart replaced them with Money Inc. Because of this, <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys split with Hart and attacked Money Inc. before the match. Later on, the Headshrinkers interfered on behalf of Money Inc. and helped DiBiase make Earthquake submit to the Million Dollar Dream, thereby winning Money Inc. the Championship. After the match, <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys again attacked Jimmy Hart. At the 1992 Survivor Series on November 25, Money Inc. and the Beverly Brothers faced <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys and the Natural Disasters in an 8-man elimination tag team match. During the match, Money Inc. eliminated the Natural Disasters, but Jerry Sags of <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys then pinned I.R.S. to win the match. This was the only major victory <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys got over Money Inc., as they failed to win the tag team title in several shots on television and at house shows in late 1992 into early 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a tag team elimination match, in which The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) teamed with <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobbs) to face Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake). The rules stated that when any man was eliminated, his tag team partner {{would also be}} eliminated. Blake Beverly and Typhoon began the match, but Beau and Earthquake soon entered the ring as well. The Natural Disasters gained control of the match by attacking Blake Beverly, and <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys entered the ring to assist the Disasters. Blake attacked Sags and tagged out of the match. Beau entered but was bodyslammed by Sags; Sags got distracted, however, which allowed Beau to suplex him and bring DiBiase into the match. Money Inc. took turns attacking Sags until Earthquake entered the ring. Earthquake performed an Earthquake splash by sitting on Beau Beverly to pin him and eliminate both Beverly Brothers. Earthquake fought DiBiase, but both men eventually left the ring and were replaced by their partners. Typhoon performed a splash on Schyster but was tripped by DiBiase. Schyster pinned Typhoon to eliminate The Natural Disasters. While Schyster was celebrating, Sags quickly pinned him to win the match for <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys.|$|E
5|$|After {{deciding}} {{to become a}} professional wrestler, Reiher trained with his father, Jimmy Snuka in New Jersey. He then began working under the ring name Solo in the UWA in California. During his time in UWA, he was offered a contract by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), but turned it down {{in favor of a}} more lucrative contract from UWA. After the UWA went out of business in late 2001, Reiher began working for the Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF), a promotion run by Jimmy Hart, <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys, and Greg Valentine. In XWF, he used the name Jimmy Snuka Jr. and was managed by his father. He appeared at the first round of XWF tapings in November 2001, defeating Buddy Lee Parker and Vapor in two separate matches.|$|E

5|$|The Hart Foundation {{held the}} WWF Tag Team Championship for almost seven months before {{dropping}} the title belts to <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys on March 24, 1991 at Wrestlemania VII. Demolition feuded with the Legion of Doom, including several six-man matches {{in which the}} Ultimate Warrior sided with the Legion of Doom. They also faced each other at Survivor Series 1990 {{as part of an}} elimination match. During the match, Smash, Crush, and both members of the Legion of Doom were disqualified for fighting outside the ring. Demolition was disbanded altogether shortly thereafter, although Smash and Crush continued to wrestle under different gimmicks.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} event was a WWF Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage. The rivalry between them {{began in the}} fall of 1990, when Sensational Sherri, who was {{managing}} Savage, tried to arrange a match between Savage and Warrior. The Warrior refused to defend his WWF Championship against Savage, and he ripped up a contract that Sherri had given him. While they faced each other at house shows over the next few months, where Savage was unable to win the title, they never had a televised match with each other. Savage then interfered in the title match at Royal Rumble 1991, enabling Sgt. Slaughter to win the title. To settle the rivalry, Savage and the Warrior agreed to face each other in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII. The Warrior won the match, forcing Savage into retirement. However, Savage would be reinstated as an active wrestler in November 1991. The following year, the rivalry was rekindled when the Ultimate Warrior was granted a shot at the WWF Championship, which Savage had won from Ric Flair at WrestleMania VIII on April 5, 1992. Flair and his executive consultant Mr. Perfect, were upset that Flair had not been granted a rematch. They decided to cause trouble between Savage and the Warrior. In August, Perfect claimed that he was in negotiations with Savage and Warrior, who both had sought his managerial services, but refused to clarify which wrestler he would support at SummerSlam. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, a show designed to promote the pay-per-view, Savage and the Warrior teamed up to face <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys. Perfect and Ric Flair interfered in the match, resulting in a count-out victory for <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys and more animosity between Savage and Warrior.|$|E
5|$|One of the staged feuds {{heading into}} the event was between Tatanka and Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels. Tatanka {{was in the midst}} of an undefeated streak and had {{wrestled}} Michaels twice in the months leading up to WrestleMania IX. Tatanka pinned Michaels in a singles match on the February 13, 1993, episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling and later teamed with <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys in a six-man match against Michaels and the Beverly Brothers; Tatanka pinned Michaels to win this match as well. Michaels was also feuding with Sensational Sherri, who stood in Tatanka's corner during the match. Sherri had been Michaels' valet. When Marty Jannetty tried to hit Michaels with a mirror, however, Michaels pulled Sherri in front of him to protect himself. Sherri's anger at getting hit over the head with a mirror caused her to turn on him at Royal Rumble 1993.|$|E

25|$|The seventh {{match was}} between <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags) (accompanied by Missy Hyatt) {{and the team}} of Sting and Road Warrior Hawk for the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Sting and Hawk had the early advantage, and {{targeted}} the left arm of Knobs. After Hawk missed a turnbuckle thrust in the corner, he fell outside, and was attacked by <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys. They had the advantage until Hawk performed a clothesline to both, and tagged in Sting. Sting attacked them both, and attempted a splash to Knobs, but Knobs raised his knees. <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys then dominated Sting, and repeatedly applied the abdominal stretch. This continued until Hawk came in, and attacked both with Sting. They performed a Doomsday Device on Knobs, and Sting attempted to pin him, but Hyatt interfered. Sting and Hawk won the match by disqualification, and <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys retained the title.|$|E
25|$|The Hart Foundation's second title reign {{lasted until}} WrestleMania VII {{when they were}} {{defeated}} by <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs), when Knobs nailed Neidhart {{over the head with}} Jimmy Hart's helmet (Jimmy Hart managed <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys at the time). The Hart Foundation split after WrestleMania VII, and Bret then focused on his singles career.|$|E
25|$|Turning face, Payne {{formed a}} tag team with Cactus Jack {{towards the end}} of the year.

They faced <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys once more, this time for the WCW World Tag Team Championships, in a Chicago Street Fight at Spring Stampede 1994, but were defeated.|$|E

25|$|After {{losing the}} titles Money Inc. had {{to focus on}} the {{challenges}} by the Legion of Doom, which gave the Natural Disasters the opportunity to defend their newly won titles against new competition. That competition {{came in the form of}} The Beverly Brothers (managed by The Genius), whom they defeated at SummerSlam 1992, the Disasters' first PPV pinfall in a year. Afterwards, the Disasters faced challenges by both <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys and Money Inc., both managed by Jimmy Hart. In a series of events that mirrored how the Natural Disasters turned face <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys turned on Jimmy Hart when Hart favored Money Inc. when signing title matches. <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys turned on Hart, while Money Inc. regained the tag team titles from the Natural Disasters in October 1992. With <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys also in the hunt for the tag team gold the Natural Disasters were slowly phased out of the tag team division with their last PPV outing as a team came at the 1992 Survivor Series PPV where they were eliminated by Money Inc.|$|E

25|$|During his and Jack's {{feud with}} <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys, Payne had become {{increasingly}} unhappy with their stiffness and insistence on controlling the match. During their brawl at Spring Stampede, Brian Knobbs and Payne did not cooperate on a fall, and Knobbs broke {{his shoulder as}} a result. After the match, WCW President Eric Bischoff shouted at Payne for hurting Knobbs, and Payne responded in kind. As a result, he was subsequently buried. He was fired from WCW soon after, although he did help Jack and his new partner, Kevin Sullivan, defeat <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys with a guitar shot.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{match was}} a Double Dog Collar match between <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags) and Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge). Rock was {{connected}} to Sags, and Grunge {{was connected to}} Knobs. All four fought to the outside, and used several weapons on each other. Grunge performed a bulldog on Knobs on a steel chair. Rock performed a somersault legdrop on Sags and performed an axe handle to him through a table. All four eventually return to the ring, where The Public Enemy had the advantage. Rock went to the top turnbuckle, but Sags pulled the chain, and Rock fell onto the table. Knobs repeatedly attacked Grunge with the chain. Sags then hit an axe handle with the chain on Rock, who was on a table. Knobs hanged Grunge with the chain over the top rope as <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys delivered a clothesline to Rock with the chain. Sags hit Rock with the chain, and pinned him for <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys to win.|$|E
25|$|While in Memphis Badd Company {{also won}} the CWA’s main tag team title, the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship, {{defeating}} Jeff Jarrett and Billy Joe Travis on August 8, 1987. They lost it to <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys just over a month later.|$|E

25|$|After {{the tour}} Marcus {{returned}} to Florida where {{he participated in}} a tournament to crown a new NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship, losing in the final to Mike Graham. When Marcus returned he also teamed up with his brother Johnny to challenge for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship chasing the champions Mike Graham and Steve Keirn until September 20, 1988 where the Laurinaitis brothers won the gold. Marcus and Johnny defended the titles for over 3 months until they came across Florida newcomers <b>The</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs) who took the gold from them. The brothers would come back strong only 3 weeks later to regain their gold and {{hold on to it}} until March 24, 1989 where <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys once again beat them for the gold. During their second run with the gold Marcus and Johnny also tourned with All Japan Pro Wrestling as a team. Shortly afterwards Johnny Ace left Florida Championship Wrestling to compete in Jim Crockett Promotions as one of the “Dynamic Dudes” (with Shane Douglas). The team known as the Bounty Hunters won the Florida tag team titles in November, but when one of the Bounty Hunters was injured Marcus stepped in and teamed up with the other Bounty Hunter to defend the tag team titles. The team held the gold until <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys beat them on a card in Nassau, Bahamas on January 6, 1990.|$|E
25|$|Going into Bash at the Beach, Pretty Wonderful had the {{advantage}} as both champions were suffering from injuries inflicted by the challengers on previous occasions (kayfabe). Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan were unable to hold off Roma and Orndorff, as Pretty Wonderful left the ring with the gold. Pretty Wonderful was immediately challenged by <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys after winning the title, but <b>the</b> <b>Nasty</b> Boys {{were never able to}} take the gold from the champions. Next, Pretty Wonderful was challenged by the duo of Stars and Stripes (Marcus Alexander Bagwell and The Patriot) at Fall Brawl. The champions retained, but a week later the championship changed hands when Stars and Stripes got the victory. Pretty Wonderful was granted a rematch against the new champions with a match booked for Halloween Havoc; Pretty Wonderful regained the titles when Roma used one of the title belts to knock Bagwell out cold.|$|E
