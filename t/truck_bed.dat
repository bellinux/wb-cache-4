After a journey of thirteen days in a pau-de-arara (open <b>truck</b> <b>bed),</b> they arrived in Guarujá and discovered that Aristides had formed a second family with Valdomira. Aristides' two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, Eurídice moved with her children to a small room behind a bar in São Paulo. After that Lula rarely saw his father, who became an alcoholic and died in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese {{manufacturers}} initially {{found they}} could export [...] "cab-chassis" [...] configurations (which included the entire light truck, less the cargo box or <b>truck</b> <b>bed)</b> {{with only a}} 4% tariff.

The [...] "cab-chassis" [...] loophole was closed in 1980.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, AMC was {{planning}} a compact coupé utility (pickup) {{based on the}} Hornet {{to compete with the}} increasing sales of Japanese compact pickup models. A prototype called the Cowboy was developed under the leadership of Jim Alexander. The prototype vehicle featured a modified AMC Gremlin front design and a cargo box with a Jeep logo on the tailgate. The standard I6 engine would be more powerful than the 4-cylinders found in the imported pickups. The only surviving prototype was built using a 1971 Hornet SC360 with the 360 V8 and 4-speed manual transmission. It was used by AMC on their proving grounds for several years before being sold to an employee, who later installed a 1973 Hornet updated front end. However, with the increasing sales of the Hornet models, and the 1970 acquisition of Jeep and no 4WD option ready for the Cowboy (at the time ALL Jeeps were 4WD), AMC's product planners shelved the Cowboy truck program. A 4WD system was developed and later used on the 1980 AMC Eagle, and the [...] "uniframe" [...] construction ("frame" [...] rails under the <b>truck</b> <b>bed</b> made of folded sheet metal and incorporated into the cab structure as one piece) resurfaced for the 1985 Jeep Comanche pickup, based on the unit body XJ Cherokee.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} Campylobacter jejuni contamination and prevalence on fomites moving between broiler farms and the processing plant in the period after cleaning and before departure to harvest chickens. In addition, changes in the proportion of contaminated fomites in the course of a day were assessed. Methods and Results: Pooled swab samples were obtained from pallets, crates, wheels of trucks, tractors and forklifts, <b>truck</b> <b>beds,</b> and from drivers' and catchers' boots. After enrichment in Bolton's broth Campylobacter were recovered on modified blood-free Campylobacter selective agar (mCCDA). Isolates were identified using tests for phenotypic and biochemical characteristics. Of the 209 samples collected, 53 % were positive for C. jejuni, with all fomites positive except tractor wheels. Pallets had the highest contamination rate at 75 %. More than 50 % of catchers' boots, drivers' boots, crates and truck wheels were positive. Forty-seven per cent and 31 % of <b>truck</b> <b>beds</b> and forklift wheels, respectively, were contaminated. The proportion of contaminated fomites did not change significantly during the day. Conclusions: This study has identified trucks, forklifts, pallets, crates, drivers' and catchers' boots as potential sources of C. jejuni for broilers. Significance and Impact of the Study: Campylobacter jejuni contamination of broiler processing plant fomites was found to be extensive ranging from 31 % for <b>truck</b> <b>beds</b> to 75 % for pallets. The proportion of contaminated fomites was observed to be similar throughout the day. The impact of contaminated fomites as sources of colonization of broilers with C. jejuni is discussed...|$|R

As these flat beds usually slope gradually to the rear, unlike the level bed of a cargo flatbed, they are known as 'beavertails'. Some tow <b>truck</b> <b>beds</b> are demountable and may be lowered behind the truck for easy loading, then both bed and load winched back aboard as one.|$|R
