5|$|The direct {{participation}} of the royal and viceroyal figures in areas of governance is limited. In practice, {{their use of the}} executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau), the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus {{one of the most powerful}} institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> in check.|$|E

25|$|Periphery {{countries}} are continuously exploited by countries {{due to the}} exportation of surpluses of raw goods to the more technologically industrialized core countries for manufacturing and distribution. Recently some of the manufacturing has been moved to periphery countries {{but it is still}} controlled and owned by the core countries. There are, however, ways in which periphery countries can rise from their poor status and become semi-periphery countries or even core countries. It is crucial for <b>the</b> core countries <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> exploiting <b>the</b> natural resources of the periphery countries and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> semi-stable or else it could cause economic unrest for the core countries as a whole.|$|R
25|$|The direct {{participation}} of the royal and viceroyal figures {{in any of these}} areas of governance is limited, though; in practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Executive Council, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the unicameral, elected House of Assembly and chosen and headed by the Premier of Nova Scotia (presently Stephen McNeil), the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the lieutenant governor will usually appoint as premier the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Assembly.

25|$|With independence, {{the office}} of Chief Minister was renamed Prime Minister, but its {{functions}} were substantially unchanged. Mara retained power in the first post-independence election of 1972. Internal divisions within the ethnic Fijian electorate led to the narrow defeat of his Alliance Party by the Indo-Fijian dominated National Federation Party (NFP) in the election of March 1977. He tendered his resignation as Prime Minister, but the NFP splintered three days later in a leadership dispute, and a constitutional crisis developed. The official representative of Queen Elizabeth, Governor-General Ratu Sir George Cakobau, ended up calling on Mara {{to form a new}} government. Although unquestionably constitutional, the Governor-General's actions were controversial. Many Indo-Fijians were outraged at what they saw as a deliberate cynical move on his part <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Ratu Mara, his fellow-chief (and distant cousin) in power at all costs. A subsequent election to resolve the impasse in September that year, however, appeared to vindicate Cakobau, when the Alliance Party won a record 36 seats out of 52.|$|E
500|$|In September 1869, {{financial}} manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up {{an elaborate}} scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold {{at the same time}} to drive up the price. The plan was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> from selling gold, thus driving its price. [...] President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $4million in gold on (Black) Friday, September 23. [...] Gould and Fisk were thwarted, and the price of gold dropped. The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous. Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped, devastating farmers for years.|$|E

500|$|On 2 March 1835 Emperor Francis died, {{succeeded by}} his epileptic son Ferdinand I. Despite {{widespread}} opinion that Ferdinand was a [...] "ghost of a monarch", Metternich valued legitimacy highly and worked <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> running. He soon accompanied Ferdinand {{on his first}} meeting with Tsar Nicholas and the King of Prussia, again at Teplitz. Ferdinand was overwhelmed, especially as the delegations paraded into Prague. Overall, however, it was an untroubled meeting. The next few years passed relatively peacefully for Metternich: diplomatic incident was limited to the occasional angry exchange with Palmerston and Metternich's failure to be a mediator between the British and Russians over their Black Sea dispute. He also put effort into bringing new technology like the railways into Austria. The most pressing issue was Hungary, where Metternich remained reluctant to support the centrist (but still nationalist) Széchenyi. His hesitancy is [...] "a sad commentary on his declining powers of political presence". At court Metternich increasingly lost power to the rising star Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky, particularly in his proposals to increase military budgets. After his failed attempt in 1836 to force constitutional reform (which would have afforded him greater influence)—largely thwarted by the more liberally minded Archduke John—Metternich was forced to share more power with Kolowrat and Archduke Ludwig as part of Austria's Secret State Conference. Decision making ground to a halt. Entertaining and maintaining his estates at Johannisberg, Königswart and Plasy (together with Mariánská Týnice) were consuming much of his resources {{at a time when he}} had four young children to support, causing him more stress.|$|E
2500|$|Ferdinand was his parents' third son, his {{elder brother}} Charles was {{expected}} to inherit Naples and Sicily. When his father ascended the Spanish throne in 1759 he abdicated Naples in [...] Ferdinand's favor {{in accordance with the}} treaties forbidding the union of the two crowns. A regency council presided over by the Tuscan Bernardo Tanucci was set up. The latter, an able, ambitious man, wishing <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> as much as possible in his own hands, purposely neglected the young king's education, and encouraged him in his love of pleasure, his idleness and his excessive devotion to outdoor sports.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{distrust}} of the King and Crown Prince and the loathing of Queen Augusta, Bismarck soon acquired a powerful hold over the King by force of personality and powers of persuasion. Bismarck was intent on maintaining royal supremacy by ending the budget deadlock in the King's favour, {{even if he had}} to use extralegal means to do so. Under the Constitution, the budget could be passed only after the king and legislature agreed on its terms. Bismarck contended that since the Constitution did not provide for cases in which legislators failed to approve a budget, there was a [...] "legal loophole" [...] in the Constitution and so he could apply the previous year's budget <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> running. Thus, {{on the basis of the}} 1861 budget, tax collection continued for four years.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries. The Blitzkrieg (Lightning War) tactics {{took the}} Western powers by surprise. By {{the time of}} the {{resignation}} of the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud on 16 June, it was obvious that Germany victory in the Battle of France was inevitable. In the Channel Islands, civilians worried about the consequences of remaining on the Islands but, to avoid panic, were told by the authorities to stay put. Senior officials were ordered to stay in order to maintain order and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> functioning. On the 15 June, the British government decided to demilitarise the Islands, evacuating the British garrisons and leaving them undefended. The Germans were not informed however. [...] Evacuation boats for civilians only became available on 20 June and again, to stop a panic, people were still told to remain where they were and that only women and children should be taken. Only when the Lieutenant Governors of the islands evacuated were the recommendation relaxed. The last official ships sailed on 23 June.|$|E
2500|$|The opium {{trade has}} been a {{continuing}} source of financing for the Taliban. Taliban insurgents force farmers to grow opium poppies to fund their operations. [...] Daud was recently quoted as saying, [...] ""The Taliban have forged an alliance with drug smugglers, providing protection for drug convoys and mounting attacks <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> away and the poppy flourishing." [...] General Mohammad Daud was further quoted in The New Yorker about this alliance, saying, [...] "There {{has been a}} coalition between the Taliban and the opium smugglers. This year, they {{have set up a}} commission to tax the harvest." [...] In return, he said, the Taliban had offered opium farmers protection from the government's eradication efforts. The switch in strategy has an obvious logic: it provides opium money for the Taliban to sustain itself and helps it to win over the farming communities. [...] In a continued effort to curb the opium trade in Afghanistan Mohammed Duad reported in June 2008 that police in Kabul set fire to 7.5 tonnes of narcotics. In April 2009, the Afghan anti-drug officers burned more than six-and-a-half tons of seized heroin, opium, hashish and drug-manufacturing chemicals worth up to £70 million on the UK market. [...] "If we do not burn the drugs, thousands of others will become drug addicts", said Daud, deputy minister for counter narcotics at the Interior Ministry. By burning this amount of opium and narcotics we show the people we are committed to the fight against drugs." ...|$|E

He played little part in <b>the</b> Greenway <b>government's</b> anti-bilingualism legislation (which resulted in the Manitoba Schools Question), though he dutifully signed it into law on March 1, 1890, following Macdonald's orders. Schultz subsequently sought concessions for francophone schools.|$|R
50|$|Gunning {{entered the}} {{diplomatic}} service, and on 23 November 1765 was appointed minister resident {{at the court}} of Denmark, where he arrived in April of the following year. His instructions were to assist the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, Walter Titley, and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> British <b>government</b> well informed of passing events. He seems to have performed his duties with regularity, tact, and ability, and {{on the death of}} Titley (27 Feb. 1768) he succeeded to the post of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary.|$|R
30|$|Because of the {{economic}} crises and in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> jobs, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> pushed for training and retraining of the workforce. For those who were made redundant or who wanted a change in mid-career the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) has been developing training for mid-career switches to various sectors, including the early childhood sector.

60|$|But {{with this}} last thought rose the presentiment of some plot {{to restore the}} Medici; and then again she felt that the popular party was half {{justified}} in its fierce suspicion. Again she felt that <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> of Florence pure, and to keep out a vicious rule, was a sacred cause; the Frate was right there, and had carried her understanding irrevocably with him. But at this moment the assent of her understanding went alone; it was given unwillingly. Her heart was recoiling from a right allied to so much narrowness; a right apparently entailing that hard systematic judgment of men which measures them by assents and denials quite superficial to the manhood within them. Her affection and respect were clinging with new tenacity to her godfather, and with him to those memories of her father which {{were in the same}} opposition to the division of men into sheep and goats by the easy mark of some political or religious symbol.|$|E
60|$|Finding this {{condition}} of things, and believing {{it to be}} an imperative duty upon the incoming executive to prevent, if possible, the consummation of such attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice of means to that end became indispensable. This choice was made and was declared in the inaugural address. The policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any stronger ones. It sought only to hold the public places and property not already wrested from the government, and to collect the revenue, relying for the rest on time, discussion, and the ballot-box. It promised a continuance of the mails, at government expense, to the very people who were resisting the government; and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the people, or any of their rights. Of all that which a President might constitutionally and justifiably do in such a case, everything was forborne without which it was believed possible <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> on foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Stenson is {{scarcely}} fair to me," [...] she complained. [...] "I did not presume to criticise his statesmanship, only {{there are some}} things here which seem pitiful. England should be the ideal democracy of the world. Your laws admit of it, your Government admits of it. Neither birth nor money are indispensable to success. The way is open for the working man to pass even to the Cabinet. And you are nothing of the sort. The cause of the people is not in any country so shamefully and badly represented. You have a bourgeoisie which maintains itself in almost feudal luxury by means of the labour which it employs, and that labour is content to squeak and open its mouth for worms, when it should have the finest fruits of the world. And all this is for want of leadership. Up you come you David Sands, you Phineas Crosses, you Nicholas Fenns, you Thomas Evanses. You each think that you represent Labour, but you don't. You represent trade--the workers at one trade. How they laugh at you, the men who like <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of this country in their own possession! They stretch down a hand to the one who has climbed the highest, they pull him up into the Government, and after that Labour is well quit of him. He has found his place with the gods. Perhaps they will make him a `Sir' and his wife a `Lady,' but for him it is all over with the Cause. And so another ten years is wasted, while another man grows up to take his place." ...|$|E
50|$|MITI {{was created}} with the split of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in May 1949 {{and given the}} mission for {{coordinating}} international trade policy with other groups, such as the Bank of Japan, the Economic planning Agency, and the various commerce-related cabinet ministries.

50|$|During the {{presidency}} of Porfirio Díaz, documents conveyed from the U.S. Consulate in Mexico kept the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. informed about Mexican affairs. The Secretary of State told President Taft of the buildup to possible regime change in Mexico, when Díaz was unable to control rebellions in various areas of Mexico. Initially, Taft {{did not want to}} intervene but wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Díaz <b>government</b> in power to prevent problems with business relations between the two countries, such as the sales of oil between Mexico and the United States.|$|R
60|$|But {{there are}} also cases in which, though not averse {{to a form of}} government--possibly even {{desiring}} it--a people may be unwilling or unable to fulfill its conditions. They may be incapable of fulfilling such of them as are necessary <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> even in nominal existence. Thus a people may prefer a free government; but if, from indolence, or carelessness, or cowardice, or want of public spirit, they are unequal to the exertions necessary for preserving it; if they will not fight for it when it is directly attacked; if they can be deluded by the artifices used to cheat them out of it; if, by momentary discouragement, or temporary panic, or a fit of enthusiasm for an individual, they can be induced to lay their liberties at the feet even of a great man, or trust him with powers which enable him to subvert their institutions--in all these cases they are more or less unfit for liberty; and though it may be for their good to have had it even for a short time, they are unlikely long to enjoy it. Again, a people may be unwilling or unable to fulfill the duties which a particular form of government requires of them. A rude people, though in some degree alive to the benefits of civilized society, may be unable to practice the forbearances which it demands; their passions may be too violent, or their personal pride too exacting, to forego private conflict, and leave to the laws the avenging of their real or supposed wrongs. In such a case, a civilized government, to be really advantageous to them, will require to be in a considerable degree despotic; one over which they do not themselves exercise control, and which imposes a great amount of forcible restraint upon their actions. Again, a people must be considered unfit for more than a limited and qualified freedom who will not co-operate actively with the law and the public authorities in the repression of evil-doers. A people who are more disposed to shelter a criminal than to apprehend him; who, like the Hindoos, will perjure themselves to screen the man who has robbed them, rather than take trouble or expose themselves to vindictiveness by giving evidence against him; who, like some nations of Europe down to a recent date, if a man poniards another in the public street, pass by on the other side, because it is the business of the police to look to the matter, and it is safer not to interfere in what does not concern them; a people who are revolted by an execution, but not shocked at an assassination--require that the public authorities should be armed with much sterner powers of repression than elsewhere, since the first indispensable requisites of civilized life have nothing else to rest on. These deplorable states of feeling, in any people who have emerged from savage life, are, no doubt, usually the consequence of previous bad government, which has taught them to regard the law as made for other ends than their good, and its administrators as worse enemies than those who openly violate it. But, however little blame may be due to those in whom these mental habits have grown up, and however the habits may be ultimately conquerable by better government, yet, while they exist, a people so disposed can not be governed with as little power exercised over them as a people whose sympathies are {{on the side of the}} law, and who are willing to give active assistance in its enforcement. Again, representative institutions are of little value, and may be a mere instrument of tyranny or intrigue, when the generality of electors are not sufficiently interested in their own government to give their vote, or, if they vote at all, do not bestow their suffrages on public grounds, but sell them for money, or vote at the beck of some one who has control over them, or whom for private reasons they desire to propitiate. Popular election thus practiced, instead of a security against misgovernment, is but an additional wheel in its machinery.|$|E
