5|$|The lengthy German defence {{during the}} Battle of Narva denied the Soviets {{the use of}} Estonia as a {{favorable}} base for amphibious invasions and air attacks against Helsinki and other Finnish cities. Stavka's hopes of assaulting Finland from Estonia and forcing it into capitulation were diminished. Finnish Chief of Defence Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim repeatedly reminded the German side that in the event their troops in Estonia retreated, Finland {{would be forced to}} make peace even on extremely unfavourable terms. Thus, the prolonged Battle of Narva helped Finland avoid a Soviet occupation, sustained its capacity for resistance and enabled them to enter negotiations for the Moscow Armistice on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Galland {{was summoned}} to Karinhall on 18 August 1940, and missed the intense air battle that day, known as The Hardest Day. During the meeting, Göring insisted that, in combat, Bf 109 fighters escort Bf 110s, which could not survive against {{single-engine}} fighters. As high-scoring aces, both Galland and Mölders shared their concerns that close escort of Bf 110s and bombers robbed fighter pilots of their freedom to roam and engage the enemy on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> They also pointed {{to the fact that}} German bombers flew at medium altitudes and low speed, the best height area and speed for the manoeuvrability of the Spitfire. Galland resented his pilots having to carry out a task unsuited to their equipment but Göring would not move from his position.|$|E

Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir Freerunning and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.|$|E
25|$|Encouragement {{came from}} many directions. In 1919, the League of Nations was founded. Here many nations lobbied for sovereignty, {{including}} the Wafdist tafwid (delegation) of Egypt. Turkey under Ataturk rejected the Verssailes borders and fought successfully {{to establish their}} national independence on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> The Bolshevik revolution in Russia had resulted in a new state power which angrily confronted the international order, and began to organized and fund subversive groups in order to overthrow existing regimes.

5000|$|In a 30 May 2006 media communique {{entitled}} Sunday Herald's Linguistics Gymnastics, Honest ReportingUK {{addressed the}} use of the word hafrada by Sunday Herald editor David Pratt. It stated that, [...] "just a cursory glance at a Hebrew-English dictionary reveals that the term 'Hafrada' does not literally mean 'apartheid'. Also, as a concept, 'Hafrada' has certainly not entered the Israeli lexicon, but rather, the term 'Geder Hafrada' ('Separation Fence') referring to Israel's security barrier. Thus, Pratt deliberately and dishonestly claims that Israelis have begun to privately use <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> for [...] "apartheid" [...] while inaccurately stating that Israel's security barrier and the apartheid ideology are one and the same." ...|$|R
500|$|Both Weber and Georg Simmel {{pioneered the}} [...] "Verstehen" [...] (or 'interpretative') method in social science; a {{systematic}} {{process by which}} an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> and from their own point of view. Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the phenomenological and existential writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality. His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?' ...|$|E

She dies grief-stricken by the edge of the river after she is unable to retrieve her children and it is claimed that she can be heard wailing for them in the sound of the wind and water. These entities, from the gentle and pure Virgen de Guadalupe, to the violated and treacherous la Malinche, to the eternally grieving la Llorona give rise to a [...] "fragmentary subjectivity" [...] often experienced by Chicanas, and their need {{to come to terms with}} them, renegotiate them on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> or reject them altogether.|$|E
