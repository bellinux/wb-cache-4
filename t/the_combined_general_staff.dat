40|$|Este Trabalho de Investigação Individual é o culminar do Curso de Estado-Maior Conjunto, cujo objetivo foi descobrir como as FFSS percecionam os novos fenómenos de violência urbana perpetrados pelas redes sociais. Com recurso ao método científico, Estudo de Caso, assumimos uma abordagem do tipo qualitativa apoiada na pesquisa bibliográfica, complementada com entrevistas semiestruturadas a personalidades especializadas na área. Concluiu-se que os fenómenos designados meets, não representam uma ameaça, mas deverá existir legislação específica que regule o uso e utilização da internet, e que, em casos de publicação de declarações ou apelos à violência que atentem contra a ordem e tranquilidade pública, possibilite a monitorização pelas autoridades. Confirmamos que as forças de segurança estão atentas, e acompanham de perto esta nova forma de comunicar e a sua capacidade de mobilização. Contudo, devido a limitações legais de atuação no ciberespaço, percecionam algumas dificuldades ao nível da prevenção e/ou intervenção. Abstract: This {{individual}} research paper is {{the culmination of}} <b>the</b> <b>Combined</b> <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> Course and is aimed to better understand how Security Forces perceive the new phenomena of urban violence, in particular those connected to the social networks. By using the Case Study scientific method, we adopted a qualitative approach, also based on bibliographic research, which was complemented with semi-structured interviews with personalities specialized in the area. We concluded that the so-called meet phenomena do not represent a threat. Nevertheless, there should be specific legislation on the use of Internet, where any statement or call for violence, which may threaten public order and tranquillity, allows authorities to monitor. We also confirmed that security forces are on alert and closely monitor this new way to communicate and mobilise. However, due to law enforcement limitations in fighting cybercrime, there are some difficulties in the prevention and/or intervention...|$|E

The aim is to study the attenuation of physiological changes that are associated with laparoscopic surgeries by regional (epidural) analgesia when <b>combined</b> with <b>general</b> anaesthesia to compare the intraoperative variables after administering <b>general</b> anaesthesia and <b>combined</b> <b>general</b> anaesthesia with regional analgesia (epidural) in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgeries. Our aim is to compare the requirement of anaesthetic drugs between patients receiving only general anaesthesia and those receiving general anaesthesia with epidural analgesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred patients posted for laparoscopic abdominal surgeries were enrolled in this randomised controlled trial. They were randomly selected to undergo <b>general</b> anaesthesia or <b>combined</b> <b>general</b> anaesthesia with regional analgesia. Monitoring was done for heart rate, blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and awareness during anaesthesia. RESULTS Cardiovascular stability (heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure) was satisfactory in the intraoperative period in both the groups. The anaesthetic and analgesic drugs required were significantly lower in <b>the</b> <b>combined</b> <b>general</b> anaesthesia-regional analgesia group as compared to patients receiving only <b>general</b> anaesthesia. CONCLUSION <b>The</b> <b>combined</b> <b>general</b> anaesthesia-regional analgesia group has the advantage of more cardiovascular stability, lower requirement of analgesics and general anaesthetic agents/drugs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{state of}} energy (SoE) of Li-ion {{batteries}} {{is a critical}} index for the remainder range forecasting, energy optimization and management. The paper attempts to make three contributions. (1) The definition of SoE is proposed and elaborated, which includes the output energy of battery, the internal resistance heating and the energy consumed on the electrochemical reactions. Based on this definition, the new mathematical model of estimating SoE is built, which can realize the real-time estimation of SoE. (2) Based on <b>the</b> <b>combined</b> <b>general</b> battery model, <b>the</b> recursive least square (RLS) method with an optimal forgetting factor is used to identify the model parameters. The parameter identification results are obtained at relative SoE points, and the verification {{results indicate that the}} proposed battery model is accurate enough to simulate the battery characteristics. (3) Based on the SoE mathematical model and <b>the</b> <b>combined</b> <b>general</b> battery model, <b>the</b> extended Kalman filter (EKF) is built to estimate the SoE online. The simulation results show that the EKF-based SoE estimator performs well even under different incorrect initial SoE...|$|R

However, a complete compendium of all RR-Lyraes in the solar neighbourhood with accurate classifications and coordinates does not exist to this day.

The Tycho 2 catalogue contains ≃ 100 RR Lyr stars.

40|$|Most of the {{available}} results on optimal block designs for diallel crosses are based on stan-dard linear model assumptions where <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>combining</b> ability effects are taken as fixed. In many practical situations, this assumption may not be tenable since often one studies only a sample of inbred lines from a possibly large (hypothetical) population. Recently Ghosh and Das (2003) proposed a random effects model and then estimated the variance components and the variances of these estimates. While comparing the yielding capacities of the cross (i, j), Kempthorne and Curnow (1961) have proposed the estimation of the yielding capacity of any cross based on the least square estimators of <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>combining</b> ability effects and/or the mean yield of the cross (i, j).

50|$|CM Draconis (GJ 630.1A) is an {{eclipsing binary}} system {{approximately}} 47 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Draco (the Dragon). The system consists of two nearly identical red dwarf stars located in the constellation Draco. The two stars orbit {{each other with a}} period of 1.27 days with a separation of 2.7 million kilometres (0.018 AU). Along with two stars in the triple system KOI 126, the stars in CM Draconis are the lightest stars with precisely measured masses and radii. Consequently, the system {{plays an important role in}} testing stellar structure models for very low mass stars. These comparisons find that models underpredict the stellar radii by approximately 5%. This is attributed to consequences of the stars' strong magnetic activity. According to the system's entry in <b>the</b> <b>Combined</b> <b>General</b> Catalogue of Variable Stars, at least one of the components is a flare star and at least one is a BY Draconis variable. The white dwarf star GJ 630.1B, located 25.7 arcseconds away shares the same proper motion as the CM Draconis stars and is thus a true companion star of the system. Given the system's distance of 47 light years, this corresponds to a separation of at least 370 astronomical units between CM Draconis and GJ 630.1B.|$|R
