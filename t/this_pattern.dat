In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. <b>This</b> <b>pattern,</b> in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|Some have {{suggested}} the syndrome {{may be an}} inability by beekeepers to correctly identify known diseases such as European foulbrood or the microsporidian fungus Nosema apis.

40|$|Despite {{differences}} in reef growth between the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea, a common distinctive pattern of polygonal sills surrounding ponded depressions consistently occurs in shallow water. Viewed from a satellite, these seafloors are reticulated and maze like.

This is a paradox since such fine-scale karstification is confined to areas with considerably more precipitation than currently observed in Arabia. We resolve this apparent contradiction by developing a Pleistocene–Holocene chronology of sea level and climate for the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf, and {{through the use of}} pattern analysis and computer simulation, reveal the mechanism of formation for these structures.
