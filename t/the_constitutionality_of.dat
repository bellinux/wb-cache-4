5|$|Early in the Act's {{enforcement}} history, the Supreme Court addressed <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> several provisions {{relating to}} voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966), the Court upheld <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school {{in which the}} predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in Puerto Rico. Although the Court had earlier held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, in Morgan the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such {{as the right to}} vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional. After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970).|$|E
