5|$|Dr. Paul Steiner (Bryant Haliday) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell (Ronald Allen) {{work on a}} {{projection}} device {{that enables them to}} transmit any object within a few miles of the machine. While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures they use it on always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E
5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil and sediment traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.|$|E
5|$|Transport in Cameroon {{is often}} difficult. Except for the several {{relatively}} good toll roads which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained {{and subject to}} inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred. Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers. Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders, and since 2005, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> intensified in the east as the Central African Republic has further destabilised.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} useful but {{computationally}} complex algorithms, {{there has been}} substantial research on creating and analyzing algorithms that approximate a solution. The knapsack problem, though NP-Hard, {{is one of a}} collection of algorithms that can still be approximated to any specified degree. This means that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> a polynomial time approximation scheme. To be exact, the knapsack problem has a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).|$|E
25|$|When {{just one}} {{chromosome}} (for any reason) remains lagging during congression, the spindle checkpoint machinery generates {{a delay in}} cell cycle progression: the cell is arrested, allowing time for repair mechanisms to solve the detected problem. After some time, if <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> not been solved, the cell will be targeted for apoptosis (programmed cell death), a safety mechanism to avoid the generation of aneuploidy, a situation which generally has dramatic consequences for the organism.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressant {{discontinuation}} {{symptoms were}} first reported with imipramine, the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), {{in the late}} 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs. As of 2001, at least 21 different antidepressants, covering all the major classes, were known to cause discontinuation syndromes. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> been poorly studied, {{and most of the}} literature has been case reports or small clinical studies; incidence is hard to determine and controversial.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} some {{problems}} using disc brakes with certain frame designs. Under hard braking, the front wheel can come out from the dropouts. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> occurred when the brake pads and dropouts are aligned so the brake reaction force tends to eject the wheel from the dropout. Under repeated hard braking, the axle moves in the dropout {{in a way that}} unscrews the quick release. Riders should make sure the skewers are properly tightened before riding. Forks that use different brake/dropout orientations or through-axles are not subject to this problem.|$|E
25|$|The TSP, in {{particular}} the Euclidean variant of <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>has</b> {{attracted the attention of}} researchers in cognitive psychology. It has been observed that humans are able to produce good quality solutions quickly. These results suggest that computer performance on the TSP may be improved by understanding and emulating the methods used by humans for these problems, and have also led to new insights into the mechanisms of human thought. The first issue of the Journal of Problem Solving was devoted to the topic of human performance on TSP, and a 2011 review listed dozens of papers on the subject.|$|E
25|$|The fully {{polynomial}} time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the knapsack problem {{takes advantage of}} the fact that the reason <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> no known {{polynomial time}} solutions is because the profits associated with the items are not restricted. If one rounds off some of the least significant digits of the profit values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/ε where ε is a bound on the correctness of the solution. This restriction then means that an algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time that is correct within a factor of (1-ε) of the optimal solution.|$|E

25|$|Small {{denomination}} {{currency and}} particularly coins are sometimes {{difficult to come}} by in Argentina, especially in Buenos Aires. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> developed to a stage in which some shop owners will not sell items if the transaction involves giving the purchaser change in coins. It has also been exacerbated by ATMs, which tend to give out only 100 peso notes, and by bus companies, some of which will take only coins in payment and sell these at a 5–10% markup {{on the black market}} rather than depositing them at banks. This situation has improved in the years following the Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002). Nowadays nearly all bus lines in Buenos Aires have a SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico; Unified Electronic Ticket System) smartcard reader, allowing passengers to pay electronically without coins.|$|E
25|$|The work on <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> been {{in terms}} of {{solutions}} in natural numbers (understood as the non-negative integers) rather than arbitrary integers. The two problems are equivalent: any general algorithm that can decide whether a given Diophantine equation has an integer solution could be modified into an algorithm that decides whether a given Diophantine equation has a natural number solution, and vice versa. This {{can be seen as}} follows: The requirement that solutions be natural numbers can be expressed with the help of Lagrange's four-square theorem: every natural number is the sum of the squares of four integers, so we simply replace every parameter with the sum of squares of four extra parameters. Similarly, since every integer can be written as the difference of two natural numbers, we can replace every parameter that ranges in integers with the difference of two parameters that range in natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} {{shortcomings}} {{in the original}} Line 21 specification from a typographic standpoint, since, for example, it lacked many of the characters required for captioning in languages other than English. Since that time, the core Line 21 character set has been expanded to include quite a few more characters, handling most requirements for languages common in North and South America such as French, Spanish, and Portuguese, though those extended characters are not required in all decoders and are thus unreliable in everyday use. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>has</b> been almost eliminated with a market specific full set of Western European characters and a private adopted Norpak extension for South Korean and Japanese markets. The full EIA-708 standard for digital television has worldwide character set support, {{but there has been}} little use of it due to EBU Teletext dominating DVB countries, which has its own extended character sets.|$|E
