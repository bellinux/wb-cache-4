5|$|A mutant who is {{friends with}} Bobby and Rogue, Pyro has anti-social tendencies {{because he is}} very angry at the general public for how <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> the mutant community. He {{has the ability to}} control (although not create) fire. He later joins Magneto and Mystique. The filmmakers cast Stanford in the role after they were {{impressed}} with his performance in Tadpole.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|His parents imbue {{him with}} a strong moral compass during his {{formative}} years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him as an outsider {{in the eyes of}} the other children. Because <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.|$|E
50|$|The Spaniards {{were taken}} into the city and given {{a tour of the}} palaces and pyramids. <b>They</b> were <b>treated</b> well and <b>they</b> <b>treated</b> the Maya there well. But there was tension after having {{recently}} lost a battle with Ekab soldiers.|$|R

5|$|One theory interprets Putana {{as being}} the first foe faced by Krishna (further {{numerous}} demons are sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna) or as the first obstacle of possessive maternal instinct faced by yogis. The legend assures a devotee liberation if <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> god as their own son. Another theory interprets Putana as an infantile disease that Krishna survived, which can be cured by forcefully suckling the child affected. Further, the theory relates to Krishna's later life when he fights a demon called Jvara (fever).|$|E
5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's love {{interest}} is Destiny (Canis selfabsorbedb*tchicus), an Afghan hound. However, Destiny {{has no interest}} in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary (Tony Way), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot understand what Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (Felis retardicus), an idiotic cat to whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (Aves aggravaticus), a pigeon who likes to revel in the misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of all humans and foxes for the way <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> birds. Lastly, there is Vince, Nelson's older brother (Vulpus c***itcus), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one swear word that is always bleeped over.|$|E

5|$|After {{several days}} of {{trekking}} through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group is initially greeted with hostility and learns that the filmmakers caused great unrest among the people. Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the Ya̧nomamö and the Shamatari. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank, where they save a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from death. The Ya̧nomamö invite Monroe and his team back to their village in gratitude, yet <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> the outsiders with suspicion. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river. A group of Ya̧nomamö women emerge from the riverbank {{to take him to}} a shrine, where he discovers the rotting remains of the filmmakers. Angered, he confronts the Ya̧nomamö in the village, during which time he plays a tape recorder. The intrigued natives agree to trade it for the filmmakers's surviving reels of film during a cannibalistic ceremony, in which Monroe must take part.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E

25|$|Although Minnan is the {{mainstream}} Southern Min language and is spoken in Teochew speaking region's closest neighbour, Southern Fujian towards the northeast, most Teochew {{people do not}} speak it and the majority see themselves as a distinct group from their mainstream counterparts in their neighbouring Southern Fujian. Most can at least understand Minnan marginally and <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> Minnan as an improper form of their own tongue. However, there are a minority group of Teochew people who speak Minnan exclusively, {{most of whom have}} had relatives and close contacts with their mainstream counterparts from their neighbouring Southern Fujian. For these Minnan speaking Teochews, Minnan is highly considered as their native language as well and <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> their hometown language as a merely accented form of Minnan. They usually have a strong sense of identity as Hoklo Minnan people and they integrate easily into {{the mainstream}} Southern Min culture.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} or models seeking to explain the causes (etiology) of mental disorders. These theories may differ in regards to how they explain the cause of the disorder, how <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> the disorder, and their basic classification of mental disorders. There may also be differences in philosophy of mind regarding whether, or how, the mind is considered separately from the brain.|$|E
25|$|Llamas, {{which are}} well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning, are very {{friendly}} and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become {{extremely difficult to}} handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.|$|E

25|$|They can be {{difficult}} pets to care for, requiring regular attention and a very specific diet of grasses and hay. Each year, they go into a period called rut that can last for several months, in which their personalities can drastically change, often becoming defensive or even aggressive. Despite their needs, prairie dogs are very social animals and come to seem as though <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> humans as members of their colony, answering barks and chirps, and even coming when called by name.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the same}} level playing field one {{group of people who}} treat each other well will create a {{pleasant}} environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> each other. Writer Dawn Eden suggests that this is a simple truth which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.|$|E
25|$|The shot of Petersen {{running along}} the top of the {{dividers}} between the terminal's moving sidewalk at the Los Angeles International Airport got the filmmakers into trouble with the airport police. The airport had prohibited this action, mainly for Petersen's safety, as they felt that their insurance would not have covered him had he hurt himself. The actor told Friedkin that they should do the stunt anyway so the director proposed that <b>they</b> <b>treat</b> it like a rehearsal but have the cameras rolling and shoot the scene, angering airport officials.|$|E
