2500|$|A {{typewriter}} is {{a mechanical}} or electromechanical machine for writing characters {{similar to those}} produced by printer's movable type. A typewriter operates by means of keys that strike a ribbon to transmit ink or carbon impressions onto paper. Typically, a single character is printed on each key press. The machine prints characters by making ink impressions of type elements similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing. [...] At {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, the term typewriter was also applied to a person who used a <b>typing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{ladder of}} ascent in this tower {{is of course}} the lift, or, as it is called, the {{elevator}}. With all that we hear of American hustle and hurry it is rather strange that Americans seem to like {{more than we do}} to linger upon long words. And indeed {{there is an element of}} delay in their diction and spirit, very little understood, which I may discuss elsewhere. Anyhow they say elevator when we say lift, just as they say automobile when we say motor and stenographer when we say typist, or sometimes (by a slight confusion) typewriter. Which reminds me of another story that never existed, about a man who was accused of having murdered and dismembered his secretary when he had only taken his <b>typing</b> <b>machine</b> to pieces; but we must not dwell on these digressions. The Americans may have another reason for giving long and ceremonious titles to the lift. When first I came among them I had a suspicion that they possessed and practised a new and secret religion, which was the cult of the elevator. I fancied they worshipped the lift, or at any rate worshipped in the lift. The details or data of this suspicion it were now vain to collect, as I have regretfully abandoned it, except in so far as they illustrate the social principles underlying the structural plan of the building. Now an American gentleman invariably takes off his hat in the lift. He does not take off his hat in the hotel, even if it is crowded with ladies. But he always so salutes a lady in the elevator; and this marks the difference of atmosphere. The lift is a room, but the hotel is a street. But during my first delusion, of course, I assumed that he uncovered in this tiny temple merely because he was in church. There is something about the very word elevator that expresses a great deal of his vague but idealistic religion. Perhaps that flying chapel will eventually be ritualistically decorated like a chapel; possibly with a symbolic scheme of wings. Perhaps a brief religious service will be held in the elevator as it ascends; in a few well-chosen words touching the Utmost for the Highest. Possibly he would consent even to call the elevator a lift, if he could call it an uplift. There would be no difficulty, except what I cannot but regard as the chief moral problem of all optimistic modernism. I mean the difficulty of imagining a lift which is free to go up, if it is not also free to go down.|$|E

50|$|Firpo was floored {{seven times}} {{in the first round}} of the bout, before he trapped Dempsey against the ropes and {{launched}} a combination that sent the champion out of the ring. Dempsey hit his head against a writer's <b>typing</b> <b>machine,</b> and for a moment, it looked as if Firpo would become world Heavyweight champion. But Dempsey was helped into the ring at the count of nine (in spite of having been seventeen seconds outside the ring; fighters are given a twenty-second count when they are knocked through the ropes) and he eventually knocked out Firpo in the second round. This fight has been regarded by critics and experts as one of the greatest fights in history. Boxing historian Bert Sugar called it the greatest fight in the history of the sport. Despite losing, Firpo gained substantial fame all over Latin America after this bout, as many people on different parts of that region spoke about his feat of dropping Dempsey. This fight remained so inspirational that, for instance, led to the naming of the Salvadorian football club C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo after him.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} aimed {{to find the}} optimum path of CNC turret typing system to reduce the {{changing}} tools times and optimize tool movement routes {{to make up for}} the deficiency of CNC Turret <b>Typing</b> <b>machine</b> production efficiency. An uncertainty polynomial model is raised based on the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. And genetic algorithm (GA) is used to solve the path optimization problem. The optimization of path can minimize the moving tools times. Furthermore, the optimization problem is simplified to shortest distance between points. Fitness function, selection operator, crossover operator, mutation operator and other genetic operations are studied in this paper. In addition, the greedy crossover operator, the elite preservation strategy and the self-adaption strategy are imported in GA, which enhance the ability of finding the optimum and speed the efficiency. Finally, MATLAB simulation testifies that the algorithm is valid. The experiment result shows that the GA can shorten processing time and can reduce the air travel effectively without changing the machine’s hardware through reasonable arrangement of the changing and moving tools path. As a result, the efficiency and precision of CNC turret typing system was improved availably...|$|E
