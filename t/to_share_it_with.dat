5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, but looked unlikely to have any further children. Under Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory and not have <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> his brothers.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} after his arrival in Manila, Bravo de Acuña {{received}} Chiquiro, an envoy from Tokugawa Ieyasu (or Daifu Sama, as {{he was known to}} the Spanish), ruler of Japan. Ieyasu wanted to establish trade and friendship with New Spain, and asked for masters and workmen to be sent to Japan to build ships for that purpose and for a navy. Earlier, Viceroy Tello had sent Fray Geronimo de Jesús, a Franciscan, to negotiate a trade and friendship treaty with Ieyasu, and Geronimo had apparently promised Spanish help with these projects. Viceroy Bravo, however, was opposed. To begin with, the greatest security of the Philippines from Japanese attack had been their lack of ships and their ignorance of navigation. As often as the latter had intended to attack Manila, they had been prevented by this obstacle. Secondly, the Philippines had a monopoly on trade between Asia and New Spain (and beyond that, to Spain). The economy of the occupiers was based largely on this trade, and Bravo was not anxious <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Japan.|$|E

50|$|Hye-Kyung Lee, a {{lecturer}} at King's College London, states that anime fansubber embody the general characteristics of fans described by John Fiske; fansubbers {{are motivated by}} strong affection for anime, devotion <b>to</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> other fans, {{the sense of community}} interaction with their viewers, working together {{as a member of a}} group, and a strong desire to support the local animation industry by promoting anime culture and widening anime's accessibility. Lee describes fansubbers as involved in productive activities that enhance their knowledge of anime and improve their skills culminating in a final product. The goal of the first anime club, Cartoon Fantasy Organization, and its subsequent chapters was to proselytize and promote anime. Sean Leonard and Lee agree that without fan distribution that began in 1976 till fansubbing 1993, the anime industry would not take off as it did in the 1990s. Some companies such as Protoculture Addicts with its titular magazine and Viz Media with Animerica drew their origins from anime club fanzines in the early history of fansubs.|$|R

25|$|Within various Native American communities, gender {{plays an}} {{important}} role in music. Men and women play sex-specific roles in many musical activities. Instruments, songs and dances are often peculiar to one or the other sex, and many musical settings are strictly controlled by sex. In modern powwows, women play a vital role as backup singers and dancers. The Cherokee people, for example, hold dances before stickball games. At these pre-game events, men and women perform separate dances and follow separate regulations. Men will dance in a circle around a fire, while women dance in place. Men sing their own songs, while women have their songs sung for them by an elder. Whereas the men's songs invoke power, the women's songs draw power away from the opposing stickball team. In some societies, there are customs where certain ceremonial drums are to be played by men only. For the Southern Plains Indians, it is believed that the first drum was given to a woman by the Great Spirit, who instructed her <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> all women of native nations. However, there also exist prohibitions against women sitting at the Beg Drum.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 2009, Blair was {{selected}} by the San Antonio Spurs with 37th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. His stock fell because of questions surrounding his durability and knee surgeries. On July 17, he signed a four-year deal with the Spurs. In his first NBA game, he posted a double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds in 23 minutes against the New Orleans Hornets on October 28, thus becoming just the third Spurs rookie, along with David Robinson and Tim Duncan, to record a double-double in his debut with the team. He later recorded 28 points and 21 rebounds in 31 minutes against the Oklahoma City Thunder on January 13, 2010, becoming first NBA rookie since Tim Duncan in the 1997–98 season to post a 20-20 game. In the team's final regular season game, he recorded 27 points, a season-high 23 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in 37 minutes against the Dallas Mavericks on April 14, becoming the first rookie since Joe Smith in 1995–96 to post two 20-20 games in the same season. Blair also participated in the 2010 Rookie Challenge, where he recorded 22 points and 23 rebounds. Sacramento Kings guard Tyreke Evans won the game MVP award, but graciously offered <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Blair. At the season's end, he {{was named to the}} NBA All-Rookie Second Team and was the only Spurs player to appear in all 82 regular season games. He started 23 games, averaging 7.8 points and 6.4 rebounds in 18.2 minutes per game. He was also the top-ranked rookie in field goal percentage (.556), and was second in rebounding. Blair helped the Spurs defeat the Mavericks 4–2 {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, only to then go on to lose 4–0 to the Phoenix Suns in the second round.|$|E

40|$|A {{critically}} {{important component of}} most signal processing procedures is that of computing the distance between signals. In multi-party processing applications where these signals belong to different parties, this introduces privacy challenges. The signals may themselves be private, and {{the parties to the}} computation may not be willing to expose them. Solutions proposed to the problem in the literature generally invoke homomorphic encryption schemes, secure multi-party computation, or other cryptographic methods which introduce significant computational complexity into the proceedings, often to the point of making more complex computations requiring repeated computations unfeasible. Other solutions invoke third parties, making unrealistic assumptions about their trustworthiness. In this paper we propose an alternate approach, also based on third party computation, but without assuming as much trust in the third party. Individual participants to the computation "secure" their data through a proposed secure hashing scheme with <b>shared</b> keys, prior <b>to</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the third party. The hashing ensures that the third party cannot recover any information about the individual signals or their statistics, either from analysis of individual computations or their long-term aggregate patterns. We provide theoretical proof of these properties and empirical demonstration of the feasibility of the computation...|$|R
