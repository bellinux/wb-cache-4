40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller (BELBIC) scheme for speed control of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive {{over a wide}} speed range. The speed control of IPMSM becomes a complex issue due to the nonlinear nature as well as coupling among its winding currents and the rotor speed particularly at high speeds. Therefore, in this paper a BELBIC is designed for simplicity and insensitivity to disturbances and ability to control the IPMSM in the whole speed range. The proposed BELBIC is designed based on maximum <b>torques</b> <b>per</b> ampere operation below the rated speed and the field weakening operation above the rated speed, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed BELBIC is investigated for a 40 kW IPMSM and simulated using MatLab/Simulink. The simulation results are compared to those obtained from the conventional PI controller based drive at various conditions such as: step change of command speed and load torque, the disconnection of one phase and parameter variations.

Using ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA) data the fluxes of angular momentum are evaluated {{as well as the}} mountain and friction <b>torques</b> <b>per</b> belt. Generalized streamfunctions and velocity potentials are introduced to better depict the fluxes related to the angular momentum transferred at the ground during an event of mountain or friction torque. The variance of the total flux divergence per belt is one order of magnitude larger than those of the torques. All variances peak at midlatitudes. As a rule, the structure of the generalized streamfunctions changes little during an event; that is, the structure of the nondivergent part of the fluxes is stable. That of the divergent part, as represented by the velocity potential, undergoes a rapid change near the peak of a torque event. Positive friction torque events in midlatitude belts are preceded by a divergence of angular momentum fluxes in that belt, which is linked to the anticyclonic mass circulation needed to induce the positive torque. The divergence in the belt breaks down shortly before the torque is strongest. Angular momentum is transported upward from the ground after that. Much of the angular momentum generated in a midlatitude belt by positive mountain torques is transported out of the domain, {{but there is also a}} short burst of upward transports.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} orbital and mass {{evolution}} of planets that undergo run-away gas accretion {{by means of}} 2 D and 3 D hydrodynamic simulations. The disk <b>torque</b> distribution <b>per</b> unit disk mass {{as a function of}} radius provides an important diagnostic for the nature of the disk-planet interactions. We first consider torque distributions for nonmigrating planets of fixed mass and show that there is general agreement with the expectations of resonance theory. We then present results of simulations for mass-gaining, migrating planets. For planets with an initial mass of 5 Earth masses, which are embedded in disks with standard parameters and which undergo run-away gas accretion to one Jupiter mass (Mjup), the <b>torque</b> distributions <b>per</b> unit disk mass are largely unaffected by migration and accretion for a given planet mass. The migration rates for these planets are in agreement with the predictions of the standard theory for planet migration (Type I and Type II migration). The planet mass growth occurs through gas capture within the planet's Bondi radius at lower planet masses, the Hill radius at intermediate planet masses, and through reduced accretion at higher planet masses due to gap formation. During run-away mass growth, a planet migrates inwards by only about 20 % in radius before achieving a mass of ~ 1 Mjup. For the above models, we find no evidence of fast migration driven by coorbital torques, known as Type III migration. We do find evidence of Type III migration for a fixed mass planet of Saturn's mass that is immersed in a cold and massive disk. In this case the planet migration is assumed to begin before gap formation completes. The migration is understood through a model in which the torque is due to an asymmetry in density between trapped gas on the leading side of the planet and ambient gas on the trailing side of the planet.

MSE is {{the measure of the}} amount of energy input required to remove a unit volume of rock, expressed in units of energy input divided by volume removed. It can be expressed mathematically in terms of controllable parameters; Weight on Bit, Torque, Rate of Penetration, and RPM. It is well documented that minimizing MSE by optimizing controllable factors results in maximum Rate of Penetration. Current methods for computing MSE make it possible to minimize MSE in the field only through a trial-and-error process. This work makes it possible to compute the optimum drilling parameters that result in minimum MSE. The parameters that have been traditionally used to compute MSE are interdependent. Mathematical relationships between the parameters were established, and the conventional MSE equation was rewritten in terms of a single parameter, Weight on Bit, establishing a form that can be minimized mathematically. Once the optimum Weight on Bit was determined, the interdependent relationship that Weight on Bit has with <b>Torque</b> and Penetration <b>per</b> Revolution was used to determine optimum values for those parameters for a given drilling situation.
