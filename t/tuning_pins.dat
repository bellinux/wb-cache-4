2500|$|The dulcimer {{comes in}} various sizes, {{identified}} {{by the number of}} strings that cross each of the bridges. A 15/14, for example, has 15 strings crossing the treble bridge and 14 crossing the bass bridge, and can span three octaves. The strings of a hammered dulcimer are usually found in pairs, two strings for each note (though some instruments have three or four strings per note). Each set of strings is tuned in unison and is called a course. As with a piano, the purpose of using multiple strings per course is to make the instrument louder, although as the courses are rarely in perfect unison, a chorus effect usually results like a mandolin. A hammered dulcimer, like an autoharp, harp, or piano, requires a tuning wrench for tuning, since the dulcimer's strings are wound around <b>tuning</b> <b>pins</b> with square heads. (Ordinarily, 5mm [...] "zither pins" [...] are used, similar to, but smaller in diameter than piano <b>tuning</b> <b>pins,</b> which come in various sizes ranging upwards from [...] "1/0" [...] or 7mm.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Each string {{is wound}} around a tuning pin, {{normally}} {{at the end}} of the string closer to the player. [...] When rotated with a wrench or tuning hammer, the tuning pin adjusts the tension so that the string sounds the correct pitch.

Proceeding from the tuning pin, a string next passes over the nut, a sharp edge that is made of hardwood and is normally attached to the wrestplank.

50|$|Unlike most socket {{wrenches}}, tuning wrenches {{usually have}} a comfortable wood or nylon handle. They are found in two basic shapes: L-shaped and T-shaped. L-shaped handles for pianos are available in several angles that are not quite right angles, provide greater leverage than T-shaped handles, and the angle provides clearance for the handle over adjacent pins, allowing a very short (and stiff) socket to be used. A short, stiff socket enables a better feel {{and control of the}} tiny movements of the <b>tuning</b> <b>pin,</b> within the pin-block. T-shaped handles are used for many lower-tension instruments such as the harpsichord, harp, and dulcimer. T-shaped handles help keep torque parallel to the shaft of the <b>tuning</b> <b>pin,</b> and thus avoid bending the pin and widening the wooden hole that holds the <b>tuning</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{design and}} ground test program was {{conducted}} to study {{the performance of the}} monofilar absorber for vibration reduction on a four-bladed helicopter. A monofilar is a centrifugal tuned two degree-of-freedom rotor hub absorber that provides force attenuation at two frequencies using the same dynamic mass. Linear and non-linear analyses of the coupled monofilar/airframe system were developed to study tuning and attenuation characteristics. Based on the analysis, a design was fabricated and impact bench tests verified the calculated non-rotating natural frequencies and mode shapes. Performance characteristics were measured using a rotating absorber test facility. These tests showed significant attenuation of fixed-system 4 P hub motions due to 3 P inplane rotating-system hub forces. In addition, detuning effects of the 3 P monofilar modal response were small due to the nonlinearities and <b>tuning</b> <b>pin</b> slippage. However, attenuation of 4 P hub motions due to 5 P inplane hub forces was poor. The performance of the 5 P monofilar modal response was degraded by torsional motion of the dynamic mass relative to the support arm which resulted in binding of the dynamic components. Analytical design studies were performed to evaluate this torsional motion problem. An alternative design is proposed which may alleviate the torsional motion of the dynamic mass...|$|R

5000|$|What made most {{models of}} the 'Pianette' so {{innovative}} was the positioning of the <b>tuning</b> <b>pins.</b> On {{any other type of}} piano, <b>tuning</b> <b>pins</b> are pounded into holes which are sufficiently, deliberately and exactly smaller than the pins so that a long-lasting tightness will keep them from sliding, no matter what force is put upon them while stretching the wires into tune. These holes are positioned beneath a metal soundboard and have a specified depth. On many {{models of the}} 'Pianette' minipiano, however, these <b>tuning</b> <b>pins</b> have to be longer so that they can emerge {{at the front of the}} instrument just below the keyboard. By allowing a wooden flap to fall positioned neatly beneath the keyboard, <b>tuning</b> <b>pins</b> are revealed at the front. These pins can be adjusted with a standard star-shaped piano wrench. The monochords used on the lowest 31 strings are relatively easy to tune. The bichords are somewhat more difficult but if the pins are still tight enough, they can be adjusted with slight movements of the wrench until the desired tone is reached. Unfortunately, however, this system which involved the use of specially made <b>tuning</b> <b>pins</b> specific to the minipiano, has proven to be its greatest problem to people attempting to salvage the instruments today. Although all pianos suffer to some degree from a natural loosening of these pins over time the minipiano is most highly criticized for the tendency of all the pins, especially those belonging to bichords, to loosen and slide much more quickly especially if they are not kept in a warm stable environment. [...] Although it is possible to access the <b>tuning</b> <b>pins</b> from the back as well, it is infinitely prefereable to be able to tune the minipiano from the front because in order to open the back one has to entirely detach the wooden lid, remove a whole set of metal rods, some screws above and across the wooden contraption holding the striking pad mechanism as well as two wooden rods attached to the pedals controlled by the player's feet. This is done to allow the central striking mechanism to pivot outwards on an axis pivoting on two large screws at the bottom of the wooden contraption. But before the wooden structure can pivot on the screws attaching it firmly to the instrument, two curved metallic 'handles' that connect two wooden bars passing horizontally just behind the row of metal rods have to be detached as well by the removing the screws holding them to the higher of the two bars. After this, the whole structure should gracefully pivot outwards, allowing access to both the piano wires and the <b>tuning</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|E

50|$|The endingidi {{is a type}} of bowed string {{instrument}} native to Uganda. The endingidi has one string, extending from the neck to a cylindrical sound-box or resonator made of wood or cow horn.A piece of hide is stretched {{over the top of the}} cylinder and is fixed to the sound-box with wooden pegs, thorny spines or nowadays also with metal nails. The hide used is usually that of the monitor lizard (varanus exanthematicus) but also of young goats and sheep or even of the python. The hide is soaked in water for a whole day before being stretched over the sound-box. The neck consists of a straight wooden stick inserted through the walls of the sound-box at about 2 to 3 cm from the top. At the top of the neck a hole is bored at 4 to 6 cm from the end into which a <b>tuning</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted vertically. The string is secured to this pin in such a way that the string can be wound round the pin in a similar way as with a violin. This allows the string to be tightened, so tuning the instrument. The string runs across the sound-box via a bridge and is fixed to the other end of the neck. The string is made of fibre or animal sinew, but nowadays it is more often of nylon. The arched bow consists of a thin flexible twig, to which a string is attached, usually of the same material as the string of the instrument itself. To give the bow more grip on the string of the instrument, resin is rubbed into the bow string. The resin is often attached to the side of the sound-box so the player can easily rub resin on the bow as he plays.|$|R

40|$|With {{sintered}} needles aligned and {{a magnetic}} field applied transverse to its easy axis, the rare-earth ferromagnet Nd$_ 2 $Fe$_{ 14 }$B becomes a room-temperature realization of the Random Field Ising Model. The transverse field <b>tunes</b> the <b>pinning</b> potential of the magnetic domains in a continuous fashion. We study the magnetic domain reversal and avalanche dynamics between liquid helium and room temperatures at a series of transverse fields using a Barkhausen noise technique. The avalanche size and energy distributions follow power-law behavior with a cutoff dependent on the pinning strength dialed in by the transverse field, consistent with theoretical predictions for Barkhausen avalanches in disordered materials. A scaling analysis reveals two regimes of behavior: one at low temperature and high transverse field, where the dynamics are governed by the randomness, and the second at high temperature and low transverse field where thermal fluctuations dominate the dynamics.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{the design of}} a compact, {{efficient}} and electronically tunable antenna is presented. A single-fed resonant slot loaded with a series of PIN diode switches constitute the fundamental structure of the antenna. The antenna tuning is realized by changing its effective electrical length, which is controlled by the bias voltages of the solid state shunt switches along the slot antenna. Although the design is based on a resonant configuration, an effective bandwidth of 1. 7 : 1 is obtained through this tuning without requiring a reconfigurable matching network. Four resonant frequencies from 540 – 890 MHz are selected in this bandwidth and very good matching is achieved for all resonant frequencies. Theoretical and experimental behavior of the antenna parameters is presented and it is demonstrated that the radiation pattern, efficiency and polarization state of the antenna remain essentially unaffected by the frequency tuning.

We show that the charge e/ 4 quasihole can be easily localized {{by means of a}} delta-function pinning potential. Using a <b>tuned</b> smooth <b>pinning</b> potential, the quasihole radius can be limited to approximately three magnetic length units. For systems of two quasiholes, adiabatic continuity between the Moore-Read and the Coulomb limit holds for the ground state, while for four quasiholes, the lowest two energy states exhibit adiabatic continuity. This implies the existence of a Majorana fermion for pure Coulomb interaction. We also present preliminary results in the Coulomb limit for braiding in systems containing four quasiholes, with up to 14 electrons, diagonalizing in the full spin-polarized sector of the second Landau-level Hilbert space.

The superconductor is described by London theory and the nanodisk by the Landau-Lifshitz continuum theory of magnetism, using the approximation known as the rigid vortex model. Pinning of the vortex line by the nanodisk is found to result, predominantly, from the {{interaction between}} the vortex line and the changes in the nanodisk magnetization induced by the magnetic field of the vortex line and applied field. In the context of the rigid vortex model, these changes result from the displacement of the magnetic vortex.

40|$|Following the ever-improving {{performance}} of data converters, {{the accuracy of}} the clock that is sampling the converter, needs to improveat the same pace. The clock accuracy is especially a problem for high-resolution, wide bandwidth converters. The aim of this project isto provide for a next-generation high-performance clock as a libraryblock for the Process & Library Technology Group of CTO (formerlyAMoS). This clock should provide a maximum output frequency of atleast 2 GHz with only a few ps of jitter while operating in a mixed-signal environment. Since the design is intended as a library block,boundary condi-tions are flexibility (for example tunability of theoutput frequency), robust-ness (for example to interference, varia-tions in PVT, etc.) and portability to new technologies. In the exi-sting PLL, the current-controlled oscillator (CCO) was identified asthe major opportunity for lowering the interval jitter of the PLL(i. e. the 1 /f 2 part of the phase noise of the output clock). Hence,this TN analyzes the use of an alterative oscillator based on an LC-tank. This LC-oscillator is based on an existing design by Nenad Pavlovic. It is designed in a 90 -nm CMOS technology. The analysis leadsto the following conclusions: the LC- oscillator is tunable from 4. 9 GHz to 6. 6 GHz. The high initial output frequency enables a sufficienttuning range at lower frequencies after division. Easy division ratiosenable synthesizing any frequency below 1. 68 GHz. The phase noise ofthe LC-oscillator is characterized by the number L=- 189 dBc/Hz. Assu-ming a PLL bandwidth of 1 MHz, the LC-oscillator would contribute only 0. 1 ps of interval jitter. This is about 60 times less than that of theringoscillator. Part of the improvement is due to a 10 times largerbias current; i. e. 2 mA. The major part of the improvement is due tothe quality factor of the LC-resonator. The non-linear varactor chara-cteristic causes up-conversion of noise and interference. Hence, the{{performance of}} the LC-oscillator is ultimately limited by the varactorquality. The tail current of the oscillator determines the oscillatorswing The oscillator swing,in its turn,averages the varactor value. As a consequence, the oscillator frequency can be tuned by varying the tail current. This tuning mechnanism allows for a straightforwardintegration of the LC-oscillator in the existing PLL architecture. The effect of supply noise and other interference is largest whenthey couple into the <b>tune</b> <b>pin</b> of the varactors. Since the oscillatoris referenced to ground, these pins as well need to be decoupled toground {{in order to keep the}} interference as a common-mode signal.
