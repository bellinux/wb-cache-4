Design: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of 503 Japanese patients who commenced on either tenofovir- or abacavir-based initial ART. Methods: The incidence of renal dysfunction, defined as more than 25 % fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the baseline, was determined in each group. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> on renal dysfunction was estimated by univariate and multivariate Cox hazards models as the primary exposure.

40|$|Introduction: Tenofovir is a {{commonly}} used component of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce vertical transmission of HIV. Although systematic review of tenofovir use in pregnancy concluded {{it to be}} low risk for foetal abnormalities (1), data is limited on its impact on renal function in pregnant women. A recent South African study (2) concluded that renal dysfunction in HIV-infected pregnant women is significantly less common than in other HIV-infected adults, however there is currently no UK data. We aimed to investigate <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> on renal function in HIV- 1 positive pregnant women in a UK clinic. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data on renal function in pregnancy from a cohort of women attending a busy inner city London antenatal clinic. All women were screened for renal function throughout pregnancy via serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) and corrected for ethnicity. Results: Ninety-seven HIV- 1 positive women were registered at Homerton Hospital antenatal service {{of a total of}} 105 pregnancies between January 2010 and September 2013. Tenofovir was prescribed in 71 / 105 pregnancies (67. 6 %). Of the 71 pregnancies, 41 were prescribed tenofovir pre-conception (57. 7 %). Of the pregnant women who started tenofovir in pregnancy, 21 / 31 (67. 7 %) were initiated before week 24 of pregnancy, in line with British HIV association (BHIVA) guidelines (3). There was no deterioration in median serum creatinine or decline in eGFR in women prescribed tenofovir during pregnancy. At six weeks after delivery, in the 42 women who continued tenofovir therapy and had eGFR measured, one woman had eGFR= 60, all others eGFR > 90 (Table 1). Conclusions: Consistent with current guidelines and experience, this study shows tenofovir did not cause decline in renal function in pregnancy in our cohort of HIV- 1 positive women, whether started during pre-conception or during pregnancy. More evidence should be prospectively collected looking at effects of tenofovir on other measures of tubular renal function in pregnancy such as proteinuria and protein-creatinine ratio...|$|E
40|$|In China, HIV- 1 -infected {{patients}} typically receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{that includes}} lamivudine (3 TC) as a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) (ART- 3 TC). Previous studies from certain developed countries have shown that, in ART- 3 TC, 3 TC-resistant HBV progressively emerges {{at an annual}} rate of 15 - 20 % in patients coinfected with HIV- 1 and HBV. This scenario in China warrants investigation because > 10 % of all HIV-infected patients in China are HBV carriers. We measured the occurrence of 3 TC-resistant HBV during ART- 3 TC for HIV-HBV coinfection and also tested <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil fumarate (TDF) used as an additional RTI (ART- 3 TC/TDF) in a cohort study in China. We obtained 200 plasma samples collected from 50 Chinese patients coinfected with HIV- 1 and HBV (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen) and examined them for the prevalence of 3 TC-resistant HBV by directly sequencing PCR products that covered the HBV reverse-transcriptase gene. We divided the patients into ART- 3 TC and ART- 3 TC/TDF groups and compared the efficacy of treatment and incidence of drug-resistance mutation between the groups. HIV RNA and HBV DNA loads drastically decreased in both ART- 3 TC and ART- 3 TC/TDF groups. In the ART- 3 TC group, HBV breakthrough or insufficient suppression of HBV DNA loads was observed in 20 % (10 / 50) of the patients after 96 -week treatment, and 8 of these patients harbored 3 TC-resistant mutants. By contrast, neither HBV breakthrough nor treatment failure was recorded in the ART- 3 TC/TDF group. All of the 3 TC-resistant HBV mutants emerged from the cases in which HBV DNA loads were high at baseline. Our results clearly demonstrated that ART- 3 TC is associated with the emergence of 3 TC-resistant HBV in patients coinfected with HIV- 1 and HBV and that ART- 3 TC/TDF reduces HBV DNA loads to an undetectable level. These findings support the use of TDF-based treatment regimens for patients coinfected with HIV- 1 and HBV...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Increased risk of {{fractures}} and osteoporosis {{have been}} {{associated with the use of}} antiretroviral drugs. There is a paucity of prospective evaluations of bone markers after the initiation of drugs currently recommended to treat HIV infection and results on the evolution of these markers are conflicting. Lastly, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> on 1, 25 -(OH) 2 vitamin D is uncertain. Methods We performed a prospective study on the evolution of bone markers, parathormone and 1, 25 -(OH) 2 vitamin D before and after standard antiretroviral regimens. This was a sub-study of a trial conducted in antiretroviral-naïve patients randomized to tenofovir + emtricitabine in combination with either atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) or efavirenz (EFV). Follow-up lasted 48 weeks. The following bone markers were analyzed: C-terminal cross-laps (CTx), osteocalcin (OC), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). Mixed-factorial analysis of variance with random-coefficient general linear model was used to compare their trends over time and linear multivariable regression was performed with a backward selection method to assess predictors of their variations from baseline to week 48. Trends of parathormone and 1, 25 -(OH) 2 vitamin D were also evaluated. Results Seventy-five patients were studied: 33 received EFV and 42 ATV/r. Significant increases were found for all markers except for RANKL. There was a significant direct association between CTx and OC increases. Multivariable analysis showed that higher glomerular filtration rate (estimated through cystatin C clearance) predicted greater OPG increase, while older age, higher HIV RNA at baseline and use of ATV/r predicted greater CTx increase. A significant increase of parathormone accompanied the evolution of the study markers. 1, 25 -(OH) 2 vitamin D remained stable, though a seasonality variation was demonstrated. Conclusions These data demonstrate CTx increase (bone resorption marker) corresponding to OC increase (bone formation marker) early upon HAART initiation. Moreover, predictors of bone marker increases have been suggested, possibly indicating that a stricter monitoring of bone health and pro-active interventions are needed in older patients, those with higher HIV RNA, prescribed ATV/r rather than EFV, and with decreased renal function at baseline. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms responsible for up-regulation of bone turnover markers, as well as to understand if and what markers are best correlated or predictive of pathological fractures. </p...|$|E

Current guidelines {{for the management of}} HIV infection recommend tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as a component of the preferred first-line combination antiretroviral therapy. The efficacy, tolerability, prolonged half-life allowing for once-daily administration, and availability as a component of several fixed-dose formulations make TDF an attractive choice for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients. TDF is also widely used as a component of postexposure prophylaxis in noninfected individuals. Most importantly, it has been recently approved for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis for noninfected adults and adolescents {{to reduce the risk of}} HIV transmission. With increasing use of TDF among adults and children, understanding of the potential for drug-associated side effects is important.

40|$|Brecanavir, a novel tyrosyl-based arylsulfonamide, high-affinity, human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) protease inhibitor (PI), has been evaluated for anti-HIV activity in several in vitro assays. Preclinical assessment of brecanavir indicated that this compound potently inhibited HIV- 1 in cell culture assays with 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50 s) of 0. 2 to 0. 53 nM and was equally active against HIV strains utilizing either the CXCR 4 or CCR 5 coreceptor, as was found with other PIs. The presence of up to 40 % human serum decreased the anti-HIV- 1 activity of brecanavir by 5. 2 -fold, but under these conditions the compound retained single-digit nanomolar EC 50 s. When brecanavir was tested in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, the antiviral activity of brecanavir was synergistic with <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> stavudine and additive to <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> zidovudine, <b>tenofovir,</b> dideoxycytidine, didanosine, adefovir, abacavir, lamivudine, and emtricitabine.

40|$|Abstract Background Each {{year more}} than two million people are newly {{infected}} with HIV worldwide, a majority of them through unprotected vaginal sex. More than half of new infections in adults occur in women. Male condoms and male circumcision reduce the risk of HIV acquisition; but the uptake of these methods is out of the control of women. We therefore aimed to determine the effectiveness of vaginal microbicides (a potential female-controlled method) for prevention of sexual acquisition of HIV in women. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and grey literature for publications of randomised controlled trials available by September 2012. We screened search outputs, selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data in duplicate; resolving differences by discussion and consensus. Results We identified 13 eligible trials that compared vaginal microbicides to placebo. These studies enrolled 35, 905 sexually active HIV-negative women between 1996 and 2011; in Benin, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, India, Thailand, and the United States of America. A small trial of 889 women found that tenofovir (a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor) significantly reduces the risk of HIV acquisition (risk ratio [RR] 0. 63, 95 % confidence intervals [CI] 0. 43 to 0. 93). Effectiveness data are not yet available from follow-up tenofovir trials being conducted in South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe (1 trial) and multiple sites in South Africa (1 trial). We found no evidence <b>of</b> a significant <b>effect</b> for nonoxynol- 9 (5 trials), cellulose sulphate (2 trials), SAVVY (2 trials), Carraguard (1 trial), PRO 2000 (2 trials), and BufferGel (1 trial) microbicides.

40|$|Evaluation of {{the switch}} to a dual ART regimen with {{lamivudine}} plus dolutegravir or protease inhibitors in HIV-infected virologically suppressed patients. A real life experience BACKGROUND: Little {{is known about the}} durability of dual treatments in HIV-infected virologically suppressed patients. We explored the combination of lamivudine (3 TC) + dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine + protease inhibitors (PI) as treatment options when switching from standard ART regimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 36 HIV-infected patients under a standard ART regimen. Inclusion criteria were: HIV-RNAq < 40 cp/ml for at least 6 months and absence of mutations in the resistance assay. A simplification regimen with 3 TC+DTG (13 pts; group A) or 3 TC+PI (23; group B) has been adopted. HIV-RNAq, CD 4, CD 4 /CD 8 ratio, total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine and renal filtrate were compared at baseline and after 6 months from simplification. The same parameters were then evaluated among the groups A and B. A comparison between regimen costs was also investigated. RESULTS: All enrolled patients (36 / 36) maintained the same viro-immunological pattern after 6 months from the ART regimen simplification (no statistically significant difference was found in the HIV-RNAq and CD 4 count), with the exception of an increase in the CD 4 /CD 8 ratio (p< 0. 05). Total cholesterol was found to be statistically increased after 6 months of dual ART therapy compared with baseline (p< 0. 05). All the other parameters (triglycerides, creatinine and renal filtrate) were unchanged. The statistical comparison of the group A and B showed no significant difference in CD 4 count, CD 4 /CD 8 ratio, total cholesterol and triglycerides. Creatinine levels were statistically increased and decreased in group A and B, respectively (F (1) = 8. 144, p = 0. 007, repeated measures ANOVA for the interaction between simplification and creatinine). A marked decrease of renal filtrate (vegf) was observed in group A while an increase in group B. The comparison between the two groups at 6 months showed a statistically significance difference (p < 0. 05), while only group B showed a significantly higher value of VEGF at 6 months compared to baseline (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0. 05). The assessment {{of the impact of the}} simplification regimen costs compared with baseline resulted statistically significant (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Switching to a dual ART regimen with DTG or PI maintains virological efficacy up to 6 months, and is associated with slight improvements of the CD 4 /CD 8 ratio. The increase in total cholesterol can be attributed to <b>the</b> statin-like <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir,</b> which is lost in the simplification regimen. The variations of creatinine and the renal filtrate observed in group A are consistent with DTG action as an inhibitor of the renal protein organic cation transporter 2 (OCT 2). Finally, the dual therapy is less expensive in economic terms...|$|R
40|$|In virologically suppressed, antiretroviral-treated patients, <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> {{switching}} to <b>tenofovir</b> (TDF) on bone biomarkers compared to patients remaining on stable antiretroviral therapy is unknown. We examined bone biomarkers (osteocalcin [OC], procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide, and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen) and bone mineral density (BMD) over 48 weeks in virologically suppressed patients (HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml) randomized {{to switch to}} TDF/emtricitabine (FTC) or remain on first-line zidovudine (AZT) /lamivudine (3 TC). PTH was also measured. Between-group differences in bone biomarkers and associations between change in bone biomarkers and BMD measures were assessed by Student's t tests, Pearson correlation, and multivariable linear regression, respectively. All data are expressed as mean (SD), unless otherwise specified. Of 53 subjects (aged 46. 0 y; 84. 9 % male; 75. 5 % Caucasian), 29 switched to TDF/FTC. There were reductions in total hip and lumbar spine BMD in those {{switching to}} TDF/FTC (total hip, TDF/FTC, - 1. 73 (2. 76) % vs AZT/ 3 TC, - 0. 39 (2. 41) %; between-group P =. 07; lumbar spine, TDF/FTC, - 1. 50 (3. 49) % vs AZT/ 3 TC, + 0. 25 (2. 82) %; between-group P =. 06), {{but they did not}} reach statistical significance. Greater declines in lumbar spine BMD correlated with greater increases in OC (r = - 0. 28; P =. 05). <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> TDF/FTC on bone biomarkers remained significant when adjusted for baseline biomarker levels, gender, and ethnicity. There was no difference in change in PTH levels over 48 weeks between treatment groups (between-group P =. 23). All biomarkers increased significantly from weeks 0 to 48 in the switch group, with no significant change in those remaining on AZT/ 3 TC (between-group, all biomarkers, P <. 0001).

40|$|<b>The</b> {{protective}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> oral <b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with {{or without}} emtricitabine (FTC) as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV differed significantly among clinical studies and poor PrEP-adherence was closely associated with PrEP-failure. Despite HIV-infections during PrEP-exposure the development of resistance mutations against PrEP was rarely observed so far. As PrEP is an emerging tool against HIV transmission, {{it is important to}} identify risk-factors for PrEP-failure and the induction of PrEP-associated resistance mutations against antiretroviral drugs. We here present the case of a 25 -year old MSM who was successfully treated with TDF due to a chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBV-DNA always &#x 3 C; 357 IU/ml after ten months of treatment). As HIV tests were negative when the treatment was initiated and six months later, no routine HIV tests were performed although the patient repetitively acquired sexually transmitted infections (STI). After 30 months, an HIV infection (subtype B) was diagnosed during a syphilis re-infection. At this point, HIV was TDF-resistant (K 65 R and A 62 V mutations within the reverse transcriptase gene). Retrospective analysis of frozen serum samples revealed HIV-seroconversion 12 months prior to diagnosis and low HIV-RNA levels from seroconversion to diagnosis (always &#x 3 C; 400 copies/ml). The TDF-based therapy of the chronic HBV-infection resembles a TDF-HIV-PrEP. But here poor therapy adherence is an unlikely cause for the &#x 0027;PrEP-failure&#x 0027; as the constantly suppressed HBV-DNA indicates therapeutic TDF-levels over years. Combining TDF with FTC might have augmented <b>the</b> prophylactic <b>effect.</b> However, TDF-levels in the rectal mucosa are high and should therefore protect MSM who practice receptive anal intercourse. On the other hand, the concomitant STI of our patient may have promoted HIV transmission (via compromising the mucosal barrier function and promoting inflammatory reactions) and therefore possibly counteracted TDF-effects. Finally, infection with a TDF-resistant virus strain might explain the lack of protection in this case. But K 65 R is a rarely transmitted drug resistance mutation and low level viremia for one year suggests considerable TDF effectiveness. In fact, we here rather present a K 65 R mutation induced by a PrEP-like TDF therapy. The development of the K 65 R mutation in a PrEP-like situation emphasizes the urgent need of regular HIV-tests during PrEP exposure...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} scale up of {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is {{in large part}} due to the introduction of a “public health approach” to access advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) which emphasized standardized treatment regimens that could be purchased in large quantities and delivered at scale. In 2010 the WHO updated their global HIV treatment guidelines recommending the substitution <b>of</b> stavudine with <b>tenofovir</b> (both <b>of</b> which are members of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class of drugs) in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Given the size of treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa, changing the NRTI used in first-line therapy for HIV could have a substantial impact on treatment outcomes. We conducted three prospective cohort studies using clinical datasets from several sub-Saharan African countries to answer questions surrounding the impacts <b>of</b> exposure to <b>tenofovir</b> in first-line therapy. The first study examines the frequency of stavudine use and single-drug substitutions (substituting the NRTI in first-line ART) in three regions in sub-Saharan Africa by calendar year, 2004 – 2014. We found a total of 33, 441 (8. 9 %; 95 % CI: 8. 7 – 8. 9 %) single-drug substitutions occurred among 377, 656 patients in the first 24 months on ART, close to 40 % of which were amongst patients on stavudine. The decrease in single-drug substitutions corresponded with the phasing out of stavudine. We saw an 80 % reduction in the risk of single-drug substitutions when comparing tenofovir to stavudine and close to a 70 % reduction in the risk when comparing zidovudine to stavudine. The second study uses a regression discontinuity design to evaluate the impact of national HIV treatment guideline changes in South Africa and Zambia recommending tenofovir in first-line ART on treatment outcomes. We found that updated WHO guidelines increased the proportion <b>of</b> patients initiating <b>tenofovir</b> (risk difference (RD) (South Africa) : 81 %; 95 % CI: 73 %, 89 %; RD (Zambia) : 42 %; 95 % CI: 38 %, 45 %). Intent to treat estimates showed a decrease in single-drug substitutions in South Africa (RD: - 15 %; 95 % CI: - 18 %, - 12 %) and Zambia (RD: - 2. 0 %; 95 % CI: - 3. 6 %, - 0. 3 %). In both countries, there was no effect on mortality, attrition or viral load failure (South Africa only). The third study investigates <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2012 <b>tenofovir</b> stock shortage in South Africa on provider and patient level outcomes, using data from four public-sector Right to Care clinics, two of which experienced a tenofovir stock shortage and two that did not. While imprecise, our results suggest a potential shift in how providers managed patients during the period of the shortage, mainly, a noticeable decrease in the average number of days between visits during the shortage compare to before or after at all four clinics and {{a significant difference in the}} proportion of patients missing visits. Difference-in-difference regression results showed a small, but significant, increase in the risk of missed visits during the shortage compared to after (RD: 1. 2 %; 95 % CI: 0. 5 %, 2. 0 %), mainly driven by ACTs clinic. No significant difference was seen in other outcomes. Great strides have been made to extend access to ART as well as increase the quality of the services provided to patients in sub-Saharan Africa. Continued access to and a consistent supply <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> in this setting is necessary for patients to receive drugs that are comparable to those used for HIV treatment in high-income countries, as we show that phasing out of stavudine and for either zidovudine or tenofovir potentially reduced toxicities and potentially improved quality of life in multiple regions throughout sub-Saharan Africa. While we show little effect on treatment outcomes when comparing patients accessing care and treatment during the shortage <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> compared to those that did not, this most likely reflects the clinics’ ability to offset the crisis by continuing to initiate newly diagnosed and eligible patients on treatment and keep treatment experienced patients on their current regimen...|$|R

40|$|Tenofovirrenal toxicity, {{particularly}} when associated with other antiretrovirals, {{has been reported}} in the adult HIV-positive population. Reports in HIVpositive children are very rare. The authors report a paediatric case of nephrotoxicity associated with tenofovir and didanosine, emtricitabine and lopinavirritonavir coadministration. A 12 -year-old girl with AIDS (clinical stage C) with a multidrug-resistant virus and several treatment failures initiated emtricitabine, tenofovir, didanosine and lopinavir-ritonavir in 2008 with good tolerance. Her viral load became undetectable and CD 4 count normal. Two years later she presented generalized weakness, polydipsia and polyuria. On physical examination dehydration was evident. Her vital signs were stable. She had lost 5 % of her body weight in the previous week. Urinalysis revealed a urine gravity of 1000, osmolality 150 mOsm/Kg and no proteinuria or glucosuria. Blood analysis showed osmolality 289 mOsm/Kg, normal values of glucose, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium. A water restriction test followed by desmopressin administration confirmed the diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Tenofovir and didanosine were stopped and abacavir was added. The patient was treated with a thiazide diuretic and salt restriction. There was good clinical evolution and no relapses.

In addition, the mechanism of absorption enhancement was investigated. In rat intestinal homogenates, complete inhibition of the conversion <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> DF (as obtained by strawberry extract) could only be obtained at relatively high concentrations of the discrete esters or by using mixtures of esters (e. g., propyl p-hydroxybenzoate 0. 02 %, octyl acetate 0. 02 %, ethyl caprylate 0. 01 %). Coincubation <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> DF with this mixture also resulted in an enhancement of its absorption in the in vitro Caco- 2 system as well as in rat ileum. As tenofovir DF is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) -related efflux carriers in the Caco- 2 model, <b>the</b> modulatory <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ester mixtures was studied on the functionality of P-gp using cyclosporin A (CsA) as a model substrate. Strawberry extract as well as the mixture of three esters interfered with the absorptive transport of CsA across Caco- 2 monolayers, illustrating that both mixtures interfere with both esterase-activity and P-gp functionality. This concerted barrier was not observed in rat ileum, suggesting differential functional activities of the biochemical barrier toward tenofovir DF in different absorption systems. Overall, our results illustrate that modulation of the biochemical barrier (metabolism and efflux) <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> DF by ester mixtures can be used to increase the intestinal absorption <b>of</b> <b>tenofovir</b> DF in an in vitro and an in situ absorption model; the mechanism of action appears to be a complex interplay of different systems; the differential expression of carriers and enzymes in different systems illustrates the difficulty of extrapolating observations between different systems/species. status: publishe...|$|R

Patients and methods A prospective observational study that included data from all consecutive HIV-infected patients who attended a metabolic clinic was conducted. Included were adult, antiretroviral (ARV) -experienced, tenofovir-naive patients, whose kidney functions were evaluated by calculated GFR using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation (MDRD). Tenofovir-exposed patients were patients who initiated tenofovir therapy at baseline and tenofovir-unexposed patients were patients whose ARV therapy did not include tenofovir. Participants were stratified into three sub-groups according to the plasma HIV- 1 RNA (VL) changes observed: sub-groups 1, 2 and 3 were patients with stable VL 0. 5 log(10) VL increases and > 0. 5 VL log(10) decreases, respectively. Results Ninety-nine patients were enrolled and included in the analysis. Within the tenofovir-unexposed group, GFRs remained stable (ANOVA, P = 0. 94) over the follow-up period. Within the tenofovir-exposed group, mean GFR changes varied significantly by sub-group (ANOVA, P < 0. 01).
