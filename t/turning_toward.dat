5|$|The 1959 Mexico {{hurricane}} is {{the deadliest}} eastern Pacific tropical cyclone on record. First observed south of Mexico on October23, the cyclone tracked northwest. It intensified into a Category3 hurricane on October25 and reached Category4 intensity the following day. After <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the northeast, the hurricane maintained Category4 status and made landfall near Manzanillo, Mexico. The system continued on that trajectory prior to dissipating the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} force boarded transport ships {{during the}} afternoon of 13December, and the convoy sailed at midnight. It proceeded to Buna in New Guinea to rendezvous {{with most of the}} escorting destroyers and made a feint north toward Finschhafen before <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> Arawe after dusk on 14December. The convoy was detected by a Japanese aircraft shortly before it anchored off Arawe at 3:30am on 15December, and the 11thAir Fleet at Rabaul began to prepare aircraft to attack it.|$|E
5|$|Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest {{toward the}} North Carolina-South Carolina border {{over the next}} two days, it slowly strengthened, {{acquiring}} more tropical characteristics. On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical storm shortly before <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the north and brushing Cape Hatteras, then accelerating toward the northeast and away from the coast. On September 11, while under the influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to the intensification of Hurricane Michael in 2000. Gustav reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) later that day.|$|E

5|$|When Emilia began <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the Baja California peninsula, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Buena Vista along the Gulf of California to Bahía Magdalena along the Pacific coast. The watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning about 12hours prior to the closest approach of the storm, and additional warnings were issued along the Pacific coastline as the storm passed. All watches and warnings were discontinued by July 27. Officials prepared two schools as emergency shelters in Cabo San Lucas, where 100people stayed during the storm. In the area, {{the threat of the}} storm resulted in the closure of several bars and restaurants.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|M-35 is an {{original}} state trunkline that was first designated by July 1, 1919, {{originally intended to}} run from Menominee {{in the south to}} near Big Bay in the north, before <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> L'Anse to end at Ontonagon. However, the section through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette and Baraga counties was never built. Automobile pioneer Henry Ford helped halt this construction to gain favor with and membership in the exclusive Huron Mountain Club. Some discontinuous sections were later ceded to local control. The northern segment of the route between Ontonagon and Baraga was retained as a discontinuous segment of the highway; this northern segment was redesignated as another state trunkline. The northern end was rerouted out of the City of Negaunee into Negaunee Township to avoid mining activity near Palmer.|$|E

5|$|On September8, Tropical Storm Fox {{was present}} in the open Atlantic Ocean between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde, likely {{originating}} from a tropical wave. Hurricane Fox was first discovered by Hurricane Hunters on September10, when it was located about 1,000mi (1,600km) east of Puerto Rico. A small system, the hurricane moved generally northwestward and gradually intensified. After <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the north, Fox reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) on September14, as it passed about 300mi (485km) east of Bermuda. Following its peak intensity, the hurricane accelerated {{to the north and}} northeast. By September17, Fox had lost all tropical characteristics, and later that day the circulation dissipated about halfway between the Azores and Newfoundland. Fox never affected land along its path. When Fox dissipated, {{it was the first time}} in 36days without an active tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Winifred was {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in northern Queensland since Cyclone Althea in 1971 and the first since Althea to inflict significant damage on the northeastern coast of Australia. The sixth named storm of the 1985–86 Australian region cyclone season, Winifred originated as a tropical low north of Cairns, Queensland on 27January 1986. Slowly organizing, the system was recognized as a tropical cyclone after gaining tropical characteristics on 30January, christened with the name Winifred the same day. Meandering southward, the cyclone began to curve southeastward that evening before suddenly <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the coast, southwestward, on 31January, steadily intensifying in that time. By the time it came ashore near Silkwood, Queensland at 0445UTC on 1February, it was producing Category3-force winds on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 957mbar (28.38inHg). Weakening as it drifted inland, Winifred persisted as a tropical depression for another five days after landfall before finally dissipating on 5February.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone's 1-minute winds {{increased}} {{once again}} to 140km/h, marking its second and final peak at 0000 UTC on November 18. The JMA, however, maintained Nepartak as a severe tropical storm. The JTWC indicated that 25W made a second landfall {{on the coast of}} Hainan, although the JMA did not make such mention, implying Nepartak's center remained over the Gulf of Tonkin. Regardless, the cyclone's circulation had obscured most of Hainan and the Gulf of Tonkin and reached into adjacent Vietnam, and its forward speed slowed to a crawl. Extended interaction with land proved detrimental to the storm, and it began to rapidly disintegrate. Just 18 hours after its final bout of strengthening, Nepartak had been reduced to an exposed circulation center with no associated thunderstorms. <b>Turning</b> <b>toward</b> the northeast, the system had been concurrently downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC and JMA early on November 19. The weak remnant low of Nepartak limped ashore over Beihai, China at 1900 UTC and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Response to stimuli: a {{response}} {{can take many}} forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the sun (phototropism), and chemotaxis.|$|E

25|$|In {{the teachings}} of the Bahá'í Faith, {{meditation}} along with prayer are both primary tools for spiritual development and mainly refer to one's reflection on the words of God. While prayer and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> God, and meditation is seen as a communion with one's self where one focuses on the divine.|$|E
25|$|Growth {{of cells}} {{contributes}} to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> light sources (phototropism), roots growing in response to gravity (gravitropism), and other tropisms originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells {{on the other side}} of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.|$|E
25|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) {{reported}} that two journalists and one student were killed while covering Egyptian unrest {{in the two}} {{weeks leading up to}} 8 July 2013. According to CPJ research, before those deaths only four journalists had been killed in Egypt since 1992. One of the journalists killed while documenting the 2013 clashes was 26-year-old photographer Ahmed Assem el-Senousy, also known as Ahmed Samir Assem. The photographer was shot by a sniper after he recorded security forces firing on protestors. According to media reports, el-Senousy may have captured his own death on film. A video clip posted on his Facebook page shows a sniper firing on crowds before <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> the camera, at which point the clip abruptly ends.|$|E

25|$|The second painting, Red Houses, bears general {{similarity}} to landscapes by Cézanne and Braque. Both paintings are Cubist in style. However, with them Weinrich did not announce an abrupt conversion to Cubism, but rather marked a <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> greater experimentation. In her later work {{she would not}} adopt a single style or stylistic tendency, but would produce both representative pictures and ones that were entirely abstract, always showing {{a strong sense of}} the two-dimensional plane of the picture's surface. After she made these two paintings neither her subject matter nor the media she used would dramatically change. She continued to employ subjects available to her in her Provincetown studio and the surrounding area to produce still lifes, village and pastoral scenes, portraits, and abstractions in oil on canvas and board; watercolor, pastel, crayon and graphite on paper; and woodblock prints.|$|E
25|$|Murgescu {{remained}} {{active in}} the press after the Guard fell from power in the violent purge of early 1941. With Antonescu as the uncontested dictator, Romania {{became involved in the}} anti-Soviet war as an ally of Nazi Germany. Murgescu was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, but continued to write (including an unpublished novel and war diary) and was allowed to pass his examinations at the university. With his journalistic work, he moved to the more mainstream review, Vremea, where he contributed analytical essays about the war effort. In one such piece, on October 25, 1942, just before the crushing of Romanian forces, he predicted that the Red Army was too exhausted and famished to mount an offensive. By 1943, his articles in Vremea and Revista Fundațiilor Regale were <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> economics and economic history, citing Victor Slăvescu as a model and inspiration.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian {{defensive}} infrastructure {{was extremely}} poor, and no airfields were yet equipped with hardened aircraft shelters capable of protecting Egypt's warplanes {{in the event}} of an attack. The Israeli warplanes headed out over the Mediterranean before <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> Egypt. Meanwhile, the Egyptians hindered their own defense by effectively shutting down their entire air defense system: they were worried that rebel Egyptian forces would shoot down the plane carrying Field Marshal Amer and Lt-Gen. Sidqi Mahmoud, who were en route from al Maza to Bir Tamada in the Sinai to meet the commanders of the troops stationed there. In this event it did not make a great deal of difference as the Israeli pilots came in below Egyptian radar cover and well below the lowest point at which Egypt's SA-2 surface-to-air missile batteries could bring down an aircraft.|$|E
