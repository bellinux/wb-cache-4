At a meeting of the Ruislip parish council on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were also aware that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell some for development. With this in mind, a vote was cast which went in favour of becoming an urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> development, as councillors felt a parish council would work slower than an urban district.|$|E

The paper's circulation continuing <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the city and its provinces, with robust anarcho-syndicalist collectives and meetings emerging in Kronstadt, Oboukhovo, and Kolpino.

40|$|Publisher's PDFBACKGROUND: Propulsive force {{generation}} {{is critical to}} walking speed. Trialing limb angle and ankle moment are major contributors <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> propulsive force during gait. For able-bodied individuals, trailing limb angle contributes {{twice as much as}} ankle moment <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> propulsive force during speed modulation. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the relative contribution of ankle moment and trailing limb angle <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> propulsive force for individuals poststroke. METHODS: A biomechanical-based model previously developed for able-bodied individuals was evaluated and enhanced for individuals poststroke. Gait analysis was performed as subjects (N = 24) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and fast walking speeds on a treadmill. RESULTS: Both trailing limb angle and ankle moment increased during speed modulation. In the paretic limb, the contribution from trailing limb angle versus ankle moment <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> propulsive force is 74 % and 17 %. In the non-paretic limb, the contribution from trailing limb angle versus ankle moment <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> propulsive force is 67 % and 22 %. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals poststroke increase propulsive force mainly by changing trailing limb angle in both the paretic and non-paretic limbs. This strategy may contribute to the inefficiency in poststroke walking patterns. Future work is needed to examine whether these characteristics can be modified via intervention.

50|$|Varying the {{surfactant}} concentration allows {{control over}} the diameter and volume of pores, and thus of the surface area of the product material. Increasing the amount of surfactant leads <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> total pore volume and hence particle surface area, but with individual pore diameters remaining unchanged. Altering the pore diameter {{can be achieved by}} varying the amount of ammonia used relative to surfactant concentration; additional ammonia leads to pores with greater diameters, but with a corresponding decrease in total pore volume and particle surface area. The time allowed for the reaction to proceed also influences porosity, with greater reaction times leading <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> total pore volume and particle surface area. Longer reaction times also lead <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> overall silica particle size and related decreases in the uniformity of the size distribution.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1917, the British and French were still searching {{for a way to}} achieve a strategic breakthrough on the Western Front. The previous year had been marked by the costly success of the Anglo-French offensive astride the river Somme, while the French had been unable to take the initiative because of intense German pressure at Verdun until after August 1916.

The cost to Germany of containing the Anglo-French attacks had been enormous and given that the material preponderance of the Entente and its allies could only be expected <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> 1917, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for that year. This impasse reinforced the French and British commanders' belief that to end the stalemate they needed a breakthrough; while this desire may have been the main impetus behind the offensive, the timing and location were influenced by political and tactical considerations.|$|E
