5|$|A deal <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> {{several of}} the Chinooks was reached in May 1991. Under this arrangement, seven of the {{surviving}} CH-47Cs were sold to the US Army for $A40 million, the funds being used to partly {{cover the cost of}} upgrading the remaining four to CH-47D standard. The total cost of the project was $A62 million, of which $A42 million was required <b>to</b> <b>upgrade</b> the four helicopters and the remainder for spare parts, administration and new facilities for the Chinooks at Townsville. All eleven Chinooks were shipped to the United States in September 1993, and the upgraded helicopters returned to Australia in 1995. It was decided to transfer the Chinooks to the Australian Army, as by this time the RAAF no longer had significant expertise in operating the type and doing so would concentrate all of the ADF's battlefield helicopters with the same service.|$|E
