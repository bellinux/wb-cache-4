Chief among these are powders, sprays, gels, and homeopathic substances <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> contain growth hormones. Authentic growth hormones are only effective when injected, mainly due to the fact that the 191-amino acid protein is too large to be absorbed through the mucous membranes, and would be broken up in the stomach if swallowed.|$|E

25|$|Many large sports {{stores and}} {{specialised}} cricket stores use special machines to knock in the bats for customers. Some manufacturers will roll the bats through a special press to compress the wood, however many bat manufacturers {{choose not to}} do this as the spring may be rolled as well, causing jarring. Many bats <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> be pre-knocked-in by the manufacturer should be manually knocked in anyway as this claim is not a guarantee that the bat {{is ready to be}} used in competition.|$|E

25|$|In early 1979, Livgren became {{interested}} in The Urantia Book, a series of papers <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> be a revelation authored by supernatural beings. Its influence can be felt in the lyrics of Kansas' 1979 album Monolith. Livgren subsequently rejected Urantia doctrine, and while on tour with the band in support of Monolith, he converted to Christianity. This {{was a result of}} a series of debates {{in the back of the}} tour bus with Jeff Pollard of Louisiana's Le Roux, the opening act for Kansas during the tour. The discussions between Livgren and Pollard concerned whether the Bible or the Urantia Book was the accurate record of the life of Jesus Christ. Because of the debates, Livgren became convinced that the Bible was the genuine record of Christ and that he had been mistaken in following the teachings of the Urantia Book. After a private hotel room conversion experience, he became an evangelical Christian.|$|E

500|$|Earp's {{reputation}} {{has been}} confused by inaccurate, conflicting, and false stories told about him by others, {{and by his}} own claims that cannot be corroborated. For example, {{in an interview with}} a reporter in Denver in 1896, he denied that he had killed Johnny Ringo. He then flipped his story, claiming he had killed Ringo. In 1888, he was interviewed by an agent of California historian Hubert H. Bancroft, and Earp claimed that he had killed [...] "over a dozen stage robbers, murderers, and cattle thieves". In about 1918 he told Forrestine Hooker, who wrote an unpublished manuscript, and then Frank Lockwood, who wrote Pioneer Days in Arizona in 1932, that {{he was the one who}} killed Johnny Ringo as he left Arizona in 1882. However, Earp included details that do not match what is known about Ringo's death. Earp repeated <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> at least three other people.|$|E
