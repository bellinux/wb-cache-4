5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished {{the prestige of the}} award. The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> it. The medal was returned with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, {{all life}} forms are said <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> full {{protection}} from {{all kinds of}} injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the urging}} of his crewmen, Choe changed his clothes in a ritual fashion in {{preparation}} for death, although he prayed to the heavens to spare him and his crew, asking what sins they had committed <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> this fate. On the sixth day, during fairer weather, their ship came upon a group of islands in the Yellow Sea where Chinese pirates were moored. The pirates robbed their ship of spare goods and rations, threw away the Koreans' oars and anchor, and left them to drift aimlessly into the sea.|$|E

25|$|In Calvinist (Reformed) theology, {{unconditional}} {{election is}} considered to be one aspect of predestination in which God chooses certain individuals to be saved. Those elected receive mercy, while those not elected, the reprobates, receive justice without condition. This unconditional election is essentially related {{to the rest of the}} TULIP doctrinal outline and hinges upon the supreme belief in the absolute sovereignty of God over the affairs of man. God unconditionally elects certain people even though they are sinful as an act of his saving grace apart from the shortcomings or will of man. Those chosen have done nothing <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> this grace.|$|E
25|$|Marine {{biologist}} Michael Dawson {{proposed that}} the golden jellyfish that inhabit Jellyfish Lake be classified as a subspecies (Mastigias cf. papua etpisoni) of the spotted jellyfish living in the nearby lagoons. The species identification is uncertain (denoted by cf. in the name) because the Mastigias papua local to Palauan lagoons may be {{only one of several}} cryptic species that make up the M. papua group, and in the future, the M. papua local to Palau may be identified as a separate species from other M. papua. He also {{proposed that the}} jellyfish living in four other Palauan marine lakes were distinctive enough <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> recognition as unique subspecies.|$|E

25|$|When Constantinople {{fell to the}} Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Byzantine {{successor}} states {{established at}} Epirus, Trebizond and especially Nicaea based their military systems on the Komnenian army. The success of the Empire of Nicaea in particular in reconquering former Byzantine territories (including Constantinople) after 1204, {{may be seen as}} evidence of the strengths of the Komnenian army model. There is reason to restrict the term Komnenian army solely to the period of the rule of the Komnenian emperors; the Byzantine army after the recovery of Constantinople in 1261 was sufficiently distinct from its earlier form <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> a separate identity as the Palaiologan army. The Byzantine Empire enjoyed an economic and cultural renaissance during the 12th century and the Komnenian army played a crucial part in providing the political and territorial stability which allowed this cultural flowering.|$|E
25|$|Pindar {{seems to}} have used his odes to advance his, and his friends', {{personal}} interests. In 462 BC he composed two odes in honour of Arcesilas, king of Cyrene, (Pythians 4 and 5), pleading for the return from exile of a friend, Demophilus. In the latter ode Pindar proudly mentions his own ancestry, which he shared with the king, as an Aegeid or descendent of Aegeus, the legendary king of Athens. The clan was influential {{in many parts of}} the Greek world, having intermarried with ruling families in Thebes, in Lacedaemonia, and in cities that claimed Lacedaemonian descent, such as Cyrene and Thera. The historian Herodotus considered the clan important enough <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> mention (Histories IV.147). Membership of this clan possibly contributed to Pindar's success as a poet, and it informed his political views, which are marked by a conservative preference for oligarchic governments of the Doric kind.|$|E
25|$|Zina is a Hudud crime, {{stated in}} {{multiple}} sahih hadiths <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> the stoning (Rajm) punishment. In others stoning is prescribed {{as punishment for}} illegal sex between man and woman, In some sunnah, the method of stoning, by first digging a pit and partly burying the person's lower half in it, is described. Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people is sentenced with flogging a 100 times. Adultery can be punished by up to one hundred lashes, though this is not binding in nature and the final decision will always {{be in the hands}} of a judge appointed by the state or community. However, no mention of stoning or capital punishment for adultery is found in the Quran and only mentioning lashing as punishment for adultery. Nevertheless, most scholars maintain that there is sufficient evidence from hadiths to derive a ruling.|$|E

25|$|For the Giro d'Italia, Voigt rode {{in support}} of Basso. Following Team CSC's team time trial win on stage 5, Voigt found himself second, {{trailing}} race leader Serhiy Honchar by six seconds. During the first mountains, Voigt helped Basso take the overall lead, while he slid down the board and finished 37th. On mountainous stage 19, Voigt and Julich were in a 20-man break, but as Team CSC was leading the peloton to defend Basso's first place, Voigt and Julich did not work. Up the last climb, Voigt was alone with Spanish rider Juan Manuel GÃ¡rate, but as Voigt did not think he had done enough <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> the victory, he let Garate take the win. Voigt finally got his first win {{of the season in}} the Ster Elektrotoer race in June. There he won stage 4 and helped teammate Kurt Asle Arvesen to the overall win, two weeks before the Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|After the Chinese National Revolutionary Army takes {{back the}} area, Dong is {{publicly}} executed for {{collaborating with the}} enemy. Ma, bent on revenge, disguises himself as a cigarette vendor and loiters outside the Japanese encampment, now converted into a POW camp. When two Japanese soldiers come out to buy cigarettes, Ma hacks them with an axe and breaks into the camp, killing more POWs. He finds and pursues Hanaya, but is brought down by guards before he can kill the latter. Major Gao (David Wu), commander of the Chinese Army contingent administering the town, condemns Ma's act as too despicable <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> death by {{the hands of a}} Chinese soldier, and instead orders a Japanese POW to carry out the execution before a massive crowd. Captain Sakatsuka hands a katana to Hanaya, who takes careful aim before delivering the fatal strike. As Ma's head falls to the ground, it rolls nine times, blinks three times, and smiles, just as 'One Strike' Liu's victims were supposed to have done.|$|E

Rheumatologist Fatima Haji, for example, appeared on Al Jazeera television news in a [...] "hysterical" [...] state, describing Isa Abdul Hasan, a man in his 60s who died in her hospital of a head wound he had received from police: [...] "I just started shouting: 'What the hell did this guy do, he was an old man. What did he do <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> this?'" [...] She later stated that following her arrest, her interrogations were centered on this television appearance.|$|E
500|$|During the mid 20th-century, Virginia Radley states, [...] "the 'Eolian Harp' {{itself can}} be read with {{pleasure}} without a redaction of the poem for meaning. It is a poem which comes full circle from Eden to Eden" [...] and that [...] "Perhaps a poem should indeed not mean but be, and, to this point, the 'Eolian Harp' is a true poem. The images and the personalities are striking enough <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> approval from a purely belletristic standpoint. But the poem has meaning also." [...] Following this, M. H.

500|$|The 2012 edition also {{included}} a ten-page story called [...] "The Door", which Brown redrew from an anonymous public domain story from a horror comic book.

[...] Their clothes disintegrate over that time, exposing their genitals, until they finally come across another doorâone that leads them to Hell. [...] Brown wrote he found the original story truly horrifying, as the couple had done nothing apparent <b>to</b> <b>deserve</b> their fate. [...] He had originally intended to incorporate it into the Ed story, but capriciously veered off in another narrative direction.|$|E
