5|$|Anning's discoveries became key {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} for extinction. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. Of the bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature, struck a major blow against this idea.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Donna Lee Brien stated <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> {{the filmmakers}} {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves}} from Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E

5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3–0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went {{through the rest of the}} season with only one other defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the sense of history repeating itself in <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended up costing them dearly. Despite this however, there was also a feeling that, given the group of players available to them, they would qualify for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to qualify for a major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E
5|$|His poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley {{consists}} of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless. Published in June 1920, it marked his farewell to London. He was disgusted by the massive {{loss of life}} {{during the war and}} was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the work can nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word usury appears in his work for the first time. The critic F. R. Leavis saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s first {{images of}} Io {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} impact craters, suggesting a very young surface. Craters are used by geologists to estimate the age of a planetary surface; the number of impact structures increase with {{the age of the}} planetary surface. Instead, Voyager 1 observed a multi-coloured surface, pockmarked with irregular-shaped depressions, which lacked the raised rims characteristic of impact craters. Voyager 1 also observed flow features formed by low-viscosity fluid and tall, isolated mountains that did not resemble terrestrial volcanoes. The surface observed suggested <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Peale and colleagues had theorized, Io was heavily modified by volcanism.|$|E

5|$|In 1812, as Napoleon entered Russia, the Poles and Lithuanians {{rallied to}} Napoleon's Grande Armée {{in the hope}} of resurrecting the Commonwealth. The Vistula Legion, {{withdrawn}} from Spain in early 1812 and reorganized into a division (with a planned strength of 10,500 that was never fully attained) was part of Napoleon's invasion forces. Poles formed the largest foreign contingent, 98,000-strong (the entire French Grande Armée was about 600,000 strong). Polish Lancers of the Vistula Legion were the first unit to cross the Neman River when the Grand Armee entered Russia and, as part of the Imperial Guard, the first unit to enter Moscow. They distinguished themselves in the Battle of Borodino and, under Prince Józef Poniatowski (who personally saved Napoleon's life), were one of the units that served as the rear guard during Napoleon's retreat. This later led to the claim <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> they had been the first to enter it, they were the last to leave Russia. They sustained heavy losses during the campaign: only 26,000 of the original 98,000-strong contingent returned. The elite Vistula Legion entering Russia was about 7,000 strong; its strength {{at the end of the}} campaign was just 1,500.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 2009, Capcom {{announced}} the Japanese release of Ultimate All-Stars. Starting on that day, the company periodically revealed the game's new characters; however, the full cast was leaked through JavaScript code on the game's official Japanese site. With {{the exception of}} Hakushon Daimaō, who was removed due to unspecified licensing issues, every playable character from the original Wii release was included. Hakushon Daimaō was also removed in Ultimate All-Stars Japanese release, due to both his unpopularity with players, and the game's status as a localization of the North American version. The new characters encompassed Frank West from Dead Rising, Zero from Mega Man X, Yatterman-2 from Yatterman, Joe the Condor from Gatchaman, and the title character from Tekkaman Blade. Shinji Ueda served as a director along with Hidetoshi Ishizawa. Ishizawa admitted <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Cross Generation of Heroes was not initially planned {{to be released in}}ternationally, neither was Ultimate All-Stars planned to be released in Japan. However, fan appeals and the research and development team's own hopes resulted in the game's Japanese localization.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, {{he says that the}} difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> a utilitarian approach to wild animal suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E

25|$|Persian metres {{were used}} {{not only in}} {{classical}} Persian poetry, but were also imitated in Turkish poetry of the Ottoman period, and in Urdu poetry under the Mughal emperors.
