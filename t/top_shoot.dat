40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{in order to}} study {{the formation of the}} terminal buds, <b>top</b> <b>shoot</b> maturation, bud break and flushing as well as the amount of growth of the <b>top</b> <b>shoot</b> under different photo- and thermoperiodic conditions, in three larch provenances (Larix decidua Mill.). Two-year-old plants were tested under long- (LD = 16 h) and short-day (SD = S h) conditions and under various temperature combinations. The experiment went on for 59 weeks in a phytotron. The plants' growth activities were greatest under LD conditions. SD conditions were necessary for the plants to complete their vegetative growth. For bud formation and lignification of the leading shoot, relatively high temperatures were required under SD conditions. Under low temperatures, bud formation was incomplete and the leading shoot remained unlignified. The investigation showed that there is an interaction between photo- and thermo-period which determines the plants' vegetative cycle. In comparison with the climate of the place of origin of the larch, in northern Scandinavia the days are longer and the temperatures lower in the autumn. This is the reason why the introduced larch hardens poorly and too late, which in its turn makes it sensitive to early frosts...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} details how herbivory by the shoot-borer Cromarcha stroudagnesia (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae, Chrysauginae), {{alters the}} growth and population dynamics of its host tree Tabebuia ochracea (Bignoniaceae) in the tropical dry forests of the Area de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Insect herbivory of tree saplings can affect tree population dynamics by increasing sapling prereproductive mortality and increasing the age of first reproduction (by decreasing the rate of sapling height increment). Herbivory of T. ochracea saplings by the larvae of C. stroudagnesia has large direct and indirect effects on both these variables. Just a single C. stroudagnesia larva attacking the <b>top</b> <b>shoot</b> of a canopy gap sapling reduces sapling annual height increment on average by 77. 9 %—equivalent to the difference in annual height increment between saplings in canopy gaps and understory shade. Each year, an average 40. 1 % of canopy gap saplings had their <b>top</b> <b>shoot</b> attacked by a C. stroudagnesia larva. Assuming a sapling remains {{at the top of}} canopy gap vegetation, this will result in a 45. 1 % increase in the duration of the pre-reproductive sapling lifestage (0. 5 m to 10 m high) relative to undamaged plants. C. stroudagnesia herbivory increases the probability that canopy gap saplings are overtopped and shaded by surrounding vegetation, and so will further, indirectly increase the age of first reproduction. Sapling mortality was directly increased by C. stroudagnesia herbivory— 10 % of heavily damaged young saplings (initially 0. 7 – 1. 5 m high) died in four years while no protected saplings died. C. stroudagnesia herbivory will also indirectly increase sapling mortality by increasing the likelihood that a sapling is killed by falling debris before it reaches reproductive age. Cromarcha stroudagnesia shoot herbivory is greatest in areas of high sapling density, and so is predicted to cause a Janzen-Connell effect. Together, these results suggest that sapling herbivory, especially herbivory of the highest apical meristems of saplings, plays an important, but largely unexplored, role in the population dynamics of tropical tree species. ...|$|E
40|$|In spring 2002, {{extensive}} damage {{was recorded in}} southeast Norway on nursery-grown Norway spruce seed-lings that had either wintered in nursery cold storage or had been planted out in autumn 2001. The damage was charac-terised by a <b>top</b> <b>shoot</b> dieback. Two visually distinct types of necroses were located either on the upper or {{lower part of the}} 2001 -year-shoot. Isolations from the upper stem necroses rendered Gremmeniella abietina, while Phomop-sis sp. was isolated mostly from the lower stem necroses. RAMS (random amplified microsatellites) profiling indi-cated that the G. abietina strains associated with diseased nursery seedlings belonged to LTT (large-tree type) eco-type, and inoculation tests confirmed their pathogenicity on Norway spruce seedlings. Phomopsis sp. was not patho-genic in inoculation tests, this implying it may be a second-ary colonizer. We describe here the Gremmeniella – asso-ciated shoot dieback symptoms on Norway spruce seed-lings and conclude that the unusual disease outburst was related to the Gremmeniella epidemic caused by the LTT ecotype on large Scots pines in 2001. The role of Phomop-sis sp. in the tissue of diseased Norway spruce seedlings is yet unclear...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMAppleT is an {{in silico}} functional-structural plant model {{that has been}} built for {{simulating}} architectural development of apple trees. It has the capability of representing tree growth within a virtual space where the development of individual organs depends on geometrical traits. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the influence of apple trees x architectural variability on their light interception efficiency. The STAR, namely the silhouette to total area ratio, of leaves, was chosen to evaluate the level of such efficiency. The strategy is to integrate MAppleT with the light interception model provided by the fractalysis module of the VPlants software library. Target values of four major traits (internode length, leaf area, branching angle and <b>top</b> <b>shoot</b> diameter), are varied in range previously observed in a segregating population of apple hybrids. A sensitivity analysis based on polynomial and generalised additive models was performed for highlighting the most influential trait on light interception and suggesting the optimal combination(s) of traits leading to the highest STAR. The contribution of stochastic processes that pilot tree topology in MAppleT is also investigated in the sensitivity analysis. This study not only provides a time- and resource-saving alternative for data collection, but also sets a methodology for ideotype definition and further genetic improvement of apple trees...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTop-shoot {{cuttings}} {{were planted}} {{with the whole}} tuber (as a control) at different dates using three spacings at the Horticultural Research Farm of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University to evaluate the performance of top-shoots as planting material and to determine the optimum time of planting and the optimum spacing for top-shoot cuttings as planting material for breeder seed production. The survival of <b>top</b> <b>shoot</b> cuttings was more than 97. 8 % irrespective of the planting time and plant spacing. Significant variations were found among the treatment combinations for plant height at 45 and 60 days after planting (DAP), foliage coverage at 45 and 60 DAP, number of branches per plant, number of tubers per plant, individual tuber weight, tuber yields per plant and per hectare yield. The highest mean yield (46. 57  t/ha) was produced by whole tubers planted on 10 November with 50  ×  10  cm spacing which was similar to whole tubers planted on 1 November with 50  ×  10  cm spacing. On the other hand, plants from top-shoot cuttings yielded 34. 82  t/ha in T 3 S 2 followed by T 1 S 1 (33. 34  t/ha), T 3 S 3 (30. 70  t/ha). The total yield of potato increased 122. 8 % from a single, early crop due to taking two repeated cuttings compared with 89. 6 % from a single late crop. Early planting of top-shoot cuttings with closer spacing (50  ×  10  cm and 50  ×  15  cm) is recommended for the multiplication of breeder seed potato...|$|E
40|$|The {{apple canker}} disease (aka European canker), {{which is caused}} by the fungus Neonectria distissima, infects apple trees and can cause severe damage on both the fruit and the tree itself. For some time it has been assumed that apple trees may be {{infected}} as early as the planting stage. There is, however, no previous documentation on rootstock infection. If rootstocks can get infected, how does this happens and what is the entry point for the infection? This project has investigated the issue by means of testing different kinds of rootstocks and different methods of inoculation. The different methods used were inoculation by pricking the rootstock with needles containing inoculum, spraying the rootstocks with a spore suspension and dripping spore suspension in the wound made after cutting off the <b>top</b> <b>shoot</b> of the rootstock. Inoculation occurred at different dates, and the rootstocks received different treatments of pinching and topping. The experiments showed that all rootstocks may become infected by apple canker, although there was a difference in how effective the different methods of inoculation were. The rootstocks which were inoculated by needles containing inoculum had a high probability of developing infections and showed symptoms of infection after four weeks. Needles with inoculum inserted into the shoots provoked earlier symptoms than those inserted into the stem. Inoculation by spraying the rootstocks with a spore suspension developed very little infection, and did not show symptoms until eleven weeks after inoculation. Results also showed that, the rootstocks were most prone to develop infections if they were pinched the same day as they were sprayed with spore suspension. Rootstocks pinched one or three days before being sprayed with spore suspension developed fewer infections. All rootstocks tested, M 9, B 9, M 26 and MM 106, developed infections of apple canker, and {{there was no difference in}} susceptibility. When wounds were made in the rootstock, either by pricking with a needle or by cutting the top off, the infection levels after inoculation were high. If the wounds were made by pinching off the shoots, however, the probability of infection was low. Wounds in younger tissue were more susceptible for infection than wounds in older tissue. The results show that to reduce the risk of infection of apple canker, it is important to be considerate while handling rootstocks to avoid damages. When pinching, topping and grafting one should take precautions to avoid apple canker and be aware of potential sources of inoculum in the near vicinity. M-P...|$|E
