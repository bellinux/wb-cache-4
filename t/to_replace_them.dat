5000|$|From the 1920s General Motors {{and others}} started buying up {{streetcar}} systems across the United States {{with a view}} <b>to</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with buses in {{what became known as}} the Great American Streetcar Scandal. This was accompanied by a continuing series of technical improvements: pneumatic [...] "balloon" [...] tires during the early 1920s, monocoque body construction in 1931, automatic transmission in 1936, diesel engines in 1936, 50+ passengers in 1948, and air suspension in 1953.|$|R
5|$|In February 1886 a fire {{destroyed}} all of Farsari's negatives, and he then toured Japan {{for five}} months taking new photographs <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them.</b> He reopened his studio in 1887. Despite his losses in the fire, by 1889 Farsari's stock comprised about 1,000 Japanese landscapes and genre portraits.|$|E
5|$|Proposed further {{upgrades}} included integrated combat {{search and}} rescue locator systems and improved early warning and anti-jam self-protection systems, and the Air Force recognized that the A-10's engine power was sub-optimal and had been planning <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> with more powerful engines since at least 2001 at an estimated cost of $2 billion.|$|E
5|$|The B-2 and C-2, {{introduced}} in 1949, allowed vibrato to be enabled or disabled on each manual separately. In 1954, the B-3 and C-3 models were introduced {{with the additional}} harmonic percussion feature. Despite several attempts by Hammond <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them,</b> these two models remained popular and stayed in continuous production through early 1975.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea of a}} full {{conversion}} was a {{sharp contrast to the}} Christianization movements by the Jesuits in Canada, who were looking to add Christianity to the Natives' existing beliefs as opposed <b>to</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>them.</b> While some Natives were quick to take on the conversion some did not like the idea of a {{full conversion}}. The process was not always an easy one and there were many reasons for the conversions themselves.|$|R

5|$|The voivodes had power {{concentrated}} in their hands, impelling the monarchs <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> frequently: forty-three voivodes ruled between 1199 and 1288. Monarchs usually refrained from appointing as voivode noblemen who owned Transylvanian estates. Michael of the Kacsics clan {{was the first}} voivode to receive a land grant in the province, around 1210. However, these originally uninhabited lands along the upper courses of the river Mureș (Maros) were confiscated in 1228.|$|E
5|$|The wood beams {{under the}} glass canopy were {{determined}} to be defective in 2014, and a plan was made <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> in September 2015 with steel beams. ZGF agreed to pay $602,000 to replace the wood beams, with the city paying an additional $188,000 to upgrade to steel beams.|$|E
5|$|Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram, is the {{principal}} {{of a high school}} named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi. As a child, she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. Conditions at the school deteriorate due to mismanagement by Gopalam's nephew, A. K. Raju, an amateur detective. This is exacerbated when Panthulu, an ayurvedic doctor, teaches the children. Gopalam decides <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> with a male and a female graduate (preferably a married couple) capable of training his younger daughter Sita in singing besides teaching children at the school.|$|E
50|$|As a result, Admiral Nakhimov had {{probably}} the heaviest broadside (six 203 mm guns and five 152 mm guns) {{of all the}} armoured cruisers built in the 19th century. Unfortunately, her guns quickly became obsolete. Consideration was given <b>to</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with quick-firing 152 mm guns (with eleven in a broadside), {{but it was not}} done due to the limited resources of Russian industry before the war with Japan. As well as steam engines, Nakhimov, like Imperieuse, was initially fitted with a full brig rigging, but this proved to lack utility and was eventually removed in 1898-1899.|$|R
50|$|The Qizilbash {{remained}} {{an important part}} of the Safavid executive apparatus, even though ethnic Caucasians had come <b>to</b> largely <b>replace</b> <b>them.</b> For example, even in the 1690s, when ethnic Georgians formed the mainstay of the Safavid military, the Qizilbash still played a significant role in the army.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, {{there were}} very few monks remaining, who asked the Chemin Neuf Community <b>to</b> come and <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> in their mission of prayer and {{welcoming}} visitors.|$|R
5|$|In August 2008, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} redesign the buildings on the island, and six designs were submitted. One of the designs removed the existing buildings and piers <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> with walking paths, and added a large curvilinear concrete building to the island. The design called for many windows in the building to create a large panorama of the surrounding seascape. In September 2010 Urban Splash placed the pier up for sale, citing a downfall in business caused by the recession as their reason.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} was successful, as the club {{narrowly}} won the Lancashire League title on goal average, over Blackpool. They {{also won the}} Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton. The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £130 <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them.</b> Following their success, Liverpool reapplied to the Football League. This application was successful, {{mainly because of the}} resignations of Accrington and Bootle from the Second Division. Liverpool's original strip had been blue and white chequered shirts and white shorts, similar to those of their neighbours Everton. From 1894 they changed to red shirts and white shorts.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 28 August, Madness {{played the}} Rock en Seine festival near Paris, {{on the same}} night where Oasis {{brothers}} Noel and Liam Gallagher engaged in a physical altercation, resulting in the split of the band. As Oasis cancelled their headlining slot, Madness, even though having played earlier in the evening, were asked <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them.</b> They accepted the invitation and both of their sets during the festival were said to have been well received.|$|E
25|$|After 1928 PR {{retained}} a few 395 class 0-6-0s for shunting, {{but they were}} approaching 50 years old so in 1934 PR obtained three purpose-built 0-6-0T shunting locomotives from Nasmyth, Wilson <b>to</b> start <b>replacing</b> <b>them.</b> These were designated class N and PR took delivery of seven more in the period 1935–38.|$|R

50|$|Although {{there are}} {{currently}} no official plans <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the MP 59 on Line 11, the STIF has expressed plans <b>to</b> eventually <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> with the MP 14, a brand new class of rubber-tyred rolling stock. This new rolling stock would be deployed as an eight-car, fully automated version for Line 14. However, {{it is possible that}} a manually driven version made of five-car formations may be developed for Line 11, as well as <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> the MP 73 stock on Line 6.|$|R
5|$|Public {{and artistic}} {{opinion of the}} new pieces was, and remains, mixed. In 1915, Mint {{officials}} began plans <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them,</b> after the design's minimum term expired in 1916. The Mint issued Barber dimes and quarters in 1916 to meet commercial demand, but {{before the end of}} the year, the Mercury dime, Standing Liberty quarter, and Walking Liberty half dollar had begun production. Most dates in the Barber coin series are not difficult to obtain, but the 1894 dime struck at the San Francisco Mint (1894-S), with a mintage of 24, is a great rarity.|$|E
5|$|Serrate {{was first}} fitted to Beaufighter Mk. VIF {{aircraft}} of No. 141 Squadron RAF in June 1943. They began operations using Serrate {{on the night}} of 14 June, and by 7 September had claimed 14 German fighters shot down, for 3 losses. The squadron was later handed to No. 100 Group RAF, who handled special operations within Bomber Command including jamming and similar efforts. In spite of their successes, {{it was clear that the}} Beaufighter lacked the speed needed to catch the German aircraft, and Mosquitoes began <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> late in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The English Benedictine Reform or Monastic Reform of the English {{church in}} the late tenth century was a {{religious}} and intellectual movement in the later Anglo-Saxon period. In the mid-tenth century almost all monasteries were staffed by secular clergy, who were often married. The reformers sought <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them</b> with celibate contemplative monks following the Rule of Saint Benedict. The movement was inspired by European monastic reforms, and the leading figures were Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester, and Oswald, Archbishop of York.|$|E
40|$|In {{automobile}} accidents, the "seatbelt syndrome" (SBS) {{consists of}} a constellation of injuries, predominantly involving thoraco-lumbar vertebral fractures and intraabdominal organ injury. A recent amendment to Irish legislation has made the wearing of seatbelts mandatory for all rear seated passengers {{in an effort to}} protect children. Whilst rear seatbelts result in a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality following road traffic accidents (RTA), we present a case in which the rear lap seatbelt caused severe abdominal injuries. It is evident that the current rear seat lapbelt system is an inferior design associated with a significant morbidity and mortality when compared to three-point harness system and consideration should be given <b>to</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> in all motor vehicles...|$|R
50|$|Picarte asked other Chilean mathematicians examine {{his work}} {{but did not}} receive an {{enthusiastic}} response. He tried to sell the copyrights for it at a very low price {{so that it could}} be published and distributed, but was unable to find a buyer. He then applied for support from the government but received the same response as from his peers: indifference and incredulity. This may have been because there were very few mathematicians in Chile at the time able to review or check his work. Lalande, who had produced the existing, widely distributed algorithm tables, was also a famous French astronomer and mathematician, so there was some resistance <b>to</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>them</b> with something new.|$|R

5|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, the only surviving {{items of the}} coronation regalia were a 12th-century spoon and three ceremonial swords. (Some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the Crown.) Detailed records of old regalia survived, and replacements were made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 based on drawings {{from the time of}} Charles I. For the coronation of Charles II, gems were rented because the treasury could not afford <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wilde was {{initially}} {{buried in the}} Cimetière de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery, inside the city. His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. It was commissioned by Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment {{to be made for}} his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950. The modernist angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male genitalia, which have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1916, {{thirteen}} German light cruisers {{had been}} lost in the course of World War I. <b>To</b> <b>replace</b> <b>them,</b> the Kaiserliche Marine ordered ten new cruisers built to a modified Königsberg class design. All ten ships were laid down in 1915 and 1916. Cöln was built by the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Bremen. Wiesbaden and Rostock were built at AG Vulcan in Stettin, and Leipzig, Ersatz Cöln, and Ersatz Emden were ordered from the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen. Dresden and Magdeburg were built at the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel, while Frauenlob and Ersatz Karlsruhe were built by the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel.|$|E
