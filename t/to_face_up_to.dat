40|$|The {{classical}} liberal tradition {{responded to}} the challenge of religious pluralism by defending the principle of tolerance. However, this principle encounters limitations when it comes <b>to</b> <b>facing</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> cultural pluralism. The article shows these limitations and suggests that the idea of multicultural politics developed by Will Kymlicka makes it possible to go beyond them. This step can only be grounded in a conception of recognition which questions some of the normative premises of liberal political philosophy, particularly the one-sided valorization of negative liberty and the opposition between the politics of equality and the politics of difference...|$|R

5|$|During the decade, Themistocles {{continued}} to advocate {{the expansion of}} Athenian naval power. The Athenians were certainly aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended; Darius's son and successor, Xerxes I, had continued the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Themistocles seems to have realised that for the Greeks to survive the coming onslaught required a Greek navy that could hope <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Persian navy, and he therefore attempted to persuade the Athenians to build such a fleet. Aristides, as champion of the zeugites (the upper, 'hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.|$|E

O.B. rushed to Max's side and held him, soon after he died in O.B.'s arms and Steph arrived too late to say goodbye. Steph was overwhelmed with grief, and refused to leave her flat she shared with Max or wouldn't take off her wedding dress, until a visit from the priest helps her <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her responsibilities for Tom.

25|$|The growth {{pace that}} the Moroccan economy {{witnessed}} {{since the beginning}} of the 1998–2007 decade has generated significant progress in terms of national income, employment and living standards. However, the results obtained show considerable disparities in terms of the distribution of the fruit of this growth, whether between the production factors, the socio-economic groups or the urban and rural areas. In fact, the national income grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% during the 1998–2007 decade. This improvement in the national income however seems to be insufficient <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the discrepancies in terms of living standards and the scale of deficits at the social level.|$|E

25|$|The third first-person {{narration}} from Alhambra follows, {{which is}} much the same as the second. We then have “The End”, which takes us to the Smart home once they return from holiday. The house has been emptied of all possessions – we must assume, as the family do, by Amber – leaving nothing but the answering machine, which contains messages forcing Magnus, Michael and Eve <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> their past. Magnus and Astrid seem freed and excited by the experience of losing their possessions, their past – Michael also seems to find some redemption. Eve, however, runs away from the family, embarking on a round-the-world tour – eventually ending up in America, where she goes in search of her old family home. “The End” ends, ominously, with Eve seeming to take up Amber’s mantle, arriving at someone’s house as an uninvited guest. The book then finishes with a short section from Alhambra, reinforcing her connection to the cinema.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{uncontrolled}} public {{decisions have}} led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes {{the rule of law}} by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.|$|E
25|$|Mehmet {{proceeds}} {{to make things}} infinitely worse for himself soon after, when he stakes his house and business on a bet, loses and swiftly disappears leaving his wife, Guizin (Ishia Bennison), <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the consequences. A then homeless Guzin arrives at Ali and his wife Sue's (Sandy Ratcliff) doorstep {{with the news that}} Mehmet had beaten her, and she isn't ever returning to him. Ali and Sue are forced to take Guizin and her three children, Murat, Rayif and Emine (Pelin Ahmet) into their one bedroom apartment. Mehmet returns to Walford in May 1987 and he manages to persuade his long suffering wife to give their marriage another chance. However, his promises to Guizin prove to be hollow as soon after he decides that the barmaid Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) is to be the next sexual conquest. Donna refuses his advances, but can't resist informing Guizin about his offer and Guizin and Donna nearly fight on New Year's Eve that year. Guizin and Mehmet's marriage is highly turbulent and they are always involved in intense arguments, mainly concerning money and gambling. In 1988 Mehmet and Guzin become partners in Ali's café after Sue gives up working to look after her baby. Mehmet often clashes with his wife about the amount of time he takes off to gamble and the way the café is run. Later in the year Mehmet and Ali run up huge gambling debts to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), manageress of Strokes wine bar, and who {{is also a member of}} the criminal underworld known as The Firm. Desperate for money the two turn to their café employee, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), for a loan. He agrees, but charges his employers 10 percent interest and later, when they cannot meet the repayments, he demands a stake in the café. The brothers refuse, but the debt eventually leads to Ali losing the café to Ian the following year.|$|E

500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, {{prominent}} Latin American dictators {{have included the}} Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, among others. As an outside influence, United States interference in Latin American politics is controversial and has often been severely criticized. As García Calderon noted {{as far back as}} 1925: [...] "Does it want peace or is it controlled by certain interests?" [...] As a theme in the dictator novel, the link between U.S. imperialism {{and the power of the}} tyrant is very important. Dictators in Latin America have accepted military and financial support from the United States when it suited them, but have also turned against the United States, using anti-American campaigning to gain favour with the people.

Giving it 3.5 out of 4 stars, USA Today writer Elysa Gardner described the album's sound and lyrics as [...] "piercingly direct". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot and Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times awarded it 3 out of 4 stars. Kot believed that the album {{would have been better}} without the songs referencing sexuality, but still considered it to be [...] "fascinating" [...] while Roberts believed that Rebel Heart stood out [...] "sturdily" [...] because of its production. Writing for The Boston Globe, James Reed opined that the album was a: [...] "welcome detour in the artist's recent discography... her most satisfying effort in a decade and nimbly connects the dots between Madonna's various eras and guises". Critic Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle called Rebel Heart: [...] "a complex, consistently strong album".|$|E
500|$|Both the House and Senate passed SOF reform bills, {{and these}} {{went to a}} conference {{committee}} for reconciliation. Senate and House conferees forged a compromise. The bill called for a unified combatant command headed by a four-star general for all SOF, an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a coordinating board for low-intensity conflict within the National Security Council, and a new Major Force Program (MFP-11) for SOF (the so-called [...] "SOF checkbook"). The final bill, attached as a rider to the 1987 Defense Authorization Act, amended the Goldwater-Nichols Act and {{was signed into law}} in October 1986. Congress clearly intended to force DOD and the Administration <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the realities of past failures and emerging threats. DOD and the Administration were responsible for implementing the law, and Congress subsequently had to pass two additional bills to ensure proper implementation. The legislation promised to improve SOF in several respects. Once implemented, MFP-11 provided SOF with control over its own resources, better enabling it to modernize the force. Additionally, the law fostered interservice cooperation: a single commander for all SOF promoted interoperability among the forces assigned to the same command. The establishment of a four-star Commander in Chief and an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict eventually gave SOF a voice in the highest councils of the Defense Department.|$|E
