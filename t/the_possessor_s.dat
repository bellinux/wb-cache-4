40|$|In Mandarin Chinese topic {{constructions of}} <b>the</b> <b>possessor,</b> {{optional}} resumptive pronouns (RP) seem to occur. Meanwhile, the data also show {{a difference in}} the extractability of <b>the</b> <b>possessor,</b> i. e., <b>the</b> so-called subject-object asymmetry in extractability (Huang 1982). That is, when <b>the</b> <b>possessor</b> of a subject possessive phrase is topicalized/left-dislocated, a gap is grammatical, and an RP is also allowed; when <b>the</b> <b>possessor</b> of an object possessive phrase is topicalized, a gap is disallowed, and an RP saves the otherwise illicit extraction of <b>the</b> <b>possessor.</b> This paper first argues that the Chinese possessive phrase has a phrase structure that resembles the English counterpart, and adopts Abney’s (1987) DP-Hypothesis for the Chinese possessive phrase. Based on the Left Branch Condition (LBC; Ross 1986), the paper then proposes the Symmetrical Hypothesis, i. e., extraction of <b>the</b> <b>possessor</b> is equally illegal from either argument position.

5000|$|In {{terms of}} semantics, {{linguists}} can see three {{different types of}} relationships based on these constructions.

Kinship is a bit strange because it appears in all three categories. Linguists do not know why this is. They can only assume that it is because of historical reasons.
