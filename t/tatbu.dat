500|$|K'inich Yat Ahk II (...) , {{also known}} as Ruler 7, was the last ajaw of Piedras Negras, an ancient Maya {{settlement}} in Guatemala. He ruled during the Late Classic Period, from 781 to roughly 808 AD. Possibly a descendant of Itzam K'an Ahk II, K'inich Yat Ahk II ascended the throne upon {{the death of his}} brother, the sixth ajaw of the site, Ha' K'in Xook. While K'inich Yat Ahk II presided over the destruction of the rival Maya site Pomona, his reign seems to have ended with the capture of Piedras Negras by K'inich <b>Tatbu</b> Skull IV of Yaxchilan. Itzam K'an Ahk II left behind several monuments, including stelae at Piedras Negras, a stone seat known as Throne 1 which records either the death or abdication of Ha' K'in Xook, and Panel 3 which recounts the exploits of Itzam K'an Ahk II.|$|E
500|$|K'inich Yat Ahk II's rule {{came to an}} {{end when}} Piedras Negras was {{captured}} by K'inich <b>Tatbu</b> Skull IV, the last king of Yaxchilan, in 808 AD; Lintel 10 at Yaxchilan directly names K'inich Yat Ahk II as a captive of the Yaxchilan ajaw. There is evidence that troops from Yaxchilan attacked Piedras Negras and razed it, as several willful burnings have been documented around the site, and Throne 1 was deliberately dismantled. In the 1930s, certain researchers used these signs as evidence that the site had undergone a [...] "peasants revolt" [...] but this idea has largely been rejected by contemporary scholars. Regardless, Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube, and Mayanist Stephen D. Houston argue that the Piedras Negras dynasty may have survived after the capture and death of K'inich Yat Ahk II until c. 810 AD. Afterwards, however, the center collapsed and Piedras Negras was abandoned.|$|E
