In whole cells of the ΔgalK strain, the isomerase-catalyzed reaction exhibited an equilibrium shift toward <b>tagatose,</b> producing a <b>tagatose</b> fraction of 68 % at 37 °C, whereas the purified l-arabinose isomerase gave a <b>tagatose</b> equilibrium fraction of 36 %. These equilibrium fractions are close to those predicted from the measured equilibrium constants of the isomerization reaction catalyzed in whole cells and by the purified enzyme.

40|$|Introduction: D-tagatose is {{a natural}} low-calorie bulk {{sweetener}} (1. 5 kcal/g) showing 92 % of the sweetness of sucrose. It is low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and has prebiotic properties. Besides this wide range of healthy benefits, D-tagatose can also be applied as flavour enhancer and flavour creator in many applications. <b>Tagatose</b> significantly reduces the lingering sweetness and the bitter and metallic off-flavour of high intensity sweeteners. The natural occurrence of D-tagatose is however too limited for the increasing interest in this alternative sweetener. Chemical production of D-tagatose from D-galactose is economically not feasible due to byproduct formation and complex waste water treatment steps. A biocatalysed process using an immobilised L-arabinose isomerase enzyme for galactose isomerisation is therefore part of this study. Materials and methods: A wild type L-arabinose isomerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus is used as enzyme source for bioconversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose with Escherichia coli (BL 21) strain as expression host. Cells are harvested from culture broth by centrifugation and are resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) or ringer solution. Different biomass concentrations are immobilised with 5 % v/v alginate in a 1 / 1 biomass/alginate volumetric ratio. Biomass concentration is varied between 1. 3 and 6. 5 %. Batch conversion experiments are performed in a thermostatic shaking bath at 60 °C. Bead concentration is varied between 10 and 30 %. A galactose solution of 360 g/l is used as substrate, containing 1 mM MnCl 2 as co-factor at pH 7. Samples are analysed by HPLC with refractive index detection. Results and discussion: <b>Tagatose</b> production increases with a higher biomass concentration immobilised in alginate. By varying the biomass concentration from 1. 3 to 6. 5 % at a bead concentration of 20 %, the <b>tagatose</b> concentration obtained after 24 hours increases from 27 to 65 g/l. The increase in <b>tagatose</b> production is however not linearly correlated to the biomass concentration. A similar conclusion can be drawn for {{the influence of the}} bead concentration. At a biomass concentration of 3. 3 % w/v, <b>tagatose</b> concentration increases from 29 to 56 g/l for an increase in bead concentration of 10 to 30 %. No significant influence of the diluent of the biomass is noticed on <b>tagatose</b> production. What’s innovative: An enzymatic bioprocess is developed and optimised for production of D-tagatose from D-galactose. Besides the unique benefits of <b>tagatose</b> for many food applications (low caloric value, low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and prebiotic properties, less lingering artificial sweetener aftertaste), the application of an L-arabinose isomerase for production of D-tagatose results in a highly selective and environmentally friendly production process, which is not yet available on the current industrial market.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the type of carbonyl group of the sugar on the structural changes of proteins during glycation, an exhaustive structural characterization of glycated β-lactoglobulin with galactose (aldose) and <b>tagatose</b> (ketose) has been carried out. Conjugates were prepared via Maillard reaction at 40 and 50 °C, pH 7, and aw = 0. 44. The progress of the Maillard reaction was followed by indirect formation of Amadori and Heyns compounds, advanced glycation end products, and brown polymers. The structural characterization of glycoconjugates was conducted by using a number of analytical techniques such as RP-HPLC, isoelectric focusing, MALDI-ToF, SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and spectrofluorimetry (tryptophan fluorescence). In addition, the surface hydrophobicity of the β-lactoglobulin glycoconjugates was also assessed. The results showed a higher reactivity of galactose than <b>tagatose</b> to form the glycoconjugates, probably due to the higher electrophilicity of the aldehyde group. At 40 °C, more aggregation was produced when β-lactoglobulin was conjugated with <b>tagatose</b> as compared to galactose. However, at 50 °C hardly any difference was observed in the aggregation produced by galactose and <b>tagatose.</b> These results afford more insight into the importance of the functional group of the carbohydrate moiety during the formation of protein-carbohydrate conjugates via Maillard reaction.

40|$|<b>Tagatose</b> is a {{high value}} low calorie {{sweetener}} that {{is used as a}} sugar substitute in the food and pharmaceutical industry. The production of <b>tagatose</b> requires the conversion of galactitol- 1 -phosphate to tagatose- 6 -phosphate by galactitol- 1 -phosphate 5 -dehydrogenase (PdGPDH). Theobjective of this work is to study the protein-ligand interaction between PdGPDH and its ligands; galactitol- 1 -phosphate, Zn 2 + and NAD+. Understanding of this mechanism will provide an insight into the possible catalytic events in these domains, thus providing information for potential protein engineering to improve the <b>tagatose</b> production. A 3 D model of PdGPDH was constructed to identify the catalytic and coenzyme binding domains. In order to understand the interaction of PdGPDH with its ligands, a docking analysis of PdGPDH-substrate, PdGPDH-Zn 2 + and PdGPDH-NAD+ complex was performed using CDOCKER in Discovery Studio 4. 0 (DS 4. 0). A series of docking events were performed to find the most stable binding interaction for the enzyme and its ligands. This study found that Cys 37, His 58, Glu 59, Glu 142 residues from PdGPDH form an active site pocket similar to known GPDH. A catalytic Zn 2 + binding domain and a cofactor NAD+binding domain with strong hydrogen bonding contacts with the substrate and the cofactor were identified.

The aforementioned advantages and the allocation of a Generally Recognized As Safe status in 2001 by the Food and Drug Administration make D-tagatose suitable as ingredient in products for diabetics and in prebiotic and low-calorie food. <b>Tagatose</b> is already used in food, beverages, health products and dietary supplements. <b>Tagatose</b> occurs naturally in some fruits (apple, pineapple, orange …) and various dairy products (sterilized milk …), although in too low quantities for various industrial applications.

Due to the complexity and low yields as well as environmental implications the chemical production of <b>tagatose</b> was stopped. D-Tagatose can also be formed starting from D-galactose through an enzymatic catalyzed process with an L-arabinose isomerase (L-AI) enzyme. The L-AI from Geobacillus stearothermophilus is expressed intracellular in E. coli, and subsequently immobilized by encapsulation with alginate.

Immobilization in alginate is simple, quick and inexpensive but has alimited mechanical strength. Improvement of the stability and productivity of the immobilized enzyme is necessary for further implementation. This study is focused on improvement of the stability and conversion degree of immobilized L-AI enzyme. This implies an investigation of innovative support materials/immobilization methods.
