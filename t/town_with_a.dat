5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a <b>town</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{was born}} in Triesen, Liechtenstein, a small <b>town</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{population}} of 4,500, close to the border with Switzerland. He is the younger son of Heinz and Elsbeth, following Patrick Burgmeier, who played football for Vaduz and USV Eschen/Mauren. From a young age, Franz played both football and skied. He played for the Liechtenstein youth team in Swiss competitions from ages 11 to 16, winning the championship when he was 13. However, at 16, a knee injury, which he suffered while skiing, nearly ended his football career and prompted him to stop the former sport.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial <b>town,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by {{improving the quality of}} the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one and a quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E

5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial <b>town,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate {{and some of the}} semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|Commerce {{continued}} to be {{an essential part of}} the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the <b>town,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.|$|E

5|$|During colonial times, {{prior to}} the {{establishment}} of the ACT, the European communities of Ginninderra, Molonglo and Tuggeranong settled in and farmed the surrounding land, raising sheep in the main but also breeding horses and growing grain. The region was also called the Queanbeyan/Yass district, after the two largest towns in the area. The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities. In 1882, the first allotments in the village of Hall – named after early pastoralist Henry Hall – were sold. By 1901, it was an established <b>town</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hotel, coachbuilder, blacksmith, butcher, shoemaker, saddler, dairy and two stores.|$|E

5|$|Ikata {{is a small}} <b>town,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{population}} of 10,637 as of March 31, 2014. The total land area of the town is 94.37km2, making the population density 113 persons per km2. However, much of the land on the peninsula is quite mountainous and not suited for development; the population density of the individual settlements, which are squeezed into the small bay areas {{in the foothills of}} the mountains, is much higher. Extrapolating from data based on the most recent land survey, only 3.21% of the town's land is inhabited; this puts the population density at a much higher 3,510 persons/kilometer-squared.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the New Zealand attack progressed well, but the German {{defenders}} regained their composure and {{the attack}} lost momentum against heavily fortified defensive positions. By 21:00, the NZ 24th Infantry Battalion had fought {{its way in}} slow house to house fighting to {{the centre of the}} town, but were pinned down with no prospect of further progress without significant armoured support. However, a combination of concealed minefields and well dug in German armour made the task of the Allied tanks impossible. In the early hours of 8 December, the New Zealand commander—Bernard Freyberg—ordered a withdrawal from the <b>town</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view to renewing the attack after further softening up from artillery and bombers.|$|E

Terlecki, a stridently pro-Western intellectual with a reputation for mocking the communist establishment, was particularly angered, and himself drove Młynarczyk to the airport, where the players continued their protests. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed Młynarczyk to travel with the team.|$|E

5|$|The smog was {{compared}} to the 1948 smog in Donora, Pennsylvania and the Great Smog of London of 1952, both of which lasted five days.
