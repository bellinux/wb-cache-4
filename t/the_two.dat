5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When <b>the</b> <b>two</b> vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E

5|$|As {{the top ten}} took to {{the track}} for the final part of qualifying, Nico Rosberg was unable to beat his time set in Q2 with his first fast lap. Hamilton however {{improved}} on his time, being more than three-tenths of a second faster than Rosberg. When both drivers were unable to improve on their times with their second timed laps, Hamilton took the 44th pole position of his career. Row two was taken up by <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Finns, Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, who narrowly beat <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Lotuses of Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado. Both Lotus drivers had emerged from their pit boxes simultaneously for their final timed laps, entering the track side-by-side. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> Red Bulls finished eighth and ninth, splitting <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Force India cars of Nico Hülkenberg and Sergio Pérez.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), <b>the</b> <b>two</b> materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining <b>the</b> <b>two</b> materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E

2500|$|To get <b>the</b> <b>two's</b> {{complement}} of a binary number, the bits are inverted, or [...] "flipped", {{by using the}} bitwise NOT operation; the value of 1 is then added to the resulting value, ignoring the overflow which occurs when taking <b>the</b> <b>two's</b> {{complement of}} 0.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> term <b>two's</b> {{complement}} {{can mean}} either a number format or a mathematical operator.

The statement [...] "convert [...] to two's complement" [...] may be ambiguous, since it could describe either the process of representing [...] in two's-complement notation without changing its value, or the calculation of <b>the</b> <b>two's</b> complement, which is the arithmetic negative of [...] if two's complement representation is used.|$|R
