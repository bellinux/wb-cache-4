We compared men and women, according to age group, of five metropolitan areas of Brazil (Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo), in the year 2000. To generate the life expectanciesand to measure the gains in years of life we used a life <b>table</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>decrements.</b> The datahad been collected in Datasus (mortality) and IBGE (population). Our results showed thatlife expectancies in the metropolitan areas of Recife, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo are morevulnerable to external causes and homicides. In Recife metropolitan area, for example, in theabsence of the deaths by external causes, the male life expectancy at birth would increase by 4. 22 years. We conclude that the deaths due to external causes and homicides, in the mainmetropolitan areas of Brazil, are causing people, mainly young males, to live less than theycould...|$|R

40|$|Noting the {{similarity}} between the illusion decrement and selective adaptation paradigms, Long has challenged the view that illusion decrement effects reflect a strategic [...] {{as opposed to a}} structural [...] underlying mechanism, and has called for further research on this issue. To investigate the confound between prolonged free inspection and repeated trials in the standard decrement procedure, the effects of three inspection conditions (continuous, intermittent, and immediate) on the magnitude of the overestimation Mueller-Lyer illusion have been assessed under two levels of trials (a total of two or six judgments). Significant illusion decline was found only under conditions of repeated trials, with either continuous or intermittent inspection. These findings do not support the predictions of purely structural theories (including neural adaptation and efferent readiness theories), according to which degree <b>of</b> <b>decrement</b> should be determined solely by viewing time. Instead, the data demonstrate that illusion decrement is a product of practice, providing converging evidence for the view <b>of</b> <b>decrement</b> as involving a cognitive 'recalibration' or learning process...|$|R

For basalt projectile points, the Law <b>of</b> Monotonic <b>Decrement</b> is exemplified during the Late Martis temporal phase. For obsidian artifacts, there appears to be an optimal distance as opposed to the Law <b>of</b> Monotonic <b>Decrement,</b> except when certain distances from sources are clustered, in which case the Law <b>of</b> Monotonic <b>Decrement</b> is fairly closely followed during the Early Martis temporal phase.

40|$|Currently, {{multiple}} decrement {{theory is}} based on the assumption that competing causes <b>of</b> <b>decrement</b> are stochastically independent, even though this assumption is usually not true in reality. This paper presents well-known results in the theory of dependent competing risks that are fun-damental in extending multiple decrement theory towards a dependent decrement theory. First, the state of the art is examined and the results that are based on the independence assumption are identified. Next, we use the well-developed theory of copula functions to model dependence, and we present a theorem that characterizes the mathematical relationship between the crude and net probabilities when the decrements are depen-dent. We also discuss the issue of identifiability and the related issue of measuring the effect of removing causes <b>of</b> <b>decrement.</b> Finally, we use an identifiability result to analyze the effect of removing heart/cerebro-vascular diseases from the U.

The a and b 1 protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö 6976 decreased the rate <b>of</b> <b>decrement</b> to the basal [Ca 2 C]i level and increased the peak of Ca 2 C entry of the P 2 Y 2 -provoked Ca 2 C transients. These effects of Gö 6976 were not caused by an increased permeability of the plasma membrane, since the Mn 2 C and Ba 2 C uptake were not changed by Gö 6976. Similarly, the Na C /Ca 2 C exchanger was not implicated, since the rate <b>of</b> <b>decrement</b> to the basal [Ca 2 C] i level was equally decreased in physiological and Na C-free buffers, {{in the presence of}} Gö 6976. On the contrary, the activity of the sarcoplasmic–endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 C ATPase (SERCA) 2 b was profoundly affected by Gö 6976 since the drug was able to completely inhibit the stimulation of the SERCA 2 b activity elicited by P 2 -purinergic agonists. Finally, the PKC activator phorbol myristate acetate had effects opposite to Gö 6976, in that it markedly increased the rate <b>of</b> <b>decrement</b> to the basal [Ca 2 C] i level after P 2 Y 2 stimulation and also increased the activity of SERCA 2 b. These results suggest that SERCA 2 b plays a role in regulating the sustained phase of Ca 2 C transients caused by P 2 Y 2 stimulation. Journal of Endocrinology (2006) 190, 641 – 64...|$|R

5000|$|De Moivre's law first {{appeared}} in his 1725 Annuities upon Lives, the earliest known example of an actuarial textbook. [...] Despite the name now given to it, de Moivre himself did not consider his law (he called it a [...] "hypothesis") {{to be a true}} description of the pattern of human mortality. Instead, he introduced it as a useful approximation when calculating the cost of annuities. In his text, de Moivre noted that [...] " ... although the Notion <b>of</b> an equable <b>Decrement</b> <b>of</b> Life ... does not exactly agree with the Tables, yet that Notion may successfully be employed in constructing a <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> the Values of Annuities for Ages not inferiour to Twelve ... [...] Furthermore, although his text contained an algebraic demonstration that applied to the entire expected future life span, de Moivre also supplied an algebraic demonstration that applied only to a limited number of years. It was this latter result that was used in his subsequent numerical examples. These examples showed de Moivre using his hypothesis in a piecewise fashion, wherein he assumed that the overall pattern of human mortality could be approximated by several straight-line segments (see his illustration to the right). He wrote that [...] "since the <b>Decrements</b> <b>of</b> Life may without any sensible Error be supposed equal, for any short Interval of Time, it follows that if the whole Extent of Life be divided into several shorter Intervals, ... the Values of Annuities for Life ... may easily be calculated ... conformably to any <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> Observations, and for any Rate of Interest".
