George B. Roberts, president of the railroad, used his social connections to hire Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr. to construct a new station. The new station was constructed on a former freight yard {{on the south side}} of the tracks (across from the previous station), where there was more space for the station. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> <b>also</b> provided better connections for passengers using newly electrified streetcars on Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street to reach the station.|$|E

5|$|Since about 1900, the Black Canyon {{and nearby}} Boulder Canyon had been {{investigated}} for their potential {{to support a}} dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc., which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, {{and some of the}} techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>also</b> presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.|$|E
