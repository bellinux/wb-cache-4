40|$|While {{much has}} been said about the need to promote intraregional trade and the {{importance}} of reducing associated <b>trade</b> <b>costs,</b> quantitative estimates of such costs have been lacking. A new comprehensive measure of international <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> is applied in this paper to calculate ad valorem <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> within and between 4 Asian subregions, including ASEAN and SAARC. Extra-regional <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> of the 4 subregions with free trade areas outside Asia, such as NAFTA and the EU as well as their <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> with China, India, and Japan are also calculated. The analysis concludes with an evaluation of the importance of tariff in overall <b>trade</b> <b>costs.</b> Sharp differences across Asian subregions are identified. ASEAN is found to have much lower intra-subregional <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> than other Asian subregions, as well as mostly lower <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> with free <b>trade</b> areas outside Asia. While SAARC intra-subregional <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> remain exceedingly high, South Asia is found to have made the most progress in reducing such costs since 2003. North and Central Asia, which groups together Russia and landlocked economies in transition, still faces prohibitive trade costs-sometimes exceeding 300 % tariff equivalent. Within the East and North-East Asia subregion, a subset of three countries - Japan, China, and Republic of Korea - is found to have the lowest intra-group <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> of any country groups examined in this paper, although the three countries have not signed free trade agreements with each other. Estimates of <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> between Asian subregions and China, India and Japan, highlight how effective China has been in reducing its <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> with ASEAN as well as other Asian and non-Asian subregions, achieving generally lower international <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> than Japan as of 2007.

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that successful implementation of bilateral or regional trade and economic integration initiatives would have a very significant impact on intraregional trade in Asia and the Pacific. However, {{little is known about}} the level of intraregional <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> in the region and to what extent these costs may have decreased over time. This paper introduces new aggregate and sectoral estimates of bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> in Asia and the Pacific available in an updated and extended version of the ESCAP <b>Trade</b> <b>Cost</b> Database (Version 2). The new data suggests that (1) most countries and subregions have made improvements in reducing trade costs; (2) <b>Trade</b> <b>costs</b> among Asian countries still often exceed the <b>costs</b> of <b>trade</b> of Asian countries with developed countries outside the region; and (3) tariff costs accounts for only a small portion of comprehensive <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> – although tariff cuts account for a large share of overall <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> reduction over the past decade. At the sectoral level, agricultural <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> are systematically found to exceed manufacturing <b>trade</b> <b>costs,</b> even when tariff costs are excluded. The fact that agricultural <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> in many developing countries are twice as high as their <b>trade</b> <b>costs</b> in manufactured goods suggest that focusing trade facilitation efforts on that sector may be particularly productive, especially given the importance of this sector for poverty reduction and more inclusive and sustainable development. <b>trade</b> <b>costs,</b> bilateral <b>trade,</b> Asia and the Pacific, sectoral data, trade facilitation, non-tariff measures...|$|R

50|$|Market {{efficiency}} implies {{stock prices}} fully reflect all {{publicly available information}} instantaneously, thus no investment strategies can systematically earn abnormal returns. Fama (1991) argued that stock prices respond instantaneously and without bias to new value relevant information and that security returns over time are determined only by changes in the market level and individual stock risk. Therefore, there are no profitable investment opportunities from superior analysis, which implies no one can consistently outperform the market. The precondition for this 'strong' definition is that information and <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> are always equal to zero. This is clearly not true in practice.|$|E
