40|$|In its {{rehearing}} of Textron, the First Circuit has {{an opportunity}} to rectify an error and curb unwise recent expansion of work product protection for <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers. In August 2007, a district court denied the government’s petition for enforcement of an IRS summons on Textron Inc. and its subsidiaries for <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers in connection with IRS examinations of the taxpayers’ 1998 to 2001 income tax returns. A divided panel of the First Circuit affirmed in January 2009. In March 2009, the First Circuit withdrew the panel opinion and dissent, and it set the case for en banc hearing on June 2, 2009. Reaction to the various Textron opinions has been mixed. I join those who think the district court and the panel majority erred. Indeed, I believe <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers should never qualify for work product protection. This report does not purport to answer all questions about the work product doctrine generally, or even all questions about the doctrine as applied to <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers. Instead, this report considers a perspective that has not been fully developed in other commentary on Textron and related cases. Specifically, there is a disconnect between the purposes of the work product rule and the decisions shielding <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers. The values animating the rule would not be compromised by IRS access to <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers. In fact, in some respects, those values would be furthered. Part I of this report describes <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers. It also outlines controversy over <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers, both generally and in the context of Textron. Part II describes the purposes the work product doctrine is intended to serve. Part ill shows that enforcement of IRS summonses for <b>tax</b> <b>accrual</b> workpapers would not traduce those purposes and would actually promote them. Part IV suggests that this purpose-based analysis is legitimately available to textualist judges as well as to judges who overtly embrace purposivism as their preferred mode of interpreting statutes and rules...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{literature}} is mixed {{as to whether}} smoothing through accruals indicates higher or lower financial reporting quality (Tucker and Zarowin 2006; Jayaraman 2008; Dechow et al. 2010). Motivated by the unique inter-temporal features and reporting incentives of tax expense, we provide new evidence on this debate by examining the link between smoothing of GAAP effective tax rates (ETRs) {{and the likelihood of}} financial restatements. Different from earnings smoothing’s insignificant relation with restatements, we find that ETR smoothing through <b>tax</b> <b>accruals</b> is associated with a lower likelihood of financial restatement and lower likelihood of tax-related financial reporting fraud. Further investigation reveals that such negative associations are stronger in firms with a higher level of discretion in tax reporting and when the demand and monitoring for transparent reporting is higher.

A respective education for tax issues give auditors by assumption also the ability to know extreme tax planning arrangements and in turn, to make a decision on that in their position as auditors.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} a tax-based fundamental—the ratio of taxto-book income—to prediot earnings growth and stock returns and to explain the earnings-price ratio. This tax fundamental reflects both temporary and permanent book-tax differences as well as <b>tax</b> <b>accruals,</b> suoh as changes in the tax valuation allowance. We find that the tax-to-book income ratio predicts subsequent five-year earnings changes, {{both before and after the}} implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109 in 1993. For the pre-SFAS No. 109 period, the tax information is unrelated to contemporaneous earnings-price ratios and strongly related to subsequent stock returns. Conversely, for the post-SFAS No. 109 period, the tax fundamental is strongly related to contemporaneous earnings-price ratios and only weakly related to subsequent stock returns, indicating improvement over time in investors' perceptions of the implications of the tax information for future earnings. Deferred taxes, a component of our tax fundamental and the focus of recent research, exhibits relatively modest ability to predict earnings or stock returns both before and after the implementation of SFAS No. 109. Finally, throughout the examined period, the taxable income information about future earnings is incremental to that in accruals and cash flows...|$|R

This research report Is aimed at highlighting the problems attached to the recognition of income for tax purposes. Various attempts at taking a snapshot of an entity in the midst of its earnings cycle have been made. An examination of the evolution of those attempts has been undertaken with particular focus on the techniques adopted in the recognition of income for the purposes of determining the liability for income tax. The report incorporates an examination of the basic concepts relating to the recognition of income, the method of income accrual followed in certain foreign tax Jurisdictions, and {{the current state of the}} law in South Africa. The recommendations formulated by the Margo Commission are analysed, and the shortfalls and anomalies in the various interpretations of accrual are demonstrated. The current state of the law, it is submitted, requires that, Income be recognised for tax purposes at the time when the taxpayer becomes unconditionally entitled to the amount in question. Any accrual, including the right to claita payment in the future, should be valued at the time of accrual, and not at the end of the year of assessment, as is suggested by some authors. The current state of the law is plagued with practical difficulties and results in a number of inconsistencies. The basic concepts relating to the recognition of income that are considered to be desirable are not adequately addressed under the current position.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a proportional capital gains tax in an economy with an Austrian sector (with wine and trees) and an ordinary sector. We analyze the effect of capital gains taxation (on both an accrual and a realization basis) on the efficiency with which resources are used within the Austrian sector. Since time is the only input which can be varied in the Austrian sector this amounts to looking at the effect of capital gains taxation on the harvesting time or selling time of assets. Accrual taxation decreases the selling time of Austrian assets. Realization taxation decreases the selling time of some Austrian assets and leaves it unchanged for others. Inflation further reduces the selling time of assets <b>taxed</b> on an <b>accrual</b> basis; often, but not always, inflation increases. the selling time of Austrian assets taxed on a realization basis. These results suggest that the capital gains tax can reduce the holding period of an asset. However, there is a sense in which such taxes (at least when levied on a realization basis) discourage transactions and increase holding periods. It is never profitable to change the ownership of an Austrian asset between the time of the original investment and the ultimate harvesting of the asset for final use. We examine the effect of capital gains taxation on the efficiency of the allocation of investment between sectors. No neutrality principles emerge when ordinary investment income is taxed {{at the same rate as}} capital gains income. We also analyze the effect of the special tax treatment of capital gains at death and find that the current U. S. tax system, under which capital gains taxes are waived at death, encourages investors to hold assets longer than they otherwise would. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} tax legislative battles of the 104 th Congress erupted over the Clinton administration 2 ̆ 7 s proposal to amend the U. S. tax rules applicable to expatriates. The administration proposed taxing the abandonment of either U. S. citizenship or long-term U. S. tax residency. The administration 2 ̆ 7 s proposal responded {{to a number of}} articles in the popular press that described the U. S. tax benefits of expatriation and divulged the names of well-heeled expatriates. Proponents claimed that Congress needed to revise the taxation of expatriates to prevent 2 ̆ 2 billionaire Benedict Arnolds 2 ̆ 2 from avoiding 2 ̆ 2 their fair share 2 ̆ 2 of U. S. income taxes. Opponents argued that the Clinton proposal would affect foreign investment in the United States and compared it to the loathed exit tax imposed by the former Soviet Union on emigrants. After the introduction of the administration 2 ̆ 7 s expatriate provisions, a legislative debate ensued. The Senate favored the administration 2 ̆ 7 s approach, under which an expatriate 2 ̆ 7 s property would be deemed to be sold for its fair market value-marked to market-on the date of expatriation. The House, however, generally favored retaining the existing expatriate regime, under which a tax-motivated expatriate is taxed like a citizen on income from the United States for ten years following expatriation. The House version passed Congress as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and was signed into law on August 21, 1996. In this Article, I argue that Congress should adopt a mark-to-market tax regime for persons and property that enter or leave U. S. residence or trade or business taxation. Mark-to-market taxation embodies sound tax policy. It better reflects the ability-to-pay norm, because it includes in the tax base all changes in a citizen 2 ̆ 7 s net wealth. It also better reflects the norm of economic rationality, because all gains-U. S. and foreign-are taxed. Part II of this Article briefly summarizes the current U. S. income and transfer taxation of citizens, residents, and nonresidents, and discusses the Code provisions that are intended to protect residence basis tax jurisdiction. Part III focuses on the challenges to the U. S. tax system that expatriation poses and argues that mark-to-market taxation is the appropriate response. Part IV addresses policy issues that would arise under an <b>accrual</b> <b>tax</b> system for expatriates and immigrants. Part V discusses the current U. S. expatriate tax regime. Part VI addresses the analogous tax issues raised by foreigners becoming resident aliens or citizens or bringing property into a U. S. trade or business. In addition, Part VII considers some ancillary issues raised by a mark-to-market regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine whether the {{information}} content of book income and taxable income depends on the book-tax conformity, and the book-tax difference consistency, and whether such an effect is incremental to the separate effects of earnings management and tax planning on the informativeness of book income and taxable income. The book-tax conformity and the book-tax difference consistency over time depend on whether the firm decides to engage in earnings management and tax planning. Book-tax conformity refers to the flexibility that a firm has to report taxable income that is different from pretax book income, and consistency of book-tax differences refers to the consistency over time of the relation between book and taxable income. Conformity arises from the similarity between accounting standard and tax laws, and consistency arises from the selection of consistent book and tax accounting methods, even when different methods could have been used for each. We measure book-tax conformity based on the root mean squared error obtained from industry-specific estimates of regression equation which estimates the extent to which pretax book income explain current tax expense, and measure book-tax difference consistency based on the standard deviation of the discretionary component of the differences between book income and taxable income. We measure information content based on correlation with contemporaneous stock returns. Earnings management refers to the use of discretionary accruals to manipulate reported income; we measure earnings management based on the standard deviation of estimated discretionary <b>accruals.</b> <b>Tax</b> planning refers to efforts to reduce tax payable by reducing taxable income; we measure tax planning based on the current effective tax rate, the ratio of current tax expense to pretax book income. In our analysis, we use Korean listed firms with available Korea Investors Services(KIS) -Vaule data from 1985 to 2012. We restrict the sample to non-financial, non-utility firms and have a december year-end. Additionally, firm-years with missing financial data and firm-years which can not estimate effective tax rates are excluded. We delete observations in which any continuous variable lies beyond the highest and lowest 1 % of the distribution for that variable to control for outliers. These data requirements result in a sample of 6, 989 firm-year observations which consist of 2, 485 observations before the financial crisis(1991 - 1997) and 4, 504 observations after the financial crisis(2000 - 2012). We conduct tests documenting (1) the incremental effect of earnings management and tax planning on the relative information content of book income and taxable income, and (2) the relation between book-tax conformity and relative information content of book income and taxable income, and (3) the relation between book-tax difference consistency and relative information content of book income and taxable income. We find that both earnings management and tax planning have opposing effects on the information content of book income and taxable income. However, we do not find a significant relationship between earnings management and information content of taxable income after controlling for tax planning. In order to better capture the joint effect of earnings management and tax planning on the informativeness of book income and taxable income, we introduce book-tax conformity and book-tax difference consistency measure. Consistent with our expectations, we find that the information content of book income is significantly greater for firms with high book-tax conformity and firms with more consistent book-tax differences. But contrary to expectations, we find that the information content of taxable income is significantly lower for firms with high book-tax conformity and firms with more consistent book-tax differences. Based on our results, we conclude that the book-tax conformity and the consistency of book-tax difference captures the effects of both tax planning and earnings management on the information content of book income and taxable income. The effect of taxes on financial reporting has been the focus of extensive research. Our study contributes new findings in this research area. To summarize, we find that while earnings management affects the information content of book income, and tax planning affects the information content of taxable income, tax planning also affects the information content of book income. This finding provides a better understanding of the conditions under which tax rules affect the informativeness of book income. Importantly, we find that book-tax conformity, and book-tax differences consistency affects the information content of book and taxable income, and this relationship is incremental to the separate effects of earnings management and tax planning. These findings suggest that book-tax conformity, and book-tax difference consistency captures the effects of both earnings management and tax planning on the information content of book income and taxable income. ? ??? ????? ????? ??? ?? ??? ???(HY- 2014...|$|R
