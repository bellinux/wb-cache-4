Women wearing ceruse {{achieved}} the white face, however, the white lead that was used to make it is poisonous. Women in this time often contracted lead poisoning which resulted in deaths before the age of 50. Other ingredients used as make-up were sulfur, alum, and <b>tin</b> <b>ash.</b> In addition to using make-up to achieve the pale complexion, women in this era were bled to take the color out of their faces.|$|E

5000|$|Trevor-Roper {{wrote that}} the mind of Hitler was [...] "a terrible phenomenon, {{imposing}} indeed in its granite harshness and yet infinitely squalid in its miscellaneous cumber, like some huge barbarian monolith; the expression of giant strength and savage genius; surrounded by a festering heap of refuse, old <b>tins</b> and vermin, <b>ashes</b> and eggshells and ordure, the intellectual detritus of centuries". Cesarani wrote that Trevor-Roper regarded Hitler, {{in marked contrast to}} Bullock, as a man who was serious about what he said but at the same time, Trevor-Roper's picture of Hitler as a somewhat insane leader, fanatically pursuing lunatic policies, meant paradoxically that it was hard to take Hitler seriously, at least on the basis of Trevor-Roper's writings. Cesarani stated that Trevor-Roper was sincere in his hatred and contempt for the Nazis and everything they stood for but he had considerable difficulty when it came to writing about the complicity and involvement of traditional German elites in National Socialism, because the traditional elites in Germany were so similar in many ways to the British Establishment, which Trevor-Roper identified with so strongly.|$|R
60|$|It is {{difficult}} to disentangle now what I understood at this time and what I have since come to understand, {{but it seems to}} me that even in those childish days I was acutely aware of an invading and growing disorder. The serene rhythms of the old established agriculture, I see now, were everywhere being replaced by cultivation under notice and snatch crops; hedges ceased to be repaired, and were replaced by cheap iron railings or chunks of corrugated iron; more and more hoardings sprang up, and contributed more and more to the nomad tribes of filthy paper scraps that flew before the wind and overspread the country. The outskirts of Bromstead were a maze of exploitation roads that led nowhere, that ended in tarred fences studded with nails (I don't remember barbed wire in those days; I think the Zeitgeist did not produce that until later), and in trespass boards that used vehement language. Broken glass, <b>tin</b> cans, and <b>ashes</b> and paper abounded. Cheap glass, cheap tin, abundant fuel, and a free untaxed Press had rushed upon a world quite unprepared to dispose of these blessings when the fulness of enjoyment was past.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} paper examines {{the effects of}} solid waste {{on the quality of}} underground water in Benin metropolis, Nigeria. The study was bore out of the unregulated manner in which both domestic and industrial wastes are deposited in the streets, river courses, buried, burnt and discarded in refuse heaps. Solid waste commonly generated in Benin metropolis includes papers and cartons, food remnants, glass and bottles, plastic and polythene, <b>tin</b> and metals, <b>ashes</b> and dust, textile and rags, aluminium and other minerals. The analysis of physical, chemical and biological parameters of raw water from eight wells collected around the metropolis close to refuse dumps shows that these wastes produces leachates and gases when they are descomposing and are washed by percolating and infiltrating rain water into ground water. However, most of the water parameters tested fall within WHO recommendations while some are not. And recommendations are made to remedy the situations which include encouraging analysis of raw water, the need for enlightenment campaign, ground water exploration in Benin metropolis should be deep and the principle of resource management should be adhered to. These are Reduced, Reuse, Recycle and Restoration of damage resources and environment I...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to quoting early alchemical texts, the Inner Chapters describe Ge Hong's laboratory experiments. Wu and Davis mention the Baopuzi formula for making mosaic gold [...] "a golden crystalline powder {{used as a}} pigment" [...] from chiyan 赤塩 [...] "red crystal salt" [...] (produced from amethyst, calcite crystal, and alum; Ware 1966:273) and huizhi 灰汁 [...] "limewater".The description of one process deserves special discussion, for it evidently concerns the preparation of stannic sulfide or [...] "mosaic gold" [...] and is perhaps the earliest known description of {{the preparation of this}} interesting substance. Mosaic gold exists in flakes or leaflets which have the color and the luster of gold, it does not tarnish, and is used at present for bronzing radiators, gilding picture frames and similar purposes. As Ko Hung describes the process, [...] "tin sheets, each measuring six inches square by one and two-tenths inches thick, are covered with a one-tenth inch layer of a mud-like mixture of Ch'ih Yen (Red Salt) and Huei Chih (potash-water, limewater), ten pounds of tin to every four of Ch'ih Yen." [...] They are then heated in a sealed earthenware pot for thirty days with horse manure (probably with a smouldering fire of dried manure). [...] "All the <b>tin</b> becomes <b>ash</b> like and interspersed with bean-like pieces which are the yellow gold." [...] The large portion of the metallic tin is converted into some ash-like compound or possibly into the ash-like allotropic modification, gray tin. A small portion of the tin is converted into bean-sized aggregates of flaky stannic sulfide. The yield is poor, for the author says that [...] "twenty ounces of gold are obtained from every twenty pounds of tin used." [...] (1935:232) The authors add, [...] "It seems likely that Ko Hung was personally experienced in the chemistry of tin, for the Chinese say that {{he was the first to}} make tin foil and that he made magic or spirit money out of it." ...|$|R
