40|$|The {{effect of}} {{synthetic}} lipid A analogs on murine spleen cells was studied. <b>The</b> <b>preparations</b> represented D-glucosamine and D-glucosaminyl-beta 1, 6 -D-glucosamine disaccharide derivatives substituted in different combinations by ester- and amide-bound fatty acids and by phosphate groups. Significant mitogenic activity was demonstrated {{with a number}} of synthetic disaccharide preparations; however, their potency was lower than that of lipid A. <b>The</b> synthetic <b>preparations</b> were not mitogenic for spleen cells from C 3 H/HeJ mice. Furthermore, the mitogenicity of <b>the</b> synthetic <b>preparations</b> was abolished after binding with polymyxin B. The results indicate that for expression of mitogenicity, a phosphate group at position 1 of the reducing glucosamine and amide-bound acyloxyacyl residues are important factors. Some of <b>the</b> synthetic <b>preparations</b> containing <b>the</b> diglucosamine backbone and expressing relatively low mitogenicity suppressed B-cell mitogenicity of lipid A. Although these preparations were lytic for erythrocytes, they did not affect the viability of the splenic lymphocytes. Suppression was seen when <b>the</b> synthetic <b>preparations</b> were added simultaneously with or after the lipid A mitogen, but optimal suppression was expressed when <b>the</b> <b>preparations</b> were added to the system 3 h before lipid A. Washing of the cells before the addition of lipid A did not affect the results. The suppression was not due to the induction of suppressor cells by <b>the</b> synthetic <b>preparations.</b> <b>The</b> disaccharide <b>preparations</b> did not inhibit T-cell mitogenicity of concanavalin A. In contrast to <b>the</b> disaccharide <b>preparations,</b> <b>the</b> monosaccharide <b>preparations</b> suppressed mitogenicity of both lipid A and concanavalin A, probably because of their direct toxicity for lymphocytes...|$|R
