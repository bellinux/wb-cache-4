In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>down</b> with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

The weather during the Wednesday run was far from suitable, with a strong easterly wind, rain and poor visibility.

By this time the fog horn on the Skull Martin Lightship could be clearly heard, but with visibility reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>down</b> to less than a mile, it was proving impossible to make the required visual reference to calibrate the speed. The prevailing conditions coupled to the high density of shipping traffic in the area forced an abandonment of the trial. Speed was reduced to , the Ben-my-Chree was swung about, and made passage back to Greenock. The inclement weather lasted into the following day, leading {{to the rest of the}} trials to be held on Friday.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from their}} own 20-yard line, the 49ers began an 11-play drive that ended on a 5-yard {{touchdown}} catch by Bruce from O'Sullivan that cut the Patriots' lead to 27–21. The Patriots responded with a 10-play series of their own; six plays into the drive, Faulk caught a second-down pass and was originally deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>down</b> short of the first down, but the Patriots challenged the play and Faulk {{was found to have}} gained the necessary first down yardage. An offensive pass interference penalty on Moss set up a 3rd and 20 that the Patriots did not convert; Gostkowski then hit a 49-yard line field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 30–21. A third-down sack of O'Sullivan led to a fourth-down interception by O'Neal that gave the Patriots the ball with 2:45 remaining in the game. The 49ers used all of their timeouts during the Patriots' next possession, and after a Patriots punt, the 49ers failed to convert on fourth down to give the Patriots the ball to end the game.|$|E

[...] When asked about Howard's positioning for Arsenal's equaliser, he replied: [...] "Tim wanted three in the wall and he will learn from that. This isn't America." [...] Silvestre denied suggestions that the win gave United a psychological edge over Arsenal: [...] "This is still a pre-season game.

500|$|Following Sonny Bono's {{death in}} a skiing {{accident}} in 1998, Cher delivered a tearful eulogy at his funeral, calling him [...] "the most unforgettable character" [...] she had met. She paid tribute to him by hosting the CBS special Sonny & Me: Cher Remembers, which aired on May 20, 1998. That month, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Later that year, Cher published The First Time, a collection of autobiographical essays of [...] "first-time" [...] events in her life, which critics praised for revealing the singer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>down</b> to earth and genuine. Although the manuscript was almost finished when Sonny died, she could not decide whether to include his death in the book; she feared being criticized for capitalizing on the event. She later told Rolling Stone, [...] "I couldn't ignore it, could I? I might have if I cared more about what people think than what I know is right for me." ...|$|E

[...] NME writer John Doran wrote, [...] "sure enough here are a wealth of rock gems that shine with a warm-hearted, Neil Young-like intensity. Those wanting clangour and dissonance will be disappointed, but everyone else will be pleasantly surprised." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Grayson Currin deemed it a [...] "motley assortment of Sonic Youth nods, acoustic entreaties, and cloying pop-rockers" [...] but that [...] "Ranaldo's opportunity {{to step out of the}} Sonic Youth shadows and into his own proper spotlight is mostly a miss made of mediocrity." [...] Ben Graham from The Quietus summarised the album as: [...] "while it may be traditional in structure, Between the Times and the Tides is innovative and inimitable in actual performance. The playing may draw on jazz, country, rock and Ranaldo's own avant-garde catalogue." [...] In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes found it [...] "great to hear the third voice in Sonic Youth stretching out. But it's also a reminder of their irreplaceable magic." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mississippi River {{topped the}} [...] flood {{stage in the}} Quad Cities on June 11, 2008. Davenport is the largest city {{bordering}} the Mississippi that has no permanent floodwall or levee. On June 12, 3.28inches of rain fell in six hours at the Quad City International Airport courtesy of severe thunderstorms and high winds, breaking the record of rain fall, for that time period, adding major problems to the flooding. The rain caused not only Mississippi River flooding, but also flooding at Duck Creek. Duck Creek is a creek which winds through central Davenport. Duck Creek topped four feet over flood stage. Three of the seven main streets, including U.S. Route 61 which was {{being used as a}} detour for Interstate 80, that cross the creek were blocked off due to major flooding over the roads.

[...] In 1989, Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed together [...] "Santa Fe", [...] "Splatter" [...] (later re-worked into the song [...] "Rent"), and [...] "I Should Tell You". Larson suggested setting the play [...] "amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, drag queens and punk" [...] in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, which happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>down</b> the street from his Greenwich Village apartment. He also {{came up with the}} show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that [...] "rent" [...] also means torn apart). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make Rent his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for Rent; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera [...] "to bring musical theater to the MTV generation." [...] Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for [...] "original concept & additional lyrics".|$|E
