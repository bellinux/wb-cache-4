5|$|One of Treloar's duties {{throughout}} much of the war was to compile and edit service annual books, which were compilations of articles written by military personnel and published by the AWM.

5|$|In Australia, {{there was}} little {{interest}} in the cultivation of Australian plants until the mid-20th century, despite a long-standing appreciation of their beauty as wildflowers.
