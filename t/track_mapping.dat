50|$|Naturalists {{from the}} National Park Service later wrote more {{detailed}} descriptions and Life magazine featured {{a set of}} photographs from the Racetrack. In 1952, a National Park Service Ranger named Louis G. Kirk recorded detailed observations of furrow length, width, and general course. He sought simply to investigate and record evidence of the moving rock phenomenon, not to hypothesize or create an extensive scientific report. Speculation about how the stones move started at this time. Various and sometimes idiosyncratic possible explanations have been put forward {{over the years that}} have ranged from the supernatural to the very complex. Most hypotheses favored by interested geologists posit that strong winds when the mud is wet are at least in part responsible. Some stones weigh as much as a human, which some researchers, such as geologist George M. Stanley, who published a paper on the topic in 1955, feel is too heavy for the area's winds to move. After extensive <b>track</b> <b>mapping</b> and research on rotation of the tracks in relation to ice floe rotation, Stanley maintained that ice sheets around the stones either help to catch the wind or that ice floes initiate rock movement.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} fluid {{evolution}} and infiltration in the Alta stock contact aureole, Utah, were studied by evaluating chemical additions and depletions in igneous, replacement skarn, and carbonate whole-rock samples. Of the major and trace elements studied, boron {{proved to be}} the most interesting tracer of fluid, due in part to extensive borate mineralization (ludwigite and kotoite) in carbonates near the stock contact, and in part to the physical-chemical properties of boron which make it a useful element for isotopic studies and for spatial distribution analysis via alpha <b>track</b> <b>mapping.</b> Boron is enriched throughout the Alta aureole and is hosted by a variety of metamorphic and metasomatic silicate minerals (forsterite and humite group are the most significant). Aureole whole-rock B concentrations increase toward the contact, indicating that B originated in the stock and migrated down-temperature in exsolved magmatic fluids. Boron stable isotope measurements of carbonates, skarns and mineral separates range from - 7. 2 to + 1. 6 δ 11 B. A value of - 6. 0 for a B-enriched igneous sill falls within this range and also indicates that the stock is the source of aureole B-enrichments...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work is to modify the traditional mapping method for the simulation of distributive mixing of multiphase flows in geometries involving moving parts such as, internal mixers or twin-screw extruders without a limitation on their geometrical periodicity. The periodicity condition, limits the results of traditional mapping method to tracking mapping mesh between specific discrete time intervals or distances for that geometry is repeated, hence, result is only for fixed orientation of rotors. Imaginary Domain Method is introduced to <b>track</b> <b>mapping</b> mesh from one state to the next free of geometrical periodicity limitations. In this work the method is introduced and its applicability and accuracy is discussed in details. A two-dimensional (2 D) simulation of mixing of two Newtonian fluids with different viscosities in an intermeshing internal mixer {{is used as a}} test case study. In this example the key issues of ability to predict mixing state in details for all orientations of rotors is presented. To reduce diffusion errors of mapping method in the boundaries of the rotors, mapping mesh refinement technique that relies upon one single reference mesh is also presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{speciation}} {{of uranium}} was {{studied in the}} mill tailings of the Gunnar uranium mine (Saskatchewan, Canada), which operated in the 1950 s and 1960 s. The nature, quantification, and spatial distribution of uraniumbearing phases were investigated by chemical and mineralogical analyses, fission <b>track</b> <b>mapping,</b> electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies at the U LIII-edge and Fe K-edge. In addition to uraniumcontaining phases from the ore, uranium is mostly associated with iron-bearing minerals in all tailing sites. XANES and EXAFS data and transmission electron microscopy analyses of the samples with the highest uranium concentrations (∼ 400 − 700 mg kg− 1 of U) demonstrate that uranium primarily occurs as monomeric uranyl ions (UO 2 2 +), forming inner-sphere surface complexes bound to ferrihydrite (50 − 70 % of the total U) {{and to a lesser}} extent to chlorite (30 − 40 % of the total U). Thus, the stability and mobility of uranium at the Gunnar site are mainly influenced by sorption/ desorption processes. In this context, acidic pH or alkaline pH with the presence of UO 2 2 +- and/or Fe 3 +-complexing agents (e. g., carbonate) could potentially solubilize U in the tailings pore waters...|$|E
40|$|The {{vicinity}} of the 490 Ma Cashel gabbroic intrusion experienced pressures of about 4. 05 + 0. 2 kbar and temperatures in excess of 850 ~ These conditions caused intense hornfelsing and partial melting of the surrounding Dalradian metasediments. From {{the study of the}} progressively changed composition of the aureole hornfelses it is deduced that elements were fractionated into the melts as follows: S i>K>Na>Ca>Mn>AI>Fe>Mg and Rb>Ba>Sr>Ga>Cr,Ni,Co. This order of fraction-ation, which is the opposite to that in magmatic rystallization, provides a detailed picture of the mode of interaction between a mantle derived basic magma and mid-crustal rocks, illustrating how one type of S-type granite can be produced. The rare earth elements (REE) were both removed and fractionated but Eu largely remained in the crystal fractions giving increasing positive Eu anomalies with rising partial melting and these trends {{can be explained by the}} extraction of a granitic melt from the hornfelses. Fission <b>track</b> <b>mapping</b> of U is used to study the behaviour of U within the aureole and the metamorphic recrystallization f detrital brown zircon to pink new zircon. The S-type Cashel microgranite sill is shown to have been derived by anatexis from the Dalradian rocks, to have preserved the Sr isotope ratios of the metasediments at 490 Ma, and not to be of the same composition as the leucosomes in the metasediments.

40|$|Comet 81 P/Wild 2 's serendipitous orbit {{change to}} {{the inner solar system}} in 1974 offered {{researchers}} a rare opportunity to sample cometary material from the Kuiper belt, a repository of material left over from solar system formation {approx} 4. 6 Gyr ago. NASA's Stardust mission intercepted the comet in January 2004 and returned with material collected from its tail in January 2006. The cometary material, consisting of particles ranging from 10 microns down to < 2 nm, was collected in aerogel, a very low density ({approx} 3 mg/cm cm 3) silica foam, to minimize the effects of deceleration from 6. 1 km/s. The entire deceleration track is extracted from the aerogel block as a pyramidal shape known as a keystone which can be mapped using x-ray fluorescence prior to extraction of terminal or intermediate particles for other analyses. One goal of the <b>track</b> <b>mapping</b> is to determine the bulk composition of the cometary material returned. Unfortunately, although the aerogel is predominantly SiO{sub 2 }, there are sufficient quantities of trace elements similar to those expected in the cometary material to require sophisticated discrimination techniques in order to decide whether a fluorescence map pixel contains only aerogel or both aerogel and cometary material. We have developed a dual threshold analysis approach for better distinguishing cometary material from aerogel contaminants and have applied it to five Stardust impact tracks and terminal particles. Here, we present aspects of the dual threshold approach and demonstrate its impact on track composition for one track...|$|E
40|$|The K/U can be {{regarded}} as a "planetary constant" which is invariant during magmatic processes but which differs for cosmochemical reasons between planets. This assumption is universal in all thermal history calculations for planets. K-SiO_ 2 -rich inclusions are found in Shaw which many authors believe is a chondrite which has been subjected to partial melting (Taylor et al., 1979; Rambaldi and Lamimer, 1976). Although the origin of these inclusions is not well understood, it is possible that they represent the first melts or magmatic fluids produced in the formation of planets. Thus it is of interest to see if U and Th have followed K into these liquids. For the case of Shaw some evidence of K/REE fractionation already exists (Rambaldi and Lamimer, 1976). Six polished sections of Shaw with affixed mica fission track detectors were irradiated with 2 x 10 ^(18) /cm^ 2 thermal neutrons. Excellent fission track images were obtained with no evidence for any significant contamination. (Random scans on our most-studied section gave 6 ppb U.) The fission track distributions show a high degree of localization. In one section, mapped in great detail, 20 - 30 large (> 50 micron) fission track localizations, can all be accounted for by whitlockite and chloroapatite. The whitlockite U concentrations (300 - 700 ppb) are variable, but typical for chondrites. The phosphate grains serve as fiducial points, allowing accurate location of the melt inclusions on the mica track detector (maximum position error= 20 microns). In many cases no localizations of tracks are found (U contents < 10 ppb) corresponding to the K-Si-rich inclusions, but in 7 / 25 cases localizations are found with U concentrations up to 300 ppb. The inclusions are small (usually< 20 μ), and there are many other small track localizations in this size range which have no obvious sources, thus some of these 7 cases may be accidental. However, <b>track</b> <b>mapping</b> at 13 random fields of view showed only 2 localizations (track density 3 - 4 times surroundings) within 20 microns. The small track localizations of unknown origin can be explained by a combination of buried sources (within 10 microns of surface), local contamination (which can never be ruled out) or localization of U on grain boundaries or cleavage planes in major phases. There is no correlation of U content with inclusion chemistry (K), size, opaque mineralogy, or petrographic location. Many of the inclusions are within large (hundreds of microns) olivine grains, including some that seem U-rich. In two of these cases the track localizations stand out from an almost blank background and match the location and size of the inclusion. It seems inescapable that the tracks do arise from the inclusions in these cases. It may be that these inclusions were a preferential site of contamination during sample preparation or by terrestrial weathering, but {{it is also possible that}} U-bearing phases only occasionally participated in the partial melting process. It may be significant that the inclusions contain no P, thus this U reservoir has not participated. Regardless, the important result is that in most cases K was mobilized to a much higher degree than U in the Shaw partial melting event. (The inclusion KIU is at least 10 x bulk chondrites.) Although the inclusions are relatively Fe-rich, the concentration of K and Si and the exclusion of U and rare-earths follows the chemical systematics of immiscible silicate melts (Watson, 1976; Ryerson and Hess, 1978). To the extent that Shaw is representative of very small degrees of partial melting in planets, K and U appear to be fractionated...|$|E
