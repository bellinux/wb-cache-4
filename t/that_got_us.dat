AllMusic additionally credits bands such as Weezer and the Get Up Kids as influences, among others. Pierre quoted Waits that [...] "all anybody ever does is imitate their favorite artist—badly," [...] adding, [...] "we're just regurgitating all the crap we listened to in the late '80s and early '90s, the music <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>us</b> into playing music in the first place." ...|$|E
500|$|... 48 {{hours before}} the film got the {{official}} green light from Fox, the studio cut the film's budget by $7–8 million, down to $58 million. This forced a last minute re-write that saw about 9 pages cut from the previously 110 page script. Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase {{at the end of}} the Twelve Bullets Fight, and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having a costly gun fight in the third act. Reese said, [...] "It was that last, lean and mean chop <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>us</b> to a place where Fox was willing to make it. The script was very efficient and not too long. That was a function of budget more than anything, but I think it really made the movie pace nicely." ...|$|E
500|$|The band members' {{main goal}} was to reinvent the group's sound from scratch, {{creating}} what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band," [...] which focuses more on pop. Sessions were not without difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material. Walker had doubts about the band's volatility, feeling the record would not get made following [...] "meltdown after meltdown." [...] The entire album was recorded in secrecy from the music industry, critics, and fans of the band. While specifically denying that the group's announcement was a reunion because [...] " [...] never broke up", the band announced a reunion tour and details of Save Rock and Roll on February 4, 2013. The quartet's announcement included {{a photo of the}} group that had been taken earlier that morning of the band members huddled around a bonfire tossing copies of their back catalog into flames at the original location of Comiskey Park, the location of 1979's Disco Demolition Night, a baseball promotional event which involved destroying disco records. A message on the group's website read [...] "when we were kids the only thing <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>us</b> through most days was music. It's why we started Fall Out Boy in the first place. This isn't a reunion because we never broke up. We needed to plug back in and make some music that matters to us. The future of Fall Out Boy starts now. Save rock and roll..." [...] Save Rock and Roll debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 154,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The arrival of Save Rock and Roll posted the quartet's third-biggest sales week, and earned the group's second career number one on the chart. The band's chart success was best described as unexpected by music journalists. Rolling Stone called the band's comeback a [...] "rather stunning renaissance", and Entertainment Weekly called the number one a [...] "major accomplishment for a band whom many in the industry had dismissed as kings of a genre whose time had passed." ...|$|E

[...] When Jake Tapper of ABC News pushed Obama to explain the fact that his administration hasn't prosecuted any Wall Street executives who didn't play by the rules, he replied, [...] "One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehman's and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal; it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless." [...] On October 18, when interviewed by ABC news, he said [...] "in some ways, they’re not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the Tea Party. Both on the left and the right, I think people feel separated from their government. They feel that their institutions aren’t looking out for them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The entire {{album was}} {{recorded}} in secrecy from the music industry, critics, and fans of the band. Stump recalled: [...] "There was a couple times there was paparazzi <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>us</b> outside and didn't put two and two together". The decision to keep recording a secret was partially so that the group members had the option to not make the record if the sessions did not work out. Keeping the secret was difficult, especially for a group so visible on social media; Hurley stayed away from Twitter, and all members got {{as far away from}} one another in public as possible. Rumors began to swirl in late 2012 after a friend of the band tweeted that the band {{was in the process of}} recording new material, though each member of the band was quick to deny any chance of a reunion. The band remained tight-lipped until the very end; when the Chicago Tribune asked Wentz a week prior to the announcement whether a Fall Out Boy reunion was happening, he replied: [...] "It's not." [...] Plans nearly went sideways when Wentz went to dinner with rapper 2 Chainz to discuss plans for the [...] "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)" [...] video. Following the conversation, 2 Chainz posted to Instagram a photo of Wentz and himself with the caption [...] "Fall Out Boyz feat. 2 Chainz?" [...] To the members of Fall Out Boy's surprise and relief, fans of the band denied the possibility, finding the idea too absurd. Stump recalls he wrote [...] "somewhere near 25%" [...] of the lyrics, the most since on Take This to Your Grave.|$|E
2500|$|Efeturi Doghudje of 360Nobs commended the {{character}} development, praised {{the performance of}} Demola Adedoyin, and the costume design. She rated the film 9 out of 10, and concluded: [...] "Script writer Tunde Babalola, was incredible, as October 1, {{was much more than}} just an entertaining feature, it was deep, intense and had that suspense <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>us</b> in the hall talking. Asides attention to detail, Babalola paid as much attention to the script trying to relive the experience of the 1960s and tying it perfectly to the British way of governing us, our tribal issues and our eventual independence. It [...] was pieced together wonderfully and creatively executed. October 1 is a must see for all". Wilfred Okiche of YNaija praised its production design, and concluded: [...] "In many ways, October 1 is a typical Kunle Afolayan film, what with the ensemble cast, big budget, period setting, ambitious story and dark psychological suspense. But where he does not leave an indelible mark on the film, one that will in future days be identified as the Afolayan touch. He proves once again and maybe {{for the first time in}} film this year, that ambition is good and no one can represent Nigeria better than Nigerians. Nollywood is rising indeed, and October 1 is a shining example". Amarachukwu Iwuala of Pulse NG praised the subtle themes in the film, while noting Kayode Olaiya as the highlight performance, and concluded that although [...] "October 1 is not fast-paced, the action nonetheless unravels at a rate that keeps everyone in suspense. The film aptly integrates several interesting subplots; smartly employing subtext and irony. This 140-minute picture is another feat for Nollywood". Augustine Ogwo of News Wire comments: [...] "October 1 is brilliant, thought-provoking and timeless. October 1 preaches the truth and it does so from an artistic point of view. Kudos must be given to Tunde Babalola for writing such an amazing script and also to the producer/director of this movie for breathing life into the story. October 1 is such a good movie that it has the power to plunge every well meaning Nigerian into a reflective mood and possibly positive action".|$|E

I am a quiet man, and fond of studiousness and thought. The more we used to see each other, personally, the less we seemed to like to be together. If he ever had slapped me on the back and snivelled over me like I've seen men do to what they called their friends, I know I'd have had a rough-and-tumble with him on the spot. Same way with George. He hated my ways as bad as I did his. When we were mining, we lived in separate tents, so as not to intrude our obnoxiousness on each other.|$|E
