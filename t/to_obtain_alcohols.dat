40|$|Alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD; {{often referred}} to as alcohol addiction or alcoholism) is a chronic relapsing brain disorder characterized by loss of control over alcohol intake. Alcohol is among the most widely used substances in the world, and even though only a minority of the people who regularly consume alcohol develop AUD, this still amounts to approximately 76 million people worldwide. Importantly, it is still unclear why some individuals are more at risk for AUD than others. The development of AUD is thought to involve a complex interaction between personality characteristics, the environment of an individual and long-lasting alcohol-induced changes in brain function. The overarching aim of this thesis was to determine which factors contribute to the individual vulnerability for AUD, using studies in rats. One of the main findings is that in populations of rats, we could identify animals that voluntarily drink low or high quantities of alcohol. We observed that a high voluntary alcohol consumption was related to a higher motivation <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>alcohol</b> and a loss of control over alcohol seeking, a key characteristic of AUD. Moreover, cognitive assessments showed that high alcohol consumption was related to reward-directed behaviour in decision making tasks and an enhanced focus on reward cues. In addition, we observed that a disrupted social development increases alcohol consumption during adulthood. With regard to the brain mechanisms involved, we investigated the role of the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is thought {{to play an important role}} in addictive behaviour. We found that functional activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system is of great importance for the motivation <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>alcohol,</b> but not for the individual level of alcohol consumption. Interestingly, the mesolimbic dopamine system was more sensitive to rewards and reward cues in rats that have been exposed to alcohol during adolescence. In conclusion, the results in this thesis contribute to the understanding of the behavioural, cognitive, social and brain mechanisms that underlie the risk for AUD. Therefore, these studies may help the development of improved treatment strategies to restore control over alcohol use...|$|R

5000|$|Antihistamines (or [...] "histamine antagonists") {{inhibit the}} release or action of histamine. [...] "Antihistamine" [...] {{can be used}} to {{describe}} any histamine antagonist, but the term is usually reserved for the classical antihistamines that act upon the H1 histamine receptor. Antihistamines are used as treatment for allergies. Allergies are caused by an excessive response of the body to allergens, such as the pollen released by grasses and trees. An allergic reaction causes release of histamine by the body. Other uses of antihistamines are to help with normal symptoms of insect stings even if there is no allergic reaction. Their recreational appeal exists mainly due to their anticholinergic properties, that induce anxiolysis and, in some cases such as diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and orphenadrine, a characteristic euphoria at moderate doses. High dosages taken to induce recreational drug effects may lead to overdoses.

Preclinical models examining effects of primary depression on secondary AUD are currently absent, preventing adequate testing of drug treatment. Here, we combined social defeat-induced persistent stress (SDPS) and operant alcohol self-administration (SA) paradigms to assess causality between these two neuropsychiatric disorders. We then exploited guanfacine, an FDA-approved adrenergic agent reported to reduce drug craving in humans, against SDPS-induced modulation of operant alcohol SA. Wistar rats were socially defeated and isolated {{for a period of}} ≥ 9 weeks, during which depression-like symptomatology (cognitive and social behavioral symptoms) was assessed. Subsequently, animals were subjected to a 5 -month operant alcohol SA paradigm, examining acquisition, motivation, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. The effects of guanfacine on motivation and relapse were measured at > 6 months following defeat. SDPS rats exhibited significant disruption of social and cognitive behavior, including short-term spatial and long-term social memory, several months following defeat. Notably, SDPS increased motivation <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and cue-induced relapse vulnerability. Guanfacine reversed the SDPS-induced effects on motivation and relapse. Together, our model mimics core symptomatology of a sustained depressive-like state and a subsequent vulnerability to alcohol abuse.

For the purposes of this study, the availability of alcohol, attitudes, causes and effects concerning alcohol use as well as preventing alcohol use constituted alcohol use. The research goal was <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> extensive background information to prepare recommendations for a strategy to prevent adolescent alcohol use. One of the goals of social and health policy in Finland since the 1990 ’s has been restraining excessive adolescent alcohol use. Methodological triangulation was employed for this study. Questionnaire data were collected from ninth grade students (n= 181) of two schools in Pori, Finland and their parents (n= 110). Thematic interview data were collected from teachers (n= 10) and school nurses (n= 4). The questionnaire data from students were further enhanced by group interviews of adolescents (n= 24, 4 groups). The questionnaire data were analysed statistically. The interviews were analysed inductively by using qualitative content analysis. There were significant differences between the adolescent and parental views on alcohol use, with adolescents using alcohol more commonly than parents assumed. Differences between boys and girls were minor, yet girls used alcohol more frequently than boys did. Adolescents were able <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>alcohol</b> easily from various sources, including their parents. Approximately one half of students felt that instruction for preventing alcohol use and programmes by school nurses were boring, partially useless. The parents were of the opinion that <b>obtaining</b> <b>alcohol</b> was too easy and that alcohol caused problems for many adolescents. The adolescents felt that alcohol was an essential element of adolescent parties and that its risks were usually exaggerated. The teachers wanted to reduce adolescent alcohol use through restrictions in the media, a shared alcohol programme in schools and introducing longer school hours. The school nurses felt that future emphasis should be placed on co-operation among school nurses and enhancing social responsibility.
