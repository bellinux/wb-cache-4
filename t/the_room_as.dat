Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>as</b> clearly as from a freestanding organ case, enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.|$|E

50|$|The guesthouse has ten themed guest rooms, {{each one}} having an animal as its theme; {{examples}} include <b>the</b> tiger <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> eagle <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> ant <b>room</b> and <b>the</b> kangaroo <b>room,</b> each with decorations matching the theme. The walls of <b>the</b> tiger <b>room,</b> for instance, feature a large tiger with glowing red eyes; <b>the</b> kangaroo <b>room</b> incorporates a sculpted kangaroo with a fireplace in its belly; the fireplace in <b>the</b> eagle <b>room</b> is in <b>the</b> {{form of a}} giant eagle’s egg. Many of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> incorporate an added level of symbolism, with the animal theme connected to a particular nationality. For instance, Nga describes <b>the</b> tiger <b>room</b> <b>as</b> representing “the strengths of the Chinese”; <b>the</b> eagle <b>room</b> <b>as</b> being “big and strong” like Americans; and <b>the</b> ant <b>room</b> <b>as</b> representing <b>the</b> “hard working Vietnamese”.|$|R
5|$|Food Circus: The Food Circus was a {{food court}} in the former armory, later named the Center House, and {{recently}} renamed The Armory (2012) as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current arrangement with a stage and a large open space for dancing, events, and temporary booths, many food booths {{were in the middle}} of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>as</b> well as at the edges. There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E
5|$|In a dance club, a {{young man}} is taken by a young woman, Marty (Kate Twa), for casual sex. The man dies afterwards, and Marty leaves <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>as</b> a man (Peter Stebbings). FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called to the scene; Mulder {{believes}} that the man's death {{was caused by a}} fatal dose of pheromones. There is also ambiguity in similar murders as to the sex of the killer. Evidence from the crime scene leads the duo to an Amish-like community in Steveston, Massachusetts, which Mulder calls the Kindred.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>as</b> well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the straw}} poll, delegates are then elected from the {{remaining}} participants in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>as</b> most voters leave once their vote is cast. All delegates are officially considered unbound, but media outlets either apportion delegates proportionally or apportion {{them in terms}} of winner-take-all by counties. In precincts that elect only one delegate, the delegate is chosen by majority vote and the vote must be by paper ballot. The state party strongly urges that delegates reflect the results of the preference poll, but there is no obligation that they do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{imposing}} Great Hall {{originally had}} two storeys but, in the mid-17th century, John Batt's grandson removed {{the ceiling and}} inserted a gallery and a large mullioned and transomed window. It was the main thoroughfare for the house linking the wings and hub of domestic life. It was a reception room for visitors, tenants and businessmen and large gatherings. It is sparsely furnished and uncluttered. The table is placed {{at one end of}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>as</b> it would have been {{towards the end of the}} 17th century, rather than in its earlier position in the centre.

25|$|Installing {{a hybrid}} OR is a {{challenge}} to standard hospital room sizes, as not only the imaging system requires some additional space, but there are also more people in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>as</b> in a normal OR. A team of 8 to 20 people including anasthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, technicians, perfusionists, support staff from device companies etc. can work in such an OR. Depending on the imaging system chosen, a room size of 70 square meters including a control room but excluding a technical room and the preparation areas is recommended. Additional preparations of the room necessary are 2-3mm lead shielding and potentially enforcement of the floor or ceiling to hold the additional weight of the imaging system (approximately 650–1800kg).|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of {{the table in the}} room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>as</b> well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging.|$|E
25|$|For {{his first}} {{exhibition}} in USA, at the Eugenia Butler Gallery of Los Angeles (1970), he exhibited {{a series of}} 37 suitcases filled with cheese on the floor, below pictures made with cheese on the wall. Called Staple Cheese (A Race), a pun on Steeple Chase, the suitcases were to be opened one a day, whilst the wall pictures included a horizontal line tracking the vertical movement of the cheeses as they slid toward it. However, {{within a few days}} the over-powering smell, maggots and flies combined to make it impossible to enter <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>As</b> a gesture to honor what he called “the exhibition’s true audience,” Roth collected some of the dead flies lying {{on the floor of the}} gallery space and put them in a glass jar. The suitcases were later stored in a container designed by Roth for a number of years until Butler's husband threw the whole exhibition away in the desert.|$|E
