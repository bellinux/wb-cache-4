5000|$|The video {{bandwidth}} was 3.0 MHz. The {{video signal}} modulates the carrier by Amplitude Modulation. But {{a portion of}} the upper side band is suppressed. This technique is known as vestigial side band modulation (AC3). The polarity of modulation is positive, meaning that an increase in the instantaneous brightness of the video signal results in an increase in RF power and vice versa. Specifically, the sync pulses (being [...] "blacker than black") result in minimum power (possibly zero power) from the <b>vision</b> <b>transmitter.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An image {{enhancement}} algorithm for low-vision patients {{was developed for}} images compressed using the JPEG standard. The proposed algorithm enhances the images in the discrete cosine transform domain by weighting the quantization table in the decoder. Our specific implementation increases the contrast at all bands of frequencies by an equal factor. The enhancement algorithm has four advantages: 1) low computational cost; 2) suitability for real-time application; 3) ease of adjustment by end-users (for example, adjusting a single parameter); and 4) less severe block artifacts as compared with conventional (post compression) enhancements. Experiments with visually impaired patients show improved perceived image quality at moderate levels of enhancement but rejection of artifacts caused by higher levels of enhancement.
