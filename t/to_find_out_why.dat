5|$|As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then set out <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States from England in August 1941 <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> Briggs and his {{committee}} were apparently ignoring the MAUD Report. Oliphant discovered to his dismay that the reports and other documents sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with {{all members of the}} committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with Allison, Coolidge, Conant and Fermi to explain the urgency. In these meetings Oliphant spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty, and explained that Britain did not have the resources to undertake the project alone, so it was up to the United States.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 White House {{shooting}} {{occurred on}} November 11, 2011, when Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, an unemployed 21-year-old man, fired a semi-automatic rifle at the White House, the official {{residence of the}} U.S. President in Washington, D.C. At least seven bullets hit the second floor. Neither the president nor First Lady Michelle Obama were home at the time, although their youngest daughter, Sasha, and the first lady's mother, Marian Shields Robinson, were. No one was injured. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. Michelle Obama learned of the shooting from an usher, then summoned Mark J. Sullivan, director of the Secret Service, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> the first family had not been informed.|$|E
5|$|That night, Jack tells {{everyone}} that he trusts Juliet {{and that should}} be enough, but Sayid disagrees. Jack continues to explain that John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She was brought to the island <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E

25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question.

The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting {{to have taken place}} would have been to fake his death.|$|E
25|$|With {{help from}} QualPro, Boise Cascade {{discovered}} {{there was no}} connection between the quality of wood they purchased as raw material {{and the quality of}} wood pulp it produced for paper and packaging products. QualPro worked with Elo TouchSystems <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> 25 percent of the touch-screens they manufactured had bubbles between the screen and coating. Statisticians identified three causes, which reduced the defects to less than 1 percent: the type of polyester, the coversheet shaping process and the type of adhesives used.

25|$|Siblings {{taken into}} care {{together}} were often separated and contact between siblings was discouraged. Boys and girls were usually separated in institutions so {{brothers and sisters}} rarely had close contact. Family ties were cut when one sibling ended up in care while others remained {{at home with their}} parents or were sent elsewhere. The result is that many people never knew they had siblings or only found out much later in life. Children's names were often changed and poor and incomplete records kept of children in care. This makes it difficult for older care leavers <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> and how they ended up in care, and to trace parents, siblings or other living relatives.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947—1949 (1988), Morris {{argues that the}} 700,000 Palestinians who fled their homes in 1947 left mostly due to Israeli {{military}} attacks; fear of impending attacks; and expulsions. He argues {{that there was no}} centralized expulsion policy as such, but expulsions were ordered by the Israeli high command as needed. This was a controversial position when Morris first wrote of it; the official position in Israel was that the Palestinians had left voluntarily, or under pressure from Palestinian or other Arab leaders. At the same time, Morris documents atrocities by the Israelis, including cases of rape and torture. The book shows a map of 228 empty Palestinian villages, and attempts to explain why the villagers left. In 41 villages, he writes, the inhabitants were expelled by the IDF; in another 90, residents fled because of attacks on other villages; and in six, they left under instructions from local Palestinian authorities. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>why</b> another 46 villages were abandoned.|$|E
