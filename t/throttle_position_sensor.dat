5000|$|A {{criticism}} of the very early ETC implementations {{was that they were}} [...] "overruling" [...] driver decisions. Nowadays, the vast majority of drivers have no idea how much intervention is happening. Much of the engineering involved with drive-by-wire technologies including ETC deals with failure and fault management. Many ETC systems have redundant pedal and <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> and controller redundancy, even as complex as independent microprocessors with independently written software within a control module whose calculations are compared to check for possible errors and faults.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{mechanical}} linkage between the accelerator pedal and the throttle valve with electronic throttle control. Instead, the <b>position</b> of the <b>throttle</b> valve (i.e., {{the amount of}} air in the engine) is fully controlled by the ETC software via the electric motor. But just opening or closing the throttle valve by sending a new signal to the electric motor is an open loop condition and leads to inaccurate control. Thus, {{most if not all}} current ETC systems use closed loop feedback systems, such as PID control, whereby the ECU tells the throttle to open or close a certain amount. The <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor(s)</b> are continually read and then the software makes appropriate adjustments to reach the desired amount of engine power.|$|R

5000|$|Most modern engines {{use some}} type of fuel {{injection}} to deliver fuel to the cylinders. The ECU determines the amount of fuel to inject based {{on a number of}} sensor readings. Oxygen sensors tell the ECU whether the engine is running rich (too much fuel/too little oxygen) or running lean (too much oxygen/too little fuel) as compared to ideal conditions (known as stoichiometric). The <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> tell the ECU how far the throttle plate is opened when you press the accelerator. The mass air flow sensor measures the amount of air flowing into the engine through the throttle plate. The engine coolant temperature sensor measures whether the engine is warmed up or cool. (If the engine is still cool, additional fuel will be injected.) ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two primary}} types of <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> (TPS): a {{potentiometer}} or a non-contact sensor Hall Effect sensor (magnetic device). A potentiometer is a satisfactory way for non-critical {{applications such as}} volume control on a radio, but as it has a wiper contact rubbing against a resistance element, dirt and wear between the wiper and the resistor can cause erratic readings. The more reliable solution is the magnetic coupling, which makes no physical contact, so will never be subject to failing by wear. This is an insidious failure as it may not provide any symptoms until there is total failure. All cars having a TPS have {{what is known as}} a 'limp-home-mode'. When the car goes into the limp-home-mode it is because the accelerator and engine control computer and the throttle are not talking to each other {{in a way that they}} can understand. The engine control computer shuts down the signal to the <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> motor and a set of springs in the throttle set it to a fast idle, fast enough to get the transmission in gear but not so fast that driving may be dangerous.|$|R
40|$|Inductive angular <b>position</b> <b>sensors</b> (IAPS) {{are widely}} used for high {{accuracy}} and low cost angular position sensing in harsh automotive environments, such as suspension height <b>sensor</b> and <b>throttle</b> body <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> These sensors ensure high resolution and long lifetime due to their contactless sensing mode and their simple structure. Furthermore, they are suitable for wider application areas. For instance, they can be miniaturized {{to fit into a}} compact packaging space, or be adopted to measure the relative angle of multiple rotating targets for the purposes of torque sensing. In this work, a detailed SIMULINK model of an IAPS is first proposed in order to study and characterize the sensor performance. The model is validated by finite element analysis and circuit simulation, which provides a powerful design tool for sensor performance analysis. The sensor error introduced by geometry imperfection is thoroughly investigated for two-phase and three-phase configurations, and a corresponding correction method to improve the accuracy is proposed. A design optimization method based on the response surface methodology is also developed and used in the sensor development. Three types of sensors are developed to demonstrate the inductive sensor technology. The first type is the miniaturized inductive sensor. To compensate for the weak signal strength and the reduced quality (Q) factor due to the scaling down effect, a resonant rotor is developed for this type of sensor. This sensor is fabricated by using the electrodeposition technique. The prototype shows an 8 mm diameter sensor can function well at 1. 5 mm air gap. The second type is a steering torque sensor, which is designed to detect the relative torsional angle of a rotating torsional shaft. It demonstrates the mutual coupling of multiple inductive sensors. By selecting a proper layout and compensation algorithm, the torque sensor can achieve 0. 1 degree accuracy. The third type is a passive inductive sensor, which is designed to reduce power consumption and electromagnetic emissions. The realization and excellent performance of these three types of sensors have shown the robustness of the inductive sensor technology and its potential applications. The research conducted in this dissertation is expected to improve understanding of the performance analysis of IAPS and provide useful guidelines for the design and performance optimization of inductive sensors...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>{{throttle}}</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (TPS) is {{a sensor}} {{used to monitor}} the throttle position of a vehicle. The sensor is usually located on the butterfly spindle/shaft {{so that it can}} directly monitor the position of the throttle. More advanced forms of the sensor are also used, for example an extra closed <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (CTPS) may be employed to indicate that the throttle is completely closed. Some engine control units (ECUs) also control the throttle position electronic throttle control (ETC) or [...] "drive by wire" [...] systems and if that is done the position sensor is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.|$|E

Generally, in automobiles <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> is controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) mainly according to the one of the inputs received from the accelerator’s Pedal <b>position</b> <b>sensor.</b> But in the proposed model, instead of ECU, another Microcontroller unit receives the pedal <b>position</b> from the <b>sensor</b> and then Microcontroller unit transfers to the ECU.

40|$|A {{dynamometer}} laboratory may typically {{face the}} following issues {{on a daily}} basis: the lack/availability of a calibration, software limiters, hardware failure codes/modes, hardware/software level incompatibilities and the time/knowledge required to troubleshoot these issues. A Reconfigurable Engine Controller (REC), which provides freedom to operate the engine under any condition, eliminates many of these issues. The result is an accelerated engine development process which includes engine mapping and/or testing new algorithms before implementation on production hardware. A REC can provide a flexible tailored controller to suit {{the needs of the}} individual testing application. This research used the dSPACE MicroAutoBox and RapidPro hardware and software with MATLAB/Simulink (the coding tool) to successfully develop and test a REC under a series of steady state engine operating conditions. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers were also successfully implemented for the <b>throttle</b> body <b>position,</b> lambda <b>sensor</b> heating and fuel pulse width modulation. The data collected from a combustion analysis system along with the production engine controller and the REC parameters was used to validate the new controller.

The latter two sensors themselves are usually the General Motors type, although the controller can recalibrated to use other sensors including Ford and Bosch.|$|E

50|$|Some {{versions}} of the engine implemented switchable Traction Control (commonly included in the early Astra GSi models). The inlet had a secondary throttle valve sandwiched underneath the primary throttle body. This is closed by a motor/arm assembly when the traction control ECU senses loss of grip/spin at the wheels.

2500|$|Locomotive power output, {{and thus}} speed, is {{typically}} {{controlled by the}} engine driver using a stepped or [...] "notched" [...] throttle that produces binary-like electrical signals corresponding to <b>throttle</b> <b>position.</b> [...] This basic design lends itself well to multiple unit (MU) operation by producing discrete conditions that assure that all units in a consist respond {{in the same way}} to <b>throttle</b> <b>position.</b> [...] Binary encoding also helps to minimize the number of trainlines (electrical connections) that are required to pass signals from unit to unit.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common inputs into a TCU is the kick down switch which is used to {{determine}} if the accelerator pedal has been depressed past full throttle. When activated the transmission downshifts into the lowest permissible gear based on current road speed to use the full power reserves of the engine. This is still present in most transmissions though is no longer as necessary to use as the TCU uses the <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> and rapid rate of change to determine whether a downshift may be necessary, thus {{there is no need to}} use the kickdown feature in most circumstances.|$|E

Some variations used a dial to specifically select {{the level of}} hardness to the driver’s desires. For most driving situations, the “Auto” selection was recommended. When the system was activated, an indicator light reflected the suspension setting selected.The system components consisted of a control switch, indicator light, four shock absorbers, shock absorber control actuator, shock absorber control computer, vehicle speed sensor, stop lamp switch, with a <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> and {{a steering angle sensor}} on TEMS three stage systems only.|$|E

50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the throttle plate rotates within the throttle body, opening the throttle passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an airflow sensor measures this change and communicates with the ECU. The ECU then increases the amount of fuel {{being sent to the}} fuel injectors in order to obtain the desired air-fuel ratio. Often a <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the throttle plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the throttle is in the idle position, wide-open throttle (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|E
5000|$|Data {{representing}} {{the amount of}} power output desired by the driver (sometimes known as [...] "engine load") is also used by the engine control unit in calculating the amount of fuel required. A <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensor</b> (TPS) provides this information.

5000|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) is an automobile technology which electronically [...] "connects" [...] the accelerator {{pedal to the}} throttle, replacing a mechanical linkage. [...] A typical ETC system consists of three major components: (i) an accelerator pedal module (ideally with two or more independent sensors), (ii) a throttle valve that can be opened and closed by an electric motor (sometimes referred to as an electric or electronic throttle body (ETB)), and (iii) a powertrain or engine control module (PCM or ECM). The ECM {{is a type of}} electronic control unit (ECU), which is an embedded system that employs software to determine the required <b>throttle</b> <b>position</b> by calculations from data measured by other sensors, including the accelerator pedal <b>position</b> <b>sensors,</b> engine speed sensor, vehicle speed sensor, and cruise control switches. The electric motor is then used to open the throttle valve to the desired angle via a closed-loop control algorithm within the ECM.|$|R
