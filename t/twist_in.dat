5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> wind direction {{is in the same}} direction as the rotation of the planet.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{received}} ratings {{near the}} season average, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Brown's performance was praised, {{as well as}} the <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> his character's storyline. Also applauded were both Sam's confrontation with Dean over his recent reckless behavior and the resulting reconciliation at the episode's end. Many critics found the presence of character Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan) in the episode to be pointless, while the critic for TV Guide enjoyed McNab's cameo and wished it had been longer.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> the sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
5|$|Gyromancer is {{a puzzle}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by PopCap Games {{in collaboration with}} Square Enix. In the game, the player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled <b>Twist.</b> <b>In</b> these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough lines have been created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, a story is told {{through a series of}} cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing game elements.|$|E

25|$|The Shar Pei's {{loose skin}} and {{extremely}} prickly coat were originally developed {{to help the}} dogs fend off wild boar, as {{they were used to}} hunt. Later, the breed was used for dog fighting; these enhanced traits made the Shar Pei difficult for its opponent to grab and hold on to, and so that if it did manage to hold on, the Shar Pei would still have room to maneuver and bite back; when grabbed by any loose wrinkle, a Shar Pei can actually <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> their skin and face in their opponent's direction. In fighting, they would <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> their skin to bite the assailant back.|$|E
25|$|The mast head {{instruments}} {{indication of}} apparent wind speed and direction {{is different from}} what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce sail <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> {{the design of the}} sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.|$|E

25|$|Inversion of Generation 2 devices was {{achieved}} {{through one of}} two different ways.

One contestant, 14-year-old Tyler Burkhalter, competed despite having diabetes requiring daily insulin treatments.|$|E
25|$|Brokeback Mountain is a 2005 American neo-Western romantic drama film {{directed}} by Ang Lee and produced by Diana Ossana and James Schamus. Adapted from the 1997 short {{story of the}} same name by Annie Proulx, the screenplay was written by Ossana and Larry McMurtry. The film stars Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams, and depicts the complex emotional and sexual relationship between Ennis Del Mar and Jack <b>Twist</b> <b>in</b> the American West from 1963 to 1983.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th {{season the}} rules were {{slightly}} altered due to the pairs <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> play. Housemates would nominate, be nominated as a pair, however {{they would not be}} evicted as a pair. The pair with the lowest save vote from the public vote would have a house vote where housemates stand behind the person they wish to stay. Also housemates could talk about nominations to their partner. This rule was only in play for the first week.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} nontrivial {{example of}} a vector bundle is the Möbius band (pictured on the right): a strip of paper with a <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the Möbius band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the Möbius band represents {{an element of the}} K-group of a circle.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the actors}} had also worked with Raymond Thompson on other Cloud 9 {{productions}} before they auditioned for The Tribe. Jennyfer Jewell (Ellie) and Ryan Runciman (Ryan) had worked on The Enid Blyton Adventure Series in 1996 and Jewell had also starred in The Enid Blyton Secret Series in 1997 alongside Daniel James (Zoot). Beth Allen (Amber) and Michael Wesley-Smith (Jack) had been cast in The Legend of William Tell in 1998 and many cast members from series 1 had acted in William Shatner’s A <b>Twist</b> <b>in</b> the Tale in 1999.|$|E
25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot <b>twist</b> <b>in</b> The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that we would have never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E
