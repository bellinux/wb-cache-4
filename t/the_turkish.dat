5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century, the chronically high {{inflation}} was brought under control; this led to the launch of a new currency, <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> new lira (Yeni Türk Lirası) in 2005, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy. In 2009, after only four years in circulation, <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> new lira was renamed back to <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> lira with the introduction of new banknotes and coins (and the withdrawal of <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> new lira banknotes and coins that were introduced in 2005), but the ISO 4217 code of <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> new lira (TRY) remains in use for the current Turkish lira in the foreign exchange market.|$|E
5|$|At 14:45, {{covered by}} an {{artillery}} barrage and machine-gun fire, <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> troops counter-attacked again. The regiment's machine gunners returned fire {{and for a}} short time the battle became a machine-gun engagement. During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles, to the right, had occupied a prominent hill, but were under heavy fire. To support them, the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents, which they caught {{in the bottom of a}} valley, with enfilade fire. Then in front of the regiment a fresh Turkish battalion was sent to assault them. In some places, <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> force got close enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment's defences. These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill, which was then occupied by <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> troops, bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment's positions, which by now were becoming untenable. At first, messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through. Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground, recapturing the hill. This brought the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> line into range of the squadron's guns. Confronted by the new threat, <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> troops retired back to their starting point. McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder, forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment. By then it was getting dark and the only Turkish offensive action was an artillery bombardment. Instead of attacking, the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines. Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy-four wounded. The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> troops.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> forces had been pushed out of the Sinai, and in January 1917, orders were given for the {{division}} to attack Rafa on the Egyptian–Palestine border. By dawn on 9 January, the regiment and division had reached the border, and the brigade manoeuvred to attack Rafa from the north-east. The 8th Squadron, leading the regiment, was moving around to the north of village, when <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> defenders opened fire on them. The regiment galloped forward, and one of their troops captured fifty prisoners at a police post. The remainder captured an uncompleted trench system, and another 171 prisoners, six of them German officers. The regiment was now position to block <b>the</b> <b>Turkish</b> withdrawal east, and were also able to observe the main Turkish defences.|$|E
