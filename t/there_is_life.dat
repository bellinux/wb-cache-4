Titan is far colder than Earth, and its surface lacks stable liquid water, factors which have led some scientists to consider life there unlikely. On the other hand, its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are bodies of liquid methane and ethane; some scientists speculate that these liquids might {{take the place of}} water in living cells different from those on Earth.|$|E

Although rumours of a relationship with Salman Khan first emerged in 2003, it was not until after their 2010 breakup that Kaif spoke of the affair, calling it her first serious relationship.

500|$|Viruses {{are found}} {{wherever}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>life</b> and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses is unclear {{because they do}} not form fossils, so molecular techniques have been used to compare the DNA or RNA of viruses and are a useful means of investigating how they arose. In addition, viral genetic material may occasionally integrate into the germline of the host organisms, by which they can be passed on vertically to the offspring of the host for many generations. This provides an invaluable source of information for paleovirologists to trace back ancient viruses that have existed up to millions of years ago. There are three main hypotheses that aim to explain the origins of viruses: ...|$|E

The reviewer added [...] " [...] often we are bombarded with wannabes [...] with weak vocals and insipid songs, [...] {{shows us that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>life</b> after pop idol and with 'a little bit' of cred." [...] Music Week also gave a positive review, noting the song was [...] "catchy". However, Ian Hyland, writing for the Sunday Mirror was critical of the song, giving it a grade of 6 out of 10. He remarked that Ribbons [...] "fails" [...] at doing [...] "sexy R'n'B". Similarly, Julie MacCaskill of the Daily Record dismissed it as [...] "a lacklustre affair with the wannabe star ditching her Mariah sound- a-like singing in favour of becoming a Kylie clone". The single debuted at number nineteen on the UK Singles Chart, the week dated January 25, 2003. The position became its peak position. The following week, the song dropped to number thirty-seven and the week after exited the top forty.|$|E

[...] Renshaw also praises Daron Malakian's guest spot, but considers Tom Morello's contribution a disappointment. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine observes [...] "Far from sounding as if they're grasping at straws, Linkin Park seem rejuvenated, proving there is {{value in the}} cliché of returning to roots." [...] Dan Epstein from Revolver described the album as [...] "...not only the hardest and heaviest thing they've ever released, but it's also their first album to pack the sort of guitar firepower that would actually appeal to your average headbanger." [...] Epstein concludes by stating that it's proof that bands don't need to get softer in order to mature. At Billboard, Kenneth Partridge states [...] "...these Cali rap-rock commandos go rogue, flinging missiles in all directions. They attack record companies, politicians, rule makers, exes, and anyone else in sight, all the while rediscovering the savage fun of super-loud guitars." [...] Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph stated [...] "...it is sleek, exciting and committed enough to suggest <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>life</b> in the rock beast yet." [...] Jordan Blum at PopMatters rated it a 5/10, describing it as a [...] "solid album", but considers it [...] "too repetitive, uninspired, and generic", compared to the three previous albums. Rolling Stone reviewer Jon Dolan states that [...] "on Album Six they're back with a retro-neo-aggro sound that would've been too intense for modern-rock radio in 1999...these dudes can still bring it like backward-ball-cap warriors hopped up on Mountain Dew and Dad's fourth divorce." ...|$|E

In 2007, Crooked Hook released their first full-length LP titled, The Captain Will Be Your Guide. The Mountain Movers have since released several EP's and in 2010, released their second full-length album, Apple Mountain. Shortly after the breakup of Spring Heeled Jack, Omonte started his own promotion company named Shaki Presents and began booking underground bands for [...] "Sundazed at Bar", a free Sunday night event at [...] "Bar", a club in New Haven.

2500|$|The apostles {{claimed that}} Jesus' {{death was a}} {{sacrifice}} of an innocent man {{for the sins of}} the guilty. But [...] "...Jesus had done away with the concept of 'guilt' itself [...] he had denied any chasm between God and man, he lived this unity of God and man as his 'glad tidings'...." [...] In order to claim that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>life</b> after death, the apostles ignored Jesus' example of blessed living. Paul made immortality the main point in 1 Corinthians 15:17 when he said [...] "...if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain." [...] "Paul himself even taught personal immortality as a reward." [...] Paul used the promise of life after death as a way to seize tyrannical power over the masses of lower-class people. This changed Christianity from a peace movement that achieves actual happiness into a religion whose final judgment offers possible resurrection and eternal life. Paul falsified the history of Christianity, the history of Israel, and the history of mankind by making them all seem to be a preparation for the crucifixion. [...] "The great lie of personal immortality destroys all rationality, all natural in the instincts—all that is healthy, all that is life—promoting, all that guarantees a future now arouses mistrust." [...] The meaning of life {{is that there is no}} meaning to present life. One lives for life in the beyond. By offering immortal life after death to everyone, Christianity appealed to everyone's egoism. The laws of nature would be broken for the salvation of everyone. [...] "...t is to this pitiable flattery of personal vanity that Christianity owes its victory [...] it is with this that it has persuaded over to its side everything illconstituted, rebelliousminded, underprivileged, all the scum and refuse of mankind." [...] This influenced politics and led to revolutions against aristocracies. Nietzsche claimed that Paul's pretense of holiness and his use of priestly concepts were typically Jewish. Christianity separated itself from Judaism as though it was the chosen religion, [...] "...as if only the 'Christian' were the meaning, the salt, the measure and also the Last Judgment of all the rest." [...] Christianity then divided itself from the world by appropriating [...] "...the concepts 'God,' 'truth,' 'light,' 'spirit,' 'love,' 'wisdom,' 'life' as if these were synonyms of themselves..." [...] According to Nietzsche, [...] "In Christianity, as the art of holy lying, the whole of Judaism...attains its ultimate perfection." [...] "The Christian is only a Jew of a 'more liberal' persuasion." ...|$|E
