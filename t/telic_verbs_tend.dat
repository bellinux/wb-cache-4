40|$|Introduction The goal of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{semantic}} generalizations for verbs that start with the prefix re-. The approach I will take is to first develop an analysis <b>telic</b> <b>verbs</b> and their result states and then to show how generalizations about re- fall out of this analysis. I use meaning postulates in combination with lexical rules to state these generalizations. 1 A central aspect of lexical generalizations is the existence of large numbers of exceptions. I will discuss a number of these exceptions and show how they can be accommodated. The general approach is couched in a situation-based logic: Episodic Logic [Hwang, 1992] [Schubert & Hwang, 1990]. A number of researchers have worked on the semantics of re-, hence the title of this paper. Marchand [1966, p. 138 - 140] provides a wealth of observations couched in a descriptive approach.

40|$|In this paper, I {{provide a}} {{systematic}} {{account of the}} aspectual meanings of the modern Mongolian converb+bayi- forms (-ju bayi-, -γad bayi-, and -γsaγar bayi-) and highlight issues in the description in previous studies. The form -ju bayihas three meanings: progress, result, and state. The form -γad bayi- only expresses the result {{in the case of}} a single action and state. The form -γsaγar bayi- has the same meaning as -ju bayi- qualitatively, but the meaning of -γsaγar bayi- is different from that of -ju bayi- quantitatively in that the former expresses an action and state that extend over a prolonged period of time. In this paper, I also argue that the aspectual meanings of the three forms can be predicted by the lexcial meaning of the verb that they combine with, and propose an aspectual classification for modern Mongolian verbs. Firstly, Mongolian verbs are divided into stative and actual verbs, and I call the verbs for which the form -ju bayi- has the same meaning as the morphologically unmarked form stative verbs. Secondly, the actual verbs are sub-divided into <b>telic</b> and atelic <b>verbs,</b> and I call the verbs for which the form -γad bayi- has a resultative meaning <b>telic</b> <b>verbs.</b> Conversely, verbs of the -γad bayi- form that do not have the resultative meaning are called atelic <b>verbs.</b> Thirdly, <b>telic</b> <b>verbs</b> are sub-divided into telic A and telic B, and I call the verbs for which -ju bayi- can express resultativeness telic A, while the verbs for which the form -ju bayi- cannot express resultativeness telic B...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on the acquisition of the syntax-semantics interface and the syntax-discourse interface in L 2 has shown that linguistic properties at the interface between the syntax and other cognitive systems {{are more difficult to}} acquire than properties within one system (Sorace 2004, 2005; Tsimpli & Sorace 2006). The present study continues this line of research by examining learners knowledge of the role of lexical-semantics in the production and comprehension of Spanish verbal grammatical aspect. Using the same methodology, the study examined and compared English adult L 2 learners of Spanish with child & adult L 1 Spanish. Previous {{research on}} the production of verbal morphology in L 1, including Spanish, has shown that young children, 3 - 4 yr-olds, distribute perfective & imperfective morphology according to the telic/atelic lexical properties of the verb. In English and Spanish comprehension studies, previous results have shown that young children perform almost within target in the combination (<b>telic</b> <b>verb</b> + perfective) and at chance when (<b>telic</b> <b>verb</b> + imperfective) aspect are combined, suggesting that comprehension lags behind production and that perfective morphology is acquired earlier than imperfective morphology in child L 1 (Bronckar...|$|R

In this paper we use psycholinguistic techniques to address both these questions.

In the second experiment, this processing correlate reveals no differences in processing between inherently atelic and unspecified verbs, delayed or otherwise.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tendency}} to form morphologically marked two major groups of verbs in Georgian: dynamic verbs marked by thematic markers, on the one hand, and stative verbs makred by auxiliary verbs, on the other hand. This difference is manifested {{in the first and}} second persons of the present tense in the v-set marked forms. Stative verbs which formed the present tense without auxiliary verbs in old Georgian employ auxiliaries in contemporary Georgian (vzi vzivar ‘I am sitting’, vdga vdgavar ‘I am standing’ [...] .), whereas a large group of dynamic verbs presented without thematic markers in old Georgian takes thematic markers in contemporary Georgian (vtib vtibav ‘I am mowing it’, vt’ex vt’exav ‘I am breaking it’). All formally stative verbs are atelic verbs (vuq’varvar ‘S/he loves me’, vdgavar ‘I am standing’). They form the future tense by adding vowel prefixes. Within dynamic verbs, three large groups are distinguished: transitive <b>telic</b> <b>verbs</b> (vasheneb ‘I am building it’), intransitive <b>telic</b> <b>verbs</b> (vimalebi ‘I hide myself) and atelic verbs (vcxovrob ‘I live’, vmgheri ‘I sing’). <b>Telic</b> <b>verbs</b> (both dynamic transitives and dynamic intransitives) form the future tense by adding preverbs. Atelic verbs (both dynamic and stative) form the future tense by adding vowel prefixes. It is reasonable to identify three various types traditionally presented within conjugation type III: a) verbs formed with the markers –eb, -ob- and –av, b) verbs formed with the marker –i (vicini ‘I am laughing), and c) verbs formed with auxiliary verbs (vc’uxvar ‘I am worried). It is suggested to place the latter group (medioactives formed with auxiliary verbs, e. g. vc’uxvar ‘I am worried’, vdumvar ‘I am silent’) within the verbs formed with auxiliary verbs. Three other main groups within auxiliary formation verbs are the following: mediopassives (vdgavar ‘I am standing’), stative passives (vgdivar ‘I am lying thrown about’), and verbs where the 3 rd subject person marker –a is attached directly to the root (cxela ‘It’s hot’). Some other features, characteristic of each type, are also described. Separation of auxiliary and non auxiliary verb formation makes it possible to describe the relation between phonematic structure of verbs and conjugation types. Inversive verbs are presented as differnet groups reflecting a variety of morphology of direct verbs but marked with a shared syntactic pattern C.

40|$|This paper aims mainly at {{investigating}} {{if there}} is the formation of resultative constructions with simple adjective in Brazilian Portuguese, since researchers disagree {{on the existence of}} these constructions in Romance Languages. To start this discussion, first I make a distinction between resultative,depictive and circumstantial constructions. Then, I relate some of their main characteristics, testing how they appear in sentences written in Brazilian Portuguese. Afterwards, I propose an extension of Folli and Ramchand (2001) ’s analysis on the Portuguese. These authors use a structure of verb phrase thatconsists of three different projections, each one consisting in a subpart of the event: Cause, Process and Result. My hypothesis about the Brazilian Portuguese is that the verbs of causative alternation – as they imply change of state – are the head of Result projection and have as their complement an adjective small clause (SC), whose predicate indicates the telic aspect of event, forming a resultative construction. Following this perspective of analysis, I study the possibility of formation of adjective resultatives with atelic and <b>telic</b> <b>verbs</b> that admit causative alternation. I also approach – although briefly – other types of constructions that express results, whose secondary predicates are, respectively, a complex adjective phrase, a PP or a DP. In this paper, only the constructions resulting from verbal actions are considered. Thus, goal of motion constructions – in which prepositions indicate the following of movement and its ending – and resultative constructions with causative verbs are not considered. The results show that there are not resultative constructions in the Brazilian Portuguese equivalent to those found in Germanic Languages, in which an atelic <b>verb</b> becomes a <b>telic</b> <b>verb</b> by adding a resultative secondary predicate to the sentence...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{show that}} the {{implicit}} processing of telicity, dynamicity and agentivity differentially modulate neural activity across different brain clusters and, in particular, within lMTG. We found that selectivity for state and <b>telic</b> <b>verbs</b> identified the most anterior and the most posterior portion of lMTG, respectively. Furthermore, dynamicity and agentivity modulated brain responses in parietal and ventral extrastriate regions. The role of each property was clearly isolated, as the stimuli were specifically controlled for and the task design covertly assessed the representation of those properties. Different event types are differentially mapped based on their semantic representation and, in particular, lMTG represents conceptual semantic properties of verbs: specifically, that kind of conceptual information which is relevant to morphosyntax, that is, telicity, stativity and agentivity, that, unlike referential semantic features, and independently of them, govern morphosyntax in a specified way...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of how event concepts are organized in the brain {{still has to be}} fully clarified. The study of the neural correlates of verbs offers a unique opportunity to address this question. Events, in fact, are typically encoded into verb items, in natural languages. Moreover, the use of words (as opposed to pictures or scenes, for instance) allow to investigate event properties, independently of crucial perceptual properties and other cognitive processes involved in the elaboration of images. The role of lexical semantics in modulating neural activity associated with verbs remains unsettled. In this project we assess whether telicity, the property to have a specified endpoint, modulates neural response to verbs in previously identified verb-selective brain regions. To address these question, we use fMRI techniques to compare the patterns of neural activity associated with <b>telic</b> <b>verbs</b> with those associated with atelic verbs, including both states and activities) ...|$|R

In the present paper, we discuss past participle agreement phenomena {{in relation to}} different strategies of differential object marking. We show that past participle agreement is a strategy to encode prototypical undergoer arguments; whereas, differential object marking – specifically, the prepositional direct object (e. g., Spanish: Maria ha matado a Juan "Maria has killed Juan") – is a strategy to encode non-prototypical undergoer arguments, that is, the arguments whose inherent properties are {{in contrast with the}} thematic role of object.

It is proposed that the antipassive construction has imperfective viewpoint in contrast to the ergative construction. Antipassive morphology is obligatory with punctual <b>telic</b> <b>verbs,</b> i. e. achievements, which are verbs that have perfective viewpoint by default. Antipassive morphology is thus necessary to convey imperfective viewpoint for verbs that are by default perfective.

Istraživanje je provedeno na primjerima stotinjak najfrekventnijih glagola iz mrežnog korpusa hrWac 2. 0. Pokazano je da se većina glagola redovito rabi u pasivu dinamičkog tipa i da izražava sva tipična značenja nesvršenih glagola. Particip pasivni nesvršenih glagola ima i uporabe u kojima se ne rabi dinamički, kod kojih se posebno relevantnom pokazuje opreka između teličnih i ateličnih glagola. Primijećeno je i to da se od nekih glagola particip pasivni ne tvori, iako je morfološki moguć. Konačno, skrenuta je pozornost na činjenicu da je pasiv nesvršenih glagola u načelu zamjenjiv se-pasivom u izražavanju budućnosti i prošlosti, što pokazuje da vid nije osobito važan parametar pri izboru između dviju pasivnih konstrukcija u hrvatskome jeziku. The study {{examines}} {{the use of}} imperfective verbs in the passive participle form in the Croatian language. For {{the purposes of the}} study, ninety seven of the most frequent imperfective verbs which form the passive participle were collected from the hrWac 2. 0 corpus (stative transitive verbs cannot normally form the passive participle). They were analyzed with respect to the criteria of frequency and acceptability. It was shown that most of the analyzed verbs are used freely in the dynamic passive function and that they express all of the typical meanings of imperfective verbs. The imperfective passive participle has some special uses when not used dynamically, in which case the contrast between <b>telic</b> and atelic <b>verbs</b> proves to be crucial. Atelic verbs, often used in the premodifying position, express permanent or characteristic features. In this function they can be replaced by the reflexive passive form, which conveys the same meaning. <b>Telic</b> <b>verbs,</b> on the other hand, have a twofold use. Numerous verbs can express the characteristic of an object that {{is the result of a}} previous action. This resultative use is quite idiosyncratic and such participles are often limited to premodifying position. The other use is the General Factual function, in which an imperfective verb is used to express a single, completed action. In neither use can <b>telic</b> <b>verbs</b> be replaced by the reflexive passive form. It was also noted that a dozen verbs are rarely used in the passive participle form, and their passive participle seems less acceptable than the rest of the sample. We have found no plausible explanation for this finding. Finally, the passive form of imperfective verbs may generally be substituted by the reflexive passive when expressing the future or past, which in turn shows that the verbal aspect is not a particularly important parameter when deciding between these two constructions in Croatian...|$|R

However, I will show that Vedic i “go”, gā “go; come; step” and gam “go; come” express a deictically-neutral meaning of ‘moving along a path’, which is not characterized with regard to both MANNER and PATH. Data suggest that these verbs can take on a deictic interpretation by cooccurring with specific particles, adverbs, demonstratives, and personal pronouns. Syntactic and discourse analysis of the Rigveda shows that motion verbs occurring in the same syntactic context are selected depending on their inherent lexical aspect (Aktionsart). <b>Telic</b> <b>verbs</b> gā and gam turn out to be intrinsically compatible with the entailment of arrival of the FIGURE to the GROUND, whereas the atelic verb i is used when the prominent information is PATH rather than GOAL of movement...|$|R
