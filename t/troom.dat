40|$|Tomato {{is among}} the most {{important}} diet source of bioactive substances such as carotenoids, especially lycopene, and phenolic compounds. The effect of industrial process parameters, in particular lethality (F 100) and ºBrix, and of storage for a period up to 24 months at <b>Troom</b> on bioactive compounds content and activity of tomato sauce was investigated. Total phenolic and lycopene content were not affected by the considered industrial process parameters and remained significantly unchanged during storage conditions. The specific antioxidant power decreased appreciably in the first months of storage and after 24 months it diminished by 27 %...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Contamination of soils due to {{the release}} of {{effluents}} or deposition of wastes containing hexavalent chromium has been arising serious environmental problems. Therefore, the development of cost effectiveness but also ecological cleaning techniques is a matter of great concern among the scientific community. Bioremediation is attracting more and more attention due to its efficiency, low impact in the ecosystems and low cost. In particular, this study approaches a bioleaching technique using an Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans DSM 504 pure culture to clean a soil contaminated with hexavalent chromium. Eight batch tests were performed in order to evaluate the effect of combined parameters: operational temperature (26 ºC and <b>Troom),</b> hexavalent chromium concentration (50 mg kg- 1 and 100 mg k...|$|E
40|$|Elizabeth Holt and Rebecca Clift 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009. Reported speech, whereby we {{quote the}} words of others, is used in many {{different}} types of interaction. In this revealing study, a team of leading experts explore how reported speech is designed, the actions it is used to perform, and how it fits into the environments in which it is used. Using contemporary techniques of conversation analysis, the authors show how speech is reported {{in a wide range of}} contexts - including ordinary conversation, storytelling, news interviews, cour <b>troom</b> trials and medium-sitter interactions. Providing detailed analyses of reported speech in naturallyoccurring talk, the authors examine existing linguistic and sociological studies, and offer some insights into the phenomenon. Bringing together work from the most recent investigations in conversation analysis, this book will be invaluable to all those interested in the study of interaction, in particular how we report the speech of others, and the different forms this can take...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{industrial}} processing, product parameters (lethality F 10 100 and Brix) and storage (up to 24 months at <b>Troom)</b> {{on the content}} and antioxidant capacity (AC) of the bioactive compounds in industrial tomato sauce were studied. The total phenolic content (TPC) of both the hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions (using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and a direct absorbance reading at 280 nm), {{in addition to the}} lycopene content and AC (using the ABTS+ assay), were analysed. Statistical analysis showed that the content and activity of the studied bioactive constituents were positively influenced by the Brix but not influenced by the thermal treatment severity (up to 40 min as F 10 100), that the TPC and its AC did not vary during storage, and that the lycopene AC decreased by 30 % in the first year and then remained constant. The lycopene fraction and the hydrophilic fractions contributed 83 % and 27 %, respectively, of the sauce AC...|$|E

The bioleaching technique herein exposed presented removal values between 33. 3 % and 83. 3 %, undergoing higher deviations due to changes on the contamination pH. Generally, it was more efficient when applied to soils contaminated with acid solutions. The lowest and highest values were both observed for operational temperatures of 26 ºC and hexavalent chromium concentrations of 50 mg kg- 1. Moreover, the highest value was observed for the soil contaminated with a hexavalent chromium solution of pH 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of two cooled mm-wave mixers is described. A Josephson point contact mixer was designed for 30 - 40  GHz. The Nb point contact {{is located in a}} symmetrical Nb waveguide flange using suitable insulating material. This construction allows the junction to be adjusted at <b>Troom</b> and makes it mechanically stable against shocks and temperature cycling. At 36  GHz the conversion loss was measured to be 5  dB when using an IF of 60  MHz. The mixer works evenly at frequencies 30 - 40  GHz. A cooled Schottky diode mixer was designed for 75 - 120  GHz. New details of this mixer include improved waveguide, backshort, RF filter and IF matching and bias circuit designs. This mixer is used in a cooled receiver (15  K) where LO is coupled by an adjustable ring-filter. The mixer is followed by a 4. 5 - 5. 0  GHz IF system of TIF = 24  K. For this receiver DSB noise temperatures of TRDSB = 140 - 230  K have been measured at any LO frequency from 75 to 120 GHz. The best SSB receiver noise temperature measured is TRSSB = 275  K at 88  GHz including a quasi-optical feed system. This implies a mixer noise temperature of TMSSB < 100  K. Finally a discussion on noise temperature and noise figure calculations and noise measurements is presented. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{focuses on}} the study of the thermal properties of starch corn processed using thermo-alkaline treatment. Using Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC) these investigators studied the changes during gelatinization of starch in alkaline solution water-calcium hydroxide Ca(OH) 2 at concentrations from 0. 1 to 0. 3 % (g Ca(OH) 2 /g dry starch). The scanning was carried out at 80 % (w/w) moisture and 5 °C/min in nitrogen environment. Similarly, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to study the thermal degradation of starch treated utilizing this method. The treated starch was subjected to heating ramps from <b>Troom</b> to 800 °C using different rates. The MDSC results indicate that the interaction of calcium ions and starch shifts the gelatinization peak to higher temperatures when the concentration increases. In the same manner results show changes in the enthalpy values of the transition compared to when gelatinization occurs only in the presence of water. However, the disruption power of alkali has a limit. On the other hand, TG data of the principal stage of degradation permitted to find the activation energy of raw and treated corn starch, using Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and also Kissinger methods. TGA analysis demonstrated that thermo-alkaline treatment with Ca(OH) 2, had a decelerator role in thermal degradation of corn starch. More complete knowledge of activation energy as a barrier to initiate decomposition process helped in the understanding of thermal decomposition stability of corn starch when thermo-alkaline treatment is used in food industry...|$|E
