[...] More importantly, he had <b>the</b> <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> {{each and}} every one of the state's county party organizations, which number twenty-one.

5|$|On June 30, Goldwater {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> moderate Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois after {{traveling to}} the Midwest to gain delegates. Dirksen's support further deflated the Stop Goldwater movement, as the Senator had criticized Goldwater's earlier vote against the Civil Rights Act, but concluded upon further review {{that he was only}} being consistent with his views. Richard Nixon followed suit and endorsed Goldwater two days later.|$|E

5|$|A related {{experiment}} {{which also}} had Teller's endorsement {{was a plan}} to extract oil from the tar sands in northern Alberta with nuclear explosions, titled Project Oilsands. The plan actually received <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the Alberta government, but {{was rejected by the}} Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to having any nuclear weapons in Canada. After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to have nuclear weapons, from a US nuclear sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|After the 1922 elections, Cotillo {{became the}} {{chairman}} of the influential State Senate Judiciary Committee, a sign of his rising authority. The post helped him to get ready for a next step. In 1924, he was the first Italian-born to become Justice of the New York Supreme Court, First District, where he would he remain until his death. He was elected with <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the Tammany Hall political machine, many social welfare organizations and organized labor, the Citizen's Union and several bar organizations.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the Council.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> Admiral Sims, the Navy Department {{initially}} {{rejected the}} British request. Like other navies of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, the U.S. Navy rigidly {{adhered to the}} doctrine of Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose first tenet was that under no circumstances should a battle fleet be divided. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson and Admiral Henry T. Mayo—Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet—were particularly worried that if Britain fell, as developments at sea suggested it might, the U.S. Navy would be left to face the German High Seas Fleet completely on its own.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{spent most}} of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls. He briefly made a trip to Mountain View, California to make a speech before {{returning}} to the trails in Iowa. He participated in the last Democratic Debate before the primary season on December 13 in Johnson, Iowa. In this debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register, Dodd commented that Education was the most important issue to him in the campaign. He also made a statement on why he felt he was the best choice for president and why he should receive <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the Des Moines Register, which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the Daily News—one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.|$|E
2500|$|Weber Jr. {{continued}} the aggressive advertising practices of his father, including traditional advertising, [...] "World's Fair"-type judging competitions, securing <b>the</b> <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> celebrities and royalty, and exhibition by well-known pianists in large cities.

5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, two major issues surfaced. First, Waterfield favored {{a tax on}} parimutuel betting, while Clements opposed it. Second, Waterfield {{supported}} the development of electric power generation through public utilities, while Clements favored private development (which won him {{the support of the}} Kentucky Utilities company). The Clements campaign also attacked Waterfield for being deemed physically unfit for military service. Clements received a late boost when he gained <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> John Y. Brown, Sr., garnering added support from organized labor. Ultimately, Clements defeated Waterfield by over 30,000 votes.|$|E

Kilroy was one of four candidates to receive <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the Franklin County Democratic Party. On November 5, 1991, she placed behind incumbent Columbus School Board President, Sharlene Morgan, natural resources expert Robert Teater, past board member Bill Moss, which made her the fourth among the eighteen candidates and the final elected member.|$|E
5|$|Federalist state legislatures, {{primarily}} those {{north of}} the Potomac River, sent the Kentucky General Assembly negative responses to the resolutions. Nicholas convinced Jefferson that Kentucky should adopt {{a second set of}} resolutions affirming the first, lest the lack of a reply be seen acquiescence. Jefferson refused to compose these resolutions, maintaining that there were sufficiently talented individuals in Kentucky to compose them and fearing still that he would be discovered as the author of the first set. Breckinridge, chosen Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives {{at the outset of the}} 1799 session, took on the task, drafting resolutions reasserting the original principles and endorsing nullification. The resolutions unanimously passed the House. The Federalist minority in the Senate opposed them, especially <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> nullification, but that chamber also adopted the resolutions as written. Breckinridge's presumed authorship of the original resolutions and his subsequent defense of them caused his popularity to soar in Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Newsom placed {{first in}} the November 4, 2003, general {{election}} in a nine-man field. Newsom received 41.9 {{percent of the vote}} to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 19.6 {{in the first round of}} balloting, but he faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff when many of the city's liberal groups coalesced around Gonzalez. The race was partisan with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported. Democratic leadership felt that they needed to reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger. National figures from the Democratic Party, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned on Newsom's behalf. Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez while Newsom received <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> Willie Brown.|$|E
5|$|Solis had the {{opportunity}} to run for the California State Assembly when, after California's 1991 redistricting, the incumbent Dave Elder in Solis's 57th State Assembly district was shifted into another district, while her new representative retired. In the June 1992 Democratic primary to fill the open seat, Solis's opponents had <b>the</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> powerful State Assemblyman Richard Polanco and the former incumbent. Solis had the support of Molina and U.S. Representative Barbara Boxer, in an effort that focused on door-to-door campaigning and featured Solis's mother making burritos for campaign volunteers. Solis came out on top of a three-way Democratic race, receiving 49percent of the vote and besting her nearest competitor, future Assemblyman Ed Chavez, who received 31percent. In the general election, Solis garnered 61percent of the vote against Republican Gary Woods' 34percent, and gained election to the Assembly. She was one of seven Latinos who won election to the Assembly {{in the wake of the}} redistricting and became collectively known as Los Siete. Solis was among the most liberal of this ideologically diverse group.|$|E

50|$|The Protectionists {{enjoyed the}} support of the {{powerful}} Australian Natives' Association (ANA) throughout the campaign as well as <b>the</b> <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Age and The Sydney Bulletin, while Free Trade received support from business interests and <b>the</b> <b>endorsements</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Sydney Morning Herald, The Daily Telegraph, The Brisbane Courier, Melbourne's The Argus and The Adelaide Register. Labour could only rely on union-owned newspapers, although some of these enjoyed a great level of influence in some electorates (the Gympie Truth for example is considered to have {{played an important role in}} the election of its part-owner, Andrew Fisher, in Wide Bay).|$|R
