40|$|Phosphorus {{oxychloride}} (POCl 3) and <b>thiophosphoryl</b> <b>chloride</b> (PSCl 3) {{are useful}} phosphorylating reagents. However, {{they are usually}} used under dry conditions as their reactivity toward water has been perceived as a problem. As part of an on-going program to develop aqueous aminophosphorylation procedures, we have investigated the reactivities of phosphodichloridate and thiophosphodichloridate ions in aqueous solutions as more selective water-soluble alternatives to POCl 3 and PSCl 3. We report the pH-kobs profiles for the hydrolyses of phosphodichloridate and thiophosphodichloridate ions in aqueous solutions. Both species show broad pH-kobs plateaus that extend to high pHs. The aminolyses of phosphodichloridate and thiophosphodichloridate ions in aqueous amine solutions have also been followed. Good selectivity towards aminolysis over hydrolysis processes has been observed. We have applied our kinetic data towards the optimisation of aqueous aminophosphorylation procedures, {{which has led to}} near-quantitative conversion of amino-nucleosides to thiophosphoramidate products. Finally, an additional research project focused upon peri-dimethylamino substituent effects on proton transfer at carbon in α-naphthylacetate esters. Rate constants for the exchange of hydrogen for deuterium at the α-CH 2 positions of naphthalen- 1 -yl-acetic acid tert-butyl ester and 8 -(N,N-dimethylamino-naphthalen- 1 -yl) -acetic acid tert-butyl ester have been determined in potassium deuteroxide solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{established}} novel, aqueous 'Click' chemistry {{that is based}} on the thiophosphoryl group. Two systems for the creation of thiophosphoryl derivatives were involved: Thiophosphoramidate I and Bromoacetyl II. The first step in the Thiophosphoramidate system is our aqueous thiophosphorylation of amines using <b>thiophosphoryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> Through careful control of reaction conditions we have devised a method that allows us to prepare and alkylate the thiophosphoramidate group in aqueous media with high conversions, and thus provide a fast, clean and straightforward route to a number of products. The thiophosphoramidate system was, then, successfully applied towards the production of nucleoside monothiophosphoramidates. In addition, a number of quinoline-based thiophosphoramidates were generated as potential antileishmanials and in vivo assays were performed against Leishmania mexicana. The bromoacetyl system uses thiophosphorylated alcohols that we alkylated with a range of activated bromoacetate esters. Hydrolysis and aminolysis kinetic studies were employed on this system for {{a better understanding of the}} conditions required for facile production of amides on these thiophosphoryl acetate esters in water. Finally, we have combined the achievements from these two systems into the thiophosphoramidate-romoacetyl strategy III, expanding the scope for generating thiophosphoryl derivatives.

40|$|A {{selected}} {{ion flow}} tube {{was used to}} investigate the positive ion chemistry of <b>thiophosphoryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> PSCl_ 3. Rate coefficients and ion product branching ratios have been determined {{at room temperature for}} reactions with nineteen cations; H_ 3 O^+, CF_ 3 ^+, CF^+, NO^+, NO_ 2 ^+, SF_ 2 ^+, SF^+, CF_ 2 ^+, O_ 2 ^+, H_ 2 O^+, N_ 2 O^+, O^+, CO_ 2 ^+, CO^+, N^+, N_ 2 ^+, Ar^+, F^+ and Ne^+ (in order of increasing recombination energy). Complementary data described in the previous paper have been obtained for this molecule via the observation of threshold photoelectron photoion coincidences. For ions whose recombination energies are in the range 10 - 22 eV, comparisons are made between the product ion branching rations of PSCl_ 3 from photoionisation and from ion-molecule reactions. In most instances, the data from the two experiments are well correlated, suggesting that long-range charge transfer is the dominant mechanism for these ion-molecule reactions; the agreement is particularly good for the atomic ions Ar^+, F^+ and Ne^+. Some reactions (e. g. O_ 2 ^+ + PSCl_ 3), however, exhibit significant differences; short-range charge transfer must then be occurring following the formation of an ion-molecule complex. For ions whose recombination energies are less than 10 eV (i. e. H_ 3 O^+, CF_ 3 ^+, CF^+ and NO^+), reactions can only occur via a chemical process in which bonds are broken and formed, because the recombination energy of the cation is less than the ionisation energy of PSCl_ 3...|$|E
