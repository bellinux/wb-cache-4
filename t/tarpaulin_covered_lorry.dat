By February 1916, as shown {{in a letter to}} his wife, he had gravitated to military camouflage. His technique for hiding artillery from aerial observation was to paint canvas covers in broadly pointillist style. He took pleasure in creating a series of nine such <b>tarpaulin</b> <b>covers</b> in styles varying [...] "from Manet to Kandinsky", suspecting that the latter could be the most effective against aircraft flying at 2000 meters or higher.|$|R

50|$|The {{command of}} Stanisławów {{was taken over}} by SS-Hauptsturmführer Hans Krueger who set up a branch office of the KdS in the city. One month earlier, Krüger was {{involved}} in organizing the massacre of Lviv professors in occupied Lwów (Lviv since 1945). Under his command, on 8-9 August 1941 more Poles and Jews in Stanisławów were arrested, also teachers, civil servants and professors. They were summoned according to a list, compiled by the Ukrainian People's Militia who were helping the German Security Police (officially, the collaborationist Ukrainian Auxiliary Police was created in mid-August by Heinrich Himmler). On 15 August, the prisoners were transported in <b>covered</b> <b>lorries</b> to a place near the city, named the Black Forest (Czarny Las) and executed. The number of victims is estimated at 200-300.|$|R
50|$|During {{its service}} the tank {{proved to be}} not entirely adapted to winter conditions, due to an {{incomplete}} draining of the cooling system, caused by a water pump system that had been modified to reduce engine height. A small shaft would break after the impeller pump froze. The repair of the shaft, considering the field conditions, proved very impractical and required three people. Two people had to hold a third person by the legs and lower him into the engine bay, where he had to loosen the fastening and remove the broken shaft. Then, he was pulled out and lowered back down to install the new shaft. He was repeatedly lowered until the new part was secured. Another serious problem discovered during the winter conditions was that the crews of the T-44A suffered from frostbite because of the complete lack of a heating system. The driver {{was supposed to be}} protected from rain and snow by a removable <b>Tarpaulin</b> <b>cover</b> with a small glass window. However, this was not successful and its use was deemed impractical.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} use of irresolvable and {{permanent}} garbage in environment to build an energy saving wall in cold and hot climatic conditions. The wall is mainly constructed from plastic bottles which provide lightness. The bottles, filled with water to store solar energy, are confined between two walls and able to provide wall stability. Transparent twin wall polycarbonate sheets have been selected as the external surface in order to let the bottles receive solar energy. The inner layer is opaque and fire resistant. A tarpaulin with a reflective inner face is used to prevent heat loss during cold and heat conditions. As the empirical results of the built sample (45 * 65 cm) indicate, in cold season, the wall stores the solar energy {{during the day and}} transfers the heat indoors (by conduction) at nights, when the <b>tarpaulin</b> <b>covers</b> the exterior. In hot season, the tarpaulin protects the wall from sunlight during the day. At night the wall transfers the heat outdoors {{in the absence of the}} tarpaulin. A comparison of the alternative wall with similar kinds of contemporary construction walls addresses it considerably light...|$|R
50|$|The {{camp was}} a slave Arbeitslager ("labour camp"), {{supplying}} manpower to several armament factories and a stone quarry. Most of the prisoners were Polish Jews. The death rate in the camp was very high. Many prisoners, including many children and women, died of typhus, starvation, and executions. Płaszów camp became particularly infamous for both individual and mass shootings carried out there. Using Hujowa Górka, a large hill close to the camp commonly used for executions, some 8,000 deaths took place outside the camp’s fences with prisoners trucked in 3 to 4 times weekly. The <b>covered</b> <b>lorries</b> from Kraków used to arrive in the morning. The condemned were walked into a trench of the Hujowa Górka hillside and shot, and their bodies then covered with dirt, layer upon layer. In early 1944, all corpses were exhumed and burnt in a heap to hide the evidence. Witnesses later attested that 17 truckloads of human ashes {{were removed from the}} burning site and scattered over the area.|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later, a {{tremendous}} tropical shower commenced, and for an hour the rain came down in torrents. Gradually the enemy's fire slackened. The English had <b>tarpaulins</b> to <b>cover</b> their ammunition, which, therefore, suffered no injury. The natives had no such coverings, and their powder was soon completely wetted, by the deluge of rain. Mir Mudin Khan, knowing that his own guns had been rendered useless, believed that those of the English were in a similar condition; and, leading out his cavalry, made a splendid charge down upon the grove.|$|R

The two men who lay sleeping in the bow knew nothing of his death, and they were so weak from exhaustion at the time the boy died that Dominick had thought it unnecessary to rouse them.

The force had been assembled at Crown Point, and numbered sixteen hundred regulars, Canadians, and Indians. Everything needful for their comfort had been provided--overcoats, blankets, bear skins to sleep on, and <b>tarpaulins</b> to <b>cover</b> them.

Schwerpunkte lagen dabei auf der Ermittlung der Resilienz oekologisch wichtiger Organismen nach 'Sulfideinbruechen' und auf Untersuchungen zur Toleranz gegenueber Sauerstoffmangel und Sulfid. Waren waehrend DYSMON I ueberwiegend natuerliche Standorte beprobt worden, so konnten waehrend DYSMON II oekologische Manipulationsexperimente (Planenabdeckung) vorgenommen werden, um natuerliche Algenabdeckungen zu simulieren. Als Realexperiment gelang es, im Mai 1995 am Standort Hiddensee die Auswirkung einer sehr dicken Algenschicht zu erfassen. Diese natuerliche Entstehung von anoxischen, sulfidischen Bedingungen erlaubte einen Vergleich mit der experimentell induzierten Anoxie in den Sedimenten. (orig.) Working {{from the}} results of DYSMON I the purpose of the DYSMON II project was to examine the {{emergence}} of sulphidic, low-oxygen environments and microorganismic and faunal responses to this. The focus was on determining the resilience of ecologically important organisms after sudden drops in sulphide concentration and tolerance of oxygen deficiency and sulphide. Whereas in DYSMON I samples had largely been taken from natural sites, DYSMON II made use of ecological manipulation experiments (<b>tarpaulin</b> <b>covers)</b> so as to simulate natural covering with algae. A real-life experiment took place at Hiddensee in May 1995 when the effects of a very thick layer of algae were examined. This natural occurrence of an anoxic, sulphidic environment permitted a comparison with the experimentally induced anoxia in the sediments. (orig.)

40|$|This {{exhibition}} of handmade ceramic work was created {{over three years}} in the ceramics studios at UCA, Farnham. The work is an exploration of the artist's own African and South African identities. The exhibition forms part of a practice-led PhD thesis entitled: Africa and the West: a contested dialogue in modern and contemporary ceramics. The exhibition comprises three themes in which an animal or animal-related symbol {{has been used as a}} metaphor and a starting point for examining questions of identity and representation. In the first phase this is relatively simple. Nguni cattle are synonymous with KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the artist comes from. In 'Object/ify', cattle forms are arranged to create a large herd-like grouping. The second theme is centred on notions of official forms of identification and identity documents. The plastic ear tag commonly used to 'mark' cattle in commercial farming practices all over the world have been remade in clay in their hundreds, and suspended using silk thread. The third animal symbol is more abstract. The group of insects known collectively as 'wood-borer' pose a significant threat to suburban houses in the port city of Durban, South Africa. To get rid of these insects, pest control companies use extermination tents. These large <b>tarpaulins</b> <b>cover</b> entire houses during fumigation. The striking forms of these giant 'skins' over houses have been translated into an installation of ceramic 'Extermination Tents' made from thin porcelain and terracotta paper clay. Inner structures of grey stoneware clay that echo scaffolding hold up some of these fragile tents. Through this careful grouping of objects, the project moves away from rural symbols. This draws more closely from the artist's own experience, that of growing up in an African city...|$|R

5000|$|The killings continued. Appointed Chief of {{the local}} Gestapo Office in Stanisławów, Krueger {{organized}} the execution of six hundred intellectuals on 2 August 1941 only one day after his arrival there. The same grave site in the forest called Czarny Las near Pawełcze village (Pawelce), was used on 15 August in the Black Forest (Czarny Las) massacre of 200-300 prisoners, mostly teachers, civil servants and professors transported out of Gestapo jail in <b>covered</b> <b>lorries</b> by SIPO. On 6 October 1941 in nearby Nadworna some 2,000 Jews: men, {{women and children were}} murdered on Krueger's orders, marking the beginning of the Final Solution in the General Government months before the Wannsee Conference near Berlin put it in motion in 1942. One week later, on 12 October 1941 with the aid of the Orpo Reserve Police Battalion 133 from Lemberg and the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, Krueger organized the Bloody Sunday massacre of 10,000-12,000 Jews in Stanisławów, where most of the remaining Jewish population of the city was brought into a Jewish cemetery and shot continuously until after dark. Krueger took part in the killings. [...] "Over the span of sixteen months (wrote historian Dieter Pohl), this small police station [...] its staff at times numbering only twenty-five [...] organized and implemented the shooting of some 70,000 Jews and the deportation of another 12,000 to death camps. Acts of such monstrous proportions are generally associated only with the large SS killing squads." [...] The atrocities committed on his orders constituted the beginning of the Holocaust by bullet on the Eastern Front.|$|R
60|$|As the Mafeking {{guns were}} {{too weak to}} answer the enemy's fire, the only {{possible}} reply lay in a sortie, and upon this Colonel Powell decided. It was carried out with great gallantry {{on the evening of}} October 27th, when about a hundred men under Captain FitzClarence moved out against the Boer trenches with instructions to use the bayonet only. The position was carried with a rush, and many of the Boers bayoneted before they could disengage themselves from the <b>tarpaulins</b> which <b>covered</b> them. The trenches behind fired wildly in the darkness, and it is probable that as many of their own men as of ours were hit by their rifle fire. The total loss in this gallant affair was six killed, eleven wounded, and two prisoners. The loss of the enemy, though shrouded as usual in darkness, was certainly very much higher.|$|R
