5|$|Farmers use live {{electric}} wires to guard their farms, which kills other animals as well. Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding compensation for <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{estimates}} Domitian's {{annual income}} {{at more than}} 1.2 billion sestertii, of which over one-third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army.

5|$|Upon {{investigation}} {{and analysis of}} measurements and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the tornado, it was given a rating of 'F3' on the Fujita scale.

High unemployment caused some of the population to move away as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties {{occurred and}} 1,500people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; {{the same area}} was affected with more precipitation {{a few days later}} by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the storm, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hazel was {{the deadliest}} and costliest {{hurricane}} of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm {{killed at least}} 400people in Haiti before striking the United States near the border between North and South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane. After causing 95fatalities in the US, Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81people, mostly in Toronto.

He was {{to have an opportunity to}} pursue these views in later roles with the National Gallery of Victoria.|$|E
30|$|A good {{basis for}} reconstructing <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{earthquake}} of 1670 in Hall is the Dreifache Chronik der Stadt Hall im Innthale (Seeböck 1882). In this chronicle {{there is an}} accurate description of buildings <b>damaged</b> by <b>the</b> earthquake in a survey which was carried out nine days after the earthquake (Seeböck 1882, 314). Moser (1989) used this chronicle inter alia {{as a basis for}} his comprehensive publication {{on the development of the}} old town of Hall, in which he also considered <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> earthquake.|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} {{underwent a}} series of repairs and redecoration, {{carried out by the}} Steel Coleman Davis Partnership in the early 21st century. These included a significant structural repair, as the main supporting roof truss was badly damaged. The frontage was also upgraded to withstand the weathering effects of being north-facing, and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> being so close to the road. Services continue to be held at the Unitarian Chapel, and as of March 2015, are held twice a month, on the first and third Sundays of each month.|$|E
5|$|The market cross was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family {{who were the}} local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. It still bears <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> cannon fire in the Civil War. Nearby was an older cross known as the Butter Cross which has subsequently been moved to the outskirts of the village. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It is also important to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
50|$|Northerners {{were outraged}} at British {{tolerance}} of non-neutral acts, especially {{the building of}} warships.

5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Before urban development, <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> {{overgrazing}} {{during the}} Spanish period was still considered capable of recovery. However, {{the completion of}} Interstate 5 {{through the middle of}} the San Juan Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into a bedroom community for Los Angeles and permanently erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of urbanized land increased from 3percent in 1964 to 18percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urbanized. With continuing development in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the cannon, {{the castle}} escaped the slighting, or {{deliberate}} damaging, that occurred {{to many other}} castles {{at the end of}} the civil war. Nonetheless, Richard Prater was forbidden to return to the castle, despite his promises to support Parliament, and his son, George Prater, only recovered Nunney from its interim owners after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. The castle declined and was sold by the Praters to William Whitchurch around 1700. During the 18th century the building was still in a reasonable condition and in 1789 an order was received make it ready to receive French prisoners, although it is unlikely they ever arrived.|$|E
