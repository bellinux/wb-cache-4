5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>questions</b> being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E

25|$|Obtaining precise {{number is}} {{difficult}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. One of the major reasons for the difference in statistical findings regarding homosexuality and bisexuality {{has to do with the}} nature of <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>questions.</b> Major research studies on sexual orientation are discussed. Most of the studies listed below rely on self-report data, which poses challenges to researchers inquiring into sensitive subject matter. More importantly, the studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex sexual experiences and attractions while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as homosexual or bisexual. Fewer research subjects identify as homosexual or bisexual than report having had sexual experiences or attraction to a person of the same sex. Several studies of sexual orientation in countries provide comparative perspectives. Tables comparing several U.S. cities' population numbers are also included. However, since many individuals may fail to report outside the heterosexual norm or define their sexuality in their own unique terms, it is difficult to fully grasp the size of the LGBT population. The type of survey being used and the type of setting a subject is in while being surveyed may also affect the answer that the subject gives.|$|E

50|$|When {{the study}} began the primary outcome being {{measured}} {{was whether the}} vaccine decreased the viral load, which is amount of HIV {{in the blood of}} study participants who received the vaccine then later became infected with HIV. At that time, researchers stated that the vaccine was very unlikely to provide any protection from HIV infection.

As a result of this change to <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>questions,</b> NIAID also announced an expansion in the desired enrollment to a total of 2200 participants.
