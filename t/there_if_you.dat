500|$|Based on the premiere, Merrill Barr of Forbes {{felt that}} the show [...] "has grown up a lot since its first year, and with the start of season three, it's hard to imagine what {{complaints}} any fans could possibly still have. If you want overall continuity, you got it. If you want people with super powers going crazy, it's <b>there.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want an ensemble cast that brings the broadcast television corner of the MCU to life, then look no further. The point is, with the new season of S.H.I.E.L.D., it's everything one could ask from the show." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow stated that the premiere was [...] "riddled with [...] visual signifiers, highlighting the ways Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gradually become sharper, sleeker, and more reliant on the bones of its comic-book source material." ...|$|E
500|$|... 2. [...] "The chief {{variable}} to choosing between a kestrel and a merlin {{may be your}} hawking land. If you live in open country, or have access at least to good pasture for cattle, a merlin can excel <b>there.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> plan to hunt mostly in town or suburb, and especially {{if you plan to}} hawk from a car, I’d recommend the kestrel. [...] The consideration coming in at close second is your intended quarry. To snipe, dove, quail and open-country sparrows, merlins are best suited. For most blackbirds (Icteridea), either falcon can prove effective. Starlings in close are extremely vulnerable to kestrels; but in the open are best prey for merlins. [...] The same holds true for house sparrows, with this exception: sparrows in thick cover are better quarry for kestrels. This is the slip for which I feel the American kestrel is perfect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{physicists}} {{and philosophers}} have {{objected to the}} Copenhagen interpretation, both {{on the grounds that}} it is non-deterministic and that it includes an undefined measurement process that converts probability functions into non-probabilistic measurements. Einstein's comments [...] "I, at any rate, am convinced that He (God) does not throw dice." [...] and [...] "Do you really think the moon isn't <b>there</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> aren't looking at it?" [...] exemplify this. Bohr, in response, said, [...] "Einstein, don't tell God what to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Overall, {{the series}} {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail {{said that the}} show is neither the new M*A*S*H for its lack of [...] "snarky chat about the stupidity of war and governments that encourage war" [...] nor is it Grey's Anatomy-on-the-front-lines as there are no [...] "lurid romantic entanglements". Doyle goes on to say, [...] "It's the horrors {{of war and the}} awfulness of a combat hospital seen emphatically through the prism of TV drama." [...] In concluding his review Doyle said, [...] "In the matter of Afghanistan and military life <b>there,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want a gruelling experience, watch the news. Combat Hospital is the entertaining version." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} host, Santorum said, [...] "I’m not {{defending}} Newsmax’s decision to put Donald Trump in <b>there.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{look at the}} [...] debate where Jim Cramer is screaming at people– maybe Donald will surprise us both." [...] Gingrich said, [...] "I can’t imagine {{what it will be}} like, which is part of why–– This is very serious business, picking the president of the United States. We all have to be very serious but, {{every once in a while}} on the campaign trail, to have something that just breaks out, is good. I believe that having Donald Trump in that kind of environment will absolutely be amazing." [...] On December 13, Trump withdrew as moderator and the debate was canceled.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the songwriting process, Rabin recalled the group used Abbey Road (1969) by The Beatles as a model and influence for the music on Big Generator. He explained: [...] "If we come up with an idea, why pressure ourselves into making it a song? Just have it <b>there.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can't come up with a chorus, don't throw it out because it's not a complete song and don't put a bad chorus around it". Such an approach led to the album having tracks longer than common pop songs of the time, peaking at seven minutes in length. Rabin described Kaye's role as a greater one than he had on 90125, but continual clashes between Kaye and Horn resulted in his keyboard parts recorded in another studio away from Horn.|$|E
