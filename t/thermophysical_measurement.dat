40|$|The {{objective}} is to develop an accurate dynamic technique which, in a microgravity environment, would enable performance of <b>thermophysical</b> <b>measurements</b> on high-melting-point electrically conducting substances in their liquid state. In spite of the critical need in high temperature technologies related to spacecraft, nuclear reactors, effects of power laser radiation, and in validating theoretical models in related areas, no accurate data on thermophysical properties exist.

The limitation of the millisecond-resolution techniques to temperatures below the melting point {{stems from the fact}} that the specimen collapses due to the gravitational force once it starts to melt.

The Department of Energy (DOE), under Cooperative Agreement, Number DEFC 28 - 98 NV 12081, has funded a research project at the University of Nevada, Reno since November, 1999 titled: 2 Ì 2 Continuing site characterization and performance verification applications with the REKA method at Yucca Mountain, Task 13. 2 Ì 2 This project is also referred to as 2 Ì 2 Drift Scale Tests, 2 Ì 2 the previous title of a research project that was funded by a different contract from the DOE from 1997 to 1999 under M 2 Ì 6 O task WBS 1. 2. 3. 14 (123 E 2265 M 1). The thermophysical properties include thermal conductivity and diffusivity, each pair determined simultaneously from an in situ temperature field measurement around a single-borehole thermal probe, using inverse modeling. The application of the method and apparatus have practiced U. S. patent 4, 933, 887, assigned to Sierra Science of Reno, NV. The method is called Rapid Evaluation of K and Alpha (REKA), referring to the determination of thermal conductivity and diffusivity from a single measurement. The application of the REKA method during the project period resulted in the submission of over 330 in situ, effective conductivity and diffusivity pairs during the reported period. The scope of work for Task 13, approved in 1999, included the design and fabrication of three new thermal probes for the use in the Enhanced Characterization of the Repository Block (ECRB) activity, as well as in subsequent performance verification. The promise of long-term application and measurement continuation at Yucca Mountain served as the basis for waiving the license fee for U. S. Patent 4, 933, 887 for the project.
