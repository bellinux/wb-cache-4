25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I,</b> Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E
500|$|When you win a race {{like this}} {{the feeling is}} very, very good. There {{have been times when}} I have been {{flat-out}} to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In [...] I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact {{the only thing you can}} judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E

500|$|Clarke {{spent the}} next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks {{full-time}} for Simon & Schuster in Cambridge. She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule.

2500|$|In March, Ponor competed at the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup {{event in}} Doha, Qatar. She placed first on balance beam {{with a score}} of 15.300 and first on floor with a score of 15.275. Ponor said, [...] "I {{want to do the}} same thing that I did in 2004. It was hard to make a comeback, but all the time I was <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do it.

2500|$|Chesney later {{suggested}} {{the failure of}} his marriage was due to [...] "panic" [...] from the intense media scrutiny surrounding it. In an interview by 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper, Chesney commented on the failed marriage. [...] "The only fraud that was committed was me <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{knew what it was}} like…that I really understood {{what it was like to}} be married, and I really didn't." [...] The annulment was finalized in late December 2005. Chesney's family still resides in east Tennessee.|$|E

2500|$|...The Lady made a {{sign for}} me to approach; but I was seized with fear, and I did not dare, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was faced with an illusion. I rubbed my eyes, but in vain. I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then I put my hand into my pocket, and took my rosary. I {{wanted to make the}} sign of the cross, but in vain; I could not raise my hand to my forehead, it kept on dropping" ...

2500|$|Bobo chic was {{associated}} {{in particular with}} punks in the SoHo area of Lower Manhattan, {{to the south of}} Greenwich Village. It was described by a student fashion writer as [...] "paying to look poor" [...] and having been [...] "made popular by silver screen stars who all look like they got dressed in the dark like the Olsen twins, Kirsten Dunst and Chloë Sevigny". In 2008 English actress Sophie Winkleman, who had attended Cambridge University in the 1990s, remarked wryly that she had [...] "wor floaty dresses at university ... <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> looked poetic and wistful. I actually looked homeless". Another British commentator referred to Mary-Kate Olsen's [...] "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to dressing", but noted that, by 2006, the Olsens' merchandising empire was recording annual sales of £500 million.|$|E
2500|$|Over a marching rhythm, she sings: [...] "If {{travel is}} searching/And home has been found/I'm not stopping/I'm going hunting." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted self-mockery towards [...] "her own idyllic disposition" [...] in the lyrics [...] "I thought I could {{organize}} freedom/How Scandinavian of me!" [...] That line {{was covered in}} various reviews; it {{has been described as}} [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "derisively" [...] delivered. When asked about the meaning of those lines, Björk replied: [...] "in Iceland, the people from Sweden, we think they're really not cool at all and they just have got no sense of humour, are really organized. And you can't organize everything. So I think in that song, I was sort of... <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could even organize freedom, just like very stupid. Quite Swedish, you know." [...] Some critics have also identified the lyrics as a hint to a failed relationship.|$|E

2500|$|The {{president}} wanted {{what he felt}} was an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives, noting privately that Warren [...] "represents the kind of political, economic, and social <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believe we need on the Supreme Court.... He has a national name for integrity, uprightness, and courage that, again, I believe we need on the Court". In the next few years, Warren led the Court {{in a series of}} liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the Court. Some writers believe that Eisenhower once remarked that his appointment was [...] "the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made". However, Eisenhower biographer Jean Edward Smith concluded in 2012 that [...] "Eisenhower never said that. I have no evidence that he ever made such a statement." [...] Eisenhower gave Warren a recess appointment that began on October 1, 1953. It was made permanent when the Senate acted on March 1, 1954. No serious opposition had appeared and he was confirmed by unanimous voice vote.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 June Pitt heard Fitzwilliam's {{objection}} {{from the}} Duke of Portland. Pitt assured [...] "that the re-establishment of the Crown of France in such {{person of the}} family of Bourbon as shall be naturally entitled to it was the first and determined aim of the present Ministry". Pitt wished to discuss this with Fitzwilliam in person. On 23 June Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland that he believed the government had moved to the Whig position and that [...] "for my own part I am now ready, not only to adopt the opinion that a junction should take place, as your sentiment, but to advise it as the genuine offspring of my own judgement... as much weight and sway should be given to us as possible. ... In my humble opinion, this junction will not produce half its effect if it is not opened to the world by such marks of real substantial favour and confidence {{on the part of the}} Crown towards us as will mark beyond dispute the return of weight, power and consideration to the Old Whigs...after thirty years' exclusion from patronage in the line of peerage" [...] new Whig peers should be created. He also rejected office except of [...] "going to Ireland, but...it is impossible". However the Duke of Portland and Lord Mansfield implored Fitzwilliam to accept office and when Lord Mansfield saw Fitzwilliam when he came down to London on 28 June he got Fitzwilliam [...] "to admit that if ever he was to take office this was the time". The next day Fitzwilliam met the Duke of Portland and reported that: [...] "I see little prospect of escaping office...the duke...seems so intent upon my accepting, as almost to say that he will not, if I do not—I left him last night my reasons for <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should be more serviceable out of office, than in...if I find I have not persuaded him, I must submit". When Pitt met the Duke of Portland on 1 July he offered the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland to Fitzwilliam as soon as Lord Westmoreland could be compensated for the loss of it. Therefore, on 3 July Fitzwilliam agreed to join the coalition government as Lord President of the Council for the time being, writing that day to Lady Rockingham: [...] "It is a time when private affection must give way to public exigency".|$|E
