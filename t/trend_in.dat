5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> this group is unlike the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a well-known brand of footwear owned by Deckers. The boots {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian footwear worn for warmth and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the late 2000s.|$|E

40|$|Censorship is {{no longer}} limited to printed media and videos.

Some countries are marked by severe restrictions and enforcement, a variety of initiatives in enforcing censorship (pervasive as well as implied), and initiatives to counter censorship. This article reflects on <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> Internet censorship in selected countries, namely Australia, Chile, China, Finland, Libya, Myanmar, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Kingdom (UK). Negative and positive trends are noted.

40|$|Past decade, {{countries}} have been striving towards more quality and equity in their educational system. This study aims at investigating to what extent countries succeeded in both aims, by investigating <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> educational quality and equity amongst 17 countries. To get a full grasp on these trends, we look both at <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> average achievement {{as well as at}} <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> achievement level of the 10 % best and 10 % lowest performing students. Furthermore, we investigate whether there is congruency between <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> quality and <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> equity. Hierarchical multilevel modeling is conducted with data of 17 countries which participated in TIMSS 2003 and 2011, Grade 4. Results indicate an overall increase in achievement, an overall decrease in social equity and an overall increase in ethnic equity. However, differences between countries are noticed, with for some countries <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> the other direction. Finally, no systematic relationship is found between <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> quality and <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> equity. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.)
