25|$|Antihypertensives are a {{class of}} drugs {{that are used to}} <b>treat</b> <b>hypertension</b> (high blood pressure). Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the {{complications}} of high blood pressure, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Evidence suggests that reduction of the blood pressure by 5mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischaemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|The dry root of Veratrum nigrum {{can lower}} blood {{pressure}} and slow heart rate, possibly by stimulating the vagus nerve, if taken in small doses internally.

Cyclopamine (11-deoxojervine) is one of the alkaloids isolated from the plant which interferes with the hedgehog signaling pathway (Hh). Cyclopamine is under investigation as a possible treatment for several cancers (such as basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma) and skin disorders (such as psoriasis), which result from excessive Hh activity.|$|E

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were applied to assess white matter abnormalities in <b>treated</b> vs untreated <b>hypertension</b> and if these correlated with neuropsychological performance. METHODS: Subjects were 40 patients with medically <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> (mean age 69. 3 years), 10 patients with untreated hypertension (mean age 57. 6 years) and 30 normotensive controls (mean age 68. 2 years). Hypertension was defined as a previous diagnosis and taking hypertensive medication, or a resting blood pressure of > 140 / 90 mmHg on the day of assessment. RESULTS: Patients with <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> performed worse on immediate (P = 0. 037) as well as delayed memory tasks (P = 0. 024) compared with normotensive controls. Cognitive performance was worse in untreated compared with <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> on executive functions (P = 0. 041) and psychomotor speed (P = 0. 003). There was no significant correlation between cognition and any of the imaging parameters in <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension.</b> However, in untreated hypertension the results revealed a positive correlation between an executive functioning and attention composite score and DTI mean diffusivity values (P = 0. 016) and between psychomotor speed and spectroscopy NAA/tCr levels (P = 0. 015). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest there is cognitive impairment in <b>hypertension.</b> <b>Treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> was associated with deficits in memory while untreated hypertension revealed a more 'subcortical' pattern of cognitive impairment...|$|R
25|$|Medical {{trials have}} {{demonstrated}} that vitamin D supplements do not prevent or <b>treat</b> <b>hypertension</b> or cardiovascular disease, although they can help in skeletal metabolism. Epidemiological and observational studies show indications that exposure to ultraviolet radiation, particularly sunlight, might reduce all-cause mortality and can help reduce cardiovascular disease and hypertension. One hundred years of scientific data has demonstrated {{that the effect of}} ultraviolet radiation on human skin is carcinogenic. There is a lack of evidence that this carcinogenic effect, like risks such as smoking or alcohol, is responsible for higher mortality. There are significant archives of studies demonstrating that ultraviolet radiation from sunlight provides measurable health benefits, independent of vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} {{treatment}} is change of lifestyle (e.g., Dietary Guidelines for Americans and physical activity). However, if in {{three to six months}} of efforts at remedying risk factors prove insufficient, then drug treatment is frequently required. Generally, the individual disorders that compose the metabolic syndrome are treated separately. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors may be used to <b>treat</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Cholesterol drugs may be used to lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, if they are elevated, and to raise HDL levels if they are low. Use of drugs that decrease insulin resistance, e.g., metformin and thiazolidinediones, is controversial; this treatment is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Weight loss medications may result in weight loss. As obesity is often recognized as the culprit behind many of the additional symptoms, with weight loss and lifestyle changes in diet, physical activity, the need for other medications may diminish.|$|E

40|$|Background: Chinese herbal {{products}} (CHPs) {{have been}} frequently used among {{patients with chronic}} diseases including hypertension; however, the co-prescription pattern of herbal formulae and single herbs remain uncharacterized. Thus, this large-scale pharmacoepidemiological study evaluated the frequency and co-prescription pattern of CHPs for <b>treating</b> <b>hypertension</b> in Taiwan from 2003 to 2009. Methods: The database of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) outpatient claims {{was obtained from the}} National Health Insurance in Taiwan. Patients with hypertension during study period were defined according to diagnostic codes in the International Classification of Disease Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The frequencies and percentages of herbal formula and single herb prescriptions for hypertension were analyzed. We also applied association rules to evaluate the CHPs co-prescription patterns. Results: The hypertension cohort included 154, 083 patients, 123, 240 patients of which (approximately 80 %) had used TCM at least once. In total, 81, 582 visits involving CHP prescriptions were hypertension related; Tian-Ma-Gou-Teng-Yin and Dan Shen (Radix Salvia Miltiorrhizae) were the most frequently prescribed herbal formula and single herb, respectively, for <b>treating</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Conclusions: This study elucidated the utilization pattern of CHPs for <b>treating</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Future studies on the efficacy and safety of these CHPs and on drug–herb interactions are warranted...|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty nine {{patients}} admitted to hospital for stroke over 30 months were examined to see whether <b>treating</b> <b>hypertension</b> had influenced the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage and infarction.

40|$|Background: Observational studies {{examining}} associations between hypertension and cancer are inconsistent. We explored {{the association of}} hypertension, graded hypertension and antihypertensive treatment with cancer incidence and mortality. Method: Eighty-six thousand five hundred and ninety-three participants from the Australian and New Zealand Diabetes and Cancer Collaboration were linked to the National Death Index and Australian Cancer Database. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for the association of <b>treated</b> and untreated <b>hypertension</b> with cancer incidence and mortality. Results: Over a median follow-up of 15. 1 years, 12   070 incident and 4350 fatal cancers were identified. Untreated and <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension,</b> compared with normotension, were {{associated with an increased}} risk for cancer incidence [hazard ratio 1. 06, 95 % CI (1. 00 - 1. 11) and 1. 09 (1. 02 - 1. 16) respectively], and cancer mortality (1. 07, 0. 98 - 1. 18) and (1. 15, 1. 03 - 1. 28), respectively. When compared with untreated <b>hypertension,</b> <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> did not have a significantly greater risk for cancer incidence (1. 03, 0. 97 - 1. 10) or mortality (1. 07, 0. 97 - 1. 19). A significant dose-response relationship was observed between graded hypertension and cancer incidence and mortality; Ptrend =  0. 053 and Ptrend =  0. 001, respectively. When stratified by treatment status, these relationships remained significant in untreated, but not in <b>treated,</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Conclusion: <b>Hypertension,</b> both <b>treated</b> and untreated, is associated with a modest increased risk for cancer incidence and mortality. Similar risks in <b>treated</b> and untreated <b>hypertension</b> suggest that the increased cancer risk is not explained by the use of antihypertensive treatment. Jessica L.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the relationship between achieved blood pressure and risk of myocardial infarction among patients <b>treated</b> for <b>hypertension.</b> METHODS: Blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors were assessed among 718 myocardial infarction case patients and 2136 matched controls.

Patients with <b>treated</b> <b>hypertension</b> who had mild elevations in blood pressure accounted for a larger share of the excess myocardial infarction incidence than those who had higher blood pressure readings. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving normotensive levels in treated hypertensive patients with uncontrolled blood pressure might prevent more than 15 % of myocardial infarctions in the treated hypertensive population...|$|R
