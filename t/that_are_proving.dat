In 2002, Harper {{wrote a letter to}} members of the former Canadian Alliance party, mentioning that the Accord is a [...] "socialist conspiracy" [...] and questioned sciences <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>proving</b> global warming and in a meeting with other Commonwealth countries in Uganda commented that Kyoto was a mistake that should not be repeated. He also stated that the Accord [...] "focuses on carbon dioxide, which is essential to life, rather than upon pollutants." [...] Harper considered the objectives implemented by Canada to meet its goals were not realistic and later criticized further the accord which did not set any targets for the world's biggest polluters. He proposed a [...] "Made in Canada" [...] plan that would concentrate its efforts on reducing smog pollution from vehicles. [...] In a CTV report in October, however, the Conservatives had mentioned that it would be an approach rather than a plan. While repeatedly mentioning that the goals will not be achieved before the timeline, John Baird mentioned on March 17, 2007 that the government had no plans to abandon the Kyoto Accord. The Conservatives' position has been backed by five independent economists, including Toronto-Dominion Bank chief economist Don Drummond. Drummond, who has been consulted by political parties of all stripes, said that the [...] "economic cost [...] would be at least as deep as the recession in the early 1980s", agreeing with the results of a study compiled by the environment department.|$|E

In reviews of the PRGF, the World Bank noted that Guinea had met its spending goals in targeted social priority sectors.

Recent advances in neuroscientific research have begun to provide additional insights into the neural mechanisms of cooperation that can help to better understand the psychological processes that underlie cooperative behavior. In turn, these models of cooperative decision-making can play a valuable role in informing and developing policy interventions aimed at improving societal level cooperation. Here, we outline several lines of current research <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>proving</b> useful in understanding the nature of cooperative decision-making, and outline how these research themes can provide promising insights for the development of more effective policy campaigns...|$|E

40|$|Multiple myeloma, {{a cancer}} of the antibody-generating plasma cells, {{is the second most}} common {{hematological}} malignancy. In this disease, myeloma cells proliferate in the bone marrow, leading to decreased blood cell formation and bone resorption locally and causing systemic disease (especially renal failure) through their production of large amounts of abnormal immuno-globins. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is now part of the preferred treatment for multiple myeloma (Raab et al., 2009; Goldberg, 2011), and> 400, 000 patients worldwide have now received the drug, which has over two billion dollars in annual sales.
