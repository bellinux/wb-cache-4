40|$|Cancer {{represents}} the largest cause of mortality {{in the world}} as the millions of humans and animals die every year. Chemotherapy being a major treatment modality used for the control of advanced stages of malignancies and as a prophylactic against possible metastasis, exhibits severe toxicity on normal tissues. Medicinal plants, including vegetables are known to have good immunomodulatory antioxidant activities, leading to anticancer effect. They act by stimulating both non-specific and specific immunity, and may promote the host resistance against infection by re-stabilizing body equilibrium and conditioning the body tissues. However, the interest in the potential benefits of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> has been greatly emerged. The cardiovascular diseases and cancer incidence rates have been found low due to <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oils.</b> Who eat a diet high in fish fat and low in carbohydrates (instead of the consumption of a high fat diet from animal and vegetable oils) have low incidence of cancer. The animal fats contain saturated fatty acids, and vegetable oils (e. g., corn oil and safflower oil) contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of omega- 6 type. Beneficial effects of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> come from their unique composition of high levels of the omega- 3 PUFAs, viz., eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

After 11 weeks, the group receiving a fish oil diet had increased levels of A. muciniphila and bacterium of genus Lactobacillus, while the group receiving a lard diet had decreased levels of A. muciniphila and Lactobacillus. Additional testing was performed by conducting fecal transplants from mice on <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> diet or the lard based diet into {{a new group of}} mice which had their native gut flora eradicated with antibiotics.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether very long–chain n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) affect illness and selected plasma cytokines in schoolchildren. Study design Thai schoolchildren aged 9 to 12 years consumed milk containing placebo (soybean) oil (n = 86) or fish oil (n = 94) on 5 {{days per week}} for 6 months; the latter provided 200 mg eicosapentaenoic acid plus 1 g docosahexaenoic acid daily. Episodes and duration of illness were recorded, and plasma interleukin (IL) - 2 receptor, IL- 6, IL- 10, and transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta 1 concentrations and the fatty acid profile of plasma phosphatidylcholine determined.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{excretion}} {{of dietary}} cholesterol in the hypocholesterolaemic effect of chronic fish oil feeding in rats was investigated. The hepatic uptake and processing of [H- 3]cholesterol carried in chylomicrons derived from fish oil was studied in vivo in rats fed a low fat diet or a diet supplemented with fish oil for 21 days. In addition, the effects of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> diet on cholesterol esterification, cholesteryl ester hydrolysis, bile acid synthesis and biliary lipid secretion were determined. In rats fed <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> {{as compared to the}} low fat diet, the uptake of [H- 3]cholesterol from the blood and its secretion into bile as bile acids was significantly slower, and this was entirely due to a decrease in the bile acid fraction. Biliary bile acid mass secretion was unchanged by fish oil feeding, while biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion was increased. No significant differences were observed either in the expression of mRNA for cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase or the secretion of bile acids into bile after 20 h biliary drainage between <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> and low fat diet groups, suggesting that bile acid synthesis is not affected. These results indicate that the access of chylomicron cholesterol to the hepatic substrate pool for bile acid formation is decreased in <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> fed rats, and this, together with its slower uptake from the blood, accounts for the retardation of its excretion via the bile. Thus, the hypocholesterolemic effect of dietary fish oil in rats is not due to more rapid metabolism of cholesterol originating from the diet. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Mice fed <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> diet had fewer peritoneal neutrophils, shorter resolution interval and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines than mice fed the control diet.
