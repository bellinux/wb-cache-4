Species of birds observed in the gardens have included song thrush, jay, wren, robin, kingfisher and tawny owl. Mammals regularly observed include hedgehogs, grey squirrels and foxes. Butterflies including the holly blue and painted lady have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{earliest}} account, the first Elves are awakened by Eru Ilúvatar near {{the bay of}} Cuiviénen during the Years of the <b>Trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First Age.

5000|$|The {{tree was}} named and {{discovered}} by Wendell Flint and Mike Law in 1985 while searching for [...] "big trees" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. They measured a massive, previously undocumented, tree that they observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mountain Home giant sequoia grove, {{and determined that}} it is slightly smaller than <b>the</b> Boole <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Converse Basin grove in Sequoia National Forest, but with a more slender base and larger trunk. The Genesis tree is also slightly larger than what was then <b>the</b> seventh largest <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world - <b>the</b> Franklin <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Giant Forest grove of Sequoia National Park - thereby making the Genesis the seventh largest tree overall, and <b>the</b> largest <b>tree</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mountain Home grove.|$|R
5|$|American {{communities}} {{pledged to}} fund the planting of <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest in addition to funds for the memorial. For example, in July 1965, the community of Los Angeles, California pledged to have 100,000 trees planted {{as a result of}} a banquet sponsored by JNF attended by more than 1000 government, union, and management leaders.|$|E
5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands of artificial <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-War years. Americans took {{little interest in the}} Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E

5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} on dead leaves {{of a wide}} variety of angiosperms. It is frequently encountered on members of the heather (family Ericaceae), and the beech family (Fagaceae), such as oak (red, white, and live oak) and chestnut, and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile. Other common substrates include leaves of <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genera Rhododendron, Lithocarpus, Berberis, Arbutus, Gaultheria, and Myrica.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, {{only one}} in five American {{families}} had a Christmas tree. While America never lacked for real trees, the time and expense of retrieving them from the wild was significant. Early in the twentieth century, however, Christmas tree farms began supplying large metropolitan areas with real <b>trees.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the germination issue.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum-140 has a short {{half-life}} of some 41 hours, {{and is not}} {{a threat}} after a fairly short time. Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, have a long enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area to not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials. The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding areas. The neighbouring population was not informed about the tests until the mid-1990s, and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation.|$|E

5|$|Near its {{landfall}} location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300houses in the village, while over 70,000homes in Havana {{were either}} damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism {{industry in the}} country. Agricultural damage was heavy, with the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons of citrus <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230km²) of fruit <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, bean, and banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1989, OTA {{approved}} {{a contract to}} transplant approximately 290 live <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path of the turnpike to locations {{along the edge of}} the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|The city's {{fiscal crisis}} in the 1970s caused {{the rest of the}} park to fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds {{exacerbated}} the pollution of the park. Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old-growth forest had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests.|$|E
