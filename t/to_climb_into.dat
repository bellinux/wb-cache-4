5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen-year-old Andy {{is about}} to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy {{intended}} to throw them away, decide <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.|$|E
5|$|The first-ever Queen of the Cage {{match for}} number one contendership to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship was next. The {{participants}} in the encounter were Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Jackie Moore, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Salinas, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. In this match, the participants fought {{on the outside of}} the ring <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the cage. The first two to do so had a standard wrestling match, with the winner determined by pinfall or submission. It lasted 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Laveaux and Love were the first to enter the cage, with Laveaux gaining the pinfall after her signature Voodoo Drop maneuver to become the first-ever Queen of the Cage and become number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship.|$|E

5|$|Every year of its 17-year run on CBS, Lassie placed {{first in}} its time slot, Sunday 7:00 P.M. EST, and often {{ranked among the}} top 25 shows on television. The show's highest ranking years in the Nielsen ratings were the Martin years when the show placed #24 in 1957, #22 in 1958, #15 in 1959, #15 in 1961, #21 in 1962, #13 in 1963, and #17 in 1964. The only Martin year Lassie did not climb into the top twenty-five was 1960, when it ran {{opposite}} Walt Disney Presents on ABC and Shirley Temple Theater on NBC. However, Lassie still ran opposite Disney when the Disney anthology television series moved to NBC in 1961, and still managed <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the Top 25. With {{the advent of the}} Forest Service seasons, the show began a steady decline in ratings.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. Collapsible Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E

25|$|Stella sank {{in eight}} minutes. Four {{lifeboats}} were successfully launched, while a fifth capsized. The {{women and children}} first protocol was observed, although one stewardess, Mary Ann Rogers, gave up her lifejacket and refused a place in a lifeboat. The capsized lifeboat was later righted by a freak wave and 12 people managed <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> it. Four of these died of exposure during the night. The eight remaining survivors were rescued by the French Naval tug Marsouin.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them {{to get out of the}} boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point he stopped and sat down.|$|E

25|$|On {{a trip to}} New York City, Rogers was at Madison Square Garden when a wild steer {{broke out}} of the arena and began <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the viewing stands. Rogers roped the steer {{to the delight of}} the crowd. The feat got front page {{attention}} from the newspapers, giving him valuable publicity and an audience eager to see more. Willie Hammerstein saw his vaudeville act, and signed Rogers to appear on the Victoria Roof—which was literally on a rooftop—with his pony. For the next decade, Rogers estimated he worked for fifty weeks a year at the Roof and at the city's myriad vaudeville theaters.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} fictional Star Wars settings, several {{real-world}} filming locations {{have been used}} to create the Yavin Moon location. For the original 1977 film, Guatemala was chosen for second unit filming to create establishing shots for the Yavin base, and in March 1977, a crew led by Richard Edlund travelled to Guatemala. The exterior panoramic shots featuring the scenery of Yavin 4 were filmed overlooking the ancient Mayan pyramid complex of Tikal amid a dense rainforest. The Rebel outlook post was built from trash cans glued together and mounted on a pole; the special effects artist Lorne Peterson was persuaded <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the precarious structure to pose in Rebel uniform for the shot.|$|E
25|$|It begins <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> {{the hills}} east of this exit, passing through some rock {{cuts in the}} four miles (6km) to the Lime Kiln Road exit, which allows easy access to a nearby former IBM {{facility}} now known as Hudson Valley Research Park. From there it descends gently over two miles (3km), with Hosner Mountain looming to the east, to the sprawling interchange with the Taconic State Parkway. It ascends again afterwards, passing scenic overlooks on either side that allow views of the valley and the Catskills to the northwest. At the crest, near where the Appalachian Trail crosses over, signs indicate the road has once again reached 1,000 feet (305 m) in elevation.|$|E

25|$|Franklin {{played his}} 250th game in round 3, kicking three behinds in a one-point loss to Collingwood at the SCG. Two weeks later, Franklin kicked his 800th career goal {{with the last}} of his three goals in the Swans' 42-point loss to Greater Western Sydney; this was Sydney's fifth of six-straight losses to start the season, which was their worst start to a season since 1993. The Swans' losing streak came to an end when Franklin kicked eight goals in a 54-point win against the Brisbane Lions in round 7. In round 10, for Indigenous Round, Franklin was among a number of players who wore the number 67 on their guernseys to commemorate the 1967 Australian {{referendum}} which recognised Indigenous Australians in the census. Franklin went on to kick five goals in the six-point loss to Hawthorn, overtaking Bernie Quinlan <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the top ten highest goalkickers in VFL/AFL history.|$|E
25|$|When a {{commission}} government brought 90 industrial plants {{to the city}} in 1913, industry in the city began attracting many settlers from the surrounding areas, causing the city's population to continue <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the 1920s. After World War I, the city erected a monument {{on the corner of}} 6th Street and 23rd Avenue depicting a doughboy in uniform to honor fallen soldiers from the city and surrounding area. During the industry boom of the 1920s, Meridian's automobile industry began to grow. Livery stables that were built around the city later evolved into service stations for vehicles. The former streetcar system was replaced by a system of buses with the creation of the Mississippi Power Company in 1925. Buses were seen as a superior mode of transportation at the time, especially since the buses could pass freely over the railroads which divided the city's southernmost neighborhoods from the downtown area {{and the rest of the}} city.|$|E
25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause a catch-22, since for years he needed alcohol to even speak to a woman, but the alcohol led to him say the wrong things. On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that he never had a crush on her as well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert him to this fact).|$|E
50|$|With a {{complete}} rebuild of club structure for 2016 and having Ray Pooley {{appointed to the}} leading coaching position the club has aimed <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> back <b>into</b> Northern Region Football League Division 1.

25|$|UMass' 2013–14 {{season was}} one of the most {{significant}} in program history. The team was coming off of a pair of ACHA semifinal appearances (one a surprise run at nationals, the other beginning with a low early-season ranking), but then followed up with a year-long stretch of dominance. After beginning fifth in the rankings, the Minutemen put together a 20–6–1 regular season <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the second seed for ACHAs, just three voting points ahead of Rhode Island in third. The URI side likely felt that they deserved better thanks to their 2–0 shutout of UMass to recapture the ECWHL playoff title, although the Minutemen would be able to point to their sweep of Rhody by identical 4–1 scores just two weeks prior to that in reply. Away from the ACHA (and the Western Hempishere, for that matter), Abromson, Corell, Harrington, Labossiere and Oteri were selected for the 2013 U.S. National University Team that competed at the 2013 World University Games, eventually winning bronze medals in Trentino, Italy in December 2013.|$|E
25|$|As the {{defending}} national champions, Texas began the season ranked #2 in the optimistic pre-season polls, having replaced the NFL-departed quarterback Vince Young with freshman Colt McCoy. The Longhorns however lost convincingly to #1 ranked Ohio State {{in the second}} game of the season in Austin. The Horns quickly rebounded to win seven straight games (including a second straight win over nemesis Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout) <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>into</b> the Big 12 South driver's seat and entertain thoughts of a rematch with Ohio State in the national championship, but in the season's 10th game McCoy was injured and Texas was shocked on the road at Kansas State. After the loss, the Horns returned home still needing a final win to clinch the Big 12 South, and even though McCoy returned for the annual matchup Texas was again shocked, losing, 12–7, to intrastate rival Texas A The loss snapped UT's six-game winning streak over the Aggies and the horns settled for the Alamo Bowl where Texas defeated a 6–6 Iowa team in a close game to cap off a 10 win season.|$|E
