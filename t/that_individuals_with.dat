5|$|A 2009 {{study found}} <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> {{a history of}} concussions might {{demonstrate}} a decline in both physical and mental performance for longer than 30 years. Compared to their peers with no history of brain trauma, sufferers of concussion exhibited effects including loss of episodic memory and reduced muscle speed.|$|E
5|$|Psychological {{studies found}} <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> little {{mathematics}} education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position {{a number on}} an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E

5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> {{different}} ABH phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotype-specific manner. GII.4 includes global epidemic strains and binds to more Histo-blood group antigens than other genogroups. A Japanese study in 2003 revealed that children with blood group type AB (19.2%, 5/26) had a lower risk of infection than those with blood group type A or O. The study demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> type AB blood were less susceptible to norovirus, and type O people were the most vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|It appears <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> FXS are {{interested}} in social interaction and display greater empathy than groups with other causes of intellectual disability, but display anxiety and withdrawal when placed in unfamiliar situations with unfamiliar people.

25|$|Flexibility. Poor mental flexibility, as {{demonstrated}} in individuals with autism, is characterized by perseverative, stereotyped behaviour, and deficits in both the regulation and modulation of motor acts. Some research has suggested <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> autism experience a sort of ‘stuck-in-set’ perseveration that is specific to the disorder, rather than a more global perseveration tendency. These deficits have been exhibited in cross-cultural samples and {{have been shown to}} persist over time.|$|E

25|$|People {{who have}} high reward {{dependent}} personalities but {{find themselves in}} situations where {{they are unable to}} find rewards and approval through family support or other types, will seek reward through other means e.g. substance abuse or over-eating. It is then suggested <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> such predispositions should adopt preventive strategies or avoid such situations, where they seek such rewards that could potentially have adverse consequences. Reward dependence drives behavior maintenance systems, and in addictive behaviors, maintenance of behaviors occurs despite adverse consequences.|$|E
25|$|According {{to recent}} research, MCI {{is seen as}} the {{transitional}} state between cognitive changes of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. Several studies have indicated <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> MCI are at an increased risk for developing AD, ranging from 1% to 25% per year; in one study 24% of MCI patients progressed to AD in 2 years and 20% more over 3 years, whereas another study indicated that the progression of MCI subjects was 55% in 4.5 years. Some patients with MCI, however, never progress to AD.|$|E

Tiziana Quarto et al. measured emotional intelligence (EI) (the ability to identify, regulate, and process emotions {{of themselves and}} of others) of sixty-three healthy subjects.

The subjects were shown various pictures of facial expressions and tasked with deciding to approach or avoid {{the person in the}} picture. The results of the social decision task yielded <b>that</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> high EI scores had left insular activation when processing fearful faces. Individuals with low EI scores had left insular activation when processing angry faces.|$|E
