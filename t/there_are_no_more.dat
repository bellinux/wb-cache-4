If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> shots remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player is in the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.|$|E
5|$|Recent DNA {{studies suggest}} that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than three or four {{subspecies}} of elk. All American forms seem to belong to one subspecies (Cervus canadensis canadensis). Even the Siberian elk (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) {{are more or less}} identical to the American forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies, too. However the Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is clearly distinct from the Siberian forms, but not distinguishable from the Alashan wapiti. The Chinese forms MacNeill's deer, Kansu red deer, and Tibetan red deer belong also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies. These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species, namely the Central Asian red deer (Cervus wallichi), which also includes the Kashmir stag.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{returning}} to his village, Don Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay at home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully recovered his sanity. Sancho tries to restore his faith, but Quixano (his proper name) only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry. After Alonso Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> adventures to relate and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.|$|E
25|$|In a {{complete}} binary tree, a node's breadth-index (i − (2d − 1)) {{can be used}} as traversal instructions from the root. Reading bitwise from left to right, starting at bit d − 1, where d is the node's distance from the root (d = ⌊log2(i+1)⌋) and the node in question is not the root itself (d > 0). When the breadth-index is masked at bit d − 1, the bit values 0 and 1 mean to step either left or right, respectively. The process continues by successively checking the next bit to the right until <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>more.</b> The rightmost bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node's parent to the node itself. There is a time-space trade-off between iterating {{a complete}} binary tree this way versus each node having pointer/s to its sibling/s.|$|E

25|$|In Syria, three rivers add {{their water}} to the Euphrates; the Sajur, the Balikh and the Khabur. These rivers rise {{in the foothills of}} the Taurus Mountains along the Syro–Turkish border and add {{comparatively}} little {{water to the}} Euphrates. The Sajur is the smallest of these tributaries; emerging from two streams near Gaziantep and draining the plain around Manbij before emptying into the reservoir of the Tishrin Dam. The Balikh receives most of its water from a karstic spring near 'Ayn al-'Arus and flows due south until it reaches the Euphrates at the city of Raqqa. In terms of length, drainage basin and discharge, the Khabur is the largest of these three. Its main karstic springs are located around Ra's al-'Ayn, from where the Khabur flows southeast past Al-Hasakah, where the river turns south and drains into the Euphrates near Busayrah. Once the Euphrates enters Iraq, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> natural tributaries to the Euphrates, although canals connecting the Euphrates basin with the Tigris basin exist.|$|E
25|$|Halfway {{across the}} sea the Roland strikes an unseen object which causes massive {{flooding}} and dooms the ship. The passengers panic as the ship sinks into the Atlantic. Von Kammacher finds Ingigered passed out in her cabin from shock and carries her to a lifeboat. He goes back and searches in vain her father but when he can't find him, von Kammacher returns to the lifeboat and holds Ingigereds hand as the lifeboat pulls away. They watch in horror as the Roland sinks into the ocean. The liner sinks so rapidly {{that many of the}} lifeboats are never launched and several passengers are swept into the sea and drowned. By morning, only von Kammachers lifeboat is still floating (the rest having been swamped by swimmers) and 8 still alive. They are spotted by a cargo liner and saved. Ingigerd is devastated when she is told that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> survivors and both her father and boyfriend have drowned.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal life}} {{in these areas}} is also {{relatively}} rich. The zone is particularly important to the brown bear, which likes to hibernate the winter away in dens along the mountainside. In spring, the brown bears descent to the plains, and only return to the mountain when the berries do. These terrains are also favored stomping grounds of the Eurasian lynx. Both species, brown bear and Eurasian lynx, are protected in Sweden. Besides the red fox, the other predators, which are the wolverine, the gray wolf and the Arctic fox, are much rarer {{and do not have}} a fixed location in the park. The park shelters an important population of moose that pass the summer on the mountain, but prefer to spend the winter in areas less snowy. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> wild reindeerin the park, which is part of those few Swedish mountains not included in the area of pasture of domestic reindeer. Muskox, which left the area almost 4000 years ago, were reintroduced in Norway and sometimes wander near the park. Among the smaller animals, one can cite the red squirrel, the European pine marten, and the mountain hare. Like other Swedish mountains, the Norway lemming is present in Fulufjället, but in a patchy fashion, extremely numerous some years and almost absent others. This phenomenon is still not entirely understood.|$|E

25|$|In the 1620s, {{encouraged}} by Pope Urban VIII who {{wanted him to}} fresco the Benediction Loggia of St. Peter's (never executed), Bernini began in earnest to develop and perfect his technique as a painter. He probably had learned the basics from his father who was a painter as well, in addition to some training in the studio of the Florentine painter, Cigoli. According to early biographers, Baldinucci and Domenico Bernini, Bernini completed at least 150 canvases, mostly in the decades of the 1620s and 30s, but currently <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 35-40 surviving paintings that can be confidently attributed to his hand (they are mostly close-up faces—including several wonderfully wrought self-portraits—set against a blank background, employing a loose, painterly brushstroke (similar to that of his Spanish contemporary Velasquez) and a very limited palette of mostly somber colors with deep chiaroscuro. The only one that is securely dated {{is that of the}} Apostles Andrew and Thomas in London's National Gallery. As for his drawings, about 300 still exist; but this is a minuscule percentage of the drawings he would have created in his lifetime; these include rapid sketches relating to major sculptural or architectural commissions, presentation drawings given as gifts to his patrons and aristocratic friends, and exquisite, fully finished portraits, such as those of Agostino Mascardi (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris) and Scipione Borghese and Sisinio Poli (both in New York's Morgan Library).|$|E
