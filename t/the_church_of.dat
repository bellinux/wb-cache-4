5|$|Of Salford's six Grade I listed buildings, {{three are}} churches. St Augustine's Church, in Pendlebury, {{was built in}} 1874 by George Frederick Bodley. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Mary the Virgin, in Eccles, was {{originally}} built in the 13th century but was expanded in the 15th. A church {{has been on the}} site since at least the Norman period. St Mark's Church, in Worsley, was built in 1846 by George Gilbert Scott. The six Grade II* listed churches are <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Andrew in Eccles, the Cathedral Church of St John, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Luke in Pendleton, Monton Unitarian Church in Monton, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Philip in Salford, and the United Reformed Church.|$|E
5|$|Sale is {{a diverse}} {{community}} with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations. The church buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th century {{in the wake of}} the population boom created by the arrival of the railway in 1849, although records show that <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Martin in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304. Before the English Reformation, the inhabitants of Sale were predominantly Catholic, but afterwards were members of <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> England. Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th century in the form of Irish immigrants. Two of the three Grade II* listed buildings in the town are churches. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Martin, which was probably originally an early 14th-century timber framed structure, was rebuilt in 1714 after the church had been destroyed in a storm. <b>The</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St John the Divine was built in 1868, to the design of Alfred Waterhouse. There are three Grade II listed churches in Sale: <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Anne; <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Mary Magdalene; and <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Paul.|$|E
5|$|Several {{churches in}} Altrincham are deemed architecturally {{important}} enough to be designated Grade II listed buildings. These are Christ Church, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Alban, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St George, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St John the Evangelist and Trinity United Reformed Church. Of the nine GradeII* listed buildings in Trafford, three are in Altrincham: <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Margaret, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St John the Divine and Hale Chapel in Hale Barns. As of the 2001 UK census, 78.8per cent of Altrincham's residents reported themselves as being Christian, 1.1per cent Jewish, 1.1per cent Muslim, 0.4per cent Hindu, 0.2per cent Buddhist and 0.1per cent Sikh. The census recorded 12.1per cent as having no religion, 0.2per cent with an alternative religion, while 6.1per cent did not state a religion. Altrincham is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury, and <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> England Diocese of Chester. The nearest synagogue, belonging to Hale and District Hebrew Congregation, is on Shay Lane in Hale Barns.|$|E
50|$|Worldwide <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God {{organizational}} splits {{resulted in}} the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Global <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God, <b>the</b> Living <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God (1993, 1998), <b>the</b> United <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God (1995), and <b>the</b> Restored <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God (1998). <b>The</b> United <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God (UCG) is the largest of these denominations.|$|R
50|$|The Restoration Movement {{has since}} divided into {{multiple}} separate groups. There are three main branches in <b>the</b> US: <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ, <b>the</b> Christian <b>churches</b> and <b>churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ, and <b>the</b> Christian <b>Church</b> (Disciples <b>of</b> Christ). Other U.S. based groups {{affiliated with the}} movement are <b>the</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ and <b>the</b> International Christian <b>Churches.</b> Non-U.S. groups include <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ in Australia, <b>the</b> Evangelical Christian <b>Church</b> in Canada, <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ in Europe. The Plymouth Brethren are a similar though historically unrelated group which originated in the United Kingdom. Some churches, such as <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ or <b>the</b> Plymouth Brethren reject formal ties with other <b>churches</b> within <b>the</b> movement.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Worldwide <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God {{arose from}} <b>the</b> Seventh Day <b>churches.</b> <b>The</b> {{personal}} ministry <b>of</b> Herbert W. Armstrong became <b>the</b> Radio <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God, which became <b>the</b> Worldwide <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God. It later splintered into many other churches and groups when <b>the</b> Worldwide <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God disassociated {{itself with the}} Restoration movements and made major attempts to join the Protestant branch of Christianity. The largest of these groups, <b>the</b> Living <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God and <b>the</b> United <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> God, continue {{in the tradition of}} Armstrongism.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> Christ, which was later named <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> the Latter Day Saints. It was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838 (stylized as <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom), which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844. This organization subsequently splintered into several different denominations, {{each of which}} {{claims to be the}} legitimate continuation of this original church, and most of which dispute the right of other denominations within the movement to claim this distinction.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{resignation}} of McKean, some efforts are being made at reconciliation between <b>the</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ and <b>the</b> mainstream <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ. In March 2004, Abilene Christian University held the [...] "Faithful Conversations" [...] dialog between members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ and International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ. Those involved were able to apologize and initiate an environment conducive to building bridges. A few leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ apologized {{for use of the}} word [...] "cult" [...] in reference to <b>the</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ. <b>The</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ leaders apologized for alienating <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ and implying they were not Christians. Despite improvements in relations, there are still fundamental differences within the fellowship. Early 2005 saw a second set of dialogs with greater promise for both sides helping one another. Harding University is contemplating a distance learning program geared toward those ministers who were trained in <b>the</b> International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ.

50|$|In <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ and <b>the</b> Restoration Movement, Warren was {{a strict}} restorationist: he {{believed}} that <b>the</b> noninstrumental <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ followed <b>the</b> strict New Testament pattern of Christian doctrine, worship, and practice. He held that any deviation from that pattern by a church would exclude it from {{being part of the}} Christian community. Warren consistently argued that members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noninstrumental <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ are “the only Christians.” This put Warren at odds with more liberal leaders in <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ such as Rubel Shelly, who argued that members of Christian bodies outside <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ could also be Christians. Warren also staunchly defended the traditional hermeneutic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ: that only direct commands from the Bible, apostolic examples, or necessary (deductive) inferences from direct commands and examples were authoritative for Christians. This hermeneutic was consistent with Warren’s strong epistemological rationalism.|$|R

5|$|Henry is {{best known}} for his six marriages and, in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, annulled. His {{disagreement}} with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> England.
