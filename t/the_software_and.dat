5|$|In 1991, Kaspersky {{was granted}} an early release from his {{military}} service {{and left the}} defense ministry {{to take a job}} at the Information Technology Center of a private company KAMI, in order to work on his antivirus product full-time. There, he and his colleagues improved <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>and</b> released it as a product called Antiviral Toolkit Pro in 1992. At first the software was purchased by about ten clients per month. It earned about $100 per month, mostly from companies in Ukraine and Russia. Kaspersky's then-future wife Natalya Kaspersky became his coworker at KAMI.|$|E
5|$|The 3.1 Sarge {{release was}} made in June 2005. This release updated 73% of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>and</b> {{included}} over 9,000 new packages. A new installer with a modular design, Debian-Installer, allowed installations with RAID, XFS and LVM support, improved hardware detection, made installations easier for novice users, and was translated into almost forty languages. An installation manual and release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively. The efforts of Skolelinux, Debian-Med and Debian-Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational, had a medical affiliation, and ones made for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>and</b> thus improves its reliability.|$|E

5|$|The {{company began}} as a {{development}} team that created software called Picture This Home in the mid-1990s for Autodesk in San Rafael, California. The program allowed people to virtually preview room decoration projects before any work began. Users could create virtual rooms, change walls and arrange furniture, and create photo-realistic renderings of completed designs. Picture This Home was awarded the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>and</b> its team of 40developers were sold to Broderbund, which was owned by The Learning Company, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc. Broderbund eventually spun Picture This Home off as a company called GoodHome.com in June 1999. The company received $30 million in venture capital from Hearst Interactive Media.|$|E

25|$|In this example, {{the general}} {{deliverables}} within an implementation of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently {{as time goes}} by, mainly because of dependencies between deliverables. For instance, the actual go for the delivery of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>and</b> the other related deliverables are dependent {{on the outcome of}} the deliverable “Proeftuin”. “Proeftuin” is an agreed period in which the software is extensively tested by the customer organization, provided and supported by the supplier.

25|$|In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, {{used the}} GNU's {{development}} tools {{to produce the}} free monolithic Linux kernel. The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name Linux {{to refer to the}} general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it GNU/Linux. This has been a longstanding naming controversy in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU {{in the name of the}} operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>and</b> the free software philosophy of the GNU project.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the film}} was {{supposed}} to be released in September 2005. Most of the animators were hired locally with only a few of them having movie-making experience. Six weeks into the animation process, only a few animated sequences were close to being completed while Linklater was off making Bad News Bears. Sabiston had divided the animators into five teams and split the work amongst them. However, there was poor communication between the teams, and the uniform animation style that Linklater wanted was not being implemented. After almost two months some animators were still learning <b>the</b> <b>software,</b> <b>and</b> Linklater became frustrated with the lack of progress.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>the</b> <b>software</b> {{development}} process, standard releases require significant development effort {{being spent on}} keeping old versions up to date due to propagating bug fixes back to the newest branch, versus focusing more on the newest development branch.

25|$|Several causes were identified: {{the late}} {{completion}} of the design made preparing training materials difficult, subcontractors did not always {{provide detailed information on}} the operation of their equipment, the combat system training was based on the completed version of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> <b>and</b> not the partial system installed in Collins, and the training assumed that none of the systems would break down. The last problem was part of an overall attitude that the first boat would be perfect off the production line and that no breakdowns would occur, and as a result, early equipment manuals tended to be light on content, and Collins would be sent to sea with few spare parts.|$|E
25|$|Unauthorized copying {{has been}} an ongoing {{phenomenon}} that started when high quality, commercially produced software was released for sale.

Entire networks of BBSes sprang up to traffic illegal software from one user to the next. Machines like the Amiga and the Commodore 64 had an international network, through which software not available on one continent would eventually make its way to every region via bulletin board systems.|$|E
