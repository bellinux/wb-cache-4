5|$|Georgian {{characters}} {{are found in}} two Unicode blocks. The first block (U+10A0–U+10FF) is simply called Georgian. Mkhedruli (modern Georgian) occupies the U+10D0–U+10FF range (shown in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the first table below) and Asomtavruli occupies the U+10A0–U+10CF range (shown in {{the top half of}} the same table).

5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E

5|$|Shankly {{began his}} {{managerial}} {{career at the}} club where his professional playing career had started. Carlisle in the 1948–49 season were struggling in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern-based players because of the town's geographic remoteness in the far north of England. Shankly's work ethic transformed the team who finished 15th in 1948–49 {{after he had been}} in charge for only the last few matches. They improved to ninth in 1949–50 and then to third in 1950–51, almost gaining promotion.|$|E
5|$|This was {{repeated}} the following season, {{and so in}} 1971 Andover took another step up and joined the Southern League. Now competing against teams from an even wider area spanning almost the entire width of the country (ranging from Bideford {{in the west to}} Bury Town in the east) and in some cases with a larger budget and fanbase, competition was always tough with the club generally finishing in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the table. The highest position the club reached at this level was the sixth place reached in 1987–88 and again in 1991–92.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{has participated}} in {{biathlon}} at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15km individual event was their best result. Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished in the bottom 10% {{in each of his}} two races. In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish. Rim's result remains the only top-20 finish by an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the field, including many in the bottom fifth.|$|E

50|$|After a {{successful}} period, poor results ensued, {{and during the}} late 2000s the club often finished in <b>the</b> middle or <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> table. The club was also in financial trouble and often couldn't pay the players their salaries.|$|R
5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season since {{the return of}} the Football League, Cardiff {{finished}} the 1946–47 season as champions of the Third Division South under new manager Billy McCandless and returned to the Second Division. McCandless left the club soon after and was replaced by Cyril Spiers who led the side to promotion in the 1951–52 season, returning to the top tier of English football {{for the first time in}} 23 years. However, despite spending five seasons in the First Division, the team continually struggled in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the table and were eventually relegated in 1957. They returned to the First Division for two seasons between 1960 and 1962 before again suffering relegation.|$|E
5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third avatar Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main {{difference in the}} anthropomorphic form portrayal {{is that the first}} two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the four different types of monsters, two halves of a Yoshi eggshell will also fall. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> eggshell <b>half</b> behaves like a monster: it disappears when it comes into contact with another <b>bottom</b> <b>half.</b> However, if a falling top half comes into contact with a <b>bottom</b> <b>half,</b> <b>the</b> two will join and hatch a Yoshi, earning the player bonus points. Furthermore, if a stack of monsters grows atop a <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> and a top half is then added, all monsters between the halves will be encased and eliminated. Larger Yoshi characters will hatch depending {{on the number of}} monsters encased, which also increases the number of bonus points awarded. If a falling top half does not have any <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> to join to in the stack it touches, it is automatically removed and no points are awarded.|$|R
50|$|LUV Graz won in 1979 the {{national}} Cup, its only national title to date. The team played five more unsuccessful finals between 1984 and 2007, {{and it was}} the runner-up of both the Championship and the Cup in 1986 and 2007. From 2009 on it has ended in <b>the</b> championship's <b>bottom</b> <b>half.</b> In summer 2014 it merged with 1. DFC Leoben (founded in 1976) and became SPG LUV Graz/DFC Leoben.|$|R
50|$|The Smithsonian’s First Lady {{collection}} was created {{soon after the}} Roosevelts left the White House. When the museum’s advocates asked her for a contribution, Edith said that she wasn’t sure she could help: she often cut up dresses for the material after she wore them. Turns out her inaugural gown was no exception. Her daughter later donated <b>the</b> remaining <b>bottom</b> <b>half,</b> and <b>the</b> Smithsonian refashioned the bodice using photographs.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in {{the top half of the}} table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the top half of the table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E
5|$|The promotional cinema {{poster for}} the film {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is actually {{the front of the}} suit. The poster caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E
5|$|Wealth, like {{income and}} taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% {{of the adult}} {{population}} possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> claim only 2%. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016. Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value. Since peaking {{in the second quarter of}} 2007, household wealth was down $14trillion, but has since increased $14trillion over 2006 levels. At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8trillion, down from $13.8trillion at the end of 2008.|$|E

5|$|York mostly {{occupied}} <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of {{the table}} {{before the turn of}} the year, and dropped as low as 23rd in September 2013. During February 2014 the team broke into the top half {{of the table}} and with one match left were in sixth-place. York's defensive record was the third best in League Two with 41 goals conceded, bettered only by Southend (39) and Chesterfield (40). Davies made the highest number of appearances over the season, appearing in 47 of York's 52 matches. Fletcher was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 10 league goals and 13 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Jarvis with nine goals.|$|E
5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos doubled in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> {{of the sixth}} to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{had just}} 13 players when McCall took over, {{and he made}} a number of summer signings {{including}} defender Darren Williams, midfielders Kyle Nix, Alex Rhodes and Scott Phelan, and strikers Barry Conlon, Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu and Peter Thorne. McCall recorded his first win as a manager against Wrexham on 25 August 2007 after substitute Luke Medley scored a late winner, but despite his pre-season target his team spent much {{of the first half of}} the season in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the table. After going unbeaten in January, the club were still 15th in League Two, and McCall told the Telegraph & Argus he did not regret his pre-season target but was carried away with the euphoria at the time. City's form continued to improve during the second half of the season, and McCall led his side to 10th place in League Two.|$|E

5|$|Dickov {{opted to}} build a {{youthful}} side and made controversial decisions {{at the start of}} the season to offload 2009–10 player of the year and club captain Sean Gregan as well as top scorer Paweł Abbott amongst other first team players. The team went into the New Year in ninth position, with games in hand on the teams above them, and being unbeaten at home in the league. Results in the second half of the season were less consistent and the team finished the season in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the table. On 6 May 2011 Dickov announced that he would make only his second appearance of the season for the first team in the final match of the season, and would then end his playing career to concentrate on management. He then came on as a 77th-minute substitute the following day against Milton Keynes Dons.|$|E
5|$|Due {{in large}} part to surplus {{revenues}} from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. The spending issue in part led to the defeat of the Republicans in the 1890 mid-term elections. Cleveland defeated Harrison for re-election in 1892, due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending. Harrison returned to private life and his law practice in Indianapolis. In 1899 Harrison represented the Republic of Venezuela in their British Guiana boundary dispute against the United Kingdom. Harrison traveled to the court of Paris as part of the case and after a brief stay returned to Indianapolis. He died at his home in Indianapolis in 1901 of complications from influenza. Although many have praised Harrison's commitment to African Americans' voting rights, scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below-average, and rank him in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> among U.S. presidents. Historians, however, have not questioned Harrison's commitment to personal and official integrity.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were scaled back and were the smallest since 1936. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne—who crashed during a practice run—and a British luge competitor. Milne had skidded off the course and crashed into a tree. Members of the IOC asked the AOF whether Milne was negligently sent to compete {{despite a lack of}} experience, which the AOF denied. The Australian manager John Wagner blamed the accident on a large group of skiers who had congregated lower down on the course during the practice session, forcing Milne to take evasive action. The Australian delegation felt that the training arrangements had not been enacted strictly, making the course unsafe. Australia was represented by five skiers—excluding Milne. Christine Smith placed in the top 30 in two events, but the remainder placed 40th or lower, although all were in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the field. Milne's replacement Peter Wenzel placed 68th in both the downhill and giant slalom.|$|E
