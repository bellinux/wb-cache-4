5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> higher up in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|JFK was {{released}} in theaters on December 20, 1991. In its first week of release, JFK tied with Beauty and the Beast for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a flop. Warner Brothers executives argued that this was at least partly because the film's long running time meant it had had fewer screenings than other films. Box office picked up momentum, however, {{in part due to}} a $15 million marketing campaign from the studio. By the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over $50 million worldwide, eventually earning over $200 million worldwide and $70 million in the United States during its initial run.|$|E

500|$|Historically, {{the press}} had enjoyed {{considerable}} prestige and respect to that point, though some Republicans complained of bias. But in his Des Moines speech, Agnew attacked the media, complaining that immediately after Nixon's speech, [...] "his words and policies {{were subjected to}} instant analysis and querulous criticism... by {{a small band of}} network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed {{in one way or another}} their hostility to what he had <b>to</b> <b>say...</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> obvious that their minds were made up in advance."

Produced by Combs, it features a prominent sample of [...] "Juicy Fruit" [...] as performed by James Mtume. AllMusic's Steve Huey stated that, {{along with the other}} singles, it was an [...] "upbeat, commercial moment", calling it a [...] "rags-to-riches chronicle".

500|$|With McCulloch {{influenced}} by American alternative rock bands such as Nirvana and The Smashing Pumpkins, the group employed a heavier sound than Echo & the Bunnymen's previous work. After successfully touring the United Kingdom {{and refusing to}} play any Echo & the Bunnymen material, Electrafixion released their only album, Burned, in September 1995. Despite critics giving the album good reviews, sales {{of it and the}} follow-up singles were disappointing. After embarking {{on a tour of the}} United States in 1996, Electrafixion eventually gave in to fan pressure and began to introduce Echo & the Bunnymen material to their live set. Sergeant felt that as the band were playing Echo & the Bunnymen songs, they might as well reform Echo & the Bunnymen; however, McCulloch was initially opposed to the idea. McCulloch changed his mind and, having persuaded Pattinson to come out of retirement, Echo & the Bunnymen was reformed in mid-1996. McCulloch felt Echo & the Bunnymen could not reform without Pattinson and described the bassist's involvement as [...] "integral". McCulloch went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to [...] "feel like the original group". He has also said, [...] "Right from the first demo [...] we realised that we'd still got that chemistry." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review of}} the Birthday of the World volume in Booklist Review commented that it offered a [...] "change of pace" [...] {{from the rest of}} the collection, and that in {{contrast}} to many of the other stories, which are set in the Hainish Universe, it [...] "stood well on its own". Suzy Hansen, writing in Salon, said that the novella allowed the reader to imagine the process of designing a part of the world. Hansen went on to say that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] allowed [...] "reality architects" [...] to ponder questions such as how to form language, and what environmental constraints shaped human beings. Hansen described the relationship between Hsing and Luis as a [...] "wonderful love story", and also praised the characterization of Bliss as a [...] "remarkable twist on organized religion", saying that the [...] "conflict [...] logical sense". Writing in 2015, Haiven called [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] a [...] "telling narrative" [...] and described it as a [...] "grim and timely warning" [...] about religious fundamentalism, and its power to shape society. He compared the struggle of the protagonists to that of the anarchist society of The Dispossessed, and went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "a chastening lesson in both the potential and the perils of freedom, [...] the secret life of authority".|$|E
500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
