From April through June, extensive refresher training occupied all hands as Iwo Jima prepared for her forthcoming Western Pacific deployment. On 24 July, steaming with a task group, she passed the volcanic island whose costly conquest by stouthearted sailors and marines had inspired her name. On board was one of the marine groups that had landed on Iwo Jima over two decades earlier. After operations in the Vietnam area, she sailed for Japan. Iwo Jima was on the line and underway for special operations in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam by 30 December once again, in a Navy-ready group with a two-pronged punch. Early in January 1967, the commanding officer, Captain Nils W. Boe, was relieved by Captain F. X. Timmes.

5000|$|... == Chapter 1 == Claudia Rankine's lyric {{opens with}} an {{introductory}} paragraph that is ironically {{a more formal}} [...] "closing" [...] to a long day. Rankine prescribes melancholia with an overall sense of exhaustion that leads the reader directly into a very familiar place: [...] "bed". It is here, {{in the beginning of}} the book that Rankine weaves [...] "prose, poetry and visual image pervasively into the daily American social and cultural life, subtly foreshadowing and boding its readers to the challenges certain citizens must overcome in order to not become invisible (National Book Award Judges’ Citation)." [...] "Sometimes the moon is missing and beyond the windows the low, gray ceiling seems approachable. Its dark light dims in degrees depending on the density of clouds and you fall back into that which gets reconstructed as metaphor." [...] (Citizen, pg.1) Moreover, Rankine's first paragraph offers the oppressed citizens, Blacks, a subtle solution even before delivering her readers the very contents of her book. The book is lyrically written, in of itself, as an extended metaphor of the extreme color distinction between white and black. Only people's perspectives regarding race allows society to identify the difference when regarding humanity and therefore equality. Throughout the lyric this racial divergence becomes more apparent as Rankine conveys each experience. The crux of the metaphor is the subsiding factor of grey; a color degree between that of white and black that implies patience and hope. These factors, subtly and metaphorically penned in the first paragraph grants these citizens a means to press forward against the subtle microaggressions, which, metaphorically speaking, is a wake for them in the very wake of the book. [...] "There are billions of souls in the world and some of us are almost to be touching the depths of how it is and what it is to be human. On the surface we exist but just beyond is existence. I write to articulate that felt experience."(Rankine) The first chapter immediately transfers the reader into a black persona who is quickly becoming invisible by the harassment of microaggressions. The necessity of tolerance ascribed by blacks, that is, in these occurrences even are subjected to children in grade school. Still consistent with second person perspective use of you, the short narration is of a child: [...] "You", who experiences a microaggression by first a student who is copying her work throughout the school year, and secondly, from Sister Evelyn, who never acknowledges the blatant incidences. [...] "...later when she tells you you smell good and have features more like a white person. You assume she thinks she is <b>thanking</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>letting</b> her cheat and feels better cheating from an almost white person." [...] The microaggression described here is that, you are unworthy of a genuine acknowledgment of gratitude. [...] "Thank you", is unnecessary or does not apply because you are classified as an [...] "almost" [...] in girl students’ mind. Rankine's verbiage utilizing the word assume, remarks the harsh reality that you have to ascribe an excuse or reasoning <b>for</b> another's actions. <b>You</b> must enable them - her and therefore the situation, crippling it, in order to rectify your own stability, in your own personal defense, so that you do not take direct offense. Only because the offense was not a direct form of prejudice. [...] "Sister Evelyn never figures out your arrangement perhaps because you never turn around to copy Mary Catherine's answers. Sister Evelyn must think these two girls think a lot alike or she cares less about cheating and more about humiliation or she never actually saw you sitting there." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> {{coming and}} <b>letting</b> {{me talk about}} the theory and {{practice}} of education. Let me start with some observations about {{what we are trying to}} do, or what I think that we should be trying to do, with Education theory. And in thinking about Education theory, we should never forget that what we are actually dealing with is people – living, breathing, feeling individuals with their own purposes and intentions. In view of the diversity and range of individuals that is implied by that simple statement, it is perhaps surprising that we can predict anything about people. But we can predict some things with considerable accuracy – such as traffic jams at particular times of day or seasons of the year, or the sale of food in supermarkets. But if we try to predict everything about a person, then we are not respecting their individuality, their ability to make their own choices, and to exercise free will. Education theory should make predictions that are helpful for planners, but that respect the freedom and individuality of the personal decisions that each of us make. I have argued elsewhere that this means that Education theory should be based on three principles: ● It should be ethical in allowing scope for individual free will; ● It should be multi-centred in allowing that there is more than one correct way to develop one’s educational career; and ● It should allow for partial autonomy between levels of understanding, between the individual, the schoo...|$|R
6000|$|I {{think your}} so {{interesting}} {{letter of the}} other day most kind and generous--it has greatly touched me. Mrs. Harrison had written me a short time before, even more movingly, and with equal liberality, and I feel my belated remembrance of you magnificently recognised. This has been a most healing fact for me in a lacerated world. How splendid your courage and activity and power, so continued, of production and attention! I am sorry to say I find any such power in myself much impaired and diminished--reduced to the shadow of what it once was. All relations are dislocated and harmonies falsified, and one asks one's self of what use, in such a general condition, is any direction of the mind save straight to the thing that most and only matters. However, it all comes back to that, and one does what one can because it's a part of virtue. Also I find one is the better for every successful effort to bring one's attention home. I have just read your [...] "English" [...] review of Lord Eversley's book on Poland, which you have made me desire at once to get and read--even though your vivid summary makes me also falter before the hideous old tragedy over which the actual horrors are being re-embroidered. I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> further <b>for</b> <b>letting</b> me know of your paper in the Aberdeen magazine--though on reflection I can wait for it if it's {{to be included in}} your volume now so soon to appear--I shall so straightly possess myself of that. As to the U.S.A., I am afraid I suffer almost more than I can endure from the terms of precautionary [...] "friendship" [...] on which my country is content to remain with the author of such systematic abominations--I cover my head with my mantle in presence of so much wordy amicable discussing and conversing and reassuring and postponing, all the while that such hideous evil and cruelty rages. To drag into our European miseries any nation that is so fortunate as to be out of them, and able to remain out with common self-respect, would be a deplorable wish--but that holds true but up to a certain line of compromise. I can't help feeling that for the U.S. this line has been crossed, and that they have themselves great dangers, from the source of all ours, to reckon with. However, one fortunately hasn't to decide the case or appoint the hour--the relation between the two countries affects me as being on a stiff downward slope at the bottom of which is rupture, and everything that takes place between them renders that incline more rapid and shoves the position further down. The material and moral weight that America would be able to throw into the scale by her productive and financial power strikes me as enormous. There would be no question of munitions then. What I mean is that I believe the truculence of Germany may be trusted, from one month or one week to another now, to force the American hand. It must indeed be helpful to both of you to breathe your fine air of the heights. The atmosphere of London just now is not positively tonic; but one must find a tone, and I am, with more faithful thought of Mrs. Harrison than I can express, your and her affectionate old friend, ...|$|R

But you alone have remained a part of me. I leave these words to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>letting</b> me depart with your love."-Jung-won. This explains the reason why Jung-won {{did not try to}} tell Da-rim that he was fatally ill and did not try to reach out or explain to her his sudden disappearance. Jung-won did not want to taint the love he and Da-rim shared. It can be speculated {{that he did not want}} it to be love out of pity. Like a photo, he wanted to preserve his memories of Da-rim while they were still innocent and happy, unlike his childhood love, which turned out to be an unfortunate ending. This allowed him to die peacefully, departing from the world with his innocent memories of her. In the scenes where his childhood lover came back, she requested him to take down her portrait. But at the end of the movie, it is seen that Da-rim's portrait remained in his shop window, symbolizing how Jung-won will never forget about her and take her out of his life.|$|E
