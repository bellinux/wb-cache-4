50|$|<b>The</b> Grand <b>Bench</b> must be {{composed}} of {{more than two-thirds of}} the Justices and be presided over by the Chief Justice. Unlike <b>the</b> Petty <b>Benches,</b> <b>the</b> Grand <b>Bench</b> can enter judgments by simple majority, rather than needing a consensus. If no majority can be reached amongst the Justices sitting on <b>the</b> Grand <b>Bench,</b> <b>the</b> judgment of the lower court is sustained by default. In addition to cases that fail to garner a consensus in one of <b>the</b> petty <b>benches,</b> <b>the</b> Grand <b>Bench</b> also hears cases where it is deemed that any order, rule, or regulation is in violation of the laws or the Constitution, where a previous opinion of the Supreme Court needs modification, or in cases where adjudication by <b>the</b> Petty <b>Benches</b> would not be appropriate.|$|R
50|$|The mithraeum was rebuilt soon after, {{but without}} the ante-room. Access was now {{directly}} into the shrine from the outside, and it is unusual that the community would not have wanted at least some form of ante-chamber, especially as they also reduced the free space within the shrine by extending <b>the</b> <b>benches.</b> <b>The</b> interior of the shrine was remodelled to include a stone podium {{in front of the}} apse (presumably for the tauroctony) and the lengthening of <b>the</b> <b>benches.</b> A new roof system was also put in with wooden posts standing in front of <b>the</b> <b>benches.</b> Five small uninscribed altars were found inside the nave, and the remains of a water-basin were recovered about two-thirds of the way along <b>the</b> northern <b>bench.</b>|$|R

He had a 100% kicking record for the 2010 Six Nations. O'Gara was selected in Ireland's squad for their 2010 Summer Tour to New Zealand and Australia, and started against New Zealand, converting 3 tries, but was on <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> for the Australia test. O'Gara became the third Irishman to win 100 caps when he came off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> during Ireland's first 2010 Autumn Series test against South Africa. He started against Samoa and scored 15 points, including a try. He came off <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> against New Zealand and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|A Ellis {{had not yet}} reached <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> to be {{replaced}} by an extra attacker (he even attempted to return to stop the puck) and thus the goal was credited as an official goal against Ellis, as opposed to an empty-net goal.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Full <b>Bench</b> is {{composed}} of three or more justices.
