30|$|In MEttLE, we {{structured}} {{the complex}} estimation process into {{a set of}} five tasks, each with a specific focus question. Learners watched the introductory video and then chose their tasks using the Estimap. They reported that the task structure depicted in the Estimap (Fig.  4), along with the focus questions of each task, made the choice of tasks easier. As described by S 1, “So, I went through this [pointing to Estimap] so I knew that evaluation needs {{to be the last}} and so...functional modelling was something which I found to be the best part <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> because <b>you</b> need <b>to</b> know how a car runs. Before solving a problem I should know that. After that the qualitative and then the quantitative and the calculation and evaluation.” Although MEttLE was not prescriptive in the task sequence, when faced with all the options of possible tasks, learners recognized the importance of beginning with a model of the working of the car. As a result, all learners chose to begin with functional modelling because it made sense to them that understanding the working principle first would make identifying the parameters that affect power easier. As S 7 reported, “I didn’t do it before, but you should know the concept what you are actually doing, you should know that before you actually solve the problem, and you should first analyse it qualitatively, like the relationships and all, that’s actually {{one of the most important}} things to do and if we just look at it as a problem and just go through the quantitative part, that way I don’t think it’ll be as beneficial as it was today.” Thus, learners changed their approach from “equation first” while solving the pre-test problem to “functional modelling first” in MEttLE.|$|R

I know that your ambition is not a very soaring one, and a few months ago you would not have ventured to dream of ever being a young lady in a shop like Jay's or Peter Robinson's. Yet for such a place you would not have to study for years and pass a stiff examination, as a poor girl is obliged to do before she can make her living by sitting behind a counter selling penny postage-stamps.
