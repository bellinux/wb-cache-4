A basic assumption when using transistors is that the retrieved RF signal from the antenna must be high enough to trigger the <b>transistors</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off.</b> Different voltage multiplier topologies possess different features and characteristics. However, as long as transistors {{are used in the}} design, there is considerable amount of voltage drop among transistors. It has been observed that the major cause of rectified voltage drop is the threshold loss. If {{the number of}} stages increases, the threshold voltage at the transistors also adds up, requiring the higher amplitude RF signal to trigger the transistors [62].

40|$|Because the {{germanium}} native oxide {{constitutes a}} poor dielectric, building metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) gate stacks on Ge requires passivation of {{the interface between}} the dielectric and the Ge channel. Different approaches to perform this passivation are available: GeO 2 growth prior to high-k depositing, sulphur passivation, etc. The interface properties of these MOS stacks are important, because they determine the electrical properties of the whole structure. Dangling bonds introduce extra energy levels within the band gap, which results {{in a loss of}} efficiency in switching a MOS - field effect <b>transistor</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off.</b> Fixed charges near the interface enlarge the voltage needed for switching between on and off state as well. Hence, characterizing these interfaces is a key challenge in semiconductor fabrication. This can for example be achieved using Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) to probe the interface, because SHG is an inherent surface and interface sensitive technique. In this work, we present SHG as an promising surface and interface characterization tool for semiconductors for passivated germanium samples. Different SHG responses are shown for germanium samples with a sulphur passivated Ge or high-k dielectric on top of Si. We show that the oxide layer as such is not probed by SHG and that different bonds over the Ge/oxide interface result in a difference SHG response. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Considering {{electronic}} devices, {{the fatigue}} failure occurs more frequently under cyclic loadings. In a daily {{use of an}} electronic device, we switch some <b>transistors</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off</b> such that heat is produced <b>on</b> the component <b>and</b> traces as well as vias (wires conducting electric signals). This heat increases {{the temperature of the}} circuit board. As a consequence, copper and the composite material try to expand differently—regarding their coefficients of thermal expansion—so-called thermal stresses occur. Unfortunately, such stresses are higher than the yield stress such that plastic deformation is induced. Since the produced heat escapes the device by an active or passive cooling, the electronic device tries to shrink or expand to its original shape. Due to the plastic deformation, this shape change generates stresses again. Hence a cyclic loading implies a plastic deformation in each cycle. The plastic deformation is irreversible and in each cycle the amount of plastic deformation accumulates. Sooner or later, there appear cracks caused by fatigue. In order to prevent these cracks, we may try to match the constants of thermal expansion of wire and composite material. Therefore, a possible improvement of fatigue properties in a circuit board relies on the choice of the composite material. In this study we investigate a non-conventional composite material and its effect to the reliability of the circuit board by using computation of thermo-electro-mechanical simulations.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{parallel}} implementation of a 1024 point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operating at subthreshold voltage, which is below the voltage that turns the <b>transistors</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off.</b> Even though the transistors are not actually switching as usual in this region, {{they are able to}} complete the computation by modulating the leakage current that passes through them, resulting in a 20 - 100 x decrease in power consumption. Our hybrid FFT design partitions a sequential butterfly FFT architecture into two regions, namely memory banks and processing elements, such that the former runs at superthreshold and the latter in the subthreshold voltage region. For a given throughput, the number of parallel processing units and their supply voltage is determined such that the overall power consumption of the design is minimized. For a 1024 point FFT operation, our parallel design is able to deliver the same throughput as a serial design, while consuming 65 % less power. We study the effectiveness of this method for a variable throughput application such as a sensor node switching between a low throughput and high throughput mode, e. g. when sensing an interesting event. We compare our method with other methods used for throughput scaling such as voltage scaling and clock scaling and find that our scaling method will last up to three times longer on battery power...|$|R

40|$|Tunability and {{adaptability}} {{for radio}} frequency (RF) front-ends are highly desirable because {{they not only}} enhance functionality and performance but also reduce the circuit size and cost. This thesis presents a number of novel design strategies in DC-DC converters, impedance networks and adaptive algorithms for tunable and adaptable RF based mobile telecommunication systems. Specifically, the studies are divided into three major directions: (a) high voltage switch controller based DC-DC converters for RF switch actuation; (b) impedance network designs for impedance transformation of RF switches; and (c) adaptive algorithms for determining the required impedance states at the RF switches. In the first stage, two-phase step-up switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters are explored. The SC converter has a simple control method and a reduced physical volume. The research investigations started with the linear and the non-linear voltage gain topologies. The non-linear voltage gain topology provides a higher voltage gain in {{a smaller number of}} stages compared to the linear voltage gain topology. Amongst the non-linear voltage gain topologies, a Fibonacci SC converter has been identified as having lower losses and a higher conversion ratio compared to other topologies. However, the implementation of a high voltage (HV) gain Fibonacci SC converter is complex due to the requirement of widely different gate voltages for the transistors in the Fibonacci converter. Gate driving strategies have been proposed that only require a few auxiliary transistors in order to provide the required boosted voltages for switching the <b>transistors</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>off.</b> This technique reduces the design complexity and increases the reliability of the HV Fibonacci SC converter. For the linear voltage gain topology, a high performance complementary-metaloxide- semiconductor (CMOS) based SC DC-DC converter has been proposed in this work. The HV SC DC-DC converter has been designed in low voltage (LV) transistors technology in order to achieve higher voltage gain. Adaptive biasing circuits have been proposed to eliminate the leakage current, hence avoiding latch-up which normally occurs with low voltage transistors when they are used in a high voltage design. Thus, the SC DC-DC converter achieves more than 25...|$|R

Furthermore, the jitter performance of the digitally-controlled delay elements is not as fine as that of the analog-tunable delay elements. This is because that for a high-resolution digital delay line, if the controller always switches the control code of the delay line, the jitter performance will not be good. Alternatively, digitally-controlled delay elements have wider range as well as simpler control of delay regulation, simpler and more robust design, lower power consumption, and better process portability than analog-tunable delay elements.|$|R

40|$|Subcellular {{difference}} in the reversal potential of Cl- (ECl) {{has been found in}} many types of neurons. As local ECl largely determines the action of nearby GABAergic/glycinergic synapses, subcellular ECl difference can effectively regulate neuronal computation. The ON-OFF retinal ganglion cell (RGC) processes both <b>ON</b> <b>and</b> <b>OFF</b> visual signals via its <b>ON</b> <b>and</b> <b>OFF</b> dendrites, respectively. It is thus interesting to investigate whether the <b>ON</b> <b>and</b> <b>OFF</b> dendrites of single RGCs exhibit different local ECl.
