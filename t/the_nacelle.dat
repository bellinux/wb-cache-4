5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving <b>the</b> <b>nacelle</b> design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of <b>the</b> <b>nacelle</b> was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>nacelle</b> was a simple, short, flat sided structure. It was {{supported}} above the lower wing on two more pairs of interplane struts which passed within <b>the</b> <b>nacelle.</b> The Anzani engine was mounted uncowled at the front, with the pilot seated under the trailing edge.|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the NACA 19 -foot {{pressure}} tunnel of a simplified twin-engine bomber model with an NACA low-drag wing primarily to obtain an indication of the effects of engine <b>nacelles</b> on <b>the</b> characteristics of the model both with and without simple split trailing-edge flaps. Nacelles with conventional-type cowlings representative of those used on an existing high-performance airplane and with NACA high-speed type E cowlings were tested. The tests were made without propeller slipstream. The aerodynamic effects of adding <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> to <b>the</b> low-drag wing were similar to the effects commonly obtained by adding similar nacelles to conventional wings. The maximum lift coefficient without flaps was slightly increased, but the increment in maximum lift due to deflecting the flaps was somewhat decreased. The stalling characteristics were improved by the presence of <b>the</b> <b>nacelles.</b> Addition of <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> had a destabilizing effect on the pitching moments, as is usual for nacelles that project forward of the wing. The drag increments due to <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> were of <b>the</b> usual order of magnitude, with the increment due to <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> with NACA type E cowlings approximately one-third less than that of <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> with conventional cowlings with built-in air scoops...|$|R
500|$|The V-22 has triple-redundant {{fly-by-wire}} {{flight control}} systems, which included computerized damage control to automatically isolate damaged areas. With <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> pointing {{straight up in}} conversion mode at 90° the flight computers command the aircraft to fly like a helicopter, with cyclic forces being applied to a conventional swashplate at the rotor hub. With <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> in airplane mode (0°) the flaperons, rudder, and elevator fly similar to an airplane. This is a gradual transition, occurring over the nacelles' rotation range; <b>the</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>nacelles,</b> <b>the</b> greater effect of the airplane-mode control surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>nacelles</b> can rotate past vertical to 97.5° for rearward flight. The V-22 can use the [...] "80 Jump" [...] orientation with <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> at 80° for takeoff to quickly achieve high altitude and speed. The control systems automate and simplify {{to the extent that}} the V-22 can hover in low wind with no hands on the controls. According to some who have flown the aircraft, former fixed-wing pilots may be preferable over helicopter ones as they are not trained to constantly adjust the controls while hovering.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>nacelles</b> had {{aluminium}} skeletons, {{the bottom}} halves {{of which were}} clad with aluminium sheeting and the tops with cotton cloth. A hatch, fitted with a connecting ladder to {{the main body of}} the airship, enabled the mechanics to climb in or out of <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> when their shifts changed.|$|R
25|$|Production {{aircraft}} {{differed in}} having the front elevator mounted on an upswept outrigger {{on the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>nacelle.</b> Additionally, the outer panels of the upper wing had a swept back leading edge, and were rigged with a slight dihedral.|$|E
25|$|The -535E4 was {{the first}} engine to {{incorporate}} a hollow wide-chord unsnubbered fan to improve efficiency. It also used more advanced materials, including titanium in the HP compressor and carbon composites in <b>the</b> <b>nacelle.</b> Later engines incorporate some features (e.g. FADEC) from improved models of the -524.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>nacelle</b> {{was built}} in 1928 by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH for the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin (Count Zeppelin). The {{propulsion}} system of this airship consisted of five nacelles fixed to the hull. Every nacelle contained a Maybach engine, type VL 2, which drove a propeller at the nacelle’s tail. A mechanic was stationed at each engine at all times.|$|E

25|$|The Il-2 is a single-engine, propeller-driven, low-wing {{monoplane}} {{of mixed}} construction {{with a crew}} of two (one in early versions), specially designed for assault operations. Its most notable feature was the inclusion of armor in an airframe load-bearing scheme. Armor plates replaced the frame and paneling throughout <b>the</b> <b>nacelle</b> and middle part of the fuselage, and an armored hull made of riveted homogeneous armor steel AB-1 (AB-2) secured the aircraft’s engine, cockpit, water and oil radiators, and fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|Design {{engineers}} {{decided to}} mount the nacelles directly to {{the underside of the}} wings to reduce the landing gear length and kept the engines low to the ground for easy ramp inspection and servicing. Many thickness variations for the engine attachment strut were tested in the wind tunnel and the most desirable shape for high speed was found to be one which was relatively thick, filling the narrow channels formed between the wing and the top of <b>the</b> <b>nacelle,</b> particularly on the outboard side.|$|E
25|$|Due to data {{transmission}} problems, structural health monitoring of wind turbines is usually performed using several accelerometers and strain gages attached to <b>the</b> <b>nacelle</b> {{to monitor the}} gearbox and equipments. Currently, digital image correlation and stereophotogrammetry are used to measure dynamics of wind turbine blades. These methods usually measure displacement and strain to identify location of defects. Dynamic characteristics of non-rotating wind turbines have been measured using digital image correlation and photogrammetry. Three dimensional point tracking has also been used to measure rotating dynamics of wind turbines.|$|E
5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of lift, {{drag and}} {{pitching}} moment {{have been made}} on model configurations representing rear-engined layouts, with large nacelles so positioned that both wing and tailplane will {{make a contribution to}} noise shielding. Only round nacelles were used with a high-wing model but both round and flat types of nacelle were tested on a low-wing model. The investigation concentrated on the effects of the large lifting surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> on <b>the</b> longitudinal stability and performance under the high-lift conditions appropriate to take-off and landing; <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> were not powered so the influence of the jet efflux was excluded. The results show that the influence of <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> on <b>the</b> downwash at the tailplane is such as to offset the lift losses and longitudinal stability changes incurred by adding <b>the</b> <b>nacelles</b> to models without tailplane; so that for the complete models the stability changes were small, and the effects on performance only became appreciable when <b>the</b> fiat <b>nacelles</b> were tilted several degrees nose down with a landing-flap setting.

2500|$|NC-2 {{differed}} in having the centre engine, of its complement of three, fitted as a pusher, retaining the pilots cockpit in <b>the</b> centre <b>nacelle.</b> [...] Also {{suffering from a}} lack of power, the NC-2 was modified with four engines in tandem outer <b>nacelles,</b> (due to <b>the</b> outer <b>nacelles</b> being built closer to <b>the</b> centre <b>nacelle,</b> <b>the</b> three tractor/one pusher arrangement was impractical). Initially <b>the</b> centre cockpit <b>nacelle</b> was retained but this was soon removed and a similar conventional cockpit to NC-1 was added.|$|R
25|$|Armament {{consisted}} of a single Madsen 23 mm cannon on a flexible mount in the nose, together with four 7.9mm FN-Browning machine guns {{in the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>nacelle.</b> It was intended that the cannon would be fixed during air-to-air combat, but that for ground strafing operations, the cannon would be released and aimed manually by the pilot, with an automatic stabilising system controlling the aircraft's ailerons and elevators to aid the pilot in keeping control of the aircraft while busy aiming and firing the cannon.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make the {{aircraft}} more manoeuvrable and in particular to increase its roll rate, a triplane configuration was chosen. This provided about the same total wing area as that of the biplane Scout with a lower moment of inertia about the roll axis. The Triplane had single-bay wings with heavy stagger, carrying six ailerons. The lower wing was close to the ground so two underwing skids were added below the interplane struts. The mid-line of <b>the</b> <b>nacelle,</b> with the engine at its rear, was on the centre plane, giving the pilot a slightly inferior view than from the Scout.|$|E
25|$|The Type F was {{a single}} seat biplane with the same layout as all other Caudron landbased biplanes before it, apart from the Type B Multiplace. They were all twin boom tractor {{configuration}} aircraft with a short central nacelle and twin fins. Compared to the Type B to Type E range, the Type F differed most obviously in <b>the</b> <b>nacelle</b> design and the vertical tail shape. By 1913, when the Type F appeared, {{at least one of}} each of the earlier types had been modified from an equal span biplane to a sesquiplane; like the Type E, the Type F was a sesquiplane from the start.|$|E

50|$|Turbomeca owned two Rockwell Turbo Commander aircraft, and {{arranged}} for Miles Aircraft to modify each of them to accept two podded Astafan engines inboard of <b>the</b> <b>nacelles.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nacelles</b> were stripped of their turboshaft engines, and converted to carry extra fuel. One of the Turbo Commanders, a model 680V-TU, originally bore the experimental registry F-WSTM, and was later redesignated F-BSTM. The other Turbo Commander, F-BXAS, was either a 690A or B model.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} large scale wind tunnel {{investigation}} of a 4 engine upper surface blowing configuration in the Ames 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel, <b>the</b> large <b>nacelles</b> extending well above the wing upper surface had a sizable adverse effect on maximum lift.

25|$|The Royal Air Force Museum London {{displays}} an F.E.2b. The {{wings and}} tail struts are replicas but the aircraft's nacelle and engine are original. <b>The</b> <b>nacelle</b> {{was made in}} 1918 by Richard Garrett & Sons, who were subcontracted to make the nacelles for Boulton & Paul Ltd, who assembled the complete aircraft. However, this nacelle was unfinished and never built into a complete aircraft. It was retained by Garretts until 1976 when it was passed to the RAF Museum. In 1986, the museum began a restoration project and commissioned the construction of replica wings and tail; a Beardmore engine was bought in New Zealand in 1992. The lengthy restoration was finally completed and the aircraft put on display in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Shorts {{airframe}} number S.39 {{was given}} to an experimental twin-engined aircraft based on the Type S.27, the Triple Twin. This was powered by two 50hp Gnome Omega engines, one {{in the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>nacelle</b> driving a pair of tractor propellers mounted on the interplane struts, with the chain drive to the left-hand propeller crossed so that the front propellers revolved in opposite directions, and the second engine mounted behind the trailing edge of the lower wing driving a pusher propeller. As first built and flown the wings were of equal span, with trailing edge ailerons fitted to both upper and lower wings. It was first flown by McClean on 18 September 1911 and bought by the Admiralty in June 1912, being given the serial number T.3.|$|E
25|$|Qantas Flight 32 was a Qantas {{scheduled}} passenger {{flight that}} suffered an uncontained engine failure on 4 November 2010 {{and made an}} emergency landing at Singapore Changi Airport. The failure {{was the first of}} its kind for the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. It marked the first aviation occurrence involving an Airbus A380. On inspection it was found that a turbine disc in the aircraft's No.2 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine (on the port side nearest the fuselage) had disintegrated. In addition to destruction of the engine, this caused damage to <b>the</b> <b>nacelle,</b> wing, fuel system, landing gear, flight controls, the controls for engine No.1 and a fire in the left inner wing fuel tank that self-extinguished. The failure was determined to have been caused by the breaking of a stub oil pipe which had been manufactured improperly.|$|E

25|$|O'Hare's initial {{maneuver}} was a high-side diving attack employing accurate deflection shooting. He accurately placed {{bursts of}} gunfire into a Betty's right engine and wing fuel tanks; when the stricken craft of Nitō Hikō Heisō Tokiharu Baba (3rd Shotai) {{on the right}} side of the formation abruptly lurched to starboard, he ducked to the other side of the V formation and aimed at the enemy bomber of Ittō Hikō Heisō Bin Mori (3rd Shotai) on the extreme left. When he made his third and fourth firing passes, the Japanese planes were close enough to the American ships for them to fire their anti-aircraft guns. The five survivors managed to drop their ordnance, but all ten 250kg bombs missed. O'Hare's hits were so concentrated, <b>the</b> <b>nacelle</b> of a Betty jumped out of its mountings, after O'Hare blew up the leading Shōsa Takuzo Ito's Betty's port engine. O'Hare believed he had shot down five bombers, and damaged a sixth. Lieutenant Commander Thach arrived at the scene with other pilots of the flight, later reporting that at one point he saw three of the enemy bombers falling in flames at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>nacelle</b> was a {{development}} of the earlier simple, flat sided structures, but no longer with its sides curving upwards in profile to the engine. Instead, the upper edges of this structure were straight, with a curved decking which ran forward, rounding into a cowling around the [...] Gnome Omega seven cylinder radial engine. The cowling was more complete than on the earlier models, though {{in the manner of}} the time there was a gap at the bottom to allowed lost oil to escape. At least one Type F had an uncowled Anzani 10-cylinder radial engine. [...] The cockpit's forward rim was raised up, making it more enclosed and better defined; similar protection had been introduced on the Type D2 and Type E. [...] As before, <b>the</b> <b>nacelle</b> was supported above the lower wing on two more pairs of interplane struts; these were enclosed by <b>the</b> <b>nacelle,</b> as on the Type D.|$|E
2500|$|The airship was {{designed}} by the prominent balloon manufacturer Édouard Surcouf and Henry Kapférer.

The engine also drove a pump to maintain pressure in the internal ballonet. [...] <b>The</b> <b>nacelle</b> was a square-section wire-braced wooden structure which had been used in the unsuccessful design of 1902, and carried a pair of rudders at the rear and a pair of biplane elevators. [...] The most novel feature of the design were the tail surfaces, which consisted of elongated tubes inflated with hydrogen. These were the result of research carried out by Charles Renard.|$|E
