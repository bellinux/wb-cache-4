5|$|In 1823, Michael Faraday, then an {{assistant}} in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied chlorine {{and went on}} to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquefy hydrogen and then newly discovered helium, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance {{scholars}} commonly practised astrology.

The distinction between astrology and astronomy was not entirely clear. Advances in astronomy were often motivated by the desire to improve the accuracy of astrology.|$|E

40|$|Variants of Metelli’s episcotister model, {{which are}} based on {{additive}} color mixture, have been found to describe the luminance conditions for perceptual transparency very accurately. However, the findings in the chromatic domain are not that clear-cut, since there exist chromatic stimuli that conform to the additive model but do not appear transparent. We present evidence that such failures are of a systematic nature, and we propose an alternative psychophysical model based on subtractive color mixture. Results of a computer simulation revealed that this model approximately describes color changes that occur when a surface is covered by a filter. We present the results of two psychophysical experiments with chromatic stimuli, in which we directly compared <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> additive model and <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new model.

In Experiment 1, 3 - to 5 -year-old children made inferences about highly familiar categories. The results were not fully consistent with either theoretical account. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naïve theory approach, the youngest children in the study did not ignore perceptually compelling lures in favor of category-match items; in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> similarity-based account, no group of participants favored perceptually compelling lures in the presence of dissimilar-looking category-match items. In Experiment 2 we investigated the mechanisms by which labels promote induction by examining the influence of different label types, namely category labels (e. g., the target and category-match both labeled as bird) and descriptor labels (e. g., the target and the perceptual lure both labeled as brown) on induction performance.
