500|$|Orion {{was less}} {{resolute}} {{in terms of}} who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said, [...] "...in Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research. All I did was listen to [...] He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). But <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> got on the set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up and everything was available. It was mesmerizing. He's really believable, and it was like a basic acting lesson." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, Reynolds and Autry {{founded the}} Major League Baseball {{expansion}} team the Los Angeles Angels. [...] At {{the time that}} he and Autry received the franchise for the American League's new Los Angeles franchise, Reynolds described his transition to a [...] "baseball man" [...] and his long relationship with Autry:"'My transformation into the town's No. 1 baseball fan,' he grinned, 'occurred <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> were given the franchise, and I found out I had a little personal investment at stake.' â€¦ 'I'd known Gene for at least 15 years, and we always hoped to own a radio station together,' explained Bob. [...] 'We satisfied that ambition with the acquisition of KMPC in 1952. NOw we have a baseball team, and we're out to make it the best.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Let us {{leave that}} until <b>the</b> last <b>minute.</b> <b>We</b> know {{about where we}} are going, and it doesn't make much {{difference}} what villages we strike {{so long as we}} do the business." ...|$|R
5000|$|Blundell said, [...] "One <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> {{were doing}} gigs in Eastbourne and <b>the</b> next <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> {{got a call}} saying {{they wanted us to}} do Top of The Pops. They were very {{exciting}} times for us all and we had a wonderful time doing it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we're {{wanted on}} that {{business}} you shall hear <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> know about it," [...] Joe replied, {{and then he}} and Fred started, preferring to walk rather than wait for the train.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, lass. I'll take no foolish risks. I've got men watchin' {{the house}} an' ranch. But I'd better have the cowboys down. There's Jake--he spots some prowlin' coyotes <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> reach home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{only human}} nature, so don't be troubled. We are all {{compasses}} pointing due north. We get shaken often, and the needle varies {{in spite of}} us; but <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> are quiet, it points right, and we have only to follow it." ...|$|E
60|$|For <b>the</b> {{next ten}} <b>minutes</b> <b>we</b> ate in silence, for Stephen had an {{excellent}} appetite and was hungry after his morning climb.|$|R
6000|$|... "Even {{the women}} folks {{will have their}} hands full--loading for us--when the real attack begins. <b>The</b> first ten <b>minutes</b> are what counts. It was that way when the Indians {{attacked}} father's trading post. If we hadn't put it to 'em hot-like from <b>the</b> first <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> would never have beaten 'em back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy {{they have}} all bolted, Dick," [...] his comrade said; [...] "after <b>the</b> first five <b>minutes</b> <b>we</b> have not heard a sound. I wonder what the prahus are doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you say is}} true," [...] said Sir James meditatively. [...] "I must confess, however, that I cannot help wishing we had not {{interrupted}} at <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> did. Still, it {{cannot be}} helped, {{it is only a}} matter of waiting until the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{of course}} she did. She could not have kept it from me, you know, for I began to laugh at her <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> came up, and {{asked her if she}} had not been delightfully employed, and you should have seen what a colour she grew directly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who'll list?" [...] {{cried the}} gaunt man again; [...] "now's your time! We've got forty men to Plymouth now, {{ready to sail}} <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> get back, and we want a dozen out of you Bideford men, and just a boy or two, and then we'm off and away, and make our fortunes, or go to heaven.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{could trust}} {{a good deal}} to her. She has much of your mother's sense. Well, you must settle it as you can with Meta's people! I do not think they love the pretty {{creature}} better than I have done from <b>the</b> first <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> saw her--don't you remember it, Norman?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{noticed that}} Mr. Dunross {{gave me his}} hand, without looking at me. His faded blue eyes, during <b>the</b> few <b>minutes</b> while <b>we</b> were together, were not once raised from the ground.|$|R
60|$|Only {{one other}} of the savages reached the boat. He seized the gunwale, but the knives of our rowers so mauled his wrists that {{he was forced to}} quit his hold, and <b>the</b> next <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> were past them all, and in safety. The strong {{excitement}} which had thus far kept me up, now left me, and I fell back fainting into the arms of Karakoee.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; but {{she will}} forgive us <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> say Napoleon, for that bad little man {{is one of her}} heroes,' added Mat, pretending to be admiring the view, while she privately {{examined}} a lady in a bower below--a stout, dark lady, with all the family traits so strongly marked that there could be no doubt of the young man's assertion.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a long}} square, {{the shape}} of a grave; the rain had made it sink down and show the shape. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> come and stood there we looked at one another and never said a word. When the dog had dug down only a few inches he grabbed {{something}} and pulled it up, and it was an arm and a sleeve. Tom kind of gasped out, and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No one {{objects to}} plenty of {{domestic}} work or fashionable pleasure, I find; but <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> begin to study, people {{tell us we}} can't bear it, and warn us to be very careful. I've tried the other things, and got so tired I came to college; though my people predict nervous exhaustion and an early death. Do {{you think there is}} any danger?' asked a stately girl, with an anxious glance at the blooming face reflected in the mirror opposite.|$|E
6000|$|He {{laughed at}} my [...] "unfortunately," [...] though {{recognising}} that I spoke merely {{from the point}} of view of lucidity, and presently remarked that he had his own idea. He didn't say what it was, and I didn't ask, intimating thereby that I held it to be in this manner we were playing the game; but I indulgently questioned it in the light of its not yet having assisted him. He answered that <b>the</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>we</b> had just passed were what had made the difference; it had sprung from the strong effect produced on him after she came in with me. [...] "It's but now I really see her. She did and said nothing special, nothing striking or extraordinary; but that didn't matter--it never does: one saw how she is. She's nothing but that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Trust me, {{your honor}} One {{of the first}} things I did, when the firing was over, was to pop into a stable and to get a big armful of hay; and take it out and hide it away, under a hedge. It was lucky I did; for <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> {{afterwards}} <b>we</b> could not have got a handful, if we had offered a Napoleon for it." ...|$|R

6000|$|She was {{as ready}} as I {{was to take}} her, and {{promptly}} on <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> sent up our names and took seats in the Ladies' Parlor. It {{had been years since}} I had entered the Palmer House, and as we waited we compared memories of its old-time splendor. [...] "My father still regards it as the grandest hotel in the West, and it is probable that Mr. Howells knew of no other. So far as I know he has never been in Chicago before, unless possibly for a few days during the World's Fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leave that to me, lord," [...] said Nicholas, with a cunning smile. [...] "Give me a purse of gold, {{not less}} than ten pieces, for some is needed to melt in the mixture, and more to bribe that woman and others. For the rest, hold {{yourself}} ready to become a husband before sunset to-morrow. Go see Sir John {{and tell him that}} the lady softens.

6000|$|The third {{night the}} house was crammed again--and they warn't new-comers this time, but people {{that was at the}} show the other two nights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or {{something}} muffled up under his coat--and I see it warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn't stand it. Well, when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> turned the corner and was in the dark he says: ...|$|E

60|$|Now I {{must say}} I began to bristle at being spoken to like that. I'm as {{proud of being}} an American as anybody can be, but I don't like {{the home of the}} free thrown into my teeth every time I open my mouth. There's no knowing what money Jone and I have lost through giving orders to London cabmen in what is called our American accent. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> tell the driver of a hansom where we want to go, that place doubles its {{distance}} from the spot we start from. Now I think the great reason Jone's rumbling worked so well was that it had in it a sort of Great British chest-sound, as if his lungs was rusty. The waiter had heard that before and knew what it meant. If he had spoken out in the clear American fashion I expect his voice would have gone clear through the waiter without his knowing it, like the person in the story, whose neck was sliced through and who didn't know it until he sneezed and his head fell off.|$|E
6000|$|As to his wounded, he {{explained}} that they were both heavy men, whom he could lift more easily than any one else. [...] "Otherwise, of course, I should have sent out one of my men; and, of course, about that gate business, we were safe <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> were well under the walls." [...] But this did not prevent his men from cheering him furiously whenever they saw him, or the mess from giving him a dinner {{on the eve of}} his departure to England. (A year's leave was among the things he had [...] "snaffled out of the campaign," [...] I to use his own words.) The doctor, who had taken quite as much as was good for him, quoted poetry about [...] "a good blade carving the casques of men," [...] and so on, and everybody told Cottar that he was an excellent person; but when he rose to make his maiden speech they shouted so that he was understood to say, [...] "It isn't any use tryin' to speak with you chaps rottin' me like this. Let's have some pool." ...|$|E
6000|$|WE {{was feeling}} pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and {{took a look at}} the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was {{standing}} on, and made us go right off to bed <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>we</b> was done supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says: ...|$|E
6000|$|For <b>the</b> {{next ten}} <b>minutes</b> <b>we</b> trudged in silence, when {{suddenly}} Umbopa, who was marching along beside me, wrapped in his blanket, {{and with a}} leather belt strapped so tightly round his stomach, to [...] "make his hunger small," [...] as he said, that his waist looked like a girl's, caught me by the arm.|$|R
50|$|His {{first goal}} for the club came under {{caretaker}} manager Andy Awford, in a relegation match against struggling Bristol Rovers. Twice {{in the first half}} Portsmouth took the lead and were pegged back by a dogged Rovers side fighting for their lives. However, in <b>the</b> 70th <b>minute</b> <b>Wes</b> Fogden popped up to poke in the winner for Portsmouth, in front of the Fratton End, after coming on as a second-half substitute, much to the delight of the 17,000 or so Portsmouth fans in the sold out Fratton Park.|$|R
