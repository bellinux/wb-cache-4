40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{authors have}} {{proposed}} and discussed temporary storage of heated water in openings excavated in rock mountain from the viewpoints of multiple-utilization of land, environmental safeguards, energy conservation, etc. When used for heated-water storage, the rock mass around <b>the</b> <b>openings</b> will receive <b>the</b> {{effects of the}} heated water. In this study, a uniaxial compression creep test at high temperatures of the rock was also carried out, then the calculation of various constants on the creep was tried. Using the results obtained in this work, temperature and stress distribution around <b>the</b> <b>openings</b> when heated water were stored was analyzed by considering the creep properties. The thermal behavior and stability of <b>the</b> <b>openings</b> were also examined. The displacement of <b>the</b> <b>openings</b> was predicted to be 1. 96 % of the diameter after one thousand days. ...|$|R
