5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} later on March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted on its website another article in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used {{by a number of}} professional athletes in several sports. <b>That</b> <b>article</b> mentioned that ten other professional wrestlers were implicated to have received performance-enhancing drugs from the same drug ring, including four WWE wrestlers and Eddie Guerrero. Angle never failed a drug test for pain pills, but he did fail a steroid test under WWE's Wellness Policy because his prescription for nandrolone had expired.|$|E

5|$|As the plenary {{legislative}} {{powers of}} the Parliament were sufficient to grant extraterritorial legislative powers to the Parliament, the Court declined to pronounce whether Article 73(a) was an empowering provision. However, it indicated on an obiter basis that had it been necessary to do so, it would have accepted the Attorney-General's alternate submission <b>that</b> <b>Article</b> 73(a) of the Malaysian Constitution was never intended to be an empowering provision.|$|E

5|$|In <b>that</b> <b>article,</b> he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{rendered}} its {{judgment on}} 9 January 1998. It accepted the appellant's assertion <b>that</b> <b>Article</b> 73(a) was an empowering provision. Hence since section 6(3) of the RSIA had clearly and unambiguously excluded Article 73(a) of the Malaysian Constitution from applying in Singapore following {{its independence from}} Malaysia, Parliament had disempowered itself from legislating extraterritorially. Applying this to the case, the Court held that Parliament had no legislative power to enact section 37(1) of the PCA.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; <b>that</b> <b>article</b> explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, Copeland {{became a}} key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. <b>That</b> <b>article</b> mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E

On August 30, 2007, an article by Sports Illustrated named Helms and nine other wrestlers to be given growth hormone not in compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness program. He was said to have received testosterone, HGH and nandrolone between November 2003 and February 2007.|$|E
5|$|The film {{began its}} {{publicity}} campaign in February2011 {{with the goal}} of releasing the film during the period of the 2011 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly elections to raise support of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Party, led by the film's writer, M. Karunanidhi. Criticism mounted against Karunanidhi for being more involved in his artistic pursuits than in his Chief Ministerial duties as the elections approached. Prior to release, the film also drew criticism from the Kongu Nadu Munnetra Kazhagam (KMK) Party claiming that the film portrayed the traditional deities of the gounder community in a bad light, showing them dancing with semi-nude women. Leading figures from the party wrote to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to ban the film, holding the promotional material used for the movie as evidence. When they received no response from CBFC, a petition was filed at Madras High Court, seeking its ban under Article 226 of the Indian constitution. The petition was dismissed, given <b>that</b> <b>Article</b> 226 can only be used by a court on a body that falls within its jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} Soviet protest {{was issued}} on 17 February 1965 {{in a letter}} to the Norwegian government. Specifically, it stated that Norway would be violating Article 9 of the Svalbard Treaty, that the installation could be used for intelligence assessment and that Norway should have consulted the Soviet Union before making the decision. The issue was discussed by the Norwegian Cabinet of State six days later. Minister of Justice and acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Oscar Christian Gundersen regarded the protest as moderate and that it fell into a series of Soviet protests against any activity on Svalbard that could remotely be considered a potential cover-up for military activity. An official response was sent on 23 March, which rejected all the Soviet objections. It stated that Norwegian authorities had made agreements with ESRO that Norway would make sufficient inspections to insure <b>that</b> <b>Article</b> 9 was followed, it pointed out the open and civil nature of ESRO and rejected the Soviet claims that they had the right to be consulted in advance.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands {{continued to be}} contested {{in state and federal}} courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled <b>that</b> <b>Article</b> Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.|$|E

30|$|The {{influence}} of author characteristics on citation counts {{have been investigated}} in previous research. Research on articles in sociology [6] and astrophysics [2] finds <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> written by men are more cited than articles written by women. However, the citation count of articles in ecology suggests that gender does not influence citation counts in this particular field of research [12]. Research also suggests <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> with a first author from an English-speaking country receive significantly more citations than articles written by authors from non-English-speaking countries [12], even though both groups wrote in English.|$|R
50|$|Wikishire organises its {{articles}} {{on the basis of}} the historic counties and ridings of Britain and Ireland and insists <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> are written in British or Irish dialects of English.|$|R
30|$|The {{first author}} {{characteristic}} {{included in our}} model is the alphabetical position of the first author‚Äôs surname (AN). Tregenza [20] found <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> written by authors whose surname begin with a letter close {{to the beginning of}} the alphabet are more frequently cited than articles written by authors whose surname is at the end of the alphabet. We therefore expect to find <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> with a first author whose surname begins with a letter early in the alphabet is more frequently cited than articles written by authors whose surname is late in the alphabet. The second author characteristic in our model is the gender of the first author (GE). Because articles written by women have been found to be less cited than articles written by men [2, 6], we expect to find <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> by women are less cited than articles by men. English as national language (EN) is the third author characteristic in our model. This variable controls for whether articles with a first author from a country where English is the national language receive more citations than other articles. Because previous studies have found higher citation counts for articles written by authors from countries where English is the native language [12], we expect to find <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> written by authors from English-speaking countries receive more citations. The fourth author characteristic is the number of authors (NA). Articles written by more than one author may benefit from division of labour and are, other things being equal, likely to be distributed to larger research networks. We therefore expect to find <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> written by more than one author are more cited than articles written by one author. The fifth and final author characteristic is the number of countries (AC) the authors are from. This variable controls for whether cross border cooperation in writing scientific articles influences how often they are cited. Articles written by authors from more than one country may benefit from division of labour and are, other things being equal, likely to be distributed to larger research networks than articles written by authors from one country only. The hypothesis is therefore <b>that</b> <b>articles</b> with co-authors from more than one country are more frequently cited than articles written by authors from one country only.|$|R
