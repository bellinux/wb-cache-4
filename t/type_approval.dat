25|$|Others {{operate under}} {{a permit to}} fly issued by the Popular Flying Association similar to the US {{experimental}} aircraft certification. However, the CAA's assertion that autogyros have a poor safety record means that a permit to fly will be granted only to existing types of autogyro.

25|$|When a halogen {{headlamp}} is retrofitted with an HID bulb, light distribution and output are altered. In the United States, vehicle lighting {{that does not}} conform to FMVSS 108 is not street legal. Glare will be produced and the headlamp's <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> or certification becomes invalid with the altered light distribution, so the headlamp is no longer street-legal in some locales. In the US, suppliers, importers and vendors that offer non-compliant kits are subject to civil fines. By October 2004, the NHTSA had investigated 24 suppliers and all resulted in termination of sale or recalls.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, purchasers of new-construction ICE {{motorized}} bicycles {{must meet}} {{a host of}} regulatory requirements and pass inspections from the DVLA and MSVA in order to register such machines for operation on public roadways. Owners must obtain an EC-type Motorcycle Single Vehicle <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> Certification (MSVA), {{and in order to}} obtain a DVLA-required insurance certificate, must provide proof from the original seller of the bicycle and engine that both the bicycle and the engine are new and unused. ICE motorized bicycles that are amateur-built and meet MSVA safety and regulatory standards, and which meet the definition of low powered mopeds (engines of proven output of less than 1kW (1.34hp) and capable of 25km/h (16mph) or less) face considerably fewer regulatory requirements.|$|E

40|$|Liferafts are {{commonly}} used worldwide as a primary or a secondary means of evacuation from merchant ships, passenger vessels, fishing boats, and offshore petroleum installations. In many cases, liferafts are required by regulations or laws whose explicit aims are {{to provide for the}} safety of life at sea. Despite being almost universally prescribed and carried by ships and offshore platforms, the actual performance that can be expected of liferafts and the people who have to use them in practice is largely unknown. Current Canadian regulations only require the successful completion of tests in calm water in order for manufacturers to obtain <b>type</b> <b>approvals</b> for their liferafts [1]. The performance of liferafts in ocean conditions is thus unknown. This absence of qualitative and quantitative knowledge, especially in different weather conditions, weakens rational decision-making processes and a host of associated search and rescue operations and planning.

50|$|The {{manufacturer}} {{claims that}} the aircraft conforms to US Light-sport Aircraft requirements and has a <b>Type</b> Design <b>Approval</b> from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, issued in 2015. As of September 2016 {{it does not appear}} on the US Federal Aviation Administration list of approved LSAs and, in fact, the category excludes electric-powered aircraft and requires a single reciprocating engine.|$|R
50|$|Rather than a UN-style {{system of}} <b>type</b> <b>approvals,</b> the US and Canadian auto safety {{regulations}} {{operate on the}} principle of self-certification, wherein the manufacturer or importer of a vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment certifies—i.e., asserts and promises—that the vehicle or equipment complies with all applicable federal or Canada Motor Vehicle Safety, bumper and antitheft standards. No prior verification is required by a governmental agency or authorised testing entity before the vehicle or equipment can be imported, sold, or used. If reason develops to believe the certification wasfalse or improper — i.e., that the vehicle or equipment does not in fact comply — then authorities may conduct tests and, if a noncompliance is found, order a recall and/or other corrective and/or punitive measures. Vehicle and equipment makers are permitted to appeal such penalties, but this is a difficult direction. Non-compliances found that are arguably without effect to highway safety may be petitioned to skip recall (remedy and notification) requirements for vehicles already produced.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most notable}} non-signatory to the 1958 Agreement is the United States, {{which has its}} own Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and does not {{recognise}} UN <b>type</b> <b>approvals.</b> However, both the United States and Canada are parties to the 1998 Agreement. UN-specification vehicles and components which do not also comply with the US regulations therefore cannot be imported to the US without extensive modifications. Canada has its own Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, broadly similar to the US FMVSS, but Canada does also accept UN-compliant headlamps and bumpers. It should be noted, however, that the impending Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union (likely to be ratified in 2015) could see Canada recognise more UN Regulations as acceptable alternatives to the Canadian regulations. [...] Canada currently applies 14 of the 17 ECE main standards as allowable alternatives - the exceptions at this point relate to motorcycle controls and displays, motorcycle mirrors, and electronic stability control for passenger cars. These three remaining groups will be allowed in Canada by the time the ratification of the trade deal occurs.|$|R
