Specifically, the equilibrium temperature distribution has a local subtropical peak and is flat elsewhere, including at the equator. On the basis of inviscid steady-state theory, {{it is argued that}} the response to such forcing is one of two distinct types. Below a <b>threshold</b> <b>forcing,</b> the atmosphere adopts a steady state of thermal equilibrium with no meridional flow. With supercritical forcing, this state breaks down and a strong meridional circulation is predicted. The <b>threshold</b> <b>forcing</b> value is that at which the absolute vorticity of the zonal flow (in gradient balance with the equilibrium temperatures) vanishes at the upper boundary. These inviscid predictions are tested in a zonally symmetric numerical model; while the model viscosity shifts the threshold and otherwise modifies the response, the threshold is clearly evident in the model behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} properties {{of a wide}} range of nonchiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) and double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT) with nonchiral commensurate walls are studied. Equilibrium structures of SWNT and DWNT, as well as the interwall interaction energies of DWNT, are computed using a local density approximation within density functional theory with periodic boundary conditions and Gaussian-type orbitals. Based on ab initio structural characteristics, elastic properties of SWNT and DWNT are calculated. Relative motion of the walls of DWNT with different radii and chiralities is explored using ab initio results for the interwall interaction energies. Relative positions of nonchiral commensurate walls of DWNT which correspond to extrema of the interwall interaction energy are derived. For DWNT with incompatible rotational symmetries of the walls, the possibility of orientational melting is predicted. Ab initio values of barriers to relative rotation and sliding of the walls of DWNT are used to calculate <b>threshold</b> <b>forces.</b> For nonreversible telescopic extension of the walls, maximum overlap of the walls for which <b>threshold</b> <b>forces</b> are greater than capillary forces is estimated.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Femoral {{impaction}} grafting requires vigorous impaction {{to obtain}} adequate stability without risk of fracture, but {{the force of}} impaction has not been determined. We determined this <b>threshold</b> <b>force</b> in a preliminary study using animal femurs. METHODS: Adult sow femurs were used because of their morphological similarity to human femurs in revision hip arthroplasty. 35 sow femurs were impacted with morselized bone chips and an increasing force was applied until the femur fractured. This allowed a <b>threshold</b> <b>force</b> to be established. 5 other femurs were impacted to this force and an Exeter stem was cemented into the neomedullary canal. A 28 -mm Exeter head was attached and loaded by direct contact with a hydraulic testing machine. Axial cyclic loading was performed and the position sensor of the hydraulic testing machine measured the prosthetic head subsidence. RESULTS: 29 tests were completed successfully. The <b>threshold</b> <b>force</b> {{was found to be}} 4 kN. There was no statistically significant correlation between the load at fracture and the cortex-to-canal ratio or the bone mineral density. Following impaction with a maximum force of 4 kN, the average axial subsidence was 0. 28 mm. INTERPRETATION: We achieved a stable construct without fracture. Further studies using human cadaveric femurs should be done to determine the <b>threshold</b> <b>force</b> required for femoral impaction grafting in revision hip surgery...|$|E

Mechanical pain was assessed using Ugo basile analgesy meter (Randall–Selitto test) before and 3 h after administration of test drug.

The discharge times of 27 single motor units were recorded from the biceps brachii in 11 old adults (78. 8 ± 5. 9 yr). The target force was set at either a relatively small (6. 6 ± 3. 7 % maximum) or large (11. 4 ± 4. 5 % maximum) difference below the recruitment <b>threshold</b> <b>force</b> and the contraction was sustained until the motor unit was recruited and discharged action potentials for about 60 s. The time to recruitment was longer for the large target-force difference (P = 0. 001). At recruitment, the motor units discharged repetitively for both target-force differences, which contrasts with data from young adults when motor units discharged intermittently at recruitment for the large difference between recruitment <b>threshold</b> <b>force</b> and target force.

When analyzed across the discharge duration, the average CV for the ISI decreased similarly for the two target-force differences (P = 0. 618) in old adults.
