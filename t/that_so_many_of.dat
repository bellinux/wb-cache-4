5|$|The {{aristocracy}} {{shared their}} power {{only with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops {{were members of the}} aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This {{is one of the reasons}} <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the civic}} {{authorities}} initially resisted installing tramways {{in the city}} centre owing to concerns about nuisance and disruption, they eventually relented; {{by the end of}} the 19thcentury Norwich had a total of [...] of tram routes, including a route along Gentleman's Walk itself. While schemes to rationalise the layout of the market's stalls had been proposed since the 18thcentury, they had foundered on the fact <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the stalls were privately owned.|$|E
500|$|Stanley {{praises the}} series saying [...] "It's not clear exactly why this bleak series is so exhilarating and binge-worthy. It {{could be that}} just as victims of tragedy {{find it hard to}} accept that their {{suffering}} is random and purposeless, voters find it intolerable <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the petty, shortsighted moves by elected officials have no greater meaning than small-time expediency." [...] She also notes that the series [...] "is more cynical than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic about human nature than The Walking Dead on AMC". However, The Americans [...] "is more complex and inventive" [...] according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1. [...] Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its [...] "bumbling chaos and ego implosions" [...] over House of Cards [...] "prohibitively sinister" [...] execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of [...] "nastiness and self-interest in power plays".|$|E

500|$|In a Gamasutra feature, Patrick Redding of Ubisoft attested that [...] "the fact <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> System Shock {{features}} are now virtually de rigueur in modern sci-fi shooters {{is a testament}} to the influence exerted by this one game." [...] GameSpy argued that the game [...] "is the progenitor of today's story-based action games, a group with titles as diverse as Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil, and even Half-Life." [...] Eurogamer called the System Shock series [...] "the benchmark for intelligent first-person gaming", and noted that it [...] "kick-start the revolution which ... has influenced the design of countless other games." [...] Steven Wright for Glixel said in a 2017 essay that System Shock still is important to gaming today, and that the only reasons it is not considered a [...] "Mt. Olympus of gaming" [...] is due to its lower sales compared to titles like Half-Life that sold in the millions, and that at the time it was released, it was difficult for players to adjust to the complex systems in the game compared to straightforward first-person shooters.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{performance}} {{also received}} positive response from celebrities and fans. US First Lady Michelle Obama, {{who attended the}} show said, [...] "Beyoncé stepped up in a way <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> our celebrities and athletes are stepping up on behalf of this issue, so I love her to death and {{was glad to be}} out there moving my body with her." [...] Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie used his Twitter account to write that everything about the show was [...] "great". Beyoncé's husband and rapper Jay-Z, also wrote on Twitter that Beyoncé was the [...] "best performer in the world". A writer of Complex magazine further discussed his statements, [...] "Sure, he's married to her... But upon further reflection, he just might have a point. What other artist out there gives the type of live performance she does on a nightly basis? Who can give you that incredible voice singing power ballads and up-tempo dance cuts—while dancing?... In a world with hotshots like Lady Gaga, legends like U2, and even Jay-Z and Kanye West's The Throne bodying stages worldwide, is Beyoncé best performer on earth?".|$|E
500|$|In May 1975, Roddenberry {{entered a}} {{development}} deal with Paramount, with principal photography intended {{to start on}} July 15, 1976, and a budget of $5 million. He started work on treatments; his first involved {{the formation of the}} Enterprise crew, including their training at Starfleet Academy and the formation of Starfleet, but this idea was never submitted to Paramount. His first major submitted script was The God Thing. A scene involving a discussion in which Spock's tutors describe religion on Earth worried the studio. The tutor says, [...] "We have never really understood your Earth legend of gods. Particularly in <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> your gods have said, 'You have to bow down on your bellies every seven days and worship me'. This seems to us like they are very insecure gods." [...] Roddenberry completed the script on 30 June; Paramount rejected it the following month. The studio was also unhappy with, and rejected, scripts by Robert Silverberg, Chris Knopt, Dick Simmons and Theodore Sturgeon. Roddenberry blamed religious Paramount executives including Barry Diller for turning down The God Thing, a story that writer Jon Povill summarized as [...] "God was a malfunctioning spaceship".|$|E
5000|$|Cave {{would later}} explain, in his {{foreword}} to Escapades of the Eel, {{that it was}} his admiration of author Damon Runyon that led him to write the adventures using [...] "the same present-tense, first-person narrative style <b>that</b> marked <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his great yarns." ...|$|R

500|$|Halperin {{described}} [...] "This Moment" [...] and [...] "Ghost" [...] as [...] "mid-tempo ballads {{that are}} closest in DNA to Perry's previous smashes". Perry stated {{that she was}} inspired to write [...] "This Moment" [...] after she heard the audio book of The Power of Now; the song's lyrics talk about [...] "living in the present"; with Perry [...] "add a romantic spin" [...] to it. Gary Trust described [...] "Ghost" [...] as a [...] "mesmerizing ballad", while Gundersen described it as [...] "powerful, dark, and haunting". Lipshutz felt that [...] "Ghost" [...] and [...] "By the Grace of God" [...] contain the album's [...] "most somber moments". While talking about each Prism track, Perry mentioned that [...] "By the Grace of God" [...] was the first song she wrote and recorded for the album back in November 2012 {{while she was in}} her [...] "dark" [...] phase. Jody Rosen from Vulture described bonus track [...] "Spiritual" [...] as an inspirational song. Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast described [...] "It Takes Two" [...] as a [...] "sweeping ballad" [...] which allowed Perry to [...] "show off a full-throated belt <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> her more bubbly tracks mask". In [...] "Choose Your Battles", Perry [...] "pounds her chest and spews venom at the man she cannot understand".|$|E
500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Phrases like [...] "Bomber-Harris, do it again!", [...] "Bomber-Harris Superstar - Thanks {{from the}} red Antifa", and [...] "Deutsche Täter sind keine Opfer!" [...] ("German {{perpetrators}} are no victims!") are popular slogans among the so-called [...] "Anti-Germans"—a small radical left-wing political movement in Germany and Austria. In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing, Anti-Germans praised the bombing on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the city's civilians had supported Nazism. Similar rallies take place every year.|$|E

2500|$|Vermeer {{was rescued}} from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, {{by which time}} several of his works had been re-{{attributed}} to others. However the fact <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his works were already in major collections, often attributed to other artists, demonstrates {{that the quality of}} individual paintings was recognised even if his collective oeuvre was unknown. [...] Other artists have continued to be rescued from the mass of little known painters: the late and very simple still lifes of Adriaen Coorte in the 1950s, and the landscapists Jacobus Mancaden and Frans Post earlier in the century.|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt then briefly {{comments}} {{on some of}} Wordsworth's more recent [...] "philosophical production" [...] which (for example, [...] "Laodamia") he finds [...] "classical and courtly ... polished in style without being gaudy, dignified in subject without affectation." [...] As in the earlier sketches, Hazlitt finds links between his earlier and later subjects. If {{there are a few}} lines in Byron's poems that give him the heartfelt satisfaction <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> Wordsworth's poems do, it is only when [...] "he descends with Mr. Wordsworth to the common ground of a disinterested humanity" [...] by [...] "leaving aside his usual pomp and pretension." ...|$|E
2500|$|A retreat up the Ancre valley was {{contemplated}} by Ludendorff and Rupprecht but rejected, {{due to the}} lack of better defensive positions further back, in favour of counter-attacks desired by Below the 1st Army commander. Gallwitz noted in early October, <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his units had been transferred north of the Somme, that he had only one fresh regiment left in reserve. The German counter-attacks were costly failures and by 21 October, the British had advanced [...] and taken all but the last German foothold in the eastern part of [...] (Regina Trench).

2500|$|For {{nearly two}} hours Hodges’ {{regiment}} was able to prevent {{the development of the}} French vanguard, and covered the retreat of the surprised foragers before retiring his troops to a nearby mill (see map). By 11:00, Marlborough had arrived within sight of the engagement. Noticing Hodges was under attack by several French batteries, the English commander ordered the embattled colonel to withdraw to a hill east of Walcourt, behind which the main Allied force was forming. Waldeck later commented to William – [...] " [...] and the English, who are with him, have accomplished miracles, and I could never have believed <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the English would show such a joie de combattre." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Moon and the Bonfires, {{the protagonist}} {{tells a story}} of {{drinking}} beer in a bar in America. A man comes in whom he recognizes as being from the valleys of Le Langhe by his way of walking and his outlook. He speaks to him in dialect suggesting a bottle of their local wine {{would be better than}} the beer. [...] After some years in America, the protagonist returns to his home village. He explores Le Langhe with a friend who had remained in the area. He finds out <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his contemporaries have died in sad circumstances, some as partisans shot by the Germans, while a notable local beauty had been executed by partisans as a fascist spy.|$|E
2500|$|Stuff Redoubt fell on 9 October and {{the last}} German {{position}} in [...] Redoubt fell on 14 October, exposing {{the positions of the}} 28th Reserve Division in the Ancre valley, to British ground observation. A German retreat from the salient that had formed around St. Pierre Divion and Beaumont Hamel either side of the Ancre, was considered by Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff and the new army group commander Field Marshal Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria and rejected, {{due to the lack of}} better defensive positions further back, in favour of counter-attacks desired by General Fritz von Below the 1st Army commander.

It first came out in 1980 and has since been reissued five times; the 2011 edition is associated with the National Trust. The Sunday Times describes it as a [...] "minor classic", and a review of the first edition states [...] "The charm of this book is <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the details of everyday life come alive and the more ordinary, prosaic things take on their true importance ... Reading it is rather like peering through the windows of a long-forgotten doll's house."

2500|$|The Citizens and Strangers Guide of 1814 said [...] "The whole {{island has}} been {{surveyed}} and framed into extensive avenues and commodious streets, forming an important legacy to posterity, {{from which the}} most solid advantages may be anticipated," [...] while another commentator from that year wrote [...] "The arrangement of the original or {{lower part of the}} city ... is essentially defective. [...] Beauty order and convenience seem to have been little valued by our ancestors." [...] This comment is especially interesting, considering <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the critics of the plan would cite its lack of beauty as a reason for their displeasure with it. One critic recently pointed out that the wide avenues attract retail and commercial use, among other benefits. In 1836, an official in the city government wrote that the Plan [...] "...laid out the highways on the island upon so magnificent a scale, and with so bold a hand, and with such prophetic views, in respect to the future growth and extension of the city, that it will form an everlasting monument to the stability and wisdom of the measure." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1904 and 1905, an aged William Oates and Joshua Chamberlain waged {{what one}} writer {{described}} as [...] "one last battle" [...] over the proposed {{construction of a}} monument on the Little Round Top to the 15th Alabama. [...] While Chamberlain indicated {{that he had no}} quarrel whatsoever to the erection of a memorial to his old enemies, he strenuously objected to the precise spot proposed by Oates, which he insisted was farther up the hill than Oates' regiment had actually gotten during the battle. [...] A somewhat-testy exchange of letters between the two men failed to resolve their differences, and no monument to the 15th Alabama was ever erected. [...] Chamberlain had visited the battlefield several years after the war, and had personally directed the removal of a pile of stones placed atop Little Round Top by veterans of the 15th Alabama. [...] At the time, as he did later in his conflict with Oates, Chamberlain stated that he had no objections to the erection of a monument to the 15th, but not atop the hill <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his men had died to hold. [...] More recent efforts to create a pile of stones atop the Little Round Top have been foiled by Gettysburg park rangers.|$|E
