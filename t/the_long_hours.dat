Housekeeping and laundry services were provided, but the quarters were small and little entertainment was available. Television broadcasts were delayed two days {{because of the need}} to fly tapes from California, and most workers had to develop their own forms of entertainment. In the winter, some took to skiing or sightseeing; in the summer, some went hiking. In general, however, little time was available for recreation because of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> worked by most people.|$|E
5|$|As {{detected}} by the British, repairs to Tirpitz following Operation Tungsten progressed quickly. Work on repairing the battleship began in late April, and 157 shipyard workers and special equipment were transported from Kiel in Germany to Kaafjord {{to accelerate the}} project. Assisted by <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> of daylight at Kaafjord's latitude during summer, three shifts of personnel worked on Tirpitz each day. The battleship was capable of moving under her own power by 2 June, and ready to begin gunnery exercises {{at the end of}} that month. The repair works concluded in mid-July, though the battleship's starboard propeller shaft could only be used to drive her forwards. Captain Wolf Junge assumed command of the battleship in May 1944, replacing Captain Hans Meyer who had been wounded during Operation Tungsten.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{four and a}} half months at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California, beginning in mid-June 1997, the longest Madonna had ever worked on an album. For most of the recording process, only three other people were in the studio with Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> he spent in the studio.|$|E

5|$|Brasenose's {{finances}} {{entered the}} second half of the century in poor shape, and considerably worse than the period between 1930 and 1931, slipping relative to other colleges from 3rd to 8th. But they were improved during Last's tenure, along with undergraduate admissions; the college showed a surplus in 1952–53, and income in 1957 (£104,000) was double what it had been in 1938. Pay for fellows was still poor, and they were small in number compared to other colleges. There was a sizeable entertainment budget, however, something which, combined with <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours,</b> have contributed to short lifespans. Only in 1987 did a sitting fellow reach retirement age. Last resigned as Principal in 1956, dying shortly after. Turnover was considerable, although some fellows stayed on: Maurice Platnauer became Principal in 1956, and retired in 1960; he was replaced by Sir Noel Hall. Hall's tenure was troubled, not externally, but rather from Hall's patchy knowledge of the college and staff; his selection, faute de mieux, was sometimes questioned, although he remained well-liked. However, the college, which had thus far stayed assured, found itself in a changing environment. Herbert Hart, however, Principal between 1973 and 1978, was the first to be elected from outside Brasenose. Lord Windlesham, made principal in 1989, was the first to hold Cabinet Office.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps {{can be used}} to give {{artificial}} daylight. Different snails {{respond to}} day length in different ways.

Moreover, an artists' colony had developed in the town, so that the Remingtons counted among their neighbors writers, actors, and artists such as Francis Wilson, Julian Hawthorne, Edward Kemble, and Augustus Thomas.|$|E

If they are, is <b>the</b> association <b>long</b> or short-lasting? This paper answers these questions through within-person analysis of a nationally representative longitudinal survey from the United Kingdom. The results suggest that <b>long</b> working <b>hours</b> of work do not directly affect SWB, but in line with theories of person-environment fit, both over-employment and under-employment are associated with lower SWB. However, over-employment is more likely for those who work <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>The</b> duration of the SWB penalty associated with over-employment and under-employment is typically short, but SWB levels tend to remain depressed for those who remain over-employed for two years or more. Results suggest that state and organisational policies that reduce <b>the</b> incidence of <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> working may enhance aggregate well-being levels...|$|R

25|$|The {{studies that}} {{conclude}} abuse {{is a bigger}} problem in military families than civilian families attribute this to <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours,</b> frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress. They point out that military families may be more reluctant to report issues of abuse {{because of the potential}} impact on the service member's career. Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because military culture offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members {{are more likely to be}} ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.|$|E
25|$|Good Humor was {{not able}} to solve its labor problems. The company was unionized early in its history and was struck on several occasions. For example, in 1950 the Teamsters shut down Good Humor's New York {{operations}} for three weeks during the critical month of June. Beginning in the 1950s, the labor pool dried up and Good Humor operated over half of its fleet with seasonal employees, mostly college students. On average, new employees lasted only two to three weeks because of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours.</b> The entire industry, except Good Humor, stopped using commissioned employees and became distributors who leased trucks to the drivers and sold them their products wholesale. Good Humor adopted this system wherever possible but was prevented from converting most branches because of union contracts.|$|E

40|$|Do professors put in {{very long}} workweeks solely {{out of a}} love of their work, or do {{expectations}} for teaching and publishing essentially require a sixty-hour workweek for the successful completion of the job? How do faculty members reconcile the demands of an academic career {{with the realities of}} family life? Drawing on a large national survey of postsecondary faculty conducted in 1998, the authors examine the length of the workweek by analyzing its relationship to faculty dissatisfaction with their workload. The authors find evidence that many professors are dissatisfied with their workload. Moreover, dissatisfaction increases among those work-ing <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>The</b> data also indicate that very <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> on <b>the</b> job greatly contribute to research pro-ductivity. <b>The</b> very <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> demanded by faculty jobs thus pose a dilemma for parents who want to spend time with their children and their families. The authors con-clude by suggesting that the challenge is to create a set of expectations for academic employment that are compatible with responsible parenting in dual-career couples...|$|R

25|$|There is {{not much}} vintage {{variation}} due to the reliability of favorable weather with little risk of summer time frost or harvest time rains. The main exception, again, is Casablanca {{due in part to}} its proximity to the Pacific. For the Chilean wine regions in the Valle Central, the Andes and Coastal Ranges create a rain shadow effect which traps the warm arid air in the region. At night, cool air comes into the area from the Andes which dramatically drops the temperature. This help maintain high levels of acidity to go with the ripe fruit that grapes develop with <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>hours</b> of uninterrupted sunshine that they get during the day. The result is a unique profile of flavonoids in the wine which some Chilean wineries claim make Chilean wines higher in resveratrol and antioxidants. Harvest typically begins at the end of February for varieties like Chardonnay with some red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon being picked in April and Carmenère sometimes staying on the vine into May.|$|E
