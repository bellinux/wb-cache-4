500|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> evil {{could exist}} in a good universe, Chrysippus replied [...] "evil cannot be removed, nor is it well {{that it should be}} removed." [...] Firstly, he argued, following Plato, that it was impossible for good to exist without evil, for justice could not be known without injustice, courage without cowardice, temperance without intemperance or wisdom without foolishness. Secondly, apparent evils exist as a consequent of nature's goodness, thus it was necessary for the human skull to be made from small and thin bones for reasons of utility, but this superior utility meant that the skull is vulnerable to blows. Thirdly, evils are distributed according to the rational will of Zeus, either to punish the wicked or because they are important to the world-order as a whole. Thus evil is good under disguise, and is ultimately conducive to the best. Chrysippus compared evil to the coarse jest in the comedy; for, just as the jest, though offensive in itself, improves the piece as a whole, [...] "so too you may criticize evil regarded by itself, yet allow that, taken with all else, it has its use." ...|$|E

Game Revolution called him [...] "mysterious, androgynous" [...] and compared him to Proto Man [...] "with a ponytail". Jeese Scheeden from IGN named him one of his ten favorite sword-wielding characters in the video games, describing him as an answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Mega Man would fight if armed with a sword, and noted his fighting style as popular with gamers. GameZone writer Michael Knutson praised the inclusion of Zero in the Mega Man X series, citing his playability as popular amongst series fan as it expanded the gameplay. Jeremy Parish from 1UP.com stated that his appearance as a playable character with his own story in Mega Man X4 by itself made it the best game in the X series. GameSpot noted the contrast in his gameplay to that of Mega Man X in Mega Man X4 increased the difficulty of using him in the title. Additionally, Brett Elston from GamesRadar credited Zero {{as one of the}} reasons the X series became so popular and that his own popularity within gamers earned him his own video game series.|$|E

2500|$|Steno's work on {{shark teeth}} led him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> any solid object {{could come to}} be found inside another solid object, such as a rock or a layer of rock. The [...] "solid bodies within solids" [...] that {{attracted}} Steno's interest included not only fossils, as we would define them today, but minerals, crystals, encrustations, veins, and even entire rock layers or strata. He published his geologic studies in De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus, or Preliminary discourse to a dissertation on a solid body naturally contained within a solid in 1669. This book was his last scientific work of note. Steno {{was not the first}} to identify fossils as being from living organisms; his contemporaries Robert Hooke and John Ray, as well as Leonardo da Vinci a century earlier also argued that fossils were the remains of once-living organisms.|$|E

2500|$|... (tetrads {{are like}} triads but in four spacetime dimensions), one recovers general relativity. The {{condition}} that the [...] field be {{given by the}} product of two tetrads is called the simplicity constraint. The spin foam dynamics of the topological field theory is well understood. Given the spin foam 'interaction' amplitudes for this simple theory, one then tries to implement the simplicity conditions to obtain a path integral for general relativity. The non-trivial task of constructing a spin foam model is then reduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> this simplicity constraint should be imposed in the quantum theory. The first attempt at this was the famous Barrett–Crane model. However this model was shown to be problematic, for example there {{did not seem to}} be enough degrees of freedom to ensure the correct classical limit. It has been argued that the simplicity constraint was imposed too strongly at the quantum level and should only be imposed in the sense of expectation values just as with the Lorenz gauge condition [...] in the Gupta–Bleuler formalism of quantum electrodynamics. New models have now been put forward, sometimes motivated by imposing the simplicity conditions in a weaker sense.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue is}} related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Zoroaster's own {{contribution}} to Iranian religion might be defined. In the older early/mid 20th-century view (so-called reform hypothesis), in which Zoroaster was {{perceived to be}} a revolutionary reformer, {{it was assumed that}} the daevas must have been the [...] "national" [...] gods (see comparison with Indic usage, below) of pre-Zoroaster-ian Iran, which Zoroaster had then rejected. This attribution to Zoroaster is also found in the 9th/10th-century books of Zoroastrian tradition, and Gershevitch and others following Lommel consider the progression from [...] "national" [...] gods to demons to be attributable to the [...] "genius of Zoroaster." [...] Subsequent scholarship (so-called progressive hypothesis) has a more differentiated view of Zoroaster, and does not follow the unprovable assumption that prehistoric Iranian religion ever had [...] "national" [...] gods (and thus also that the daevas could have represented such a group), nor does it involve hypothetical conjecture of whose gods the daevas might/might not have been. While the progressive hypothesis gives Zoroaster credit for giving Iranian religion a moral and ethical dimension, it does not (with one notable exception) give Zoroaster credit {{for the development of the}} daevas into demons. It assumes that the development was gradual, and that a general distrust of the daevas already existed by the time the Gathas were composed.|$|E

[...] It cited then Israeli defence minister Shaul Mofaz stating, [...] "under no circumstances would Israel be able to tolerate nuclear weapons in Iranian possession." [...] In December 2005, a British newspaper claimed that the Israeli military had been ordered by then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to plan for possible strikes on uranium enrichment sites in Iran in March 2006, based on Israeli intelligence estimates that Iran {{would be able to}} build nuclear weapons in two to four years. It was claimed that the special forces command was in the highest stage of readiness for an attack (state G) in December of the following year. Ariel Sharon reportedly said, [...] "Israel - and not only Israel - cannot accept a nuclear Iran. We have the ability to deal with this and we're making all the necessary preparations to be ready for such a situation." [...] Israeli military Chief of Staff, Dan Halutz, was quoted as responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> far Israel was ready to go to stop Iran's nuclear energy program with the statement [...] "Two thousand kilometers." [...] Seymour Hersh says U.S. Department of Defense civilians led by Douglas Feith have been working with Israeli planners and consultants to develop and refine potential nuclear, chemical-weapons, and missile targets inside Iran.|$|E
