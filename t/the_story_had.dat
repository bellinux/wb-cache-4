5|$|Madness in the Fast Lane is the BBC documentary, first {{broadcast}} on BBC One on 10 August 2010, which brought {{the story of}} Sabina and Ursula Eriksson and the killing of Glen Hollinshead into the public consciousness. The footage on the M6 motorway of the two women jumping into the passing traffic had previously been {{broadcast on}} Motorway Cops, {{but this was the}} first time the rest of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been told.|$|E
5|$|On February 27, 2008, {{allegations}} surfaced {{that two}} Conservative Party officials offered terminally ill, Independent MP Chuck Cadman a million-dollar {{life insurance policy}} {{in exchange for his}} vote to bring down the Liberal government in a May 2005, budget vote. If <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been proved true, the actions may have been grounds for charges as a criminal offence since, under the Criminal Code of Canada, it is illegal to bribe an MP.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.35 million viewers in the UK and {{achieved}} an Appreciation Index of 85. Reviewers were generally positive about the episode; some praised the setting and characters but others commented that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> not developed enough {{even though it was}} only the first part. The computer-generated effects used for one scene were also disapproved of by a couple of reviewers.|$|E

5|$|The second, G.I. Joe and the Transformers, was a 4-issue mini-series {{running from}} January to April 1987. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> the Joes and the Autobots joining forces {{to stop the}} Decepticons and Cobra from {{destroying}} the world. A trade paperback later collected all four issues.|$|E
5|$|While {{the show}} was still in previews, writer Owen Davis claimed <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been lifted from his earlier play Lola, which had {{appeared}} briefly on Broadway in March 1911, then was adapted as a movie in 1914. He filed a lawsuit, {{but by the end}} of May it was settled with a cash payment to Davis.|$|E
5|$|Work on Siti Akbari was {{completed}} {{over a period}} of several years. Lie stated that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> taken him three years, writing sporadically. Tio, however, reports rumours that the writing took some seven years, with Lie sometimes taking long breaks and sometimes writing in a fervor, writing from dawn until dusk.|$|E

5|$|An EastEnders {{spokesperson}} {{stated that}} programme-makers {{were working in}} close conjunction with the NSPCC in order to portray the subject matter accurately and sensitively, commenting that the show aims {{to raise awareness of}} real-life issues, and has in the past similarly drawn attention to issues such as domestic violence, rape and HIV. John Grounds, the NSPCC's director of communications, praised the soap for raising awareness of the issue. Sara Nathan of The Sun reported that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been planned since the previous year, and would begin with Whitney worrying about Tony's release from prison and the effect it would have on her family.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against Marsh and Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery rebuttal, {{but by the end}} of January <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E

5|$|Lonesome Road: In Lonesome Road, the Courier is {{contacted}} by Ulysses, an ex-legionary and courier who, upon seeing the Courier's {{name on a}} list of possible deliverers, refused to deliver the Platinum Chip that was ultimately responsible for the Courier's attempted murder. Ulysses was a character whose involvement in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been hinted since New Vegas' initial release, and Lonesome Road concludes his story, {{as well as that of}} the Courier. Initially, Lonesome Road was planned to be released in August 2011; however, the add-on was delayed until September 20 for unspecified reasons.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|An early 1970s Spider-Man story {{led to the}} {{revision}} of the Comics Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction {{of the use of}} illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.|$|E

5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the film had been growing since Noé's adolescence, when he first became {{interested}} in matters of death and existence. In his early twenties—while under influence of psilocybin mushrooms—he saw Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. He then decided that, if he ever made a film about the afterlife, {{that was the way}} in which it would be filmed. Noé had been working on different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> initially been more linear, and the drafts were set in different locations, including the Andes, France, and New York City. Tokyo was chosen because it could provide colourful environments required for the film's hallucinogenic aspects, and because Japan's repressive drug laws add to the drama, explaining the intensity of the main character's fear of the police.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{original}} version having been broadcast on PBS, a pilot episode for an American version (known as Red Dwarf USA) was produced through Universal Studios {{with the intention of}} broadcasting on NBC in 1992. The show essentially followed the same story as the first episode of {{the original}} series, using American actors for most of the main roles: Craig Bierko as Lister, Chris Eigeman as Rimmer, and Hinton Battle as Cat. Exceptions to this were Llewellyn, who reprised his role as Kryten, and the British actress Jane Leeves, who played Holly. It was written by Linwood Boomer and directed by Jeffrey Melman, with Grant and Naylor onboard as creators and executive producers. Llewellyn, Grant and Naylor travelled to America for the filming of the American pilot after production of the fifth series of the UK series. According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. Grant and Naylor rewrote the script, but although the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>had</b> been well received.|$|E
