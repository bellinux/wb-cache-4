6000|$|These barren and tedious eccentricities are {{all that}} the {{air-tight}} stove can bestow {{in exchange for the}} invaluable moral influences which we have lost by our desertion of the open fireplace.

60|$|The {{island of}} Torcello is some {{five miles away}} from Venice, in the {{northern}} lagoon. The city was founded far back in the troubled morning of Christian civilization, by refugees from barbarian invasion, and built with stones quarried from the ruins of old Altinum, over which Attila had passed desolating. During the first ages of its existence Torcello enjoyed the doubtful advantage of protection from the Greek emperors, but fell afterward under the domination of Venice. In the thirteenth century the debris of the river that emptied into the lagoon there began <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> the wholesome salt canals, and to poison the air with swampy malaria; and {{in the seventeenth century}} the city had so dwindled that the Venetian podestà removed his residence from the depopulated island to Burano,--though the bishopric established immediately after the settlement of the refugees at Torcello continued there till 1814, to the satisfaction, no doubt, of the frogs and mosquitoes that had long inherited the former citizens.|$|E
6000|$|From Stanton Harcourt we drove--I {{forget how}} far--to {{a point where}} a boat was waiting for us upon the Thames, or some other stream; for I am ashamed to confess my ignorance of the precise {{geographical}} whereabout. We were, at any rate, some miles above Oxford, and, I should imagine, pretty {{near one of the}} sources of England's mighty river. It was little more than wide enough for the boat, with extended oars, to pass, shallow, too, and bordered with bulrushes and water-weeds, which, in some places, quite overgrew the surface of the river from bank to bank. The shores were flat and meadow-like, and sometimes, the boatman told us, are overflowed by the rise of the stream. The water looked clean and pure, but not particularly transparent, though enough so to show us that the bottom is very much weedgrown; and I was told that the weed is an American production, brought to England with importations of timber, and now threatening <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> the Thames and other English rivers. I wonder it does not try its obstructive powers upon the Merrimack, the Connecticut, or the Hudson,--not to speak of the St. Lawrence or the Mississippi! ...|$|E

"I {{consider}} those printed Paper Aprons, {{worn by the}} Parisian Cooks, as a new vent, {{though a}} slight one, for Typography; therefore as an encouragement to modern Literature, and deserving of approval: nor is it without satisfaction that I hear of a celebrated London Firm having in view to introduce the same fashion, with important extensions, in England."--We {{who are on the}} spot hear of no such thing; and indeed have reason to be thankful that hitherto there are other vents for our Literature, exuberant as it is.--Teufelsdrockh continues: [...] "If such supply of printed Paper should rise so far as <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> the highways and public thoroughfares, new means must of necessity be had recourse to. In a world existing by Industry, we grudge to employ fire as a destroying element, and not as a creating one. However, Heaven is omnipotent, and will find us an outlet. In the mean while, is it not beautiful to see five million quintals of Rags picked annually from the Laystall; and annually, after being macerated, hot-pressed, printed on, and sold,--returned thither; filling so many hungry mouths by the way? Thus is the Laystall, especially with its Rags or Clothes-rubbish, the grand Electric Battery, and Fountain-of-motion, from which and to which the Social Activities (like vitreous and resinous Electricities) circulate, in larger or smaller circles, through the mighty, billowy, storm-tost chaos of Life, which they keep alive!"--Such passages fill us, who love the man, and partly esteem him, with a very mixed feeling.|$|E
50|$|The canal {{was built}} {{during the reign}} of Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin (popularly known in Kashmir as 'Budshah'). It was {{considered}} as a lifeline of the city even up to {{the early part of the}} 20th century. However, with the arrival of motor transport, it gradually lost its sheen. As such, it was filled up to pave way for a road through the old city. The filling up of the canal is considered an ecological disaster as it led <b>to</b> the <b>choking</b> <b>up</b> of Brari Nambal and in turn affected the entire water system of the city.|$|R
60|$|A curious {{example of}} the {{struggle}} between plants has been communicated to me by Mr. John Ennis, a resident in New Zealand. The English water-cress grows so luxuriantly in that country as <b>to</b> completely <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> the rivers, sometimes leading to disastrous floods, and necessitating great outlay to keep the stream open. But a natural remedy has now been found in planting willows on the banks. The roots of these trees penetrate {{the bed of the}} stream in every direction, and the water-cress, unable to obtain the requisite amount of nourishment, gradually disappears.|$|R
60|$|In {{ten days}} they dropped ten {{thousand}} feet. They {{came to a}} land where their throats were always dry, where the trees and shrubs seemed like property affairs from a theatre, where they plunged their heads into every pool that came to wash their noses and mouths from the red dust that seemed <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> them <b>up.</b> They found tin and oil and more copper. Then, by slow stages, they passed on to a land of great grassy plains, of blue grass, {{miles and miles of}} it, and suddenly one day they came to the telegraph posts, rough pine trees unstripped of their bark, with a few sagging wires. Tavernake looked at them as Robinson Crusoe might have looked at Man Friday's footsteps. It was the first sign of human life which they had seen for months.|$|R

These had an outer annular orifice for steam and an inner circular opening for exhaust gases and formed the upper {{portion of a}} bell-mouth scoop.

5000|$|Cyrus {{performed}} [...] "Malibu" [...] {{live for}} the first time at Wango Tango on May 13, 2017, as a special guest performer. A little over a week later, she gave her first televised performance of the track at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards on May 21. She was introduced by both her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, and sister, Noah Cyrus, before performing the song. She wore a pair of white jean shorts, a white crop top, and a tan cowboy hat. Cyrus began <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> <b>up</b> towards the end of the performance, becoming teary-eyed and thanking her fans. A day later, she performed the song on The Voice finale, in front of a forest-themed backdrop similar to in the song's music video. She prefaced the performance by dedicating it to Ariana Grande and victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which had occurred 2 days prior to her performance, saying, [...] "I'd like to dedicate this song to my good friend Ariana Grande and to everyone who experienced that horrific attack yesterday. Our hearts are with you.” On May 26, Cyrus also performed the song on the Today show as part as their Citi Concert series.|$|E
6000|$|... § 16. I {{speak of}} some rocky slopes as lines of rest, because, {{whenever}} a mountain side {{is composed of}} soft stone which splits and decomposes fast, it has a tendency <b>to</b> <b>choke</b> itself <b>up</b> with the ruins, and gradually to get abraded or ground down towards the débris slope; so that vast masses of the sides of Alpine valleys are formed by ascents of nearly uniform inclination, partly loose, partly of jagged rocks, which break, but do not materially alter the general line of ground. In such cases the fragments usually have accumulated without disturbance {{at the foot of}} the slope, and the pine forests fasten the soil and prevent it from being carried down in large masses. But numerous instances occur in which the mountain is consumed away gradually by its own torrents, not having strength enough to form clefts or precipices, but falling on each side of the ravines into even banks, which slide down from above as they are wasted below.|$|R
500|$|In 2010, the BBC {{analyzed}} the stigma over men crying during Titanic and films in general. [...] "Middle-aged {{men are not}} 'supposed' to cry during movies," [...] stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of Titanic as having generated such tears, adding that [...] "men, if they have felt weepy during , have often tried to be surreptitious about it." [...] Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, [...] "For many men, {{there is a great}} deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed." [...] Rohrer said, [...] "Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during Titanic will readily admit <b>to</b> becoming <b>choked</b> <b>up</b> during Saving Private Ryan or Platoon." [...] For men in general, [...] "the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion".|$|R
5000|$|James Reaney (London Free Press) {{called the}} Canadian crooner's {{concert at the}} John Labatt Centre a mixture of warmth and {{insanity}} declaring, [...] "Bublé can play it beautifully straight. The man who followed Monday's sweet and soulful version of Van Morrison's 'Crazy Love' with a reverential take on Hoagy Carmichael's 'Georgia on My Mind', complete with a thrilling high-note solo from his band's trumpeter, and then pulled off Stevie Wonder's 'For Once in My Life' the way Nelson Riddle might have arranged it for Frank Sinatra {{is not simply a}} showbiz kidder." [...] Jason MacNeil (Jam!) gave the singer's performance at the Air Canada Centre three and a half out of five stars commenting, [...] "But Buble's first real highlight might have been following the schmaltzy 'I've Got The World On A String' when he poured himself into the tender and heartfelt 'Best Of Me', almost appearing <b>to</b> get <b>choked</b> <b>up</b> at some points in the song. The song led nicely into a strong cover of Van Morrison's 'Crazy Love'." ...|$|R

But deep down she strives to repress the love she still feels for Rodrigo.|$|R
6000|$|Late in the '70s, {{while on}} his way to a consulship in Germany, Bret Harte visited London for the first time. There he was taken in charge by Joaquin Miller, the Poet of the Sierras, who in his reminiscences relates: [...] "He could not rest until he stood by the grave of Dickens. At last one {{twilight}} I led him by the hand to where some plain letters in a broad, flat stone just below the bust of Thackeray read 'Charles Dickens.' Bret Harte is dead now and it will not hurt him in politics, where they seem to want the hard and heartless for high places, it will not hurt him in politics nor in anything anywhere to tell the plain truth, how he tried <b>to</b> speak but <b>choked</b> <b>up,</b> how tears ran down and fell on the stone as he bowed his bare head very low, how his hand trembled as I led him away." ...|$|R
6000|$|We hurried on {{along the}} trace, which now sloped rapidly downhill. [...] Suddenly, a loathsome smell defiled the air. Was there a gas-house in the wilderness? Or had the pales of Paradise been just smeared with bad coal-tar? Not exactly: {{but across the}} path crept, festering in the sun, a black runnel of {{petroleum}} and water; and twenty yards to our left stood, under a fast-crumbling trunk, what was {{a year or two}} ago a little engine-house. Now roof, beams, machinery, were all tumbled and tangled in hideous and somewhat dangerous ruin, over a shaft, in the midst of which a rusty pump- cylinder gurgled, and clicked, and bubbled, and spued, with black oil and nasty gas; a foul ulcer in Dame Nature's side, which happily was healing fast beneath the tropic rain and sun. The creepers were climbing over it, the earth crumbling into it, and in a few years more the whole would be engulfed in forest, and the oil-spring, it is <b>to</b> be hoped, <b>choked</b> <b>up</b> with mud.|$|R

50|$|A 2008 review {{published}} in the journal Violence and Victims found that although less serious situation violence or altercation was equal for both genders, more serious and violent abuse was perpetrated by men. It was also found that women's physical violence was more likely motivated by self-defense or fear while men's was motivated by control. A 2011 systematic review from the journal of Trauma Violence Abuse also found that the common motives for female on male domestic violence were anger, a need for attention, or as a response to their partner's own violence. Another 2011 review {{published in}} the journal of Aggression and Violent Behavior also found that although minor domestic violence was equal, more severe violence was perpetrated by men. It was also found that men were more likely <b>to</b> beat <b>up,</b> <b>choke</b> or strangle their partners, while women were more likely to throw something at their partner, slap, kick, bite, punch, or hit with an object.|$|R

Dehydrators & TXs switched off. The collapse left sections of twisted mast strewn over the transmitter site, and across the junction of Common Lane and Jagger Lane, and the surrounding fields. Although a falling stay cable cut through a local church and across the transmitter site buildings, no one was injured. It completely disabled the BBC2 UHF transmitter and the ITV VHF transmitter, leaving several million people without service. BBC1 VHF television transmissions continued from Holme Moss. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) owned a collapsible emergency mast, 61 m tall, which was moved to Emley from the Lichfield transmitting station so that some service could be restored. ITV signals were restored to 2.5 million viewers within four days. The BBC provided a mobile mast on an outside broadcast van to restore a restricted BBC2 colour service within two days. The ITA bought a larger temporary mast from a Swedish company. A crew of Polish riggers were hired, and a 204 m mast was erected in under 28 days {{at a cost of}} £100,000. This mast could hold only one set of antennas, so many viewers in outlying areas still could not receive colour programmes. The taller mast was brought into service on 16 April. Some weeks later, the BBC erected a 91 m mast, improving coverage.|$|R

When I was not nearly so old as you, my dear, there was a young gentleman who sat next us at church, who used, almost every Sunday, to cut my name in large letters in the front of his pew while the sermon was going on. It was gratifying, of course, naturally so, but still it was an annoyance, because the pew was in a very conspicuous place, and he was several times publicly taken out by the beadle for doing it. But that was nothing to this. This is a great deal worse, and a great deal more embarrassing.
