While several {{studies on the}} reason for the passage have been done from factors such as logrolling, interest groups and partisan politics, I have already explained it from another factor, the "Flexible <b>Tariff</b> <b>Provision</b> (FTP)," which had an epoch-making aspect - delegation of the power to adjust tariffs from Congress to President and Tariff Commission. This article aims to illuminate the intent and the meaning of FTP by tracing to the passage process of the first FTP of the Fordney-Mc-Cumber Act of 1922. Tariff Commissioner William Culbertson, a leading proponent of 1922 FTP, had engaged in tariff matters since Taft Administration, and long aspired to expand the power for the Tariff Commission of 1916 enough to affect more directly the executive in the U. S. commercial policy. Primary sources such as letters and diaries illustrate that Culbertson approaced the executive people including Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover as early as March 1921; Culbertson's desire characterized by making efficient tariff rates not excessively high or low with elasticity won the approval Hoover and Hoover's close friend Senator Irvine Lenroot; they supported Culbertson not only during the process of 1922 FTP but also after its passage, even when Culbertson was in conflict with Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge over the power of the Commission to initiate tariff investigation. Hoover continued to pursue the tariff reform, leading to his behavior during 1929 - 1930.

This potential requirement for grocery stores and restaurants was supported by 93 and 88 percent of respondents, respectively. Binomial probit analysis identified the socioeconomic characteristics of consumers {{with respect to their}} decision on the labeling of fresh or frozen beef in grocery stores and restaurants. Important variables for both types of outlets were "prefer domestic over imported durable goods, " "consider domestic beef safer than imported beef, " and "male. " While food shopping, consumers often look for distinguishing features of products to select among the many items available. Brands, labels, store signs, distinctive packaging, and other recogniz-able features help consumers distinguish one prod-uct from another. For example, Certified Black Angus Beef is differentiated from other meat by its distinctive label and promotional material. The consumer can also identify some differ-ences between particular cuts of beef-say, rump roasts-by looking for the United States Depart-ment of Agriculture (USDA) Quality Grade label. Consumers can use this aggregated information to help them answer questions regarding the beef cut's edibility, economic value, safety, nutritive content and suitability for particular meal uses. Another attribute that beef consumers may de-sire to know is the country-of-origin. Beef marketed in U. S. grocery stores and restaurants is either do-mestic or imported. While U.

40|$|Sharing {{different}} stages of manufacturing between countries is of major and growing importance. But because of previous deficiencies in the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC Revision 1) system, {{it was not possible}} to differentiate between the international trade in components and parts and the exchange of fully fabricated manufactured goods. Such a distinction was needed to empirically estimate theamount of global production sharing. Changes in the SITC classification system (Revision 2) now allow one to approximate how much production sharing occurs within the key machinery and transportation equipment (SITC 7) group, which includes about 50 percent of world trade in all manufactures. In 1995, OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) exports of parts and components in this group totaled $ 440 billion, which was about 30 percent of all shipments (components plus assembled goods) of machinery and transportation equipment. Developing countries produced and exported an additional $ 100 billion of these products [...] which indicates global exports exceeded one-half trillion dollars. But the extent of production sharing is clearly greater than these figures indicate, because the SITC Revision 2 system does not allow one to distinguish between components and parts in chemicals or other manufactured goods. The data also show that over the past decade trade in machinery and transport equipment components has grown considerably faster than final stage products in this group. A different form of production sharing involves the use of special <b>tariff</b> <b>provisions</b> for the re-import of domestically produced components that have been assembled abroad. A second data source on this activity indicates that trade in these goods totals about $ 100 billion annually, with most of the activity involving the European Union and the United States. (Again, the available data probably understate the importance of this exchange.) Even so, these supplemental statistics illustrate the importance of this activity to some developing countries, as more than 40 percent of manufactured exports from the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Jamaica, and Mexico involve assembly operations using components manufactured abroad.

40|$|Economists {{have been}} trying to deal with {{technical}} trade barriers in agriculture for decades (Hillman 1978). It is a difficult conceptual and empirical subject that will not be settled soon. Recently, trade policy economists have noted that appropriate treatment of technical barriers in trade policy modelling may be of growing importance. One standard argument is that, as other non-tariff barriers in agriculture are eliminated and as tariffs are reduced, the relative (and perhaps absolute) importance of technical barriers is increased (Josling 1994; Sumner 1995 b). Among the most important technical trade barriers are those relating to sanitary and phytosanitary [SPS] and food safety concerns. These were dealt with in several places in recent trade agreements. The agriculture provisions of the Uruguay Round trade agreements [URA] reduced the scope for non-tariff barriers and lowered <b>tariffs.</b> The <b>provisions</b> found in the Uruguay Round "Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures " and the "Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade " require that import restrictions based on SPS claims be more consistent with science and that technical barriers in general be less arbitrary...|$|R

40|$|The US-Australia Free Trade Agreement {{is not in}} Australia’s interests, argues John Quiggin in this {{overview}} of the debate so far THE passage of legislation implementing the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) brings to an end one of the stranger episodes in Australian economic policy debate. (There remains a remote possibility that the US government will reject the implementing legislation, and particularly the Labor amendment on patent rights, as inconsistent with the agreement). Traditionally, such debates have seen economists lined up in support of free trade, while politicians {{were more likely to}} oppose it. By contrast, economists’ attitudes to the FTA have ranged from lukewarm support to vehement opposition, with the latter view predominating. Meanwhile politicians have argued for the FTA with a mixture of geopolitical arguments - suggesting that opposition is, or will be seen as anti-American - and interest-group arguments about benefits for particular businesses. This apparent paradox may be resolved with the observation that the agreement is not really about free trade at all. This is partly because bilateral agreements have negative effects on trade with countries not included in the agreement, but more significantly because the proposed agreement involves the adoption of US policies which give monopoly rights to owners of ‘intellectual property’, and thereby restrict trade. The aim {{of this paper is to}} survey some of the main issues surrounding the FTA, including impacts on trade in goods and services, the distinction between trade agreements and economic integration agreements, and the role of intellectual property and its impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Trade in goods Australia has very few barriers to trade in goods, and even fewer that are significant in relation to our trade with the United States. Our general tariff of 5 per cent is at a level which can be justified under the revenue <b>tariff</b> <b>provisions</b> of the GATT. The main areas of higher tariff protection, the motor vehicle industry textiles, clothing and footwear industry, are areas where the United States has little capacity to export to Australia. There has been some criticism of Australia’s quarantine policies, but these policies are designed to focus on science-based analysis of disease threats rather than on protection for domestic producers. Similarly, Australia has very few policies that subsidise exports or otherwise distort international market prices. Most agricultural industries receive minimal assistance. Single-desk selling policies for some agricultural commodities have been criticised as anti-competitive, but the cost of such policies, if any, is borne by Australian producers. Thus far, most producer groups have concluded that benefits such as the pooling of risk outweigh any costs from forgoing a choice of export marketers. By contrast, the United States has a wide range of barriers and distortions, particularly in the agricultural sector. The most important set of distortions are the broad-ranging production and export subsidies contained in the Farm Bill passed in 2002. This Bill provides for $US 190 billion in subsidies over 10 years to US agricultural industries including grain, cotton, wool and dairy. Subsidised exports of these commodities depress world prices and harm all Australian producers, regardless of whether they are in direct competition with subsidised exports. Although they have received more attention, restrictions on imports to the US are of less significance. The most important barriers relate to sugar, beef and dairy products, and there are a range of less significant barriers. As in Australia, the US also provides significant protection to a small group of manufacturing industries. The pattern is largely symmetrical, with motor vehicles and TCF being notable beneficiaries. This symmetry reflects the fact that, in both Australia and the United States, these industries have declined as a result of competition from Asia. The bilateral balance of trade shows a strong surplus for the US. Conversely, Australia currently collects substantially more revenue from tariffs on imports from the US than does the US from tariffs on Australian exports. This is important in assessing the distribution of costs and benefits from the FTA. The content of the proposed FTA As has been widely publicised, the proposed FTA removes most tariffs and trade barriers, but makes no change in US restrictions on imports of sugar from Australia and only modest and gradual changes with respect to imports of beef and dairy products. More importantly, no changes are proposed to the US Farm Bill. Not only is the general system of subsidies unaffected (it would perhaps have been utopian to hope for broad-based reform) but there does not even appear to be any commitment to avoid the use of export subsidies that directly harm Australian exporters in particular markets. Indeed, it appears that the issue of the Farm Bill was not raised in the negotiations. The most important distortions of agricultural trade practised by the US are unaffected by the FTA and are, in effect, endorsed by Australia’s signature to the agreement. There have recently been indications that negotiations in the World Trade Organisation may lead to more substantial progress in reducing farm subsidies. This merely accentuates the questions surrounding the wisdom of abandoning multilateral processes in favour of unbalanced bilateral deals. Services and investment: The impact of the proposed FTA on services is relatively modest. Although there are some provisions in both Australia and the US that discriminate against noncitizens, these are relatively modest. Moreover, some of the most important policies of this kind, such as restrictions on airline services, have been excluded from the scope of the agreement. The main interest therefore relates to possible future developments, going beyond the removal of overt discrimination against noncitizens. These are discussed below, particularly in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It should be noted that the services sector was responsible for a substantial proportion of the gains from an FTA estimated by the Centre for International Economics. In view of the modest scope of the actual agreement, it seems likely that these gains have been overestimated. Similar points apply in relation to investment. It appears that the threshold for Foreign Investment Review Board review will be raised, but this will have little direct impact since hardly any proposals are rejected. The main issue is the ‘standstill’ approach central to the agreement, which allows for the creation of new rights for investors in future, but makes it almost impossible to withdraw rights that have already been granted. Of more concern is the possibility that some future agreement will create a right of foreign investors to seek ‘review’ of decisions they allege to be discriminatory against them. This provision, embodied in North American Free Trade agreement and in the aborted Multilateral Agreement on Investment is said to be justified on ‘level playing field’ grounds, but actually produces discrimination in favour of foreign investors, since domestic enterprises have no comparable rights. Trade and Economic Integration: As the main proponent of the FTA, Alan Oxley of the pro-FTA lobby group, Austa, has noted, the use of the term ‘Free Trade Agreements’ is ‘ a misnomer in a world of lower tariffs’. Oxley writes, ‘The World Bank prefers to describe them as regional integration agreements. Free Market Arrangements would be an even more appropriate term’. In general, an integration agreement involves the adoption of common, or at least compatible, economic policies on a wide range of issues, including intellectual property, public ownership of infrastructure, and competition policy. Ultimately, integration is likely to extend the provision and financing of health care and education. However, ‘integration’ is a misleading term in the context of a bilateral agreement between Australia and the United States. Given the relative size of the two countries, and the fact that the United States has adopted a general strategy of seeking bilateral agreements on trade and other issues on a ‘pattern bargaining’ model, it is clear that any agreement will involve Australia adopting American institutions and not vice versa. This does not represent a difficulty for advocates of an FTA such as Austa. Austa publications indicate a strongly held belief that the economic and social institutions of the United States are superior to those of Australia, and that we will therefore benefit from an agreement which binds us to replace our existing institutions with those of the United States. The most direct effects relate to issues concerning intellectual property Intellectual property: Under the proposed FTA, Australia is required to adopt American policies on intellectual property, policies that are economically unsound even in the US context, and entirely adverse to Australian interests. Australia currently sets the term of copyright fixed at fifty years after the author’s death and publishers interested in making public-domain works accessible to the general public are increasingly taking advantage of this. By contrast, the United States has steadily extended copyright terms. The proposed FTA sets a minimum copyright term of 70 years, but sets no maximum. Many of the relevant issues arose in the case of Eldred vs Ashcroft, decided recently by the US Supreme Court. This case was a constitutional challenge to a recent Act of Congress which extended the term of copyright protection from fifty years after the death of the author to seventy years (ninety-five for corporations). The Copyright Term Extension Act is often referred to as the ‘Mickey Mouse Act’ because of the observation that the term of copyright is extended whenever the Disney copyright on Mickey is about to lapse. The constitutional challenge failed, but the case did elicit an unusual degree of interest from American economists, seventeen of whom submitted a brief to the Supreme Court opposing the Act. The list is striking not only because of the eminence of the signatories (five Nobel Prizes and more to come) but because it represents all shades of economic opinion from free-market luminaries like Buchanan, Coase and Friedman to interventionists like Akerlof and Arrow. The central theme of the economic critique is that copyrights and patents cannot be appropriately analysed in terms of the protection of ‘intellectual property’. Copyrights and patents are monopoly rights. It is necessary to strike a balance between the incentive to inventive and creative work provided by copyrights and patents and the economic costs of monopoly rights over ideas. Current US policy is excessively favorable to monopolies. This is also an area of concern in relation to future developments in the process of economic integration with the United States. The current agreement does not require Australia to match widely criticised US policies such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. However, given the strength of the entertainment industry and related lobbies in the United States, there can be little doubt that there will be continuing pressure for measures to enhance the monopoly rights of owners of intellectual property. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme: US demands for ‘reform’ of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are closely related to the issues of intellectual property. Pharmaceutical companies want the right to maximize returns on their intellectual property by dealing directly with consumers and setting monopoly prices, rather than, as at present, by negotiating with the Australian government. In the leadup to the FTA, the US Congress passed legislation requiring the Administration to report on ‘progress toward opening Australia’s drug pricing system’ (see Drug Industry Seeks to Sway Prices Overseas). The agreement included provisions allowing US drug companies an independent review of decisions by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which recommends inclusion or rejection This is a complex issue, since it is difficult to forecast the implications of changes to procedures that are already fairly opaque. The Australian government has asserted, in effect, that the concessions offered on the PBS are meaningless, and will have no effect of prices or on the cost of the scheme. By contrast, commentary in the US, from both supporters and opponents, suggests that the concessions were not substantial. Perhaps the clearest indication comes from the pharmaceutical lobby itself. Promoting the deal, Medicines Australia chief executive, Kieran Schneemann, said the deal and changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) would act as an incentive for American firms to invest in Australia, and suggested as much as $ 1 billion might be spent on research here. The idea that a purely procedural reform, with no real implications for prices and costs, would somehow generate $ 1 billion in investment, is absurd. If Schneeman’s estimate is remotely plausible, the FTA must involve a large increase in payments to US pharmaceutical companies. Looking ahead, it seems inconceivable that Medicare will be safe from attack under the provisions of an agreement. The private insurance lobby in Australia has opposed Medicare since its exception, and would be strengthened immeasurably by the much large and stronger US industry. The single-payer and bulk-billing provisions of Medicare, already under severe strain, could be rendered unworkable by legal challenges under an FTA. Modelling the FTA In the leadup to the FTA, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade commission to the Centre for International Economics to analyse the economic impacts of a likely agreement. The CIE reported benefits of around $ 4 billion, largely because of the benefits assumed to flow from improved access to the US sugar market. When the agreement was announced, with no improvement in access for sugar, the CIE prepared a new analysis (PDF file) which, surprisingly enough, showed even larger benefits. The loss of sugar access was more than offset by the inclusion of highly speculative assumptions about a reduction in the cost of capital. (The results of the modelling are in the chart in the attachment at the bottom of this page.) The big gains in the CIE’s picture come from two main sources. The first is so-called ‘dynamic gains’ from liberalisation. I’ve pointed out many times that such gains are little more than a pious belief held by advocates of free-market reform. They have no basis in neoclassical economic theory and no real supporting evidence. The report is gracious enough to cite my objections, but goes on to ignore them. The CIE’s second gain comes from the idea that capital market liberalisation will reduce the equity risk premium and therefore increase economic welfare. The difficulty is in the assumption that capital market liberalisation will reduce the equity premium and will have no offsetting adverse effects. The proposed changes are tiny by comparison with the floating of the dollar and the associated removal of exchange controls over the 1970 s and 1980 s, not to mention the associated domestic liberalisation. Yet there is no convincing evidence that these changes had any net effect on the risk premium for equity. Australian regulators who have to use a risk premium in estimating the cost of capital have looked at this issue repeatedly, and none has yet been willing to base decisions on the assumption that the risk premium for equity has declined recently, relative to the 20 th century as a whole. Then there’s the question of offsetting effects. The most important changes relax restrictions on takeovers. The analysis here is based on the assumption that such restrictions are necessarily harmful. Yet there’s ample evidence at every level to contradict. Faced with doubts of this kind, the Senate Committee of Inquiry commissioned an alternative analysis from Philippa Dee, currently at ANU and formerly with the Productivity Commission. Her analysis yielded much smaller estimates of net benefits from liberalisation of trade in goods and services. In addition, Dee included an estimate of the cost of increasing the term of copyright, which the CIE had put in the too-hard basket. But neither Dee nor the CIE assessed impacts on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Overall, Dee’s results suggested a net annual benefit of $ 50 million per year or, as Bob Brown put it, $ 2. 50 per Australian. Political aspects In political terms, the FTA debate was one of the most striking recent examples of defeat being snatched from the jaws of victory. Labor’s acceptance of the FTA was a comprehensive political defeat. In retrospect, it would have been better politics to approve the deal immediately. Moreover, if Labor was to keep its options open, it was necessary for senior figures, such as state premiers, to keep their mouths shut. Instead, Latham found himself presented with a fait accompli as the Labor premiers lined up behind Howard. Even after all this, it would have been better to withhold support and propose to renegotiate the deal after the US and Australian elections. Labor’s capitulation represented a decision to pursue the small target strategy that failed in 1998 and, even more dismally, in 2001. Not content with humiliating Labor, however, John Howard decided to raise the stakes, by rejecting a face-saving Labor amendment cutting off a minor loophole with respect to the PBS. The result was a twofold disaster for Howard. First, he was eventually forced to accept the Labor amendments verbatim despite his earlier claims that they could not possibly be drafted. Second, and more significantly, the debate over the amendments finally brought the core issues to the attention of the broad public. It has now become clear that, if interpreted in the spirit in which it was negotiated, the FTA would imply the destruction of the PBS. Australia’s only defence now is to insist on the narrowest possible reading of the terms of the agreement, and to invite the United States to take it or leave it.

Wi-Fi 2. 0 {{is expected to}} provide better performance and larger coverage than today's Wi-Fi, thanks to the good propagation characteristics of the legacy spectrum such as TV bands. Wi-Fi 2. 0 is modeled as a network consisting of an access point (called CR hotspot) and end-user terminals (CR devices) operated by a CR wireless service provider. In this article {{we focus on the}} economical perspective of Wi-Fi 2. 0 and discuss various aspects in profit management of Wi-Fi 2. 0 WSPs. In particular, we consider profit-maximizing optimal strategies in terms of customer admission/eviction control and inter-WSP market competition. We first show that Wi-Fi 2. 0 operates on time-varying spectrum availability due to the ON-OFF channel usage of legacy users, and advocate the necessity of customer eviction control upon appearance of legacy users. We also identify two types of WSP-WSP market competition in leasing the limited spectrum resources from the licensees and in enticing end customers with a competitive price. Then we enumerate the key factors affecting the profit of collocated WSPs, such as channel leasing cost, service <b>tariff,</b> QoS <b>provisioning,</b> and coexistence with legacy services. By examining Wi-Fi 2. 0 from an economic point of view, we show its commercial value in developing next-generation CR applications that benefit both legacy and CR users. close 41...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much debate about the {{possible}} negative effects of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) for food security in ACP signatories. This paper investigates whether the commitments undertaken by ACP governments when they signed EPAs are a threat to food security. Analysis of the tariff liberalisation schedules suggests that ACP states have made use of their flexibility to exempt many food staples from liberalisation. However, the EPA provisions on other border measures are more problematic. Although EPAs were intended to create a WTO-compatible system of trade preferences between the EU and ACP states, all of the EPAs require ACP signatories to make commitments which go beyond WTO disciplines. From a food security perspective, these commitments concern <b>tariff</b> standstill <b>provisions,</b> the ban on export restrictions and export taxes, limits {{on the size of}} the remedies available under the bilateral safeguard clause, and the failure to prohibit the use of export subsidies by the EU partner. The paper recommends that disciplines which potentially might limit the policy measures which ACP governments could take to improve food security, and which go beyond WTO-compatible provisions, should be removed either through renegotiating the existing interim agreements or when establishing full EPAs. However, it also warns that an excessive focus on trade policy has distracted attention from the more important question of the domestic initiatives that ACP governments take to ensure that agriculture can play its role as an engine of growth and poverty reduction. The potential of EPAs to improve food security can only be realised by a focus on greater agricultural investment and improved institutions.

50|$|Douglas Irwin’s 1998 paper {{examines}} {{the validity of}} the opposite tariff hypotheses posed by the Republicans and Democrats in 1890. Irwin looked at historical data to estimate import demand elasticities, and export supply elasticities for the US in the years before 1888. With this information, he calculated that tariffs had not reached the maximum revenue rate, and therefore a reduction, not an increase, in the tariff would have reduced revenue and the federal surplus. His findings confirmed the Democrats' hypothesis, and refuted the Republicans'. After examining the actual tariff revenue data, it appears that revenue did decrease by about four percent from $225 million to $215 million after the Tariff of 1890 increased rates. Irwin explains that {{this is due to the}} <b>Tariff</b> of 1890’s <b>provision</b> that raw sugar be moved to the duty-free list. Sugar, at this time, was the item that raised the most tariff revenue, so making it duty-free reduced this revenue. If sugar is excluded from import calculations, the tariff revenue increased by 7.8 percent from $170 million to $183 million.|$|R
