These targets consist of {{many different types of}} materials glued together including low density foams, plastics, and metals. To verify models, the physicists need to know the exact thickness of the targets and target components to [plus-minus] 1. 0 [mu]m. The target components are typically 3 - 5 mm in diameter and 200 - 300 [mu]m thick and may have features such as moguls or two-dimensional sine waves machined onto them.

Aluminum alloy 6061 widely used materials in aircraft, automobile and helicopter components is selected for this study. A full factorial design of experiment is carried out with five levels. Three different machining conditions: <b>machining</b> 2 mm <b>thickness,</b> <b>machining</b> 3 mm <b>thickness</b> and <b>machining</b> 4 mm <b>thickness</b> are considered.

Due to the high feed rates and small <b>thicknesses,</b> <b>machine</b> vision and other nondestructive evaluation techniques are used to ensure consistent, defect-free material by continuously assessing post-production quality. One {{of the fastest growing}} inspection areas is for 0. 5 - 500 micrometer thick thin films, which are used for semiconductor wafers, amorphous photovoltaics, optical films, plastics, and organic and inorganic membranes. As a demonstration application, a prototype roll-feed imaging system has been designed to inspect high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), used for fuel cells, after being die cast onto a moving transparent substrate. The inspection system continuously detects thin film defects and classifies them with a neural network into categories of holes, bubbles, thinning, and gels, with a 1. 2 % false alarm rate, 7. 1 % escape rate, and classification accuracy of 96. 1 %. In slot die casting processes, defect types are indicative of a misbalance in the mass flow rate and web speed; so, based on the classified defects, the inspection system informs the operator of corrective adjustments to these manufacturing parameters. Thickness uniformity is also critical to membrane functionality, so a real-time, full-field transmission densitometer has been created to measure the bi-directional thickness profile of the semi-transparent PEM between 25 - 400 micrometers. The local thickness of the 75 mm x 100 mm imaged area is determined by converting the optical density of the sample to thickness with the Beer-Lambert law. The PEM extinction coefficient is determined to be 1. 4 D/mm and the average thickness error is found to be 4. 7 %.
