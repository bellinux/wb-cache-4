5000|$|... "Aunt Maria", which {{features}} slide guitar from Martin Simpson, {{is about the}} titular Aunt meeting song collector Cecil Sharp. The song originated from Knightley's involvement in Cecil Sharp Project in January 2012, where he developed material with British and American musicians to celebrate Cecil Sharp’s Appalachian song gathering. The BBC said that [...] "Maria allows her song to be recorded and her history told, but is uneasy about the difference in class between herself and Sharp, and anxious that she shouldn’t {{be the only one}} to whom the collector <b>talks.</b> “There’s <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> folk like me, sir,” Knightly sings as Maria. “Why don’t you come and see, sir?”." [...] As with [...] "Katrina", the song features Leonard Podolak performing a 5-string banjo. Sykes interjects two verses from the traditional song [...] "Bonnie Light Horseman" [...] into the album's seventh song [...] "Coming Home", [...] "subtly complicating the otherwise simple tale of a family’s bad seed." [...] The song is a [...] "telling snapshot of the Afghan war campaign." [...] "Reunion Hill" [...] is about a Civil War window, and is a cover of Richard Shindell's Prairie ballad. [...] "No Man's Land" [...] is a [...] "sparsely-scored genuine-angst-ridden slow-burner" [...] dedicated to the late Jackie Leven.|$|R
5000|$|On December 1, 2007, Salters was {{covering}} the Big 12 Championship Game at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. In {{one of her}} sideline reports {{during the first half}} she mentioned Missouri quarterback Chase Daniel's frustration due to Missouri being stymied by the Oklahoma defense, saying Daniel was [...] "upset" [...] and [...] "fuming." [...] However, a technical blunder caused Salters' microphone to be broadcast over the stadium's PA system. The camera shifted to Chase Daniel, who was visibly perplexed and curious as to who was talking about him and why it was being heard throughout the entire stadium. ABC TV announcer Brent Musburger then mused, [...] "Lisa was <b>talking</b> to a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> folks than she anticipated." [...] The likely explanation was that Salters' mic was to have been hooked up to the PA for the upcoming halftime contest, and her mic was inadvertently left on the PA after a pregame sound check.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2007, Blagojevich {{campaign}} boss Christopher G. Kelly {{was indicted}} on federal charges of tax fraud. The charges against Kelly were {{not related to}} the governor or any political work. However, Kelly has been listed as a [...] "co-schemer" [...] in court filings related to the Rezko case. According to prosecutors, Kelly was involved in pressuring prospective state contractors for [...] "finder's fees" [...] or political contributions. [...] At the time of Rezko's indictment, Blagojevich described his relationship with Kelly: [...] "They're two different people, by the way, and it's a different relationship. Chris and I are much closer. Chris is the head of my political campaign. That's someone I <b>talk</b> to a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> frequently." [...] In January, 2009, Kelly, pleaded guilty to the tax charges, and in June, at 50, was sentenced to 37 months in prison, fined $7,500, and ordered to pay more than $600,000 in restitution. He was allowed to stay free on bail pending a September trial [...] "in which he is charged with paying an unnamed consultant $450,000 in kickbacks to get $8.5 million in inflated roofing contracts from two airlines at O'Hare International Airport," [...] according to a report. Prosecutors hoped that Kelly would yet testify on the workings of the Blagojevich administration.|$|R
5000|$|... "We <b>talk</b> a <b>lot</b> {{about not}} drawing fans. At {{the same time}} {{most of the players}} are still telling the fans they'll be fined $50 if they sign any autographs. If some of the guys spent as much time signing autographs as they do shooing kids we'd have a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> friends around here. Chief kid-shooer is O'Donoghue. He enjoys the work. One of these days he's going to make another Frank Crosetti." [...] — Jim Bouton in Ball Four (August 22, 1969) ...|$|R
2500|$|His debut single, [...] "Should've Been a Cowboy", went {{to number}} 1 [...] on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in 1993, in {{addition}} to reaching number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100. This song led off his self-titled debut album. By {{the end of the}} decade, [...] "Should've Been a Cowboy" [...] received more than three million spins at radio, thus making it the most-played country song of the 1990s. Certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies, the album produced three more top 5 hits on the country charts: [...] "He Ain't Worth Missing" [...] at number 5, followed by [...] "A Little Less <b>Talk</b> and a <b>Lot</b> <b>More</b> Action" [...] (originally the B-side of [...] "Should've Been a Cowboy") and [...] "Wish I Didn't Know Now" [...] both at number 2. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote of the album, [...] "It is given a production that's a bit too big, clean, glossy and cavernous for Keith's good — it fits the outsized sound of early-'90s radio, but not his outsized talent — but beneath that sheen the songs are very strong." [...] He also thought that it showed the signs of the style that Keith would develop on subsequent albums The album's success led to Keith touring with then-labelmates Shania Twain and John Brannen.|$|R
5000|$|... "A <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> mature. A <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> focused. We {{just had}} a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> {{time to spend with}} it. Working with Butch Walker in the studio just made us a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> efficient, and we could move a lot faster. We wrote a lot of songs for this record. I think we just pushed better songs further along then {{we had a chance to}} with Animosity." ...|$|R
2500|$|Beyond the macroscopic, Turner has {{admitted}} that this album is more personal than previous releases. “This record is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> organic [...] to me. It indeed is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> {{focused in a}} way that it is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> coherent than Oceanic was. I do feel that it has a wider emotional feel because it is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> personal stuff of myself behind it in the content. I don't really know how this comes across in the music. There is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> things in it that I was dealing with while writing the record and since, let's say Celestial for instance. It's hard to say actually.” ...|$|R
