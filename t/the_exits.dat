40|$|Abstract. Safety {{evacuation}} {{design is}} a key content for building fire safety design. In this paper, we apply the CAFE model to conduct an one-exit room simulation. And then we establish the regression equation of exit flow rate considering the factors of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> width, <b>the</b> size of the room, the location of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> and <b>the</b> pedestrian density. So as to find the effect of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location on <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate, we analyze the correlation of the two variables. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate of large room is easily affected by <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location. And it proves that <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate decreases {{with the increase of}} <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> location. At last we study the probability distribution of the number of pedestrians evacuating through <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> and list some reasons why <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> flow rate decreases with <b>the</b> increasing <b>exit</b> width...|$|R
50|$|Although I-345 {{uses its}} own mileposts, <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> {{numbering}} is not consistent. <b>The</b> <b>exit</b> numbers on <b>the</b> northbound stretch count upwards from the I-45 numbers (<b>the</b> <b>exit</b> for Spur 366 being labeled as exit 286A), {{while on the}} southbound stretch <b>the</b> Spur 366 <b>exit</b> is numbered exit 1A, followed by <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> for Ross Avenue numbered exit 285.|$|R
25|$|Of {{particular}} interest in the investigation is the design of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> itself. Several factors played a possible role, {{including the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> was an atypical left exit; inadequate advance notice was given of this setup; <b>the</b> HOV <b>exit</b> was signed differently than standard exits; the arrow on <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> sign misled drivers about where the HOV lane continued; and <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> ramp itself had poor signage.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{infantry}} {{landing in the}} second wave, supporting arms began to arrive, meeting the same chaos and destruction as had the rifle companies. Combat engineers, tasked with clearing <b>the</b> <b>exits</b> and marking beaches, landed off-target and without their equipment.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, during torrential rain {{all over}} Pakistan, {{water from a}} nearby nullah entered the mine, {{reaching}} a depth of two feet (60cm) and blocking <b>the</b> <b>exits,</b> after which the mine was closed.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to <b>the</b> <b>exits</b> {{were also}} cleared, with minefields lifted and holes blown in the {{embankment}} {{to permit the}} passage of vehicles. As the tide receded, engineers were also able to resume their work of clearing the beach obstacles, {{and by the end}} of the evening, 13 gaps were opened and marked.|$|E
50|$|Exits {{are well}} indicated, with signs {{far ahead of}} exits. There are {{frequent}} signs that announce <b>the</b> next three <b>exits.</b> At each exit, there is a sign with the distance to <b>the</b> next <b>exit.</b> Exit signs are also posted 3000 m, 2000 m, 1000 m, and 500 m ahead of <b>the</b> <b>exit,</b> immediately before <b>the</b> <b>exit,</b> and at <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> itself.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> {{times from}} an interval {{for a general}} one-dimensional time-homogeneous diffusion process and their applications to the dividend problem in risk theory. Specifically, we first use Dynkin’s formula to derive the ordinary differential equations satisfied by the Laplace transform of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> times. Then, as some examples, we solve the closed-form expression of the Laplace transform of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> times for several popular diffusions, which are commonly used in modelling of finance and insurance market. Most interestingly, as the applications of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> times, we create the connect between the dividend value function and the Laplace transform of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> times. Both <b>the</b> barrier and threshold dividend value function are clearly {{expressed in terms of}} the Laplace transform of <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> times...|$|R
5|$|A {{segment of}} I-94 in Battle Creek between <b>the</b> <b>exits</b> for Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) and I-194 {{was named the}} 94th Combat Infantry Division Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature in 2002. The name honors the US Army's 94th Infantry Division, which was {{activated}} at the nearby Fort Custer in 1942 and served with distinction in the European theatre of World War II. Because the unit originated in Battle Creek, and its number matched that of the freeway, the Legislature added the designation by passing Public Act305 of 2002. The name was dedicated in ceremonies at a rest stop along the section of I-94 on September 28, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover <b>the</b> <b>exits</b> of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, the Persians made {{their way down the}} coast towards Attica. The Persians dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off on the island of Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked <b>the</b> <b>exits</b> from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E
5000|$|Another hazard {{in the use}} of {{overwing}} exits is {{them being}} improperly opened (usually a result of passengers in these seats not paying attention to the verbal briefing provided pre-departure, or not observing the opening instructions on the safety card and on <b>the</b> <b>exit).</b> <b>The</b> majority of overwing <b>exits</b> involve <b>the</b> passenger physically removing the hatch from its frame and disposing of it outside on the wing without blocking <b>the</b> <b>exit.</b> Research conducted at the Cranfield Institute in the UK [...] showed that many passengers are prone to leaving <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> hatch on <b>the</b> seat next to <b>the</b> <b>exit,</b> thereby hindering other passengers' egress through <b>the</b> <b>exit.</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>EXIT</b> chart has two useful {{properties}} {{as shown}} in [7]. One is the necessary condition for the convergence of iterative decoding that <b>the</b> flipped <b>EXIT</b> chart curve of the outer decoder for iterations lies below <b>the</b> <b>EXIT</b> chart curve of the inner coder. The other is that the area under <b>the</b> <b>EXIT</b> curve of outer code relates to the rate of inner coder. In [8], the authors demonstrated that if the priori channel is an erasure channel, for any outer code of rate R, the area under <b>the</b> <b>EXIT</b> curve is 1 −R. To our best knowledge, the area property of <b>the</b> <b>EXIT</b> chart has been proved only for cases where the priori channels are erasure channels.|$|R
5|$|Authorities {{received}} the first distress {{call from a}} person who escaped from the restaurant at 12:38pm, and the first police car reached the building at 12:47pm. The policemen were armed with the standard equipment for Czech police officers: holstered pistols (mostly with variants of CZ75 that was also used by Kovář), body armor, and a select-fire rifle stored in car. The first two officers to arrive immediately entered the building with body armor on and guns drawn. , taking cover behind a bar opposite to the door, opened fire on the officers {{as soon as they}} entered. The police noted people lying on the ground and sitting on chairs between them and the shooter. Not knowing the status of the civilians, the police decided not to return fire, covered <b>the</b> <b>exits,</b> and waited for the arrival of a tactical unit. By this time, other police units as well as the first ambulance car had arrived, taking away the wounded female victim who had escaped.|$|E
