5|$|A more {{recently}} developed batch production method, the FFC Cambridge process, consumes titanium dioxide powder (a refined form of rutile) as feedstock and produces titanium metal, either powder or sponge. The process involves fewer steps than the Kroll process and <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> time. If mixed oxide powders are used, {{the product is}} an alloy.|$|E
5|$|There are {{thousands}} of uses of various potassium compounds. One example is potassium superoxide, , an orange solid {{that acts as a}} portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber. It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> volume than the gaseous oxygen.|$|E

5|$|An {{advantage}} held by Eurostar is {{the convenience}} {{and speed of}} the service: with shorter check-in times than at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing and high punctuality, it <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than it does by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market. In 2007, it achieved record market shares of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.|$|E
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E

5|$|York {{has been}} a major railway centre since the first line arrived in 1839 at the {{beginning}} of the railway age. For many years the city hosted the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway. York railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line from London to Newcastle and Edinburgh. It <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> than two hours to get to York from London by rail, with at least 25 direct trains each weekday. The station is also served by long distance trains on CrossCountry services linking Edinburgh and Newcastle with destinations in south and west England via Birmingham. TransPennine Express provide a frequent service of semi-fast trains linking York to Newcastle, Scarborough, Leeds, Manchester, Manchester Airport, and Liverpool. Local stopping services by Northern connect York to Selby, Harrogate, Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and many intermediate points, as well as many other stations across Greater Manchester and Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts. Each character has different traits and advantages. The eight characters consist of: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker. The Locksmith can open doors {{twice as fast as}} the other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies who are not in the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which runs around collecting coins; the Mole can dig holes through walls and <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> time to open vents; the Gentleman has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the Redhead can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to security systems, resulting in them shutting off temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E

25|$|The {{couscous}} that {{is sold in}} most Western supermarkets {{has been}} pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous then leaving covered tightly for about five minutes.

25|$|The {{time taken}} for food or other {{ingested}} objects to transit through the gastrointestinal tract {{varies depending on}} many factors, but roughly, it <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> than an hour after a meal for 50% of stomach contents to empty into the intestines while total emptying takes around 2 hours. Subsequently, 50% emptying of the small intestine takes between 1 and 2 hours. Finally, transit through the colon takes 12 to 50 hours with wide variation between individuals.|$|E
25|$|Lipomas are {{normally}} removed by simple excision. The removal {{can often be}} done under local anaesthetic, and <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> than 30 minutes. This cures {{the great majority of}} cases, with about 1–2% of lipomas recurring after excision. Liposuction is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small connective tissue component. Liposuction typically results in less scarring; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to regrowth.|$|E
25|$|When managed {{according}} to the standards, policies and procedures developed by the CSIRO, lambs are normally mulesed {{a few weeks after}} birth. The operation usually <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> than a minute. Standard practice is to do this operation simultaneously with other procedures such as ear marking, tail docking, and vaccination. Because the procedure removes skin, not any underlying flesh or structure, there is little blood loss from the cut other than a minor oozing on the edges of the cut skin.|$|E

25|$|In busy washrooms, urinals are {{installed}} for efficiency: compared with urination in a general-purpose toilet, usage is faster because within the room {{there are no}} additional doors, no locks, and no seat to turn up; also a urinal <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> space, is simpler, and consumes less water per flush (or even no water at all) than a flush toilet. Urinals may also come in different heights, to accommodate tall and short users, men or boys. There are often privacy barriers between the urinals.|$|E
25|$|Babies feed {{differently}} {{with artificial}} nipples {{than from a}} breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. Drinking from a bottle <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> effort and the milk may come more rapidly, potentially causing the baby to lose desire for the breast. This is called nursing strike, nipple strike or nipple confusion. To avoid this, expressed milk can be given by means such as spoons or cups.|$|E
25|$|The digital {{fire control}} system automates the {{complete}} projectile loading process and gun laying operation. An ammunition inventory management system {{keeps track of}} all onboard ammunition as well as ammunition expenditure during firing. The weapon is laid to the target using an automatic fire control system, which includes an onboard positioning and navigation system. This can receive target information from the battery or regimental command post. It <b>takes</b> <b>less</b> than 60 seconds to come into action and open fire and 40 seconds to re-deploy.|$|E
