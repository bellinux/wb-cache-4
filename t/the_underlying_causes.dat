5|$|Cases of {{epilepsy}} may {{be organized}} into epilepsy syndromes by the specific {{features that are}} present. These features include the age that seizure begin, the seizure types, EEG findings, among others.

5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials {{in the areas of}} sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{targeted}} to <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b> However, most vasculitis {{in general are}} treated with steroids (e.g. methylprednisolone) because <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of <b>the</b> vasculitis is due to hyperactive immunological damage. Immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine may also be given.|$|R
40|$|Injury {{related to}} a death may be {{recorded}} on the death certificate as <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death or as a condition associated with death but not causing it The present study uses the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death data for 1978 to determine the percentage of injury-related deaths for which injury was identified as <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death and the variation of this percentage with age at death. Injury was identified as <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death in 86 % of all cases with injury recorded on the death certificate. The percentage with injury identified as <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> varied with age: 93 % {{for those in the}} first year of life, 97 % for those aged 1 - 44 years, 87 % for those aged 55 - 64, and 50 % for those aged 75 or older. The percentage with injury identified as <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> also varied by cause of injury. In all age groups, assault, suicide, and motor vehicle accidents were identified as <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of death in more than 90 % of the cases in which they were mentioned. Causes other than motor vehicle accidents, assaults, and suicides, especially when occurring in the elderly, were less likely to be identified as the underlyin...|$|R

5|$|This {{classification}} {{was widely}} accepted but {{has also been}} criticized mainly because <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of epilepsy (which are {{a major determinant of}} clinical course and prognosis) were not covered in detail. In 2010 the ILAE Commission for Classification of the Epilepsies addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into three categories (genetic, structural/metabolic, unknown cause) that were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent technologic and scientific advances.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes.</b> When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E

5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E

25|$|Denouncing {{the concept}} of saviors, spiritual leaders, and any other {{intermediaries}} to reality, Krishnamurti {{stressed the need for}} a revolution in the psyche of every human being.

He urged people to directly discover <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of the problems facing individuals and society, and stated that such discovery is the natural outcome of absolute and unconditional psychological freedom, which he declared as being within everyone's reach.|$|E
25|$|Trait {{models have}} been criticized as being purely {{descriptive}} and offering little explanation of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of personality. Eysenck's theory, however, proposes biological mechanisms as driving traits, and modern behavior genetics researchers have shown a clear genetic substrate to them. Another potential weakness of trait theories is that they may lead some people to accept oversimplified classifications—or worse, offer advice—based on a superficial analysis of personality. Finally, trait models often underestimate the effect of specific situations on people's behavior. Traits {{are considered to be}} statistical generalizations that do not always correspond to an individual's behavior.|$|E

25|$|Although many of peacebuilding's aims {{overlap with}} those of peacemaking, {{peacekeeping}} and conflict resolution, it is a distinct idea. Peacemaking involves stopping an ongoing conflict, whereas peacebuilding happens before a conflict starts or once it ends. Peacekeeping prevents the resumption of fighting following a conflict; it does not address <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> of violence or work to create societal change, as peacebuiding does. It also differs from peacebuilding in that it only occurs after conflict ends, not before it begins. Conflict resolution does not include some components of peacebuilding, such as state building and socioeconomic development.|$|E
25|$|Hahnemann {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> {{of disease}} were phenomena that he termed miasms, and that homeopathic preparations addressed these. The preparations are manufactured using {{a process of}} homeopathic dilution, in which a chosen substance is repeatedly diluted in alcohol or distilled water, each time with the containing vessel being bashed against an elastic material, commonly a leather-bound book. Dilution typically continues well past the point where no molecules of the original substance remain.
