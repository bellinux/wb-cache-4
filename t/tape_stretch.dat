PRV {{characteristically}} travels along chains of synaptically connected neurons and has been used extensively for elucidating neural circuits in the peripheral and central nervous system in vivo. The recombinant virus PRV 369 is an attenuated retrograde tracer that encodes G-CaMP 2, a fluorescent calcium sensor protein that is stable at physiological pH and mammalian temperature. This protocol describes the use of PRV 369 to express G-CaMP 2 in a neuronal circuit and to monitor its activity in a living animal, specifically in the submandibular ganglia (SMG), the peripheral parasympathetic ganglia that innervate the salivary glands. The procedure describes the delivery of PRV 369 to the glands and shows how SMG neurons can then be imaged post-inoculation to explore connectivity and activity. ### RELATED INFORMATION Additional information {{on the use of}} PRVs for tracing neural circuitry in vivo is described in Song et al. (2005). Specific information on the recombinant PRV 369 is available in Granstedt et al. (2009). Background on the properties and uses of G-CaMP 2 is also available (Nakai et al. 2001; Ohkura et al. 2005; Tallini et al. 2006; Hoogland et al. 2009). PRV has a broad host range, infecting almost all mammals and some avian embryos (except higher primates including humans). Therefore, this technology is expected to work in any species susceptible to PRV infection. For an example of an SMG infected by PRV 369 and spontaneous calcium transients imaged with two-photon microscopy, see Figure 1. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Example of an SMG infected by PRV 369. Spontaneous calcium transients were imaged with two-photon microscopy 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi). Scale bar = 20 μm. ΔF/F: relative fluorescence change. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1.

Anesthetize the animal by injecting intraperitoneally with 16 μL ketamine/xylazine per gram of body weight. - *Wait until the animal is anesthetized by checking paw-pinch withdrawal and corneal reflexes before continuing*. - Lay the animal on its back on a piece of cardboard. Immobilize the limbs with <b>tape.</b> <b>Stretch</b> back the nose by securing a rubber band across the mouth. - Monitor the animal during the entire surgical procedure and test the depth of anesthesia regularly (e. g., by controlling respiratory rate and paw-pinch withdrawal reflex). - Using an alcohol swab, wet the neck area {{from the base of the}} chin to just above the ribcage. - Use a razor blade to shave away the hair, exposing the skin. - Use cotton-tipped applicators to apply disinfectant solution/surgical scrub to the shaved area. Finish by swabbing with 70 % ethanol. - Grasp the skin with forceps. Use a sterile scalpel to make a shallow incision ~ 1. 5 -cm long from the ribcage to the chin. - Gently detach the glands from the skin using tissue separator scissors. - The salivary glands are located immediately below the skin, and adhere to it via layers of connective tissue. - Rinse the Hamilton syringe with DPBS before drawing up PRV inoculum. - Using the Hamilton syringe, inject 5 μL of the PRV 369 into each side of the salivary glands: - i. Inject PRV into one side of the salivary gland by making two to three separate injections in the center. - ii. Keep the syringe in place for ~ 10 sec at each injection site. - iii. Repeat with the other side. - Injecting in both the left and right glands doubles the chance of finding infected cells and reduces the number of animals used. - Close the incision with silk sutures. Apply disinfectant solution to the sutured area. - For post-operative analgesia, inject 5 μL of the diluted buprenorphine per gram of body weight intraperitoneally. - Keep the mouse on a heating blanket at 37 °C until it recovers. Put the animal in a new cage by itself. **In Vivo Imaging of Fluorescent Indicator in SMG Neurons** 13. At the desired time post-inoculation, anesthetize the animal for ~ 10 min in an isoflurane chamber using 2 % isoflurane. 14. Place the animal on its back on the imaging stage. Position the animal’s nose in the isoflurane cone. Tape down all limbs. 15. Insert the rectal temperature probe. Turn on the heating blanket to keep the animal’s temperature at 37 °C. 16. Under a dissection microscope, use stitch scissors to remove the sutures. 17. Use tissue-separator scissors to separate the glands from the skin. With the aid of retractors, pull open the skin to better expose the glands. - *Healthy glands have lobules and appear pinkish gray. It is rare to detect any damage in the glands from the first surgery. Even if some inflammation occurs in the glands, it does not affect imaging in the submandibular neurons*. 18. Using fine forceps to cut connective tissue, locate the SMG anterior to one of the salivary glands. - *The SMGs are located along the salivary duct and surrounded by connective tissue. They appear as small translucent beads. Healthy ganglia should have detectable capillaries with blood flow*. 19. Lift the ganglion onto a small metal platform that is controlled by a micromanipulator. - *Apply some tension so that the ganglion stays in place*. 20. Move the stage from the dissection microscope to an upright imaging microscope. Perfuse the area with warm mammalian Ringer’s solution. 21. Image calcium transients with a one-photon wavelength of 480 nm (or two-photon excitation at 920 nm) and with a 500 - to 550 -nm bandpass emission filter. - *Labeled cells will have dim background fluorescence that fills the soma compared with nonlabeled cells. Transients are bright and can be seen in the raw movies. See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Fluorescence intensity of infected cells is low. **[Step 21]** - **Solution**: The fluorescence quantum efficiency of G-CaMP 2 is only in the range of wild-type green fluorescent protein (GFP) at typical intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations. As a result, infected cells might be hard to find because they are only slightly brighter than autofluorescent cells. Because excessive excitation leads to bleaching, take averaged images without increasing excitation intensity. Search for cells that are brighter than the average cell. Typical calcium signals in vivo increase the intensity by 40 % and last longer than a second, making them easily detectable. Note that bleaching accelerates when calcium (and therefore fluorescence) is elevated. ### DISCUSSION PRV 369 provides the capability to reliably detect neuronal activity by expression of a fluorescent calcium indicator protein in intact circuits in living animals. It is isogenic with PRV Bartha strains encoding GFP (PRV 152; Smith et al. 2000) and red fluorescent protein (PRV 614; Banfield et al. 2003), two of the most frequently used PRV-based viral circuit tracers. PRV 369 should therefore be useful in circuits previously elucidated by these tracers. The endogenous activity of PRV 369 -labeled neurons can be monitored early on with minimal effects caused by infection. However, at later time points in infection, the number of infected cells and calcium transient frequency increases significantly, perhaps indicating cell and tissue responses to infection (Granstedt et al. 2009). The described approach for labeling and monitoring activity in the SMGs can be generalized to other circuits. Although not all types of circuits have been explored with PRV, to our knowledge PRV has labeled every circuit tested. However, for each circuit the precise time window for reliable imaging must be determined empirically by measuring the time course of infection spread through the circuit. It is best to image cells that are infected early rather than late. Many factors influence the time when optimal imaging can be done. Critical variables include the injection site, infection dose, viral strain, and animal species (Card 1998). When performing intraparenchymal injections of PRV, the injection pressure is an additional important factor. The PRV virion has a diameter of ~ 200 nm and the width of undisturbed extracellular space in the brain is in the 40 - 60 nm range (Thorne and Nicholson 2006). When injected at a low rate (1 nL/min), PRV virions remain highly localized at the site of injection. With increasing pressure, the extracellular space widens, increasing the volume, which in turn leads to more dispersed inoculum and more widespread infection. The time when cell bodies become infected after injection can be estimated using some basic parameters: the number of serial synapses that must be crossed from the point of inoculation to the desired area for imaging, the time to replicate and package PRV, and the distance over which virus must be transported. In cultured neurons, PRV replication and packaging reaches a maximum by ~ 10 h and virions move in the retrograde direction at ~ 1 μm/sec, or 3600 μm/h (Smith et al. 2001). With these assumptions, an approximate formula for how long to wait after inoculation is: Wait time in hours = [10 × (number of synapses to cross) ] + [(total transport distance over dendrites and axons in μm) / 3600]. Because SMG neurons are difficult to impale for intracellular recordings, PRV 369 is valuable for allowing characterization of neuronal activity in a circuit that is otherwise difficult to access by conventional recording methods. Another advantage is the relatively fast calcium-dependent kinetics of G-CaMP 2 compared to other indicator proteins, allowing better separation of successive signals in time. In the future, the advent of improved versions of G-CaMP (i. e., G-CaMP 3, G-CaMP 4) should lead to improvements in signal-to-noise ratio. Alternative calcium-sensor PRV strains such as As 1 -PRV 08 (Boldogkoi et al. 2009) can also be used with the described protocol after determination of virus-specific characteristics (e. g., time point of experiment after inoculation) and of indicator-specific parameters (e. g., excitation wavelength, filters). In summary, this protocol allows for reliable and sensitive detection of endogenous circuit activity at single cell resolution and early in infection after inoculation with the circuit-tracing PRV 369. ### REFERENCES 1.

Clinical decisions can depend on serial changes in the measurement. Head circumference is also widely used as a variable in research. Apart from studies in neonates, 1 {{few studies have examined}} the accuracy of measurement. In recent years in the UK the Lasso-o tape has been marketed specifically for head circumference measurement. Anecdotal evidence from clinics and ward rounds highlighted that older Lasso-o tapes, some of which were in bad condition, appeared to be of different lengths and were more easily stretched. Currently there are no guidelines on when to replace the tapes. We therefore wished to assess whether the Lasso-o tape is still an accurate measuring tool after multiple use and to apply measures of intra- and inter-observer variability and reproducibility of head circumference measurement using the Lasso-o tape...|$|R

40|$|Background: Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a painful}} condition caused by microtrauma to plantar fascia due to overuse. It {{is a most}} common cause of heel pain in runners. Various studies proved taping and Iontophoresis as effective in the treating plantar fasciitis. But there are no studies comparing the combined effect of iontophoresis with taping and taping alone in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Methods: 50 patients suffering from plantar fasciitis who met the inclusion criteria were selected. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups i. e. Group A and Group B. Group A received taping, iontophoresis with plantar fascia stretching. Group B received taping and plantar fascia stretching. A total of 6 treatment sessions were given on alternate days over a period of two weeks for both the groups. Results: VAS and FFI scores across baseline and post intervention showed a significant improvement statistically in their mean scores between Groups A and B (P< 0. 05). Between group comparison of VAS and FFI scores, it showed that subject treated with Iontophoresis in combination with taping and plantar fascia stretch (Group A) had significant improvement in VAS and functional ability when compared to subjects treated with taping and plantar fascia stretching alone (Group B). Conclusion: Iontophoresis along with Taping and plantar fascia stretching gave an additional benefit when compared with Taping and plantar fascia stretching alone in reducing pain and improving function in plantar fasciitis.

40|$|Estimating Percent Residue Cover Using the Line-Transect Method The line-transect {{method is}} one of the easiest method to use in the field to {{determine}} the percent residue cover on the surface. Accurate measurement is necessary to determine if enough cover is present to comply with the conservation plan. The following is a step-by-step procedure for using the line-transect method to measure the percentage of residue cover. Step 1 Use a 100 -foot or 50 -foot measuring tape for measuring residue cover. Other measuring length or even knotted ropes can be used if the appropriate multiplication factor is used to calculate the percentage. Step 2 Select an area that is representative of the whole field. Avoid end rows or small areas of the field that have been adversely affected by flooding, drought, weed or insect infestation, or other factors which have substantially reduced yields. The most accurate reading of residue cover can be obtained by taking an average from at least three different representative locations in the field. · Step 3 Anchor one end of the <b>tape</b> and <b>stretch</b> it diagonally across the rows so that it crosses several passes of the farming implements used. Readings are more accurate when the <b>tape</b> is <b>stretched</b> diagonally across the rows than when taken in a windrow of residue left by the combine or in an area where residue amounts are less. Step 4 Measure the residue cover by counting the number of foot marks that are directly over a piece of residue as shown below. For the reading to be accurate, • do not move the tape while counting • look at {{the same side of the}} tape at each foot mark • look straight down at the tape and the foot mark • count only those foot marks that have residue directly under the...|$|R

Dave Kean, an expert Mellotron repairer, recommends that older Mellotrons should not be immediately used after a period of inactivity, as the tape heads can become magnetised in storage and destroy the recordings on them if played.|$|R

40|$|The {{mainstay}} of patellofemoral pain (PFP) treatment is exercise therapy, often {{in combination with}} adjunct treatments such as patient education, orthoses, patella <b>taping</b> and <b>stretching,</b> making the intervention multimodal in nature. The vast majority of randomised controlled trials among patients with PFP have investigated the effect of treatment among adults (> 18 years of age). So, while systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide evidence-based recommendations for treating PFP, these recommendations are largely based upon the trials in adults. In the present article, we have summarised the findings on the efficacy of multimodal treatment (predominantly exercise) from the three largest trials concerning patients with PFP, focusing on the long-term success-rate 1 year after receiving multimodal treatment, and with a particular focus on the success rate across the different age groups, including both adolescents, young adults and adults. The results of this paper show that {{there appears to be}} a difference in the success rate between adolescents and adults, despite providing similar exercise treatment and having similar exercise compliance. While PFP may present in a similar fashion in adolescence and adults, it may not be the same underlying condition or stage, and different treatments may be required. Collectively, this highlights the importance of increasing our understanding of the underlying pathology, pain mechanisms and why treatment may—or may not—work in adolescents and adults with PFP...|$|R

30|$|A {{vertical}} incision {{is made in}} {{the vault}} with the cranial end of the incision 2 cm inferior to the hysterectomy incision scar. The incision is positioned 2 cm inferior to avoid potential damage to the ureters. The incision is opened further, and the rectocoele, if present, is dissected out and reduced. The IVS Tunneller (Tyco Healthcare USA) is used to place a polypropylene tape as an inverted “U” around the rectum and attach it behind the posterior vaginal wall. Bilateral incisions of 0.5  cm are made on the perineal skin at 4 o’clock and 8 o’clock 2 cm below and lateral to the external anal sphincter. The tunneller is initially inserted subdermally to the 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions to prevent the tape from slipping through the levator ani muscle. The tip of the tunneller is elevated and inserted into the ischiorectal fossa and through the rectovaginal fascia and into the vaginal incision. The tip of the tunnelling device is guided by a finger positioned in the vaginal incision. Vaginal and rectal examinations are performed before and after the insertion to ensure correct placement of the tape and to exclude damage to the rectum. The procedure is repeated on the other side. The apical portion of the tape is anchored to each corner of the vault at the estimated insertion site of the uterosacral ligament. The rectovaginal fascia and the perineal body are reconstituted and the vaginal incision closed. The <b>tape</b> is gently <b>stretched</b> and the excess trimmed. The perineal skin incisions are sutured without suturing the tape.|$|R
