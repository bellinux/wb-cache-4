5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts {{to convince the}} Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain {{the basis for the}} modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this discovery, the {{condition}} became known as trisomy21. Even before the discovery of its cause, the presence of the syndrome in all races, its association with older maternal age, and its rarity of recurrence had been noticed. Medical texts had assumed it was caused by a combination of inheritable factors <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> identified. Other theories had focused on injuries sustained during birth.|$|E
5|$|Coffelt's {{account was}} {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E

5|$|Kneale {{credited}} {{the director}} Rudolph Cartier with {{bringing to the}} screen in Quatermass II, with its ambitious location filming, an expansive style <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> seen in British television drama beforehand. Cartier worked with Kneale again on the third Quatermass serial, Quatermass and the Pit, in 1958, and had subsequent successes with plays such as Anna Karenina (1961), Cross of Iron (1961) and Lee Oswald — Assassin (1966). He continued directing for television until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The film {{plays out}} with a {{recapitulation}} of a mock Kazakhstan national anthem glorifying the country's potassium resources and its prostitutes as being the second cleanest in the region. The visual melange of Soviet-era photos are mixed with the real flag of Kazakhstan and, incongruously, the final frames show the portrait of Ilham Aliyev, real-life president of Azerbaijan, a country <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> otherwise mentioned in the film.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} strong and {{damaging}} aftershocks persisted for about three-and-a-half months. The {{largest in the}} sequence came on May 8. The event caused additional destruction to the northeast of the initial meizoseismal area. Qatur, which had been nearly destroyed by the mainshock, took another serious hit. Other villages (Chaliyan, Givaran, Mir 'Umar, and Ravyan) also experienced major destruction. Shikaryazi was a village in the southeast region <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> seriously affected by the mainshock, but experienced heavy damage during the May 8 event. This shock resulted in four additional deaths.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of 9mm ammunition for the Owen Guns was discovered, apparently because the ammunition {{was in the}} LST <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> completely unloaded. An emergency airdrop was requested at 10:30. In Port Moresby, the 1st Air Maintenance Company prepared 30 parachutes, each attached to two boxes containing 2,560 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a total of 153,600 rounds. This was loaded onto three USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers at Wards Airfield that took off at 16:55. They arrived over the Finschhafen area after dark at 19:15, where a drop zone in a Kunai patch was marked by men holding hand torches. Of the 115,000 rounds that were dropped, about 112,000 were recovered.|$|E

5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|After its release, The Complete Studio Albums (1983–2008) {{received}} mixed reception from reviewers, who complimented {{the overall}} packaging {{of the box}} set, but hoped that the record label would have included Madonna's other popular songs <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> on the original studio albums. The box set charted in multiple nations including Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. It entered the top-ten of the Japanese Oricon album chart. The same week, MDNA was also present in the top-ten, making Madonna the first female artist from a Western country to have two albums in the chart's top-ten.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E

5|$|Development of Shiny Festa {{began as}} a result of series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami's desire to create a video game that has a lighter feel and makes use of the franchise's songs <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> featured in video game form. Shiny Festa original releases sold a total of 119,132 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and together ranked as the best-selling video game in Japan that week. The games were described by reviewers as accessible to the franchise's new and existing fans, but the iOS releases were criticized by journalists for their prohibitive pricing. The mechanics of Shiny Festa later reappear in The Idolmaster Shiny TV, a high-definition remastered version for the PlayStation 3.|$|E
5|$|During his reign, he {{completed}} the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the delta region, restored Theban rule {{over the whole}} of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan. He then reorganized {{the administration of the}} country, reopened quarries, mines and trade routes and began massive construction projects of a type <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> undertaken since the time of the Middle Kingdom. This building program culminated {{in the construction of the}} last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers. Ahmose's reign laid the foundations for the New Kingdom, under which Egyptian power reached its peak. His reign is usually dated to the mid-16th century BC.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{months after}} the release of Grove's book, Titan Books, in {{association}} with Sparkplug Press, released a detailed history on the Friday the 13th series. Peter M. Bracke released Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th on October 24, 2005. The book chronicles the creation of the series up to the release of Freddy vs. Jason. Bracke spent three years researching the series and collecting more than 200 interviews from the cast and crew of each of the films. Bracke's extensive work for the book prompted Sean S. Cunningham to provide a foreword. Crystal Lake Memories also includes images, storyboards, concept art, and publicity material <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> released to the public. A private party was held on October 22, 2005 at Universal Studios CityWalk Hollywood for the book's premiere.|$|E

5|$|In September 1939, {{the base}} was renamed HMS Daedalus II, but was {{transferred}} {{back to the}} RAF in May 1940. Early in the war Lympne was home to Army Co-operation and bomber squadrons. During Operation Dynamo in May 1940 a French Air Force squadron was based at Lympne. It was equipped with Marcel Bloch and Potez fighters. On 15 August 1940, during the Battle of Britain, Lympne was bombed by Stuka dive-bombers of II Gruppe, StG1. All the hangars were hit and those aircraft belonging to Cinque Ports Flying Club <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> evacuated to Sywell were destroyed in the fire. Lympne was evacuated and only available as an Emergency Landing Ground until mid-September.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania regained its {{independence}} on February 16, 1918 {{and the old}} fortress was placed under engineering staff supervision. Those materials <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> taken by the Germans were used to resupply Lithuanian military needs, and {{for the construction of}} the armored train Gediminas, named after the 14th century Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas. In 1920, the Kaunas Fortress Board was formed and charged with the task of administering the fortress. Due to the development of new military technologies, its reconstruction was seen as a vast and inappropriate expense. The fortress' armament was dismantled and the trenches were filled with scrap iron.|$|E
5|$|Matthias's {{ordinary}} revenues amounted around 250,000 golden florins {{per year}} when his reign began.

However, an extraordinary taxone golden florin per each porta or peasant householdwas levied late that year. The Ottomans occupied the fort of Golubac in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the mobilization of all noblemen. He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes. King Stephen Thomas of Bosnia accepted Matthias's suzerainty.
