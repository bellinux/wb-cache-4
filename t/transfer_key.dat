40|$|Abstract — Group key {{establishment}} {{is an important}} mechanism to construct a common session key for group communications. <b>Key</b> <b>transfer</b> protocols rely on a mutually trusted key generation center (KGC) to select session keys and transport session keys to all communication entities secretly. Most often, KGC encrypts session keys under another secret key shared with each entity during registration. In this paper, we propose an authenticated <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> protocol based on secret sharing scheme that KGC can broadcast group key information to all group members at once and only authorized group members can recover the group key; but unauthorized users cannot recover the group key. The confidentiality of this transformation is information theoretically secure. We also provide authentication for transporting this group key. Goals and security threats of our proposed group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> protocol will be analyzed in detail. <b>Key</b> words—Group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> protocol, session <b>key,</b> secret sharing, confidentiality, authentication. ...|$|R

Unlike the prior hegemons, the United States is geographically isolated and faces no contiguous great power rivals interested in balancing it. This means the United States is far less threatening to great powers that are situated oceans away, the authors claim. Moreover, any competitor {{would have a hard}} time matching U.S. military might. [...] "Not only is the United States so far ahead militarily in both quantitative and qualitative terms, but its security guarantees also give it the leverage to prevent allies from giving military technology to potential U.S. rivals.

40|$|Abstract: Group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> {{protocols}} {{depend on}} a mutually trusted key generation center (KGC) to transport the group key to all group members secretly. This approach requires that a trusted sever be set up, and it incurs communication overhead costs. In addition, the existing group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> protocols based on secret sharing all use threshold schemes that need to compute a t-degree interpolating polynomial to encrypt and decrypt the secret group key, then it increases the computational complexity of system. In this paper, we first present a novel group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> protocol without an online KGC, {{which is based on}} DH key agreement and a perfect linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS). The confidentiality of the group <b>key</b> <b>transfer</b> phase of this protocol is information theoretically secure, which is ensured by this LSSS. Furthermore, this protocol can resist potential attacks and also reduce the overhead of system implementation.
