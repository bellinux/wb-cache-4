500|$|Explaining {{his choice}} of label, Thornton said, [...] "I chose to go with {{somebody}} that [...] take this as a creative project, not a marketing project. Major labels tend to let inexperienced people oversee your projects. Your innovation goes down because they have [...] input. You don't see anybody going into the studio to tell James Brown what to do. Even though he can adapt to certain things, nobody tells him how to sing. That's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about myself." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the start}} of the 21st century, Buckles {{continued}} living near Charles Town, West Virginia, and was still driving a tractor on his farm at age 103. He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war [...] "unless it's an emergency".

500|$|It {{is a great}} {{outlet for}} me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most {{personal}} songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [...] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go {{hand in hand with the}} song's composition.|$|E
500|$|At Paleyfest {{in early}} 2007, Steve Carell later {{recalled}} that {{he enjoyed the}} episode [...] "because it spoke {{to the fact that}} Michael is not a homophobe; he just doesn't understand the world. They are two very different things. It's not that he's intrinsically racist or homophobic or sexist, he just doesn't have a frame of reference. He's not capable of understanding. And once he does glean some understanding he misinterprets it into something altogether. But I think at least <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about the character is he's a decent heart, a decent person and he's just trying his best." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told {{him a lot of}} things that happened to me in the past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that.

500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
5000|$|This <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> That <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> was a {{departure}} for Osmond {{as it took}} a more Pop-sounding direction than any of her previous albums. The album produced two singles, only the title track charted, peaking within the Top 40, at #39, on the Billboard Hot 100 chart {{in the summer of}} 1977. The non-charting single from the album was [...] "Please Tell Him That I Said Hello".|$|R
50|$|In 1977, Marie {{released}} her fourth studio album titled This <b>Is</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> That <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> and was {{much different from}} her earlier country music where she covered several country artist hits.

The album only had two singles and was not a commercial success.|$|R

2500|$|In a July 2015 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Anselmo {{spoke out against}} Pantera and his other band's usage of the Confederate flag claiming {{it was a mistake}} to use it on their merchandise, albums and other promotional material. Anselmo said [...] "These days, I wouldn't want anything to fucking do with it because truthfully... I wouldn't. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> and the group of people I've had to work with my whole life, you see a Confederate flag out there that says 'Heritage, not hate.' I'm not so sure I'm buying into that." [...] Anselmo said originally that Pantera used the image because they were huge fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd but it was never about promoting hate.|$|E

5000|$|Anna Calvi {{talked to}} The Guardian about [...] "One Breath" [...] saying: “I {{wanted to explore}} {{the feeling of being}} out of control, and how this can be very scary and yet thrilling at the same time. It’s always {{important}} to me that the music tells the story as much as the lyrics, so I was very focused on creating rich textures and a lot of atmosphere for the songs to exist in. This record was made during quite a turbulent time in my life and <b>I</b> like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can <b>feel</b> that in the music when I listen back.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Hangin' Tough, Jennings second {{release on}} MCA, peaked at #19 on the Billboard country albums chart, which was {{starting}} {{to be dominated by}} a new generation of younger country singers like Randy Travis. AllMusic: [...] "Waylon perfectly articulates a unique romantic dilemma in 'I Can't Help <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> Don't <b>Feel</b> About You,' emphasizing the irony of the situation...Perhaps most impressive, though, is the unguarded melancholy so eloquently expressed in the quietly heartbreaking 'Crying Don't Even Come Close.' Hangin' Tough isn't a definitive Waylon album, but it will reveal its share of diamonds in the rough to hardcore fans." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Canadian Railroad Trilogy" [...] {{is a song}} by Gordon Lightfoot that {{describes}} {{the building of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway. This song was commissioned by the CBC for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967, to start Canada's Centennial year.

Lightfoot re-recorded the track on his 1975 compilation album, Gord's Gold, with full orchestration (arranged by Lee Holdridge). A live version also appears on his 1969 album Sunday Concert.

2500|$|During {{his college}} years, Strait joined the country band Stoney Ridge, {{answering}} a flyer the band posted around campus {{looking for a}} new vocalist. Strait renamed the group the Ace in the Hole Band and quickly became the lead; they began to perform at different honky-tonks and bars around south and central Texas, traveling as far east as Huntsville and Houston. They gained a regional following and opened for national acts such as The Texas Playboys. Soon, his band was given the opportunity to record several Strait-penned singles including [...] "That Don't Change <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> About You," [...] and [...] "I Can't Go On Dying Like This" [...] for the Houston-based D label. However, the songs never achieved wide recognition, and Strait continued to manage his family cattle ranch during the day in order to make some extra cash.|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks's involvement in Smile effectively ceased on April 14, 1967, {{when he left}} to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, [...] "I {{walked away from the}} situation as soon as I realized that I was causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about it.…As soon as I found out I was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn't {{want to be part of}} that game." [...] Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{idea for}} [...] "Black Cat" [...] {{was based on}} a warning to a rebel {{involved}} in substance abuse, in addition to the consequences of drug addiction. Its composition compares the theme to the folklore superstitions of cats having nine lives and black cats foreshadowing a negative omen or misfortune. She also related its title to the bold nature of a panther, saying [...] "I have always felt some kind of connection between myself and a panther. They're not afraid of anything, they're willing to take on anything–that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about my work." [...] Regarding its development, she said, [...] "I was getting dressed and ready to go to the studio. The television was on - some commercials and other stuff. I just started humming a melody. I don't know why and it kept sticking in my head. So I put it down on tape." [...] She later recalled Jam & Lewis saying [...] "they thought it was something that might work."

2500|$|Relations {{between new}} {{producer}} Freiberger and the Year One veterans were strained. Landau complained about stories he felt were light-weight or absurd {{when compared to}} the previous year's efforts. He wrote on the cover of a script: [...] "I'm not going out on a limb for this show because I'm not in accord with what you're (Freiberger) doing as a result... etc. I don't think I even want to do the promos—I don't want to push the show any more as I have in the past. It's not my idea of what the show should be. It's embarrassing to me if I am not the star of it and in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it should be. This year should be more important to it, not less important to it... I might as well work less hard in all of them." [...] Johnny Byrne said that Freiberger was a good man and good producer, but not good for Space: 1999. He had gotten them a second year after the cancellation, but the changes he made did not benefit the programme.|$|E

Why am I acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E

Some years later he would write “Ich bin kein freund der Abstracten kunst” (I am no friend of abstract art). After Vienna, Arnold returned to in Munich where studied landscape painting under Heinrich von Zügel and Leo von Konig. After Munich, he traveled to Berlin where he further refined his painting style under the well-known German impressionist Max Liebermann. Arnold once wrote that Liebermann made him into a true painter. On his stylistic naturalism, Arnold once wrote: [...] "Ich gebe die Stimmung der Landschaft so wieder, wie ich sie emfinde und wie sie auch der Betrachter empfinden soll" [...] (I show {{the texture of the}} landscape in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it and, as also how I want the viewer to feel it) ...|$|R

You have to go through those things and make the changes you have to make and be there and go, 'Okay, I did it.' It doesn't come that easy. [...] I just didn't hold back this time, and writing that way has made me feel really purified, like I've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in all of my problems. It's not about all the times that I've been afraid and tormented and sad, it's about looking at those situations and stomping them out. It feels really good to sing these songs now." ...|$|R
