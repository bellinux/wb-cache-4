25|$|Rattling Blanket Woman was the {{daughter}} of Black Buffalo and White Cow (also known as Iron Cane). Her older siblings were Lone Horn (born 1790, died 1877) and Good Looking Woman (born 1810). Her younger sister was named Looks At It (born 1815), later given the name <b>They</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Afraid</b> <b>of</b> Her. The historian George Hyde wrote that Rattling Blanket Woman was Miniconjou and the sister of Spotted Tail, who became a Brulé head chief.|$|E

Black Shawl outlived Crazy Horse. She died in 1927 during the influenza outbreaks of the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|As these spiders live in {{constant}} proximity to humans, {{they are not}} usually aggressive and will even let a human hand approach their web. Like any other spider, however, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> bigger foes, and, in most cases, will retreat behind an obstacle (such as a dried leaf or prey remains) upon perceiving more than usual disturbance to their web. Further disturbance {{may lead to the}} spider dropping down on a thread, then running away from the web. If the distance is not considerable, it will usually return to its web within a couple of days. Otherwise, it will start a new one.|$|E
500|$|In Cambodia, the Ab (...) , {{similar to}} the Penanggalan is either a young or an old woman which detaches her head at night through windows of houses looking for lungs, hearts and blood of dead or alive animals and returns to her body in the day. Married Abs go to bed quickly and starts {{detaching}} their heads. Most {{of them do not}} allow anyone to go into the room and their husbands are afraid of them, some might even run away from the house. In movies, women turn into abs through a special holy water but according to local legends it is passed through heredity. Abs are considered to be afraid of humans but will run after them if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> her. She might get her intestines stuck into thorns. The Abs like a river go along a certain path and remembers it very carefully.|$|E

500|$|Themes in {{the series}} often revolve around {{forbidden}} love, such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart, Graystripe and Silverstream, Leafpool and Crowfeather, and Dovewing and Tigerheart. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats (such as Leafpool), who cannot have mates, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on [...] "faith and spirituality" [...] in StarClan. [...] All books {{in the series}} feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, {{but in terms of}} prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. [...] Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. [...] Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are [...] "equally valid." [...] This leads to fear and suspicion between them because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> things they do not understand. Holmes said that [...] "ignorance is a very scary thing!" [...] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.|$|E

[...] Pereira said that police claims {{regarding}} the incident had been conflicting, and {{took issue with}} their pursuit of Menezes {{for an extended period}} and their allowing the 'suspected suicide bomber' to board a bus. 'Why did they let him get on a bus if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> suicide bombers?… [...] He could have been running, but not from the police… [...] When the Underground stops, everybody runs to get on the train. That he jumped over the barriers is a lie.' ...|$|E

Diaz has said, [...] "Fighters are afraid of conditioning, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> getting tired, but I don’t want to have anxiety or be afraid of anything. I can go 100 percent out there and {{never have to worry about}} getting tired. Everybody says fighting is 90 percent mental, and it's true. Knowing you can go 15 minutes or 25 minutes without any problem can help you sustain that mental advantage over your opponent..." ...|$|E
50|$|Raven {{the trickster}} came upon three young women drying salmon on the beach. Being hungry, and {{interested}} in stealing their salmon he asked them if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> being alone. <b>They</b> answered no, so he asked if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> bears, to which they also answered no. He went through {{a long list of}} animals, all of which the young women said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> until he mentioned owls. The women confessed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> very <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> owls. Raven walked away and hid himself in some bushes nearby, where he began to mimic owl calls. The women were terrified, and ran up the mountainside. When <b>they</b> <b>were</b> halfway up and could run no more, they turned into yellow cedar trees. This is said to be why cedars are beautiful, growing silky bark like a woman's hair, graceful limbs, and why their young trunks are smooth to touch. This <b>is</b> also why <b>they</b> grow high on the slopes of Vancouver Island.|$|R

2500|$|Today the BDSM culture {{exists in}} most western countries. This offers BDSM {{practitioners}} {{the opportunity to}} discuss BDSM relevant topics and problems with like-minded people. This culture is often viewed as a subculture, mainly because BDSM is often still regarded as [...] "unusual" [...] {{by some of the}} public. Many people hide their leaning from society since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the incomprehension and of social exclusion. It is commonly known in the BDSM culture that there are practitioners living on all continents, but there is no documented evidence for many countries (due to restrictive laws and censorship motivated by politics or religion) except their presence in online BDSM communities and dating sites.|$|E
2500|$|Princess Ida reviews her student troops' {{readiness}} to meet Hildebrand's soldiers in battle, but the terrified girls admit that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> fighting ("Death to the invader!"). [...] Princess Ida is disgusted by {{their lack of}} courage and vows that, if necessary, she will fight Hildebrand's army alone ("I built upon a rock"). [...] Her father, King Gama, arrives with a message that Hildebrand prefers {{not to go to}} war against women. [...] He reveals that Hildebrand has been torturing him by treating him in luxury and giving him nothing to complain about ("Whene'er I spoke sarcastic joke"). [...] He suggests that, instead of subjecting her women to all-out war, she pit her three strong, brave brothers against Hilarion and his friends, with Ida's hand to depend on the outcome. [...] Ida is insulted to be [...] "a stake for fighting men" [...] but realises that she has no alternative.|$|E
2500|$|According to Frederick Hoxie's Encyclopedia of North American Indians, Crazy Horse was {{the third}} in his male line to bear the name of Crazy Horse, which in Lakota is Tȟašúŋke Witkó. Tȟašúŋke Witkó III (1840–1877) {{was the son of}} Rattling Blanket Woman and Tȟašúŋke Witkó II. The love of his life was Black Buffalo Woman, whom he courted, but she married another man named No Water. At one point, Crazy Horse persuaded Black Buffalo Woman to run away with him. No Water {{borrowed}} a pistol and ran after his wife. When he found her with Crazy Horse, he fired at him, injuring him in the face and leaving a noticeable scar. Crazy Horse was married two times, first to Black Shawl and second to Nellie Larrabee (Laravie). Nellie Larrabee was given the task of spying on Crazy Horse for the military, so the [...] "marriage" [...] is suspect. Only Black Shawl bore him any children, a daughter named <b>They</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Afraid</b> <b>of</b> Her, who died at age three.|$|E

2500|$|Tobias {{has stayed}} up all night, and is making himself a morning cocktail. Agnes comes down from her room. [...] She tells Tobias that it is his role {{to make all the}} {{decisions}} with regards to what to do about Edna and Harry. She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room is drinking. Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E
60|$|Men {{are afraid}} of dying, principally, I believe, because they fear the unknown. It is not that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the pain of dying. It is not that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> going to hell. Neither is it that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> not going to heaven. But when they think of {{actually}} dying, they feel as if {{to go into the}} next world was to be turned out into the dark night, into an unknown land, away from house and home, and all they have known and loved; and so they shrink from death.|$|E
