5000|$|Hill {{defines the}} correct {{methodology}} for {{learning how to}} ride a motorcycle as {{the order of the}} sport, which comprises six training fundamentals taught in the following order: (1) bike placement, (2) vision and focus, (3) motor controls, (4) brakes, (5) turn-in rate and <b>turn-in</b> <b>point,</b> and (6) body position and body timing. According to Hill, mastering the order of the sport requires training {{both on and off the}} bike. Developing a theoretical understanding of riding a motorcycle (i.e., the physics of how and why a motorcycle reacts to given inputs) facilitates the development of correct physical skills and handling.|$|E
50|$|The corner entry phase often {{begins with}} straight-line {{threshold}} braking where {{the goal is}} to achieve maximum deceleration rate. This is followed by the turn-in where the driver begins to steer the vehicle toward the apex. Traditionally, many drivers were taught to complete all braking before this turn-in portion and take a more circular path with a constant speed to the apex. Later, many racing drivers started to incorporate trail-braking into their corner entry. Trail-braking involves carrying brake pressure past the <b>turn-in</b> <b>point</b> which allows the forces generated by the tires to decelerate the car in a more optimized direction. This more optimized direction of force causes a vehicle to travel on a Euler spiral shaped path of decreasing radius to the apex. If done properly, this results in a higher average speed and lower elapsed time to the apex compared to the traditional circular entry.|$|E
50|$|McPhillamy Park is a fast, {{downhill}} {{left-hand turn}} which is guarded by a crest {{prior to the}} <b>turn-in</b> <b>point,</b> rendering the corner blind to approaching drivers. Drivers have {{to stay close to}} the wall while turning so as not to run wide on exit. However, going too close may cause the car to clip the inside kerbing, which Allan Moffat did in practice for the 1986 James Hardie 1000, crashing the Holden VK Commodore, which he was sharing with long-time rival Peter Brock, head on into the concrete. British driver Win Percy, driving Allan Grice's Roadways VL Commodore, would complete an almost carbon copy of Moffat's crash in practice for the 1987 James Hardie 1000. McPhillamy Park is the location of the longest-running campsite for those who camp at the track (sometimes for over a week in advance of a race). The park was named after Walter J. McPhillamy, a previous mayor of the Bathurst City Council and the owner of most of the land occupied by the Bald Hills which was donated.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Repairables are components andor sub assemblies {{which can be}} repaired if they become unserviceable. Repairables are typically high cost, long procurement leadtime items. Because of these characteristics, significant economies {{can be achieved by}} repairing these items rather than discarding them when they become unserviceable. Historically, these carcasses have been difficult to manage because, when they broke, maintenance personnel were primarily concerned with replacing them with ready-for-issue units; what happened to the carcass was of little concern. Defense Management Review Decision (DMRD) 901 's objective to reduce supply system costs includes an initiative to achieve savings by retaining retrograde carcasses returned from the fleet at the first <b>turn-in</b> <b>point</b> rather than shipping them immediately to the repair depot or designated storage site. This thesis analyzes the operation of the ATAC Program to determine a 'ship or hold' decision for returned carcasses. A thorough study of ATAC's background, current management controls and operating procedures, and results from previous studies were combined with on-site hub observations to show how and why the ATAC system works. Because of ATAC, the DMRD 901 initiative to retain carcasses at their first <b>turn-in</b> <b>point</b> is not cost effective except for those items experiencing rapid phase-out or numerous upgrades. Detailed indicators to measure and monitor ATAC cost and performance effectiveness need to be implemented. Lieutenant Commander, United States NavyLieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
