5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.|$|E
5|$|Bud Carson was Tech's {{defensive}} coordinator in 1966. His {{job was to}} appease the massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired.</b>|$|E

As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{started the}} 2003 season 4–4, but lost their final eight games. With two games {{remaining}} in the season, Jim Fassel requested a meeting with team management, and asked, if he was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired,</b> that they do so now rather than wait {{until the end of}} the season. Management complied with his request, formally firing Fassel on (or around) December 17, 2003, but allowing him to coach the team's final two games.|$|E
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> on attackers. The narrow slits {{were intended to}} protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E

5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired,</b> they {{would also have to}} fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5|$|After Michigan {{began the}} season with a 22 record under senior starter Gardner and with head coach Hoke under pressure, Morris started in the September 27 Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. Michigan lost the game 3014, earning its third loss earlier than it had ever done in the 135-year history of Michigan football. The 16-point loss was the largest loss to Minnesota since 1977 and the largest to Minnesota at home since 1962. On September 30, Michigan {{athletic}} director Dave Brandon revealed that Morris suffered a concussion during the game but still played after showing signs of a concussion. This revelation sparked calls for Brandon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired,</b> including a protest on the Michigan campus. When Gardner was injured in week 7 (October 11) against Penn State, Russell Bellomy and not Morris was the replacement, due to what was presumed to be lingering injuries (high-ankle sprain and/or concussion) to Morris.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E

5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired,</b> then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
5|$|As the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 {{became more}} common, the U.S. Air Force {{initiated}} the International Fighter Aircraft (IFA) program {{to provide an}} equivalent to allies. The USAF desired a light weight fighter with competitive performance to the MiG, inexpensive when purchased in large numbers, and with reasonable operating costs for prospective customer nations. Although numerous companies entered designs, Northrop's existing F-5 {{put them in a}} leading position. They submitted an upgrade, the F-5E Tiger II, with the AN/APQ-153 radar and other changes to allow the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> from wing-tip rails. On 20 November 1970, Northrop's entry was announced as the IFA winner. Northrop produced a total of 1,399 F-5E/F Tiger IIs by the time manufacturing ended in 1986.|$|E

In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired.</b>|$|E

5|$|By midday, {{the crowds}} {{returned}} around St. Philip Neri's Church. General George Cadwalader ordered the crowds to disperse, {{but they did}} not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence grew, and three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. In response to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> at the crowd on Third Street. A man named Charles Naylor begged the general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but the crowds returned, being led by an alderman and the sheriff, and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. The crowds grew, and a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people's shoulders.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, from Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps, {{advanced}} towards Gettysburg. Heth deployed no cavalry and led, unconventionally, {{with the}} artillery battalion of Major William J. Pegram. Two infantry brigades followed, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis, proceeding easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m., Heth's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry vedettes and deployed into line. Eventually, they reached dismounted troopers from Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The first {{shot of the}} battle was claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> by Lieutenant Marcellus E. Jones of the 8th Illinois Cavalry, fired at an unidentified man on a gray horse over a half-mile away; the act was merely symbolic. Buford's 2,748 troopers would soon be faced with 7,600 Confederate infantrymen, deploying from columns into line of battle.|$|E
5|$|In December, Kelly {{started a}} storyline with Drew McIntyre, who had {{developed}} an on-screen romantic interest in her. She rebuffed his advances on several occasions, stating {{that he was}} too aggressive and vindictive. On January 30, 2011, at the Royal Rumble, Kelly prevented the Acting General Manager Vickie Guerrero from interfering in the World Heavyweight Championship match between Edge and Dolph Ziggler. On the following SmackDown, Kelly and Edge defeated LayCool and Ziggler in a two-on-three handicap match to retain Edge's World Heavyweight Championship, with Kelly scoring the pinfall. Following the match, Guerrero fired Kelly in storyline. At Elimination Chamber later that month, Kelly was re-hired by SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long, and made her return by attacking Guerrero. She was stopped by LayCool, who were in turn stopped by Trish Stratus. On the following episode of SmackDown, Kelly gained revenge on Guerrero when Kelly and Edge defeated Guerrero and Drew McIntyre in a mixed tag team match, causing Guerrero <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> in storyline per the pre-match stipulation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, Wheeler and three of his {{batteries}} were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, {{they were forced to}} travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed. Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand {{what it was like for}} aircrew <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> on by an anti-aircraft battery.|$|E
5|$|New York {{played the}} Cleveland Browns a week later. In a meeting before the game, Ryan told his players that he {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> {{at the end of}} the year. The Jets defeated Cleveland, 24–13, and despite the uncertainty, the players and coaches were in high spirits. Several players including Antonio Cromartie, Calvin Pace, and Willie Colon went on to publicly express their support for Ryan to return as coach. In the season finale, the Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins 20–7, eliminating them from playoff contention. In the locker room after the game, owner Woody Johnson and Idzik announced Ryan would return for the 2014 season much to the delight of the players. Ryan was praised for keeping his team competitive after being eliminated from playoff contention and keeping their spirits high throughout the year despite their inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the inner bailey, with its wall studded with {{semi-circular}} projections, is unparalleled. This innovation had two advantages: firstly, the rounded wall absorbed the damage from siege engines much better as it did not provide a perfect angle to aim at; secondly, the arrowslits in the curved wall allowed arrows <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fired</b> at all angles. The inner bailey, which contained the main residential buildings, used the principles of concentric defence. This and the unusual {{design of the}} inner bailey's curtain wall meant that castle was advanced for its age, since it was built before concentric fortification was fully developed in Crusader castles such as Krak des Chevaliers. Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe; for instance when Edward I of England—who had himself been on Crusade—built castles in Wales in the late 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded were concentric.|$|E
