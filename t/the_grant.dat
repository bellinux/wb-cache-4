5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> of arms. For corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E

40|$|In this study, I {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} offering two large non-refundable grants to low-income Canadian youth on postsecondary attendance. <b>The</b> <b>grants</b> had two interesting features. First, they were clawed back from loans, thus reducing costs but providing no additional liquidity. Second, <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> were only available to students if parental income was below a fixed threshold. This sharp discontinuity in the offer of <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> provides for near ideal conditions to study their causal impact, closely mimicking random assignment. Despite the large size of <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> (up to $ 6, 000 or $ 7, 000), the fact that students were automatically assessed for <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> with their regular student loans application, and evidence that most Canadian youth are at least aware of non-refundable study grant opportunities, I find that <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> had no impact on postsecondary or university attendance. Some policy implications are discussed. Access to postsecondary, student debt...|$|R
