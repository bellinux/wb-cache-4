40|$|Statement of Problem: <b>Tetrahydrozoline</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} as new gingival retraction agent but its clinical efficacy with widely used conventional retraction agents has not been tested. Purpose: The {{study was designed to}} clinically evaluate efficacy of newer retraction agent <b>tetrahydrozoline</b> with two widely used retraction systems i. e., Expasyl retraction system and medicated retraction cords on basis of amount of gingival retraction. Materials and Methods: 30 subjects were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Maxillary Impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid for all subjects. Tray material was used for making the special tray. Latin Block Design was Used in the Study to avoid tissue fatigue. Retraction was done with aluminium chloride; <b>Tetrahydrozoline</b> and Expasyl according to Latin block design. Impressions were poured with die stone. Casts were retrieved and sections were made with die cutter. 3 mm thin slices were obtained. Each slice was used to measure the amount of retraction under stereomicroscope under 20 x and images were transferred to image analyser. Results: The amount of gingival retraction obtained by using aluminium chloride as gingival retraction agent was maximum (148238. 33 μm 2) compared to <b>tetrahydrozoline</b> (140737. 87 μm 2) and Expasyl (67784. 90 μm 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Backround/Aim. Retraction {{agents for}} {{temporary}} vertical and lateral suppression of gingival tissue {{as well as}} bleeding control and fluid flow in the gingival sulcus {{are expected to have}} maximal efficiency without irreversible damage of local tissue and adverse systemic effects. The research started from the assumption that <b>tetrahydrozoline</b> is a biologically more acceptable means of gingival retraction than commercially available preparations. The aim {{of the study was to}} comparatively analyse the inflammatory effects of different retraction materials and <b>tetrahydrozoline.</b> Methods. The effect of retraction liquid on the basis of aluminum chloride and epinephrine and <b>tetrahydrozoline</b> hydrochloride on gingival tissue of rabbits was investigated. The application time in the rabbit's gingival sulcus was 7 minutes. Tissue biopsy was performed after an hour, a day, and 7 and 30 days. Tissue preparations were analyzed under a microscope. Results. The obtained results indicate a reversible damage of gingival tissues as a result of local application of aluminum chloride- and epinephrine-based retraction agents. Their use led to acute inflammatory response after an observation period of 1 and 7 days. After 30 days reparation of damaged tissue was observed. The use of <b>tetrahydrozoline</b> resulted in a visibly weaker inflammatory response. Conclusion. Retraction liquids insertion led to an acute inflammatory response of gingival tissue which in time assumed a chronic character. The inflammatory response to the administered <b>tetrahydrozoline</b> was significantly lower with complete reparation of gingival tissue. Taking this fact into account it is recommended as a potential retraction agent. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 41017...|$|E
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{actions of}} certain substituted imidazolines {{have given them}} considerable therapeutic importance. Naphazoline is a well-known vaso-constrictor; phentolamine, because of its adrenergic blocking properties, is useful in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, and tolazoline, as a peripheral vasodilator, exerts a beneficial effect in certain vascular diseases. More recently tet. rahydrozoline, 2 -(1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 1 -naphthyl) -imidazoline, was shown to be an active vasoconstrictor (Hutcheon et al., 1955) and, under the trade name of Tyzine, it is being marketed as a nasal decongestant. <b>Tetrahydrozoline</b> also caused bradycardia and, like phentolamine, reversed the pressor response to epinephrine In experimental animals.

40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, there are increasing requirements for analytical methods in quality assessment {{for the production}} of drugs. In this investigation, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) was used for the rapid qualitative separation and identification of active ingredients in generic over-the-counter drugs and food additives in beverages. The active ingredients determined in drugs were acetaminophen, aspartame, bisacodyl, caffeine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, famotidine, glucosamine, guaifenesin, loratadine, niacin, phenylephrine, pyridoxine, thiamin, and <b>tetrahydrozoline.</b> Aspartame and caffeine were determined in beverages.

40|$|Aim of {{the work}} was to develop mucoadhesive eyedrops {{containing}} <b>tetrahydrozoline</b> hydrochloride (TZ), a decongestant drug, and based on a ternary interaction drug-polymer-polymer. The anionic polymers assessed were the anionic hyaluronic acid (HA) and polyacrylic acid (PAA), the cationic chitosan (HCS) and the polyelectrolyte gelatin (G). Formulations based on the ternary systems TZ/G/HA, TZ/HCS/HA, TZ/G/PAA and TZ/HCS/PAA at the stoichiometry ratios between cationic and anionic polymers and containing a 10 and 20 fold excess of the anionic polymers were prepared. The formulations were characterized for in vitro mucoadhesive and release properties. The ex vivo/in vivo residence properties were assessed for the formulations that combined the better in vitro mucoadhesive and release properties. The physical stability of the formulations selected was determined following steam sterilization and storage at 25 and 40 degrees C. The synergistic effect of G with HA and PAA improves the mucoadhesion of the formulations while the interaction of HCS with HA and PAA is likely to produce higher neutralization of the anionic polymer charge and minor chain flexibility resulting in a limited mucoadhesion improvement. Both G and HCS participate to control drug release. The selected formulations demonstrate to possess consistency (viscosity) sensitive to the ions of the medium, and probably for this reason the ex vivo/in vivo residence properties could not directly correlated to mucoadhesion and to drug release control properties. However, the formulations are able to maintain levels of TZ detectable until 20 min after the instillation in rabbits, while TZ was not detectable since 3 min after instillation of the drug solution...|$|E

Results: In total 122 intubations in patients age 0 - 6 were identified (< 2 years 60; 2 - 6 years 62). Of these 95 (78 %) intubations were associated with single agent exposures. The 5 most common single agent exposures identified were alpha- 2 agonists (n= 12), opioids (n = 12), detergents (n= 9), caustics (n = 8) and envenomations (n= 8). Most of the alpha- 2 agonist single agent exposures (11 / 12) involved clonidine. The other was brimonidine. Laundry pods were involved in 8 / 9 detergent exposures.

Results: Fifty-seven children developed clinical manifestations such as somnolence (N= 34 / 57), sweating (N= 20 / 57), pallor (N= 17 / 57), hypothermia (N= 16 / 57), bradycardia (N= 13 / 57), cool extremities (N= 9 / 57), restlessness (N= 7 / 57), tachycardia (N= 6 / 57), vomiting (N= 5 / 57), irregular respiratory pattern and apnea (N= 5 / 57), miosis/ mydriasis (N= 4 / 57).
