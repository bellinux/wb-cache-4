5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey {{was just a}} population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel}} monkey differs in coloration from South American {{squirrel monkey}}s. While South American squirrel monkeys {{tend to be}} primarily greenish in color, <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap {{at the top of}} the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Marquez, a Houston Independent School District (HISD) parent {{involvement}} {{specialist for the}} Gulfton area, stated in a 2004 Education Week article that members of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> communities specifically identify themselves with Gulfton rather than Houston.|$|E
50|$|He won {{the bronze}} medals at <b>the</b> 1985 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships and <b>the</b> 1986 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games, {{and the gold}} medal at <b>the</b> 1987 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> grey-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel}} monkey is orange or reddish-orange in color, {{with a black}} cap. It differs from <b>the</b> black-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel monkey}} in that the limbs and underparts of <b>the</b> grey-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey are less yellowish. Some authorities also consider the cap on <b>the</b> grey-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey to be less black than that of <b>the</b> black-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey, but other authorities regard this as a feature that varies by age rather than by subspecies.|$|R
50|$|He won {{the silver}} medal at <b>the</b> 2001 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships, the bronze medal at <b>the</b> 2002 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games, {{the gold medal}} at <b>the</b> 2003 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships, the bronze medal at the 2003 South American Championships and the bronze medal at <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games. He also became Cuban {{champion}} in 2006.|$|R
5|$|Palms in {{the genus}} Calyptronoma have pinnately {{compound}} leaves and large, solitary stems 4 to 15 metres (13 to 49ft) tall. The genus is endemic to the Greater Antilles, inhabiting wet areas near streams. Calyptronoma {{is closely related}} to <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> genus Calyptrogyne.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel monkey}} {{in the wild}} is unknown, but captive specimens {{have been known to}} live more than 15 years. Other squirrel monkey species are known to be able to live more than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|A {{language}} {{which was}} the ancestor of Pochutec split from Proto-Nahuan (or Proto-Aztecan) possibly as early as AD 400, arriving in Mesoamerica a few centuries earlier than the main bulk of speakers of Nahuan languages. Some Nahuan groups migrated south along <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> isthmus, reaching as far as Nicaragua. The critically endangered Pipil language of El Salvador is the only living descendant {{of the variety of}} Nahuatl once spoken south of present-day Mexico.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> black-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel}} monkey is orange or reddish-orange in color, {{with a black}} cap. It differs from <b>the</b> grey-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel monkey}}, which replaces it in central Costa Rica, in that the limbs and underparts of <b>the</b> black-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey are more yellowish. Some authorities also consider the cap on <b>the</b> black-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey to be more black than that of <b>the</b> grey-crowned <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey (C. o. citrinellus), but other authorities regard this as a feature that varies by age rather than by subspecies.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{a bronze}} {{medalist}} in the 200 metres at <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games, a bronze medalist in the 100m at <b>the</b> 2009 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships, {{and a silver}} medalist in the 100m at <b>the</b> 2013 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships ...|$|R
50|$|He won {{the gold}} medal at <b>the</b> 1989 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships and silver medals at <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games and <b>the</b> 1993 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships. He also competed at the 1988 Olympic Games and the 1993 World Championships without {{reaching}} the final.|$|R
5|$|Arachnids {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine, and their venom has been studied for bioactive factors. In 1993 Margatoxin was synthesized from the venom of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> bark scorpion, Centruroides margaritatus. This peptide selectively inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels. Patented by Merck, {{it has the potential to}} prevent neointimal hyperplasia, a common cause of bypass graft failure.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey. The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt}} to prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E
5|$|El Salvador {{has made}} two FIFA World Cup appearances: first in 1970 {{and again in}} 1982, but have never progressed beyond {{the first stage of}} a finals tournament. They were the 1943 CCCF champions, and {{finished}} in second-place in the 1941 and 1961 championships. They have competed in the CONCACAF regional tournaments fourteen times, finishing as runners-up in 1963 and 1981. La Selecta also competes in the biennial UNCAF Nations Cup, the Pan American Games, the Olympics, and have achieved two gold medals in <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games.|$|E

5|$|Fossils of the Mediterranean and Caribbean {{species are}} {{known from the}} Pleistocene. The time of {{divergence}} between the Hawaiian and Caribbean species, 3.7 million years (Ma) ago, corresponds to the closing of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Seaway by {{the formation of the}} Isthmus of Panama. The divergence between Mediterranean seals and the New World clade was dated to 6.3 Ma ago.|$|E
5|$|On April 26, 1940, {{the first}} {{national}} football federation was approved, with Dr. Luis Rivas Palacios as president. In 1941, the first international competition in CONCACAF, the international governing body for football in North America, Central America and the Caribbean, <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championship (CCCF) took place in Costa Rica. El Salvador took part {{for the first time}} alongside Costa Rica, Curaçao, Nicaragua, and Panama. El Salvador were runners-up, recording two wins, one tie, and one loss.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 UNCAF Nations Cup was {{the inaugural}} UNCAF Nations Cup, <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{championship}} for men's national association football teams. It {{was organized by}} the Unión Centroamericana de Fútbol or UNCAF, and it took place in Costa Rica from May26 to June2, 1991. All matches were played in the Costa Rican capital, San José at the Estadio Nacional. The top two teams, apart from Costa Rica, go on {{to participate in the}} 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Costa Rica were given a bye due to their performance at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Cienfuegos. He won the silver medal at <b>the</b> 2005 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships and at <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games.|$|R
50|$|Camp Santiago {{also served}} as a village for athletes for <b>the</b> 1993 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games in Ponce and <b>the</b> 2010 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games in Mayagüez.|$|R
50|$|He won bronze at the 1989 IAAF World Indoor Championships, silver at <b>the</b> 1989 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships {{and silver}} at <b>the</b> 1990 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel}} monkey is omnivorous. Its diet includes insects and insect larvae (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers and nectar. It also eats small vertebrates, including bats, birds, lizards and tree frogs. It finds its food foraging through the lower and middle {{levels of the}} forest, typically between fifteen and thirty feet high. Two-thirds to three-quarters of each day is spent foraging for food. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available.|$|E
5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{predictions}} for heavy rainfall {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean, the hurricane's movement was more northerly than expected, resulting in less precipitation along <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> coast than anticipated. In its early developmental stages, Hattie struck San Andrés Island, located offshore eastern Nicaragua, with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts of 104mph (167km/h). As the hurricane neared the island, the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds. Rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels. Many palm tree plantations were devastated. The schooner Admirar, anchored {{in one of the}} island's bays, capsized during the storm. Overall, Hattie resulted in one death, fifteen injuries, and $300,000 in damage (1961USD) in San Andrés. The hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island, and of the four was the only to approach from the south.|$|E
50|$|In the 10,000 metres he won {{the bronze}} medal at <b>the</b> 1982 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games and the silver medal at <b>the</b> 1986 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games. He later {{finished}} fourth at the 1990 Goodwill Games in 27:43.07 minutes. This was his personal best time. At <b>the</b> 1983 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships he won both the 5000 and 10,000 metres.|$|R
50|$|Born in Tortola, Crabbe won {{the bronze}} medal over 200 metres at <b>the</b> 1999 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships. He {{finished}} sixth at <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games.|$|R
50|$|He {{won gold}} medals at <b>the</b> 1993 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games and <b>the</b> 1993 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships, {{and a silver}} medal at the 1995 Pan American Games.|$|R
5|$|Dominic Johnson {{participated in}} {{athletics}} as a pole vaulter, {{returning to the}} Olympics for his third time; Johnson had previously participated as a pole vaulter (and, at one time, a relay runner) on behalf of Saint Lucia in the 2000 Summer Olympics and 1996 Summer Olympics. Johnson flew to San Diego days before the competition cutoff and made the qualifying preliminary height for the Olympics shortly after winning a silver medal at <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships in Cali, Columbia. Johnson's event took place on 20 August 2008. With a height of 5.30 metres, Johnson did not qualify, although he tied for seventeenth place in his qualifying group. As such, he did not advance. Johnson tied with the Czech pole vaulter Štěpán Janáček for thirtieth place overall.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Congress in Guatemala City, Guatemala on January 26, 1991, the {{qualification}} rounds for {{the inaugural}} CONCACAF Gold Cup was decided upon. Since Costa Rica {{were given a}} bye into the competition due to its first place standing at the 1989 CONCACAF Championship, which {{also served as a}} qualification phase for the FIFA World Cup hosted by Italy in 1990, they weren't required to participate in the preliminary stages. However, the final qualification round of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> zone had two bids: the United States and Costa Rica. Costa Rica won the bid and was named by CONCACAF and UNCAF as the host nation of the inaugural UNCAF Nations Cup tournament on February 19, 1991.|$|E
5|$|One popular {{theory is}} that {{squirrel}} monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the Guatemalan black howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey and Guatemalan black howler.|$|E
50|$|With the Bahamian 4 x 100 metres {{relay team}} he {{finished}} fourth at <b>the</b> 2003 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships {{and won a}} bronze medal at <b>the</b> 2005 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships.|$|R
50|$|Competing as a javelin thrower {{for more}} than 10 years, he participated in many {{international}} competitions {{as a part of}} the Cuban national team. At <b>the</b> 1971 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships in Athletics he won the gold medal. He won silver at both <b>the</b> 1974 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games and the 1975 Pan American Games, and gold once again at <b>the</b> 1977 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Championships in Athletics.|$|R
50|$|He won bronze {{medals at}} the 2005 South American Championships and <b>the</b> 2006 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games, and silver medals at <b>the</b> 2002 <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Games and the 2003 South American Championships.|$|R
