5|$|In all {{of these}} <b>transitive</b> closure algorithms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish pairs of vertices that are reachable by at least one path of length two or more from pairs that can only be connected by a length-one path. The <b>transitive</b> reduction consists of the edges that form length-one paths that are the only paths connecting their endpoints. Therefore, the <b>transitive</b> reduction can be constructed in the same asymptotic time bounds as the <b>transitive</b> closure.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like {{the object of a}} <b>transitive</b> verb, but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a <b>transitive</b> verb.|$|E
5|$|Like the <b>transitive</b> closure, the <b>transitive</b> {{reduction}} is uniquely defined for DAGs. In contrast, for a directed graph {{that is not}} acyclic, there can {{be more than one}} minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This {{means that the}} subject of an intransitive verb is treated similarly to the object of a <b>transitive</b> verb, but differently from the subject of a <b>transitive</b> verb.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the possessive {{agreement}} suffixes on nouns and the <b>transitive</b> agreement suffixes on verbs {{in a number of}} instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between <b>transitive</b> and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} an {{orientation}} of the complete graph Kk is the <b>transitive</b> tournament k with vertices 1,2,…,k and arcs from i to j whenever i < j.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{relation}} → on graphs is <b>transitive</b> (and reflexive, trivially), {{so it is}} a preorder on graphs.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperative}} mood is used {{to issue}} orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative {{is used to}} express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have <b>transitive</b> and intransitive paradigms. There are two <b>transitive</b> positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, {{and one that is}} considered rude and is usually used to address children.|$|E
5|$|Another set (set B) {{is used to}} {{indicate}} the person of subjects of <b>transitive</b> verbs (and in some languages, such as Yucatec, also the subjects of intransitive verbs, {{but only in the}} incompletive aspects), and also the possessors of nouns (including relational nouns).|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of <b>transitive</b> verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of <b>transitive</b> verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take <b>transitive,</b> intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that <b>transitive</b> suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight <b>transitive</b> paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrumental}} case is versatile. It is {{used for}} the instrument with which an action is carried out, for oblique objects of intransitive verbs (also called antipassive verbs) and for secondary objects of <b>transitive</b> verbs.|$|E
5|$|Typologically, Erromintxela {{displays}} the same features as the Basque dialects it derives its grammatical structures from. Its case marking follows the ergative–absolutive pattern where {{the subject of}} an intransitive verb is in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), the same case being used for the direct object of a <b>transitive</b> verb. The subject of a <b>transitive</b> verb is marked with the ergative case. Similarly, auxiliary verbs agree with the subject and any direct object and indirect object present and verb forms are marked for allocutive (i.e. a marker is used to indicate the gender of the addressee).|$|E
5|$|Wagiman is a prefixing language, which, in {{the context}} of {{typology}} of Australian languages, may refer to its genealogical classification as well as its syntactic properties. Wagiman, along with other Gunwinyguan languages, inflects verbs for person and number of the subject obligatorily, and optionally for the object. In this respect Wagiman displays characteristics of a head-marking language. However, Wagiman also behaves as a dependent-marking language, in that nominals are case marked as to their grammatical or semantic roles, such as ergative (the subject of a <b>transitive</b> clause) or absolutive (the object of a <b>transitive</b> clause or the subject of an intransitive clause).|$|E
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a <b>transitive</b> verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a <b>transitive</b> verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
5|$|Important {{polynomial}} time computational problems on DAGs include topological sorting (finding a topological ordering), {{construction of the}} <b>transitive</b> closure and <b>transitive</b> reduction (the largest and smallest DAGs with the same reachability relation, respectively), and the closure problem, in which {{the goal is to}} find a minimum-weight subset of vertices with no edges connecting them {{to the rest of the}} graph. Transforming a directed graph with cycles into a DAG by deleting as few vertices or edges as possible (the feedback vertex set and feedback edge set problem, respectively) is NP-hard, but any directed graph can be made into a DAG (its condensation) by contracting each strongly connected component into a single supervertex. The problems of finding shortest paths and longest paths can be solved on DAGs in linear time, in contrast to arbitrary graphs for which shortest path algorithms are slower and longest path problems are NP-hard.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (<b>transitive</b> on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{have two}} sets of affixes that are attached to a verb to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set A) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of <b>transitive</b> verbs. They {{can also be used}} with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. <b>Transitive</b> verbs encode {{the gender of}} the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode {{the gender of the}} grammatical subject, creating a set of four verb subclasses. The distinction between the two genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E
5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining {{words and phrases}} to make clauses and sentences. Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology are central to Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order). Preferred word orders in a simple <b>transitive</b> sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and word order frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as topic and focus.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Mayan languages is {{simpler than}} that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic. Verbs are marked for aspect or tense, {{the person of the}} subject, the person of the object (in the case of <b>transitive</b> verbs), and for plurality of person. Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.|$|E
5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking {{to answer questions}} {{that are difficult to}} test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects have been carried out there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity <b>transitive</b> reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transitive</b> closure: Rthinsp&+, {{defined as}} the {{smallest}} <b>transitive</b> relation over X containing R. This {{can be seen to}} be equal to the intersection of all <b>transitive</b> relations containing R.|$|E
25|$|A <b>transitive</b> {{subgroup}} of Sn is a subgroup whose action on {1,nbsp&2,nbsp&,...,nbsp&n} is <b>transitive.</b> For example, the Galois group of a (finite) Galois extension is a <b>transitive</b> {{subgroup of}} Sn, for some n.|$|E
25|$|A {{relation}} that is reflexive, symmetric, and <b>transitive</b> {{is called}} an equivalence relation. A relation that is symmetric, <b>transitive,</b> and serial is also reflexive. A relation {{that is only}} symmetric and <b>transitive</b> (without necessarily being reflexive) is called a partial equivalence relation.|$|E
25|$|L0(A) = the {{smallest}} <b>transitive</b> set containing A as an element, i.e. the <b>transitive</b> closure of {A}.|$|E
25|$|Nominative–accusative {{alignment}} {{uses the}} same coding system for subjects of <b>transitive</b> and intransitive verbs and a different coding system for direct objects of <b>transitive</b> verbs. The different kinds of arguments are represented as A, S, and O. A is the subject (or most agent-like) argument of a <b>transitive</b> verb, O is the direct object (or most patient-like) argument of a <b>transitive</b> verb, and S is the sole argument of an intransitive verb.|$|E
25|$|The intransitive base, {{also known}} as causativization, {{approaches}} state that the <b>transitive</b> variant {{is derived from the}} intransitive variant (the causative is derived from the anticausative), by adding one argument, that is an agent. The <b>transitive</b> base approaches, {{also known as}} decausativization, propose that the intransitive form is derived from the <b>transitive</b> by deleting one argument that is the agent. Common base approaches suggest that both the <b>transitive</b> and the intransitive forms are formulated from a common base.|$|E
25|$|However, the <b>transitive</b> {{closure of}} a {{restriction}} is {{a subset of}} the restriction of the <b>transitive</b> closure, i.e., in general not equal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transitive</b> verbs {{consist of}} single roots and various suffixes upon modern intransitive verbs. Historically, intransitive verbs {{probably}} developed by dropping these <b>transitive</b> suffixes and ablauting.|$|E
25|$|A partial {{equivalence}} relation is <b>transitive</b> and symmetric. <b>Transitive</b> and symmetric imply reflexive if {{and only if}} for all a ∈ X, there exists a b ∈ X such that a ~ b.|$|E
25|$|Nominative–accusative languages, or {{nominative}} languages have {{a form of}} morphosyntactic alignment {{in which}} subjects of <b>transitive</b> and intransitive verbs are distinguished from objects of <b>transitive</b> verbs by word order, case-marking, and/or verb agreement.|$|E
25|$|Many, if not most, <b>transitive</b> and intransitive verbs {{share common}} roots, though their {{derivation}} is often unpredictable. Some thematic features among intransitive verbs include ablaut, reduplication, the suffix -ek, and the prefix pV, where V stands for any vowel. Thematic suffixes among <b>transitive</b> verbs include -ih and -VC, where C stands for any consonant. Some <b>transitive</b> verbs also {{end in a}} final short vowel.|$|E
25|$|Case-marking {{is one of}} {{the formal}} guises of DSM, along with agreement, inverse systems and voice alterations, which {{goes hand in hand with}} DSM. The use of case marking on subject is to {{differentiate}} prominence in arguments. It can be used on subjects of <b>transitive</b> verbs and intransitive verbs. The definiteness and animacy scale of Differential Subject Marking has the same hierarchical structure exhibited in the section on Differential Object Marking. The functional motivation for the implementation of DSM and DOM is to avoid ambiguity as to what is subject and object in <b>transitive</b> clauses. The most natural hierarchy of animacy and definiteness places <b>transitive</b> subjects higher than <b>transitive</b> object.|$|E
25|$|Clauses with a verb can be intransitive or <b>transitive.</b> In Ixtenco Otomi, if a <b>transitive</b> verb has two {{arguments}} {{represented as}} free noun phrases, the subject usually precedes the verb {{and the object}} follows it.|$|E
25|$|In this language, the {{argument}} of the intransitive and agent of the <b>transitive</b> sentence are marked with the same nominative case particle ga, while {{the object of the}} <b>transitive</b> sentence is marked with the accusative case o.|$|E
