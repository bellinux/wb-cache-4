40|$|This thesis report investigates how the {{parameters}} of friction stir welding tools {{affect the quality of}} welds. Specifically, the joining of 5 mm 6061 -T 6 aluminium alloy with four different tools was carried out and a relationship between tool parameters and weld quality was then determined. The four types of tools include; a flat shoulder with cylindrical threaded pin, flat shoulder with triangular pin, spiral shoulder with threaded triflute pin and concave shoulder with threaded pin. The design of the friction stir welding tools are based on literature reviewed. To analyse the quality of the welds microstructure, bend and hardness tests were conducted. The experimental setup consists of a milling machine with an adjustable spindle speed and <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> rate which was used to undertake friction stir welding. The welding parameters of spindle speed and <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> rate were kept constant throughout testing which allows only the tool geometry to affect the outcome of the welds. Welds made with the triflute, cylindrical and concave tools were of a satisfactory condition whereas the triangular tool failed. Results from post weld analysis indicate that the triflute and concave tools have a coarse grain microstructure which leads to a lower hardness and a more ductile failure during the bend test. The cylindrical tool resulted in a fine grained microstructure and thus has a higher hardness and brittle failure. The triangular tool failed to produce a satisfactory weld due to failure in the pin which sheared off. Micro crack defects were found in all weld samples as well as a wormhole in welds made using the cylindrical tool and lack of root penetration with the triflute tool...|$|E

30|$|Although the {{relational}} model in Eq. (13) is established {{based on the}} surface helical curve of the rotational parts, when the rotational parts with spiral grooves conduct rotational motion and rectilinear motion at a certain speed, and when the abrasive balls produce a <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> movement through extrusion under the function of gravity and then enter the spiral groove at a relatively low speed, it can be considered that a variation of N, the rotational speed of the abrasive balls, is negligible. The lead angle of helical motion is only related to the speed ratio of rotational and linear motion. As a result, {{the relational}} model in Eq. (13) {{can be applied to}} the rotational parts with spiral grooves; in other words, it can be used as an active profiling and polishing model for spiral grooved parts of a rotor.|$|E

It allows correctly determining the value of the <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> (in multiple-pass processing) which, as it is known, should be conformed to the value of the contact width of the wheel cutting surface and workpiece.

40|$|ABSTRACT: "Die-less forming " {{is a new}} concept, {{intended}} to manufacture long compo-nents of continuous-fiber thermoplastic-matrix composites. The concepts behind die-less forming have been tested in experiments on a two-roller demonstration machine. The experiments focused on finding the effects of important forming parameters on the shape. Laminates with special lay-up were also made and formed to study the effect of lay-up on shape. Quasi-isotropic laminates showed an unexpected "excess bending. " An elastic/visco-plastic model has been developed to explain and predict this excess bending during die-less forming. The model is rate dependent and captures the shape dependency on strain rate, <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> magnitude and the lay-up. The model {{is based on the}} application of the principle of virtual displacements. The model predicts the net bend angle well for quasi-isotropic laminates. 1. EXCESS BENDING DUE TO INCREMENTAL FORMING I N THE DIE-LESS forming process, we control the position of the rollers andhence the way the component exits the forming zone. The material does not allow in-plane changes in area. Hence, we consider only developable shapes to be formed out of continuous fiber laminates. Although the shapes before and after the bend is propagated are developable (inextensible) surfaces, the interme-diate shapes are not. Referring to Figure 1, the constraints on the component are as follows: o The left of the component is fixed to an XZ table. This article was invited by the edito...|$|E
40|$|Compliant tools, such as {{filamentary}} brushes, {{are being}} increasingly used in modern manufacturing facilities, especially in automated deburring and finishing operations. Although numerous advantages of brushing tools for deburring applications have been cited, the material removal mechanics and dynamic characteristics of such compliant tools {{are not well}} understood. It is recognized {{that there is an}} urgent need to formulate a process model for deburring with compliant tools. Furthermore, the control strategies for automatic deburring need to be developed in order to carry out advanced automatic deburring operation. In this research, process models have been obtained from brush/workpart dynamic systems and brush material removal characteristics. A process model for the dynamic system is established by employing a viscoelastic representation and Dynamic Data System (DDS) analysis. Parameters of the systems are identified by experimentally obtained dynamic response. The viscoelastic and first order DDS dynamic process models yield close agreement for poles of the system. Material removal characteristics are described by first order differential equations. Parameters of the system are evaluated by experimentally obtained 2 ̆ 2 Master Curves 2 ̆ 2 of dynamic force response. In addition, a multiple regression method and an Neural Network model are applied in modelling the burr height reduction. Control strategies have been developed for cases of burr with known constant height, known varying height, and unknown height. The closed-form solutions of <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> rate along the X axis have been obtained for both known constant height burr and known varying height burr. The feed rate is increased proportionally with increase of initial penetration depth. An equal-distance sampling technique was employed {{in the development of the}} closed-loop control system for burr with unknown height. The use of the concept of dividing the brush into many differential brushes has shown the success in the analysis for burr with unknown height. Computer simulations show the validity of control law developed as a result of burr totally removed, and indicate that K a = 1. 25 seems to be desired proportional gain value.

The PPP machine exploits this insight and utilizes an oblique grinding technique that obviates the traditional trade-off between MRR and planarization efficiency. High speed grinding with cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheels are industrially attractive options for hard-to-machine metallic alloys, due to their low cost, reliability, reduced thermal damage and superior workpiece surface finish. However, thermal issues and transient behavior of the grinding wheel wear directly affect the workpiece surface integrity and tolerances. This thesis investigates the topological evolution of an electroplated CBN grinding wheel, characterization of its wear and life expectancy, when utilized in nickel-based alloy grinding. Depth profiling, digital microscopy and scanning electron microscopy are utilized to investigate topological evolution and mechanisms of grit failure. The results are used to elucidate the statistical evolution of the grinding wheel surface. It is found that when a grit is pulled out, load redistribution commences in its neighboring domain, with localized rapid grit wear. The unique experimental findings are used to develop a novel phenomenological model for the progressive wheel wear, including the combination of grit pullout (Stage I) and grit wear (Stage II). For Stage-I, the model employs the grinding kinematics, thermal shock to the grit-wheel interface, Paris law type fatigue approach. For Stage-II, Preston type wear approach is employed. The molding framework is utilized to infer electroplated CBN grinding wheels’ life expectancy for the high speed grinding and high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG) processes. The model provides the process design domain for different grinding process parameters, while maintaining a targeted wheel life, and averting potential damage of the workpiece...|$|E
