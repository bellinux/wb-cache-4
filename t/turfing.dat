2500|$|In 1844, {{the site}} of the Kennington Oval was a market garden owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy was willing to lease the land for the purpose of a cricket ground, and on 10 March 1845 the first lease, which the club later assumed, was issued to Mr. William Houghton (then {{president}} of the progenitor Montpelier Cricket Club) by the Otter Trustees who held the land from the Duchy [...] "to convert it into a subscription cricket ground", for 31 years at a rent of £120 per annum plus taxes amounting to £20. The original contract for <b>turfing</b> The Oval cost £300; the 10,000 grass turfs came from Tooting Common and were laid in the Spring of 1845 allowing for the first cricket match to be played in May 1845. Hence, Surrey County Cricket Club (SCCC) was established in 1845.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are four}} primary moves in krump: jabs, arm swings, chest pops, and stomps. Krumping is rarely choreographed; {{it is almost}} entirely {{freestyle}} (improvisational) and is danced most frequently in battles or sessions rather than on a stage. Krumping is different stylistically from other hip-hop dance styles such as Breakdancing and <b>turfing.</b> Krumping is very aggressive and is danced upright to upbeat and fast-paced music. Despite the style, krumping does not promote aggression or fighting - moves are meant to take up space and challenge other dancers to feed off and return the energy, [...] whereas b-boying is more acrobatic and is danced {{on the floor to}} break beats. The Oakland dance style <b>turfing</b> is a fusion of popping and miming that incorporates storytelling and illusion. Krumping is less precise than <b>turfing</b> and more freestyle. Thematically, all these dance styles share common ground including their street origins, their freestyle nature, and the use of battling. These commonalities bring them together under the umbrella of hip-hop dance.|$|E
