40|$|Bi-phasic photocatalyic {{particles}} {{have been}} prepared {{in the form of}} Janus-like structures (bi-phasic materials with two distinct properties on opposing sides of the particle) using a new synthetic procedure consisting of <b>the</b> <b>sequential</b> <b>layer</b> depositions of semiconductor oxide materials onto soluble substrates. A number of different systems have to date been investigated with an aim of photocatalytic applications. A general synthetic regime consists of utilising simple sol-gel chemistry to deposit <b>sequential</b> <b>layers</b> of photocatalytic material on top of a soluble substrate. The substrate can subsequently be removed yielding extremely fragile disks that fracture into bi-phasic powders of Janus like particles. These particles have two unique sets of properties contained in different faces of the same particle, aimed at the simultaneous reduction and oxidation of toxic species in water. This new synthetic technique is investigated for photocatalyic applications with an eye to efficient water purification, utilising the synergistic effect of <b>the</b> two materials <b>to</b> create highly effective photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of anatase/rutile (TiO 2) bi-phasic nanoparticle composites enhanced with platinum and deposited on the surface of polycarbonate filters has been successfully demonstrated.

Signal resolution depends, however, on the extraction technique used. We compared the use of mechanical micromilling and continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-IRMS) methods with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to obtain δ 18 O profiles from otoliths of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and used these <b>to</b> corroborate <b>the</b> time of freshwater emigration of the juvenile with macroscopic patterns within the otolith. Both techniques showed the transition occurring at the same visible feature on the otolith, allowing future analyses <b>to</b> easily identify <b>the</b> juvenile (freshwater) versus adult (marine) life-stages. However, SIMS showed a rapid and abrupt transition whereas micromilling provided a less distinct signal. The number of samples that could be obtained per unit area sampled using SIMS was 2 to 3 times greater than that when using micromilling/CF-IRMS although the δ 18 O values and analytical precisions (∼ 0. 2 ‰) of the two methods were comparable. In addition, SIMS δ 18 O results were used to compare otolith aragonite values with predicted values calculated using various isotope fractionation equations...|$|R

The challenges of producing (manually or automatically) a correct divide-and-conquer parallel program from a given sequential code are two-fold: (1) assuming that individual worker threads execute a code identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sequential</b> code, <b>the</b> programmer has <b>to</b> provide <b>the</b> extra code for dividing the tasks and combining the computation results, and (2) sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>sequential</b> code may not be usable as is, and {{may need to be}} modified by the programmer.
