Facing potential prison sentences of over 400 years, he negotiated a plea bargain agreement <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a maximum of 54 years, and a $2 million fine. On November 17, 2007, federal judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr. sentenced Cox to 26 years in prison. He also ordered Cox to pay $5.97 million in restitution. He will not be eligible for release until 2029.|$|E
5|$|During {{a trip to}} Nashville, Tennessee, Nelson {{attended}} a party in Harlan Howard's house, where he sang the songs that he had written for the album Phases and Stages. Another guest was Atlantic Records vice-president Jerry Wexler, who previously had produced works for artists such as Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin. Wexler was interested in Nelson's music, so when Atlantic opened a country music division of their label, he offered Nelson a contract <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> more creative control than his deal with RCA. When Nelson was released from his RCA contract, he signed with Atlantic for US$25,000 per year, becoming the label's first country artist.|$|E

5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a friend and informal leader there for many of his classmates, and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying. He also became a lightweight boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, he {{was elected}} as member of Parliament for Leominster, a {{position}} <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> immunity from his creditors. When that parliament dissolved in 1802, he fled to France. Later, he returned, and was member of Parliament for Barnstaple from 1806 to 1812 while continuing his association with the theatre. Taylor paid little of the agreed receipts to performers, or composers, and lived {{for much of his}} period of management in the King's Bench, a debtors' prison in Southwark. Here he maintained an apartment next to Lady Hamilton and lived in some luxury, entertaining lavishly.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} {{marijuana}} and cocaine.

In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E
5|$|In September 1792 Heywood was court-martialed {{and with}} five others {{was sentenced to}} hang. However, the court {{recommended}} mercy for Heywood, and King George III pardoned him. In a rapid change of fortune he found himself favoured by senior officers, and after the resumption of his career received a series of promotions <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> his first command {{at the age of}} 27 and made him a post-captain at 31. He remained in the navy until 1816, building a respectable career as a hydrographer, and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement. The extent of Heywood's true guilt in the mutiny has been clouded by contradictory statements and possible false testimony. During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf, and he later benefited from the Christian family's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh's character and present the mutiny as an understandable reaction to an unbearable tyranny. Contemporary press reports, and more recent commentators, have contrasted Heywood's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged, all lower-deck sailors without wealth or family influence.|$|E
5|$|Several years prior, one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} men in the small island nation of Horai, Tenro Horai, discovered an incredible magical power deep within the ground <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> god-like strength, the Ubusunagami Okinokai. Tenro and his followers used this power to conquer other nations. A rebel federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge the Horai. They fought to free the world of Horai's conquests, but lost battle after battle. Eventually they were almost completely wiped out, except one young man survived named Shinra. Shinra set off to battle Horai again, but he was shot down and crashed in a remote village called Ikaruga. The village was inhabited by people exiled due to the Horai expansion.The village inhabitants saved Shinra from the plane wreckage and nursed him back to health. After healing, Shinra stated that he was still determined to continue the battle against Horai. The villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane they had built themselves called the Ikaruga. The ship was specially designed and hidden away in a secret underground location beneath the village. It was the first ship built to utilize and switch between two energy polarities, black and white.|$|E

5|$|The Delius {{household}} was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, {{and played}} for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz {{was drawn to the}} music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to London for Delius to attend concerts and opera.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{remains the}} only {{national}} championship game to have featured three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players – Jordan, Ewing and Worthy – chosen in 1996 to mark the NBA's 50th anniversary. In addition to Jordan's, Ewing's and Worthy's Hall of Fame NBA careers with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively (including a combined 9 NBA championships), Floyd was named an NBA All-Star and still holds playoff records for most points in a quarter and half, while Perkins played in the league for 17 seasons. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> the confidence to become what many {{believe to be the}} greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. Jordan has said multiple times that before he would take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would sometimes think back to his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth {{boarded a}} plane to New York to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show, {{the rest of the}} Tar Heels {{returned}} to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10,000 fans. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. The crowd was so big that it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina. The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship. In the 1990s, the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings. Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university, as well as being signed to a new fiveyear contract <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> $11,500 per year.|$|E
