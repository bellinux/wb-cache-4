40|$|We {{study the}} optical {{properties}} of highly anisotropic quantum dot structures (quantum dashes) {{characterized by the}} presence of two trapping centers located along the structure. Such a system can exhibit some of the properties characteristic for double quantum dots. We show that sub- and super-radiant states can form for certain quantum dash geometries, which is manifested by a pronounced transfer of intensity between spectral lines, accompanied by the appearance of strong electron-hole correlations. We also compare exciton absorption spectra and polarization properties of a system with a single and double <b>trapping</b> <b>center</b> and show how the geometry of multiple trapping centers influences the optical properties of the system. We show that for a broad range of trapping geometries the relative absorption intensity of the ground state is larger than that of the lowest excited states, contrary to the quantum dash systems characterized by a single <b>trapping</b> <b>center.</b> Thus, optical properties of these structures are determined by fine details of their morphology.

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the forces on, and displacements of, an optically trapped bead along the propagation direction of the trapping laser beam (the axial direction). In a typical experimental configuration, the bead is trapped in an aqueous solution using an oil-immersion, high-numerical-aperture objective. This refractive index mismatch complicates axial calibrations due to both a shift of the <b>trap</b> <b>center</b> along the axial direction and spherical aberrations. In this work, a known DNA template was unzipped along the axial direction and its characteristic unzipping force-extension data {{were used to determine}} 1), the location of the <b>trap</b> <b>center</b> along the axial direction; 2), the axial displacement of the bead from the trap center; and 3), the axial force exerted on the bead. These axial calibrations were obtained for <b>trap</b> <b>center</b> locations up to ∼ 4 μm into the aqueous solution and with axial bead displacements up to ∼ 600 nm from the <b>trap</b> <b>center.</b> In particular, the axial trap stiffness decreased substantially when the trap was located further into the aqueous solution.
