40|$|Blood flow {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{in studying}} cancer angiogenesis and hypermetabolism. Current photoacoustic blood flow estimation methods focus on either the axial or transverse component of the flow vector. However, the Doppler angle (beam-to-flow angle) is needed to calculate the <b>total</b> flow <b>speed,</b> and it cannot always be estimated accurately in practice, especially when the system's axial and lateral resolutions are different. To overcome this problem, we propose a method to compute the <b>total</b> flow <b>speed</b> and Doppler angle by combining the axial and transverse flow measurements. The method has been verified by flowing bovine blood in a plastic tube at various speeds and Doppler angles. The error was experimentally determined {{to be less than}} 0. 3 mm/s for <b>total</b> flow <b>speed,</b> and less than 15 ° for the Doppler angle.
