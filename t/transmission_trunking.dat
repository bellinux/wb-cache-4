40|$|Public access mobile radio systems (PAMR) using {{trunking}} technology {{allow more}} {{efficient use of}} the frequency spectrum, as all the users of the system jointly use a common pool of channels. Trunked PAMR systems can operate on two different levels of management, {{on the basis of}} messages (message trunking) and transmissions (<b>transmission</b> <b>trunking).</b> When using message trunking, the system allocates the radio channel from the beginning {{to the end of the}} conversation. However, with <b>transmission</b> <b>trunking,</b> the system allocates a radio channel when one partner presses his or her push-to-talk button (PTT) and deallocates the radio channel when he or she releases the PTT button to change talking partners. Thus, during the silence produced by this change, no channel is occupied. The advantage of <b>transmission</b> <b>trunking</b> is that there is no waste of channel occupancy during the pauses in the conversation. The drawback is that a more complex control system with more signalling is needed, where the distribution of the transmission occupancy is more crucial in the performance than in the distribution of the message holding time when trunking by message. In message trunking, the lack of radio channel only causes a delay and the user has to wait to begin the conversation, while in <b>transmission</b> <b>trunking,</b> it can produce an unpleasant effect of clipped words. This paper verifies that voice calls, generally assumed to have an exponential holding time, are better modelled with other distributions, and analyses the statistical properties of the conversation time in two different PAMR systems (13 refs.)

40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis of transmission holding time data based from two different Public Access Mobile Radio (PAMR) is presented. The data are obtained from digitised conversations by automatically identifying the spectrum of the in-band signalling that limits every transmission. It is shown how the empirical histogram {{is far from being}} exponential, which is the type most used in teletraffic issues. From the different theoretic distribution models adjusted to the transmission times a mixture of lognormals is the best fit. As <b>transmission</b> <b>trunking</b> needs far more signalling and the Grade of Service (GoS) is more crucial than when trunking by message, a careful choice of the distribution model is strongly recommended. The best fit distribution can be used to feed computer simulations in order to obtain accurate measurements of system performance. 1.

40|$|Abstract—Mobile radio {{systems for}} {{public safety and}} {{agencies}} engaged in emergency response and disaster recovery operations must support multicast voice traffic. In this paper, we analyze the distribution of call interarrival and call holding times for multicast voice (talk group) traffic on a <b>transmission</b> <b>trunked</b> mobile radio system. In such systems, the channel is held only while a user is making a call (while the push-to-talk key is pressed and the radio is transmitting). We find that the call interarrival time distributions are exponential and exhibit tendency toward long-range dependence. The call holding times best fit lognormal distributions and are not correlated. A potentially important implication of these findings is that performance estimation methods that assume memoryless Markov arrival and departure processes may not be viable approaches.

40|$|In {{order to}} have {{accurate}} operation, synchronous telecommunication networks need a reliable time basis signal extracted from the line data stream in each node. When the nodes are synchronized, routing and detection can be performed, guaranteeing the correct sequence of information distribution among the several users of a <b>transmission</b> <b>trunk.</b> Consequently, an auxiliary network is created inside the main network, a sub-network, dedicated to {{the distribution of the}} clock signals. There are different solutions for the architecture of the time distribution sub-network and choosing one of them depends on cost, precision, reliability and operational security. In this work we analyze the possible time distribution networks and formulate problems related to precision and stability of the timing signals by using the qualitative theory of differential equations.

Reliable {{knowledge}} of traffic in PMR (Private Mobile Radio) systems {{is essential for}} assessing the issues in migration from analog to digital and trunked PMR systems. In this work, we investigated two concepts. First, we modeled the service time distribution of conventional PMR networks by using teletraffic data of a conventional PMR network. It is found that {{the density of the}} service time is a shifted exponential which is delayed by 0. 7 second. The mean service time is about 2. 5 seconds. We showed that voice call arrivals to a <b>transmission</b> <b>trunked</b> PMR network are not Poisson distributed. Analytical and simulation methods based on M/G/C (a C server queue with Poisson input and general service) models may not model the system as well as G/G/C (a C server queue with general input and general service) models. Several trunked PMR systems have been designed over the last decade, most of which have symmetric downlink and uplink channel capacities. These systems may not be spectrally efficient in case of group or broadcast-based voice and data calls, a common feature of PMR systems. Second, we studied a new asymmetric PMR system comprising of a wideband OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) -based downlink, such as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) system.

30|$|An {{important}} aspect to highlight {{in relation to}} this mechanical parameter of wood is that EDL and EDT exhibit lower values and the greatest in CV values in comparison to EDlog, EDlumber and EDdried (Table  1). A possible cause for this variation {{may have been the}} method of measurement used, which was indirect. Both ultrasound transducers were located at a 45 ° angle in log for measuring ultrasound wave time. This is an indirect measurement of ED and lower values than transducers were located parallel to the fiber [17]. Variations in transducer inclination or depth affect wave <b>transmission</b> through the <b>trunk,</b> since energy flows through the anisotropic plane and decreases as it passes through the growth rings [25]. In the case of EDT, this measurement was taken precisely {{at the center of the}} tree and therefore, the pith might affect this measurement. In teak wood, pith diameter is greater than 1  cm and is usually made up of very soft tissue [26], which decreases ultrasound velocity.|$|R
40|$|A {{decision}} {{framework is}} introduced to assist municipal engineers and planners to optimise decisions regarding {{the renewal of}} large infrastructure assets, such as water <b>transmission</b> pipes, <b>trunk</b> sewers or other assets with high costs of failure, inspection and condition assessment. The proposed decision framework identifies a need for immediate intervention or alternatively, enables to optimise the scheduling of the next inspection and condition assessment. The deterioration of the asset is modelled as a semi-Markov process, thereby discretised into condition states. The waiting times in each state {{are assumed to be}} random variables with `known' probability distributions. If pertinent data are scarce (as is typical in most municipalities) these probability distributions can be initially derived based on expert opinion. These distributions will then be continually updated as observed deterioration data are collected over time. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to calculate the distributions of the cumulative waiting times. Conditional survival probabilities are used to compile agedependent transition probability matrices in the various states. The expected discounted total cost associated with an asset (including cost of intervention, inspection and failure) is computed as a function of time. The time to schedule the next inspection/condition assessment is when the total expected discounted cost is minimum. Immediate intervention should be planned if the time of minimum cost is less than a threshold period (2 to 3 years) away. A computer program was prepared for demonstration and proof of concept. The decision framework lends itself to a computer application fairly easily. Although usable in its current form, this paper identifies some issues that require as yet unavailable [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Motion of {{the upper}} limbs is often coupled {{to that of the}} lower limbs in human bipedal locomotion. It is unclear, however, whether the {{functional}} coupling between upper and lower limbs is bi-directional, i. e. whether arm movements can affect the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry. Here we tested the effects of voluntary rhythmic arm movements on the lower limbs. Participants lay horizontally on their side with each leg suspended in an unloading exoskeleton. They moved their arms on an overhead treadmill as if they walked on their hands. Hand-walking in the antero-posterior direction resulted in significant locomotor-like movements of the legs in 58 % of the participants. We further investigated quantitatively the responses in a subset of the responsive subjects. We found that the electromyographic (EMG) activity of proximal leg muscles was modulated over each cycle with a timing similar to that of normal locomotion. The frequency of kinematic and EMG oscillations in the legs typically differed from that of arm oscillations. The effect of hand-walking was direction specific since medio-lateral arm movements did not evoke appreciably leg air-stepping. Using externally imposed trunk movements and biomechanical modelling, we ruled out that the leg movements associated with hand-walking were mainly due to the mechanical <b>transmission</b> of <b>trunk</b> oscillations. EMG activity in hamstring muscles associated with hand-walking often continued when the leg movements were transiently blocked by the experimenter or following the termination of arm movements. The present results reinforce the idea that there exists a functional neural coupling between arm and legs...|$|R

Ring-index fibres can maintain singlemode transmission for considerable values of normalized frequency (much larger than cutoff for classical single mode fibres) for particular cases of the refractive index profile.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{various aspects}} of packet data <b>transmission</b> in terrestrial <b>trunked</b> radio (TETRA) networks giving particular emphasis {{on the performance of}} applications transmitting data between a number of radio terminals and a fixed server. The utilization of such applications is constantly increasing in public safety networks and so does the need to dimension and configure TETRA networks to meet their reliability, delay and loss requirements. Without an efficient radio resource management (RRM), one operator can exhaust the capacity of others. This study tackles an efficient scheduling to provide maximum system throughput and proportional fairness in accordance with operator capacity share through adaptive resource allocation scheme. We refer to this new scheme as multi-operators time division generalized processor sharing scheme (M-TDGPS). It employs both adaptive rate allocation to maximize the resource utilization and GPS techniques to provide fair services for each operator. The performance analysis of this scheme is derived using the GPS performance model and compared with the normal static rate M-TDGPS scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive rate M-TDGPS scheduling scheme improves both system utilization (throughput) and average delays.

However, trunk disease pathogens have been isolated from soaking water, indicating cross contamination. Cuttings of Vitis vinifera cv. Sunmuscat and V. berlandieri x V. rupestris rootstock cv. 140 Ruggeri were immersed in sterilized, deionised water for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 h. The soaking water was cultured (25 °C for 3 days) on non-specific and specific media for fungi and bacteria. The base of each cutting was debarked and trimmed and three 3 mm thick, contiguous, transverse slices of wood cultured at 25 °C for 3 days. The soaking water for both cultivars became contaminated with microorganisms within the first hour. Numbers of fungi isolated from the wood slices soaked for one hour were significantly greater than those from non-soaked cuttings. The number of bacterial colonies growing from the wood slices increased after soaking for 2 - 4 h in Sunmuscat. In a second experiment Shiraz cuttings were soaked for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. The soaking water became contaminated within the first hour but only the bacterial count increased significantly over time. Microorganisms also established on the container surfaces within the first hour although {{there were no significant}} increases over 24 h. These results confirm that soaking cuttings is a potential cause of cross contamination and demonstrate contamination of cuttings occurs after relatively short periods of soaking.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the effect of a movable {{backrest}} on vibration <b>transmission</b> through the <b>trunk</b> during driving and on the physiological consequences thereof. Eleven healthy male subjects drove for about 1 h on normal roads with a movable and with a fixed backrest while surface electromyography (EMG) was measured at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L 5) and vertical accelerations were measured at the seat, backrest and at the spine at the levels of the second sacral vertebra (S 2) and seventh cervical vertebra (C 7). The movable backrest significantly reduced accelerations at C 7 by up to 11. 9 % at the 5 Hz frequency band. The movable backrest also significantly reduced the coherence and transmission between S 2 and C 7 accelerations, but not the differential motion between these sensors. EMG at both sides of L 5 was on average 28 % lower when using the movable backrest. Spinal shrinkage was unaffected by backrest type. It is concluded that a movable backrest reduces the transmission of vibration through the trunk and that it reduces low back EMG. Car driving is associated with the risk of developing low back pain and this may be related to exposure to whole body vibration.
