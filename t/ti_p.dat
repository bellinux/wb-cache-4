Although various media reports dispute the actual time of the disturbance, it is presumed to be near the beginning to an hour into R. Kelly's set. Madison Square Garden security then searched the area but found nothing and gave clearance for R. Kelly and his bodyguards to return. On their walk back, they were suddenly pepper-sprayed by Tyran [...] "Ty Ty" [...] Smith, a childhood friend of Jay-Z and rushed to nearby Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center. By this time Jay-Z was performing onstage in place of R, Kelly, unaware of the backstage violence. After a forty-five-minute set, he told the crowd {{he would have a}} show for them in a few minutes.

The Δ value of the <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> doublet is equal to 5.7  eV, which {{is comparable to the}} theoretical value (ΔTi 2 <b>p)</b> of <b>Ti</b> for Ti oxide. After etching, the intensity of the Ti-O peaks decreases due to the volatility of TiFx, which is partly removed from the surface during the thermal desorption process. The suppressed peak shifts to higher binding energy regions by 0.4 and 0.35  eV for of <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> 3 / 2 and <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> 1 / 2, respectively, as shown in Figure  4 b (2). This result can be explained by a bond shift compensation scheme between TiFx and the etched BTO, in which the Ti 4 + cations are partially reduced to create Tix+ (x[*]=[*] 1, 2, 3) cations in the presence of adequate oxygen vacancies [24]. The peak intensities of <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> 3 / 2 (458.5  eV) and <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> 1 / 2 (464.15  eV) are strengthened when compared to the etched counterparts, as shown in Figure  4 b (3), and return identically to their original binding energies found in the case before the etching process.|$|R

The zircons we have studied typically display banded concentration gradients, having between 1 and 7 peaks in Ti abundance over length scales of 10 – 20 μm—the beam diameter commonly used for SIMS trace-element zircon analyses—with amplitudes {{of up to}} 4. 5 ppm Ti (baseline values are ~ 1 – 4 ppm) and widths (measured at half-height) of between ~ 0. 2 and 4 μm. Spatial correlations between concentrations of Ti and other trace elements (P, Y, and Ce) are also common, but variable in character, ranging from oscillatory co-variation of <b>Ti,</b> <b>P,</b> Y, and Ce to cases where only a subset of peaks for a given element is spatially correlated with peaks in Ti. There are also longer length-scale, generally positive correlations among concentrations of <b>Ti,</b> <b>P,</b> Y, and Ce (i. e., gradients on which narrower peaks are superimposed). In contrast, Hf concentrations are either uncorrelated or inversely correlated with these longer length-scale variations in Ti concentrations. The wide range in Ti concentrations over distances of less than 1 μm and the various correlations between Ti concentrations {{and those of the}} other analyzed elements suggest that on the micron scale and at temperatures between ~ 700 and 800 °C, zircon-liquid Ti partitioning is not controlled by bulk or lattice equilibrium. Treating our NanoSIMS Ti ion maps as though they were conventional SIMS analyses (i. e., generating an average Ti concentration for each map), we evaluate the hypothesis that while micron-scale variations in Ti concentrations might be kinetically controlled, when averaged over 100 – 400 μm 2, such variations capture the thermal state of the growing zircon. Using these average Ti concentrations, independent petrologic pressure and temperature constraints, estimates of silica and titania activities based on phase assemblages as well as calculations using rhyolite-MELTS, we show that crystallization temperatures predicted by Ti-in-zircon geothermometry generally do not agree with the independently constrained temperatures for the samples...|$|E

40|$|Background: Titanium (Ti) {{is widely}} proven to enhance bone contact and growth on its surface. It is {{expected}} that bone defects could benefit from Ti to promote healing and to increase strength of the implanted area. Purpose: The present study aimed at comparing the potential of porous Ti sponge rods with synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA) for the healing of bone defects in a canine model. Material and Methods: Six mongrel dogs were submitted to three trephined osteotomies of 6. 0 &# 0215; 4. 0 mm in one humerus and after 2 months another three osteotomies were performed in the contralateral humerus. A total of 36 defects were randomly filled either with Ti foam, particulate HA, or coagulum (control). The six animals were killed 4 months after the first surgery for histological and histometrical analysis. Results: The Ti-foam surface was frequently found in intimate contact with new bone especially at the defect walls. Control sites showed higher amounts of newly formed bone at 2 months - <b>Ti</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 000) and HA (p = 0. 009) - and 4 months when compared with <b>Ti</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 001). Differently from HA, the Ti foam was densely distributed across the defect area which rendered less space for bone growth in the latter's sites. The use of Ti foams or HA resulted in similar amounts of bone formation in both time intervals. Nevertheless, {{the presence of a}} Ti-foam rod preserved defect's marginal bone height as compared with control groups. Also, the Ti-foam group showed a more mature bone pattern at 4 months than HA sites. Conclusion: The Ti foam exhibited good biocompatibility, and its application resulted in improved maintenance of bone height compared with control sites.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a XAS {{experiment}} carried out at the <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> edge on well-ordered TiOx ultrathin films grown on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. XAS at the <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> edge has been extensively applied to the study of Ti bulk compounds, particularly to the study of titania. According to the literature, the corresponding <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> edge spectral shape is related to the stoichiometry and crystal field symmetry at the Ti sites. In the present study we aim at extending the potential of the XAS technique by discussing <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> spectra obtained on several, dimensionally confined, TiOx phases in the form of ultrathin films. One of the main features of these films is their high degree of structural order. Furthermore, the results of previous studies provide valuable information about the chemistry and structure of the films, so that we are able to analyse the current XAS data in detail and to compare them with the appropriate <b>Ti</b> 2 <b>p</b> XAS data of bulk oxides.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{interfacial}} structure, the current−voltage (I−V) characteristics, and contact resistance of metal electrode−carbon nanotube contacts for five metals, <b>Ti,</b> <b>Pd,</b> Pt, Cu, and Au, based on first-principles quantum mechanical density functional and matrix Green's function methods. We find that Ti {{leads to the lowest}} contact resistance followed by Pd, Pt, Cu, and Au. The sequence, <b>Ti</b> ≫ <b>Pd</b> > Pt > Cu > Au, correlates well with the predicted cohesive strength of the electrode−carbon interface. In addition Ti leads to linear I−V characteristics up to ∼ 1 V, suggesting an Ohmic contact for both metallic and semiconductor nanotubes. However, the high reactivity of the Ti electrode at the contact to the nanotube distorts the nanotube structure...|$|R
40|$|Transitional basalts of the Treinta y Tres region intrude late Proterozoic granites in {{northeast}} Uruguay. The {{age of the}} swarm {{is assumed to be}} close to 750 Ma. Major and trace geochemical diagrams indicate gabbro type fractionation, which is supported by MPR plots. In comparison to the Florida and Nico Perez suites, the Treinta y Tres swarm is enriched in <b>Ti,</b> <b>P,</b> Zr and Sr and depleted in LILE and REE. These features and the Sro and Ndo isotope values are discussed in terms of source heterogeneity and crustal contamination. The geochemical characteristics do not support crustal contamination. The Treinta y Tres suite is better explained by a source affected by two melting episodes. The dikes were originated from the latter melting, which occurred in a an isotopically heterogeneous source. Diagrarns related to several incompatible elements ratios indicate that the mantle source of Uruguaian dikes and of continental basalts of Brazil have similar geochemical features since Early Proterozoic up to Mesozoic...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} {{correlation}} between tortuosity of extracranial internal carotid artery (EICA) and extracranial vertebral artery (EVA) and acute ischemic stroke, so as to discuss the causes of vascular tortuosity and the mechanism on inducing stroke. Methods This study included 103 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 103 patients without acute ischemic stroke whose manifestations were headache and dizziness. CTA {{was used to measure}} the tortuosity index (TI), deviation degree (DD), tortuosity degree (TD) and angular number (AN) of EICA and EVA. Pearson correlation analysis and Spearman rank correlation analysis were used to analyze the correlations of arterial tortuosity with risk factors for ischemic stroke and vascular morphology. Univariate and stepwise multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to screen related risk factors for tortuosity of EICA and EVA.   Results The stroke group had higher <b>TI</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 000, 0. 000), DD (P = 0. 000, 0. 000), TD (P = 0. 002, 0. 000) and AN (P = 0. 019, 0. 000) of EICA and EVA than those in control group. According to the site of infarction, the stroke group was divided into anterior circulation infarction (ACI) subgroup (N = 73) and posterior circulation infarction (PCI) subgroup (N = 30), and {{there was no significant difference}} in above-mentioned vascular morphological indexes between 2 subgroups (P > 0. 05, for all); in each subgroup, there was no significant difference between infarct side and non-infarct side of EICA, and between left and right EVA (P > 0. 05, for all). Nevertheless, the <b>TI</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 000), DD (P = 0. 000) and TD (P = 0. 045) of EICA in ACI subgroup were higher than those in control group; <b>TI</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 000), DD (P = 0. 000), TD (P = 0. 000) and AN (P = 0. 046) of EVA in PCI subgroup were higher than those in control group. In stroke group, correlation analysis revealed that TI of EICA was positively correlated with age, cervical artery atherosclerosis (CAS), EICA and EVA morphological indexes (except DD of EVA; P < 0. 05, for all), but was negatively correlated with male (r s = - 0. 253, P = 0. 010); TI of EVA was positively correlated with age, hypertension, morphological indexes of EICA and EVA (P < 0. 05, for all), but negatively correlated with male (r s =- 0. 276, P = 0. 005). Univariate and stepwise multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that female (EICA: OR = 1. 458, 95 % CI: 1. 111 - 5. 166, P = 0. 016; EVA: OR = 9. 092 ， 95 %CI: 1. 294 - 63. 872, P = 0. 026) and age (EICA: O R = 1. 050, 95 %CI: 1. 013 - 1. 088 ， P = 0. 007; EVA: OR = 1. 084, 95 %CI: 1. 003 - 1. 138, P = 0. 001) were independent risk factors for tortuosity of EICA and EVA.   Conclusions There are no significant differences between left and right side, anterior and posterior circulation on tortuosity distribution of patients with ischemic stroke. The EICA and EVA morphological indexes of stroke patients was significantly higher than that of non-stroke patients. Female and age are independent risk factors for tortuosity of EICA and EVA.     DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2017. 04. 01...|$|E

Spl-Ap-Phl-An-fassaitic Cpx-Chu-Cal-Dol assemblage, are being reported {{for the first time}} from a marble quarry in the vicinity of Rajapalaiyam town. This locality forms part of the Madurai block of the 550 Ma Southern Granulite Terrain and exhibits metamorphic P-T conditions ranging from 7 - 9 Kbars at 800 - 1000 degreesC as deduced from the Sil-Opx-Grt-Crd-Bt bearing pelitic assemblages. The role of CO 2 {{in the formation of the}} granulites has been dealt with most of the papers, but, only recently attention is being paid to the role of F rich halogenated fluids, in the formation of humite bearing minerals and in the migration of elements like Ti, Zr and REE. The metamorphic fluid activity which led to the formation of the above unique Fo-Spl-Ap-Chu assemblage including the geikielite and titanoclinohumite minerals can be associated with intrusive granites. The charnockitic pods in the deformed calcitic marble zone may also have helped in providing <b>Ti,</b> <b>P,</b> and Zr.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{interface}} between the transmucosal portion of endosseous implants {{surface and the}} connective tissue is characterized by fibroblast-rich barrier tissue, which {{is important for the}} long-term stability and maintenance of the implant. This study investigated the effect of cell adhesion on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) protein and on gene expression over a 72 -h culture period. Fibroblast-like cells were cultured on anodized-hydrothermally treated commercially pure titanium with nanotopographic structure (SA-treated c. <b>p.</b> <b>Ti)</b> surfaces. MethodsMurine fibroblast-like NIH/ 3 T 3 cells were cultured for 10 – 72 h on c. <b>p.</b> <b>Ti,</b> anodic oxide (AO) c. <b>p.</b> <b>Ti,</b> and SA-treated c. <b>p.</b> <b>Ti</b> disks. Cell morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cytoskeletal structure and FAK protein localization were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). FAK mRNA levels were analyzed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. ResultsSEM and CLSM showed increased NIH/ 3 T 3 cell adhesion with time, and actin filaments oriented parallel with the filopodium-like extensions on all disks. Filopodium-like extensions were bound tightly to the nanotopographic structure surface of cultures on SA-treated c. <b>p.</b> <b>Ti,</b> and especially at 72 h. FAK protein was localized along cellular extensions on SA-treated c. <b>p.</b> <b>Ti</b> and the expression of FAK mRNA was significantly higher on these disks than on c. <b>p.</b> <b>Ti</b> and AO c. <b>p.</b> <b>Ti</b> after 72 h (P< 0. 05).
