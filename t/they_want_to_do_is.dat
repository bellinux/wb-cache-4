5000|$|A key {{component}} of the HighScope approach is the plan-do-review sequence. Children first plan what materials <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work with, what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and whom <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with (this can be done formally or informally in small groups). Once {{they have made a}} plan, however vague, of what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>they</b> can go and do it. Then, after this chosen worktime, the children discuss what they did and whether it was the same as, or different from, what they had planned.|$|R

50|$|When Bounce {{started to}} {{practise}} together they knew pretty soon that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something more.

At that time they didn’t know that Bounce would last for seven years.|$|R

They are not likely to post them more than fifty or sixty yards from the wall; and, indeed, it is, as Bathurst pointed out to me, probable that they are only thick near the gate. All <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to prevent us slipping away. I should think that Bathurst must be out near the lines by this time." ...|$|E

All <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> mush. I like tennis, riding, golf. I want to do things. But it's too hot, or this, or that. Yet they'll break their necks to carry a girl off to some roadhouse, and dance--dance till you're melted. Then they stop along the river to go bathing. I've been twice. You see, I have to sneak away, or lie to mother and say I've gone to Gail's or somewhere." ...|$|E

5000|$|Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) and Julia Houston (Debra Messing) {{are having}} trouble {{deciding}} what project <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next.

Julia tells him she's getting the rights <b>to</b> <b>do</b> The Great Gatsby, which <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when <b>they</b> first met, but Tom demurs.

6000|$|... "I have to {{go through}} with it, but it's a hell of utterly inglorious squabbling. They bait me. They have been {{fighting}} the same fight within themselves that they fight with me. They know exactly where I am, that I too am doing my job against internal friction. The one thing before all others that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to bring me down off my moral high horse. And I loathe the high horse. I am in a position of special moral superiority to men who are on the whole as good men as I am or better. That shows all the time. You see the sort of man I am. I've a broad streak of personal vanity. I fag easily. I'm short-tempered. I've other things, as you perceive. When I fag I become obtuse, I repeat and bore, I get viciously ill-tempered, I suffer from an intolerable sense of ill usage. Then that ass, Wagstaffe, who ought to be working with me steadily, sees his chance to be pleasantly witty. He gets a laugh round the table at my expense. Young Dent, the more intelligent of the labour men, reads me a lecture in committee manners. Old Cassidy sees HIS opening and jabs some ridiculous petty accusation at me and gets me spluttering self-defence like a fool. All my stock goes down, and as my stock goes down the chances of a good report dwindle. Young Dent grieves to see me injuring my own case. Too damned a fool to see {{what will happen to the}} report! You see if only they can convince themselves I am just a prig and an egotist and an impractical bore, they escape from a great deal more than my poor propositions. They escape from the doubt in themselves. By dismissing me they dismiss their own consciences. And then they can scamper off and be sensible little piggy-wigs and not bother any more about what is to happen to mankind in the long run.... Do you begin to realize the sort of fight, upside down in a dustbin, that that Committee is for me?" ...|$|E

50|$|Writer Peter Schreck and {{director}} Igor Auzins had worked together successfully on We of the Never Never (1982) {{and decided to}} collaborate on another project. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a contemporary love story in the sporting genre, and originally thought of doing a $1.5 million film shot in Bondi.

Auzins and Schreck formed a company, Angoloro Productions, with John Weiley as a third partner in December 1982. They then approached Hoyts Edgley who agreed to finance within 24 hours.|$|R

50|$|While cartel {{members have}} been living in the United States for years, their desire to not attract {{attention}} on U.S. soil means that their behavior is different than how they operate in Mexico.

5000|$|The Jerusalem Post {{describes}} {{the show as}} a [...] "controversial animated series about two clueless characters who surf the Net and bungle terror attacks."

The episodes will often feature Yasser sending them on a suicide mission ending with dire consequences to his own people due to Ahmed and Salim's naive and childlike nature.|$|E

Sometimes their enthusiasm in serving her almost betrays her secret, but all <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> help. Kumiko took him in when he was a teen, calling him a younger brother since the family didnt accept underage kids, and he had nowhere else to go. In the manga, he dated Nodas older sister briefly. But she dumped him when he tried to do a legitimate job to please their father, leaving him heartbroken.|$|E

Carton made {{comments}} about Codey's wife Mary-Jo's battle with postpartum depression prompting Codey himself to confront Carton in the studio. Carton would say [...] "What Governor Codey {{ought to do is}} approve the use of medical marijuana so women can have a joint and relax instead of putting their babies in a microwave. Then all <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> cook Doritos. Women who claim they suffer from this postpartum depression ... they must be crazy in the first place."

5000|$|In {{several of}} his novels (most notably The Case of the Vanishing Boy) Key portrays some sort of {{communal}} withdrawal from society {{by a group of}} like-minded individuals. Key sometimes depicted government-sponsored social services for children as inefficient or even counterproductive in its efforts: In The Forgotten Door, social services is presented as a clearly undesirable alternative for the protagonist Little Jon, and in Escape to Witch Mountain, Tony and Tia actively flee the system. In both cases, however, it's for a very logical reason: the characters are [...] "not from around here." [...] All <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> go home and, happily, a few of us locals have the decency to help them do so (Key's The Forgotten Door predates E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial by over a decade).|$|E

The video is a parody of the 2002 horror film 28 Days Later. Lauren Bennett, featured in the song, also appeared in the music video. Director Mickey Finnegan described the concept: [...] "There's been an epidemic, the world has gone crazy, as soon as the song came out, everyone got possessed and all <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to shuffle, everyone is a shuffler." [...] The video features the dancers performing the Melbourne Shuffle, which quickly gained popularity in the United States.|$|E
