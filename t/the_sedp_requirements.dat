40|$|Through {{discussion}} of Semisubmersible Exploratory Drilling Platforms {{and their role}} as vectors in marine biological introductions, this paper establishes a base of knowledge for future referral. Included in this project are details of semisubmersibles, their unique characteristics and operations, historical movements, past introductions, future operations, and continuing potential for invasions. The significance of semisubmersibles as biological vectors is further addressed. Three criteria {{will be used to}} assess the significance of the role of semisubmersibles in the introduction of alien species: first, what is <b>the</b> rate of <b>SEDP</b> movements over time; second, how are SEDP movements unique, and what role does that uniqueness play; third, of what environmental impact are the biological invasions precipitated by <b>the</b> <b>SEDP</b> movements...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve water quality in rivers and streams or to {{maintain}} water quality without further degradation, most Environmental Protection Authorities throughout the world set stringent effluent discharge limits on sewage treatment plants. In most cases, these limits are based on Best Available Technology. The use of this technology is expensive, and does not consider {{the ability of the}} flow condition of receiving waters in digesting wastewater. An alternative strategy called &# 039;seasonal effluent discharge program&# 039; (SEDP) was investigated in this study, which utilises different flow conditions in the river, in different periods in order to accommodate various wastewater discharge concentrations. A river water quality model was developed for Yarra River in Victoria (Australia). A genetic algorithm optimisation procedure was used for estimating the reaction parameters and calibrating the model. The river water quality model was then used to study <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>SEDP.</b> <b>The</b> results of the study revealed that <b>the</b> <b>SEDP</b> is a feasible strategy for improving water quality in Yarra River, since the river has high assimilative capacity in winter compared to summer. This allows a lower wastewater treatment (via a lower chemical dosage) during winter, because of the high dilution capacity in the rive...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} our approaches and experiments in content-based copy detection (CBCD) and surveillance event detection pilot (SEDP) tasks of TRECVID 2008. We {{have participated in}} the video-only CBCD task and four of <b>the</b> <b>SEDP</b> events. <b>The</b> CBCD method relies on sequences of invariant global image features and efficiently matching and ranking of those sequences. The normalized Hu-moments are proven to be invariant to many transformations, as well as certain level of noise, and thus are the basis of our system. The most crucial property of proposed CBCD system is that it relies on the sequence matching rather than independent frame correspondences. The experiments have shown that this approach is quite useful for matching videos under extensive and strong transformations which make single frame matching a challenging task. This methodology is proven to be fast and produce high F 1 detection scores in the TRECVID 2008 task evaluation. We also submitted four individual surveillance event detection systems. “Person-Runs”, “Object-Put”, “Opposing-Flow ” and “Take-Picture ” are the four selected events. The systems rely on low level vision properties such as optical flow and image intensity as well as heuristics based on a given event and context...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines <b>the</b> {{contribution of}} <b>SEDP</b> to <b>the</b> improvement of access and quality education in Ilala Municipality. The study adopted {{a case study}} design. The research area {{of the study was}} purposely selected. Random and purposive sampling procedures were used to get sample of this study. A total of 214 participants were included in the sample. Interviews questionnaires and observation were used for data collection. Data were processed using SPSS. The findings show that the surveyed schools has been either built or improved by SEDP for example SEDP contributed much in increasing access by increasing the number of secondary schools from 8 before 2004 to 49 in 2009, in Ilala Municipality. SEDP Provided with various materials, like books, and magazines, were rarely found. Findings also revealed that although there were some improvements in the access and quality of education after <b>the</b> introduction of <b>SEDP,</b> <b>the</b> services offered did not meet learning and teaching needs. The quality of education remained a challenge due to increasing rate of failures as Division Zero in national examinations at Form IV. There were few books, and space and furniture were inadequate. Findings shows that, The main problem found is low information and not having circular on the introduction of Ward Secondary Schools and unequal distribution of capitation grants. It is recommended that The government should ensure equal distribution of capitation grant among those government secondary schools, Government should allow the capitation given to schools to be utilized according priority Lastly, Education programmes like SEDP should include all education stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess <b>the</b> {{contribution}} of <b>SEDP</b> in improving access to and completion of secondary education taking Moshi Municipality as the area of study. The specific objective of the study was to find out the extent to which students enrolled in secondary schools manage to complete four years circle without dropping in between, factors for the dropout since <b>the</b> implementation of <b>SEDP</b> as well as challenges facing <b>the</b> achievement of <b>SEDP</b> in ensuring access and completion of secondary education. A cross sectional survey and case study design were employed. The target population included students, teachers, head of schools, Education Officers as well as Ward Education Coordinators. Purposive and random sampling was applied during selection of the participants. Questionnaires and interviews were used as data collection tools. The data was gathered compiled and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The analysis of data from questionnaires were categorized and entered into the computer for computation of descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics were analyzed and presented by tables and charts. The findings of the research showed that; students who fail to complete secondary education are caused by poor economic condition of their families, peer group pressures, pregnancy among girls‟ students and ignorance of not knowing importance of education. Suggestions and recommendations to rescue the situation of absentees of secondary students are given that parents should be empowered to combat poor economic conditions so that they manage send their children in secondary schools. Government should ensure access to education to all citizens. Dormitories should be built up in each ward secondary schools to help girls avoid temptations which will cause them fall in early pregnancies...|$|R
40|$|This paper follows {{an earlier}} I. D. S. Working Paper (5) which made an {{evaluation}} of the PIM system of procedures developed by Belshaw and Chambers and currently being used in the Special Rural Development Programme in Kenya. Following <b>the</b> <b>SEDP</b> half year seminar at Diani (EPD 237 / 015 (l)) we anticipated that some changes had taken place in the PIM system since our previous research conducted towards the end of September 1972, We have now widened our sample to include officers concerned with the SPJ 3 P at the divisional, district, provincial and national levels. In doing this we hoped to; i) review our previous findings, modifying or discarding them where necessary; and ii) identify and evaluate any changes that might have occurred -in the PIM systeme Once in the field we found that the only notable change in the system was a proposal to replace monthly management meetings and monthly management reports (MMMs and MMBs, respectively) with quarterly ones. In seme areas this innovation had not been instituted while in others the innovations had been in operation for about four month. Therefore, many of our comments concerning these innovations will be more anticipatory than empirical. Only time will tell. The PIM system is judged against the functions which it was intended or could have been expected to fulfil and is found to be generally successful. Various ways in which the system is not working well are noted and recommendations are made for overcoming these difficulties. The types of situations in which the PIM procedures are probably useful and the kinds of officers {{who are most likely to}} be successful in applying them are analysed. Within the limitations mentioned and with the reforms suggested, the PIM system is found to be a valuable tool for improving Government performance and is recommended for wider use...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how community secondary school heads in Shinyanga, Tanzania, are prepared and supported to implement the Secondary Education Development Plan (<b>SEDP).</b> <b>The</b> research was a case study employing mixed methods. Data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and statistical documents. It was found that many teachers are appointed to headships with little skill in leadership and management, still fewer of them are sent for leadership training yearly. Moreover, results revealed that, shortage of essential services and of teachers, together with many responsibilities, causes a good number of heads to feel discontented with their job. Surprisingly, it was also found that some school heads work without guidelines on how to implement the Secondary Education Development Plan (<b>SEDP).</b> <b>The</b> study was limited by the number of respondents; simply 37. 1 percent of all participants responded. This necessitates further research, employing a larger sample, on the preparation and development of schools heads in Shinyanga so as to reach an accurate conclusion. Moreover, an investigation into the importance of training to enhance performance is imperative. Mixed methods, utilizing both questionnaires and in-depth interviews would result into enriched findings. It was recommended that deputy heads should be trained before being appointed to headship positions. Additionally, other means of enhancing leadership skills like coaching, mentoring and reflection should be adopted as futur...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{distributed}} algorithm for the dynamic economic dispatch problem (DEDP) in a smart grid scenario. Different from the static economic dispatch problem (<b>SEDP),</b> <b>the</b> DEDP aims at minimizing the aggregate operating {{costs of a}} group of generators over a time period with ramp rate constraints. The proposed algorithm is based on the average consensus algorithm on undirected graphs and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is distributed in the sense that no leader or master nodes are needed, while all the nodes (generators) conduct local computation and merely communicate with their neighbors. Convergence analysis shows that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution...|$|R
