The front and back lawn of the fictional Ewing family home played host to a massive barbecue filled with people from the Dallas area, across the U.S. {{and around the world}} (who paid as much as $1,000) to reminisce and celebrate the series, as well as meeting with cast members. During the festivities, Kercheval said he was shocked to see the continued support for the show 17 years after it last aired: [...] "I don't understand it. The staying power. Who knew?" [...] Linda Gray also fondly remembered her time on the show: [...] "I think it was a special time.

As to the navigation which the latter wished to undertake to Nueva España and his desire to have masters sent him for that purpose, to build ships for that voyage, that was a matter which [...] although the governor would do his best to effect, and to please him in everything [...] was not within his control, without first informing his Majesty and the latter's viceroy in Nueva España thereof; for he, the governor, had no power or authority outside of the affairs of his government of the Philippines.|$|E
2500|$|Helena Mulkerns in Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "a rich mood piece of broad proportions" [...] and [...] "a glorious aural mosaic". The title track [...] "sails the {{listener}} gently into an ebb-and-flow movement that permeates the album" [...] that contains multi-vocals she described as [...] "distinctive" [...] and [...] "striking". She thought Roma's lyrics were [...] "unornamented but compelling", but its mutli-lingual touches [...] "enrich" [...] the listening experience without becoming too dominating. Kristine McKenna, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote a critical review who described it as [...] "a portentous pastiche that's drawn comparisons to ecclesiastical choir and Gregorian chant, but in fact sounds like nothing more than unusually windy New Age music" [...] which [...] "makes for bland, bloodless music ideal for elevators; this is a record about sound rather than lyrics, melody, or any of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> invest music with emotion and ideas." [...] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett rated the album five stars out of five, writing that it [...] "established her as the unexpected queen of gentle, Celtic-tinged new age music" [...] with a subtlety that produced strong tracks as a result. Raggett concluded: [...] "It's a perfect combination of timelessness and technology, an appropriate end to this fine album".|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} looking past {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E
