50|$|Hewlett used an {{incandescent}} bulb {{as a power}} detector, {{low pass}} filter and gain control element in the oscillator feedback path to control the output amplitude. The resistance of the light bulb filament (see resistivity article) increases as its temperature increases. The temperature of the filament depends on the power dissipated in the filament and some other factors. If the oscillator's period (an inverse of its frequency) is significantly shorter than the <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> of the filament, then {{the temperature of the}} filament will be substantially constant over a cycle. The filament resistance will then determine the amplitude of the output signal. If the amplitude increases, the filament heats up and its resistance increases. The circuit is designed so that a larger filament resistance reduces loop gain, which in turn will reduce the output amplitude. The result is a negative feedback system that stabilizes the output amplitude to a constant value. With this form of amplitude control, the oscillator operates as a near ideal linear system and provides a very low distortion output signal. Oscillators that use limiting for amplitude control often have significant harmonic distortion. At low frequencies, as the time period of the Wien bridge oscillator approaches the <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> of the incandescent bulb, the circuit operation becomes more nonlinear, and the output distortion rises significantly.|$|E

A useful {{feature of the}} motor-generator {{is that they can}} handle large short-term overloads better than semiconductor devices of the same average load rating. Consider that the thermally current-limited components of a large semiconductor inverter are solid-state switches massing a few grams with a <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> to their heat sinks of likely more than 100 ms, whereas the thermally current limited components of an MG are copper windings massing some hundreds of kilos which are intrinsically attached to their own large thermal mass.

50|$|A {{bolometer}} {{consists of}} an absorptive element, such as {{a thin layer of}} metal, connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal link. The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir - the greater the absorbed power, the higher the temperature. The intrinsic <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant,</b> which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal conductance between the absorptive element and the reservoir. The temperature change can be measured directly with an attached resistive thermometer, or the resistance of the absorptive element itself {{can be used as a}} thermometer. Metal bolometers usually work without cooling. They are produced from thin foils or metal films. Today, most bolometers use semiconductor or superconductor absorptive elements rather than metals. These devices can be operated at cryogenic temperatures, enabling significantly greater sensitivity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{turbine blades}} expanded, however, {{contacting}} the honeycomb labyrinth seals {{and allowing the}} metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage static seal (ISS), contracts {{at a faster rate}} than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant.</b> The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the static seal. If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and rotating seal elements. The resulting stiction can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core. Air turbine starter (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction. Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 kn but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent. Since they were too high for an APU start, the ram air turbine (known as an [...] "air-driven generator" [...] on Bombardier products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned oxygen masks, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.|$|E

The <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> were used in microbiological prediction models to calculate the maximum difference in shelf life between packages at the two most extreme spots in the pallet unit load, when temperature elevated from 4 C to a higher temperature (ranging from 4. 5 C to 12 C), during different periods of time (ranging from 0. 5 h to 200 h).

This means that a temperature sensor used for calculating the predicted shelf life of a product, can be placed relatively far from the product itself (e. g. on the secondary package or even on the pallet) without jeopardizing the reliability of the resulting shelflife prediction. However, the results also emphasize the importance of continuous temperature monitoring along the entire chilled food supply chains...|$|R

40|$|A sudden drop {{in power}} after a beam {{interruption}} leads to thermal fatigue effects in structural {{components in the}} blanket of an accelerator driven system. These thermal fatigue effects limit component lifetimes. A sudden return to power after a beam interruption can contribute significant additional thermal fatigue and greatly reduce component lifetimes. One obvious solution is a gradual return to power after a beam interruption. There are two potential problems with this solution. One problem involves interruptions that are longer than the <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> of thin structural members but shorter than the <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> of thick structural members. In such a case, a gradual return to power reduces the additional thermal fatigue in the thin structural members but increases the thermal fatigue in thick structural members. Some compromise is necessary. The other problem is that for thick components with long <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> a long, gradual return to power is required to minimize additional thermal fatigue. Such a slow return to power can reduce the utilization or the effective load factor of the system. Specific examples of beam interruptions with various assumptions on return to power are provided for a preliminary design for the blanket of the Accelerator Driven Test Facility. Also, mitigation options to increase component lifetime are discussed. These mitigation options include improving beam reliability and modifying the blanket design to better tolerate beam interruptions...|$|R

Resonators with a microoven {{can be used}} for high-precision feedback control of temperature to compensate for the temperature dependence of resonator frequency over a wide temperature range. However, ovenization requires power con-sumption for heating, and the <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> must be minimized for effective temperature control. This paper demon-strates an efficient local-thermal-isolation mechanism, which can reduce the power requirement to a few milliwatts and the ther-mal time constant to a few milliseconds. In this method, the mechanical suspension of the resonator is modified to provide thermal isolation and include an integrated resistive heater. This combination provides mechanical suspension, electrical heating, and thermal isolation in a compact structure that requires low heating power and has a small <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant.</b> A power consumption of approximately 12 mW for a 125 ◦C tempera-ture rise and a <b>thermal</b> <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> ranging from 7 to 10 ms is reported in this paper, which is orders of magnitude lower than that of commercially available ovenized quartz resonators.

The heat dissipation in prosthetic sockets is greatly influenced by the thermal conductive properties of the hard socket and liner material employed. However, monitoring of the interface {{temperature at}} skin level in lower-limb prosthesis is notoriously complicated.
