5|$|After {{the success}} of their debut, Korn decided to enter the studio again for a second album. By then, the band had created a large fan base, and the {{expectations}} for their follow-up album were high. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> into the studio in early April 1996 at Indigo Ranch Studios, Malibu, California.|$|E
5|$|In early 1908 the {{brothers}} {{also agreed to}} a contract with a French company. In May <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Kitty Hawk with their 1905 Flyer to practice in private for their all-important public demonstration flights, as required by both contracts. Their privacy was lost when New York newspapers heard about the tests and sent several reporters to the scene.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of {{the last part of the}} war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them for the duration of the hostilities. When they finally arrived in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.|$|E

5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth from the}} camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of producer and director {{was taken over}} by Naoki Yoshida, a staff member at Square Enix who had previously worked on the Dragon Quest series. Among these were other staff changes: Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer, Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist, Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist, and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat system designer. Yoshida's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction. Through subsequent patches to the game, multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made: among the most notable were the addition of a job system, personal chocobos, a revamped battle system, greater customization options for gear, and multiple new dungeons and bosses. Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions, and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the community would be a high priority. During this period, XIV and XI were taken offline to help with energy conservation {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services. Due to the earthquake, a planned and partially-developed boss battle with the Primal Titan was cut and replaced by another Primal: the team felt that players might be offended by the Primal and associate beastribe's links with the power of earth in this context.|$|E

Kidman fought {{back with a}} headscissors takedown, and <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and forth. After Kidman countered a powerbomb into a sitout facebuster, he attempted a Frankensteiner, but Guerrero held on. After interference from Guerrera and Mysterio, who helped Guerrero and Kidman respectively, Kidman pinned Guerrero after a shooting star press to win the match, and retain the title.|$|E

After Konnan {{kicked him in the}} corner, Jericho hit Konnan with the belt. Konnan fought back with a Facejam, and forced Jericho to submit with the Tequila Sunrise. Konnan won the match, and retained the title.|$|E
25|$|The band’s {{following}} {{release was}} a 7-inch vinyl called Life Transmission (also known as Útfrymi), which was released {{through their own}} label, Eskvímó in 1981. It contained two songs: the title song, {{which was the first}} work they sang in English, and “Heima er Bezt”. Later, they collaborated on the soundtrack to Brennu-Njálssaga, a film about the Njáls saga which was directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson, toured Iceland and played along with Þursaflokkurinn and Baraflokkurinn in Akureyri.

As Goldberg attacked Luger outside, Luger pushed Goldberg's shoulder into the ringpost. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and forth as Buff Bagwell and The Sarge came down to be in Goldberg's corner. Luger hit Goldberg with brass knuckles, and Bagwell performed a Buff Blockbuster to Goldberg, seemingly by accident. Luger attempted to apply the Torture Rack, but Goldberg blocked it. Bagwell attacked Bruce outside as Goldberg pinned Luger after a spear and a Jackhammer to win the match. After the match, Bagwell attacked Goldberg with a steel chair, and revealed his alliance with Luger.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the war, Šakić fled Croatia, {{alongside}} Pavelić {{and other}} Ustaše leaders, to Argentina. They were welcomed by Argentine leader Juan Perón. Šakić and his wife first found refuge in Francoist Spain, before settling in Argentina in 1947. Šakić's wife changed her name to Esperanza. The two settled in the coastal town of Santa Teresita, 200 miles southeast of Buenos Aires, where Šakić ran a textile business and was {{an active member of the}} country's 10,000-strong Croat community. Šakić and his wife had three children, and arranged for Pavelić to be their godfather. In 1956, the Šakić family fled Argentina following the fall of Perón's government. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Spain before returning to Argentina three years later.|$|E
25|$|Family members, {{including}} his sisters, Kate and Maggie, and friends took the bodies back to Greta.

Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were buried in unmarked graves at Greta, on 30 June 1880. About 100 people were at the funeral, with Dan's cousin, Tom Lloyd, as the undertaker, and a Greta farmer, Daniel O'Keefe, acting as a preacher. After the graves were filled in, the whole area was ploughed over to keep the site of the graves hidden. The family was worried that the police would still try to get the bodies.|$|E

Austin fell over the top rope outside the ring, and Rhodes lost the first fall via disqualification. Rhodes continued to attack Austin, and performed mounted punches. Austin pulled him down, and pinned Rhodes with a roll-up while pulling his tights to win the match and the title. This match was notable for the lights in the arena going out briefly during the second fall, shortly before the finish.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the fleet}} {{comprises}} numerous smaller vehicles like the SunVan paratransit vans, and formerly, the Old Town trolley.

25|$|Caesar's commanders {{followed}} different paths. Labienus {{sided with}} the Optimates, the conservative aristocratic faction Caesar fought against in his civil war, and was killed at the Battle of Munda in 45 BC. Caius Trebonius, one of Caesar's most trusted lieutenants, was appointed consul by Caesar in 45 BC, {{and was one of}} the senators involved in Caesar's assassination on the Ides of March (March 15), 44 BC. He was himself murdered a year later. Caius Fabius held up the Pompeian forces at Ilerda until Caesar got there and won the Battle of Ilerda in 49 BC. Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus was entrusted with fleet operations by Caesar during his civil war. He was put in charge of the naval blockade of Massilia (Marseilles) during the Siege of Massilia by Caesar's forces. He built a fleet from scratch and secured the capitulation of the city. He, too, joined the conspiracy to assassinate Caesar. Marc Antony continued to be a faithful supporter of Caesar. He was made Caesar's second in command, as Master of the Horse, in 47 BC during Caesar's second dictatorship and was left in charge in Italy. He mishandled a political issue and deployed troops against a crowd in Rome. Caesar stripped him of his office. He received no appointments in 46 BC and 45 BC. In 44 BC he was elected as Caesar's consular colleague. After Caesar's murder, Antony was part of the Second Triumvirate, an alliance with two other Caesarians, Octavian and Lepidus. Marc Antony and Octavian defeated the forces of the assassins of Caesar in the Liberators' civil war. Later Octavian declared war on Cleopatra VII of Egypt in order to fight Marc Antony, her ally and lover. They were defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Egypt. Marc Antony was defeated again and the two committed suicide.|$|E

500|$|Another {{effect of}} the battle was the changed {{attitude}} of the Swiss.
