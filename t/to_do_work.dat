5|$|In 2007, Guinness World Records {{recognized}} Folding@home as {{the most}} powerful distributed computing network. As of September 30, 2014, the project has 107,708 active CPU cores and 63,977 active GPUs for a total of 40.190 x86 petaFLOPS (19.282 native petaFLOPS). At the same time, the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under BOINC totals 7.924 petaFLOPS. In November 2012, Folding@home updated its accounting of FLOPS, especially for GPUs, and now reports the number of active processor cores and physical processors. Using the Markov state model method, Folding@home achieves strong scaling across its user base and gains a linear speedup for every added processor. This network allows Folding@home <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work</b> that was formerly impractical computationally.|$|E

Smith also became color commentator for the local broadcast of Cardinals games on KPLR-TV from 1997 to 1999. When his stint on This Week in Baseball concluded, Smith then moved on <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work</b> for CNN-SI beginning in 1999. After La Russa retired as manager of the Cardinals in 2011, Smith became active in the organization again, starting with his stint as a special instructor for the team's 2012 spring training camp.|$|E

5|$|Jones had {{previously}} codirected AJ Goes to France, a 2006 live-action independent film that also has Thompson {{as the leading}} actor. It was produced as an assignment for Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where Jones majored in film. Jones had moved from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, to Minneapolis in 2005, after he graduated from Fargo South High School. For AJ's Infinite Summer, Jones was inspired by his hometown, {{as well as the}} comics he drew that featured AJ and his other friends, Danny Davy and Morgan. Additionally, the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson, Jones' professor from Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader. Secret Cities, a Fargo-based band in which Jones' friends play, provided the score for the pilot. Jones found it excellent that both his friends and his friend's band were allowed by the network <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work</b> for the pilot.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both Marge and Mr. Burns want Homer {{to go on}} {{the same}} rafting trip. Homer starts with being on his family's raft, and then swims back and forth between that and Mr. Burns's raft. Marge discovers that he has double booked the weekend while both rafts float near a waterfall, and is upset that he chose <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work</b> on a family outing. Homer can only save one raft, and he saves the one {{containing}} his family. As Mr. Burns and the executives are about to go over the waterfall, Marlowe rides up on a motorboat and carries Mr. Burns to safety, while the executives fall over the edge. Homer goes over the waterfall by himself, but is completely unharmed and finds gold. Later, at their house, Homer tells Marge that he is a safety inspector again. Fireworks go off outside, and it is revealed that they were caused by a fire at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, presumably because Homer failed at his job.|$|E

25|$|Work can be {{extracted}} also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When {{the flow of}} energy is coming into the body, work is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment {{of the notion of}} energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, Energy {{is a measure of the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work.</b> Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an energy transformation, the second principle of energy flow transformations says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work</b> and apply a force over a distance.|$|E

25|$|The central {{concept of}} {{thermodynamics}} {{is that of}} energy, the ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work.</b> By the First Law, the total energy of a system and its surroundings is conserved. Energy may be transferred into a system by heating, compression, or addition of matter, and extracted from a system by cooling, expansion, or extraction of matter. In mechanics, for example, energy transfer equals {{the product of the}} force applied to a body and the resulting displacement.|$|E

25|$|Measuring exergy {{requires}} {{the evaluation of}} a system’s reference state environment. With respect to the applications of exergy on natural resource utilization, the process of quantifying a system {{requires the}} assignment of value (both utilized and potential) to resources that are not always easily dissected into typical cost-benefit terms. However, to fully realize the potential of a system <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work,</b> {{it is becoming increasingly}} imperative to understand exergetic potential of natural resources, and how human interference alters this potential.|$|E
25|$|Other qualities {{within a}} {{reference}} state environment include temperature, pressure, and {{any number of}} combinations of substances within a defined area. Again, the exergy of a system is determined by the potential of that system <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work,</b> so it is necessary to determine the baseline qualities of a system before it is possible to understand the potential of that system. The thermodynamic value of a resource can be found by multiplying the exergy of the resource by the cost of obtaining the resource and processing it.|$|E

25|$|This is {{analogous}} to a human throwing an arrow by hand versus using a bow; the use of elastic storage (the bow) allows the muscles to operate closer to isometric on the force-velocity curve. This enables the muscles <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work</b> over a longer time and thus produce more energy than they otherwise could, while the elastic element releases that work faster than the muscles can. The use of elastic energy storage {{has been found in}} jumping mammals as well as in frogs, with commensurate increases in power ranging from two to seven times that of equivalent muscle mass.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at San Diego State University, USA, {{found that}} narcissism revealed {{a positive relationship}} with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work</b> below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making false allegations). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral {{muscle fatigue}} during {{physical}} work is an inability {{for the body}} to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand. This {{is the most common}} case of physical fatigue—affecting a national average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002. This causes contractile dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>work.</b> The insufficiency of energy, i.e. sub-optimal aerobic metabolism, generally results in the accumulation of lactic acid and other acidic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle, causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local muscle fatigue, though recent studies have indicated otherwise, actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy.|$|E
