5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that</b> eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as the Asylum where they keep insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: the survivor of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to have spent a year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's force-field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force-field is still too strong <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that.</b> The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to protect them from the planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{deal with}} it is <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that</b> {{experiments}} with processes of heat transfer to or from the system may be used to justify the formula (1) above. Moreover, it deals to some extent with the problem of lack of direct experimental evidence that the time order of stages of a process does not matter in the determination of internal energy. This way does not provide theoretical purity in terms of adiabatic work processes, but is empirically feasible, and is in accord with experiments actually done, such as the Joule experiments mentioned just above, and with older traditions.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 2011 the Dunedin City Council {{decided that}} Carisbrook would be sold after the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Demolition work was begun {{at the start}} of 2012, with the {{floodlight}} towers being dismantled and sent up to Christchurch for use by the new temporary Christchurch Rugby Stadium at Addington Showgrounds, <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that</b> city a first-class ground while AMI Stadium awaits rebuilding. Originally the floodlights were to be reused at the University Oval for day/night cricket matches. The corporate box stand, which was only 14 years old, was always designed to be dismantled for use elsewhere, and there are proposals to move parts of the structure to University Oval and some to Queenstown's Stadium. The turnstile building on Neville Street is a category I historic building and would be protected during any potential developments on the site.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the I-10 bypass around Balmorhea and Toyahvale had been completed. With the {{completion}} of the Interstate, US 290 through much of West Texas became largely concurrent with the Interstate separating only to serve as a sort of business route into towns bypassed by the Interstate. With the creation of Interstate business routes, US 290 became obsolete on the portion running along I-10 and its route designation over that portion was canceled in 1992. The entire portion of US 290 through Toyahvale and Balmorhea, part of which was concurrent with SH 17, did not become a new Interstate business route. Instead, Business Route 10-F separated from I-10 at FM 2903 to enter Balmorhea and rejoin the Interstate along SH 17. FM 3078 was designated in 1992 along the portion of US 290 between I-10 and SH 17 <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that</b> stretch of highway not concurrent with SH 17 to have a highway designation when the US 290 designation was canceled.|$|E

25|$|Although the Wilderness {{is usually}} {{described}} as a draw, it could be called a tactical Confederate victory, but a strategic victory for the Union army. Lee inflicted heavy numerical casualties (see estimates below) on Grant, but {{as a percentage of}} Grant's forces they were smaller than the percentage of casualties suffered by Lee's smaller army. And, unlike Grant, Lee had very little opportunity to replenish his losses. Understanding this disparity, part of Grant's strategy was to grind down the Confederate army by waging a war of attrition. The only way that Lee could escape from the trap that Grant had set was to destroy the Army of the Potomac while he still had sufficient force to do so, but Grant was too skilled <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that</b> to happen. Thus, the Overland Campaign, initiated by the crossing of the Rappahannock, and opening with this battle, set in motion the eventual destruction of the Army of Northern Virginia.|$|E
500|$|Astrophysicist Adam Frank {{served as}} a {{scientific}} consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood. Frank advised on [...] "the human experience of space and time", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or [...] "had this enlarged perspective." [...] He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate [...] "amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that</b> science to open up new possibilities—people are used to that in their lives. So I think {{it makes sense to}} them, and it's exciting to them". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a [...] "great thing ... speaking as a scientist", saying that [...] "they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them." ...|$|E
500|$|Day of the Tentacle uses {{time travel}} extensively; {{early in the}} game, the three main protagonists are {{separated}} across time by {{the effects of a}} faulty time machine. The player, after completing certain puzzles, can then freely switch between these characters, interacting with the game's world in the separate time periods. Certain small inventory items can be shared by placing the item into the [...] "Chron-o-Johns", modified portable toilets that instantly transport objects to the other time period, while other items are shared by simply leaving the item in a past time period to be picked up by a character in a future period. Changes made to a past time period will affect a future one, and many of the game's puzzles are based on the effect of time travel, aging of certain items, and alterations of the time stream. For example, one puzzle requires the player, while in the future era where Purple Tentacle has succeeded, to send a medical chart of a Tentacle back to the past, having it used as the design of the American flag, then collecting one such flag in the future {{to be used as a}} Tentacle disguise <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that</b> character to roam freely.|$|E

500|$|Savage sued CAIR for {{copyright}} infringement {{for using}} excerpts from his show on CAIR's website. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was [...] "deliberately designed {{to obscure the}} specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as [...] "a throwback document" [...] and a [...] "book of hate". CAIR called the suit [...] "bizarre, sloppy and baseless". On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as {{it was used to}} [...] "comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations." [...] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>that</b> filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.|$|E

2500|$|US 50 through Salisbury was {{upgraded}} {{in three}} portions in the 1950s and 1960s.
