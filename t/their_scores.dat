5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all of the cards the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> are calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E

5|$|The Master Ninja Tournaments were {{a series}} of three online {{contests}} held by Microsoft and Tecmo in 2004. They took place over Xbox Live, and were open to participants in Europe, Japan, and North America. Winner selection was based on the scores achieved through playing Ninja Gaiden or its Hurricane Packs. Players had 14 to 24 days to complete the required games and submit <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> to an online scoreboard.|$|E
50|$|Single {{selected}} number - Any number between 1 and 20 can {{be chosen}} and players {{have to hit}} it at least once during their throw to avoid penalty. If the player succeeds, that number is added to <b>their</b> total <b>score.</b> Doubles and trebles score as 2 times and 3 times respectively. If the number chosen was 20, and a player hits a single 20 and two treble 20s, 140 points are added to <b>their</b> <b>score.</b> If a player hits the treble 20 and misses {{with the other two}} darts, 60 is added to <b>their</b> <b>score.</b> If a player misses with all three darts, <b>their</b> <b>score</b> is halved.|$|R
50|$|If {{a student}} {{selected}} a university department {{related to their}} studies at high school (namely applied sciences, social sciences, or foreign languages), <b>their</b> <b>score</b> was multiplied by 0.8. If a student preferred to study at a different department from their high school concentration, <b>their</b> <b>score</b> was multiplied by 0.3.|$|R
50|$|Currently the {{following}} tournaments use sets as <b>their</b> <b>scoring</b> system.|$|R
5|$|Sonic Colors {{features}} a co-operative two-player mode titled Eggman's Sonic Simulator. In this mode, players control Sonic-modeled robots or their Mii characters {{through a series}} of levels. These levels can be unlocked by collecting special Red Star Rings hidden throughout each act. Completing Sonic Simulator levels rewards the player Chaos Emeralds, and once all seven are collected, Sonic can transform into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings in normal levels. As Super Sonic, players are invincible and can boost infinitely, though they cannot use Wisps and lose one ring per second, de-transforming when the ring counter hits zero. The game also features online leaderboards, allowing players to upload <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{records show}} that the German claimants {{included}} Staffelkapitän Hauptmann Theodor Rossiwall and Oberleutnant Sophus Baagoe who were credited with kills against Hurricanes, taking <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> to 12 and 14 respectively. Baagoe would be killed in action within a month, on 14 May 1941. It cannot be known for certain which one shot down Pattle since three other German pilots made claims in the air battle. One of the 80 Squadron pilots involved in the battle, Roald Dahl, records five Hurricanes were downed in several air battles that day, with four pilots dying. One of those was Pattle.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3 {{supports}} split-screen multiplayer {{and online}} multiplayer. Five different game modes {{can be played}} online in the game. Impact Time is disabled in multiplayer and the gameplay is some modes is tweaked. Single Race {{is analogous to the}} single-player version except AI drivers are replaced with other players. Online Road Rage functions differently to the offline mode. The online version is a team-based mode that supports up six players and the objective is to destroy the rival team's cars before a certain number of miles have been driven. The remaining three modes are variations on the Crash mode that can be played online and locally. Team Crush and Double Impact are both two-player modes where both players causes pileups on a Crash junction simultaneously. Team Crush is focused cooperative gameplay while Double Impact is about competing with each other. Party Crash is an eight-player score competition mode where players crash on a junction individually and <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> are compared. In April 2010, online services were shut down.|$|E

30|$|We also {{examined}} {{the results for}} males and females. The males increased <b>their</b> <b>score</b> on the MAAS from 3.62 (SD[*]=[*] 1.06) to 4.28 (SD[*]=[*] 0.70); the females increased <b>their</b> <b>score</b> from 3.63 (SD[*]=[*] 0.90) to 5.37 (SD[*]=[*]. 90). Given that there were only 2 female participants, a statistical comparison of the results by gender was not possible.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, McMaster's School of Medicine adopted {{progress}} testing, {{developing the}} personal progress index (PPI), a {{system based on}} progress testing invented concurrently by the University of Missouri-Kansas City's medical school and the Maastricht University. The PPI is used as an objective method for assessing acquisition and retention of knowledge for students in the medical program. The PPI is administered at regular intervals to {{all students in the}} program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20 percent on their first examination, and increase by five to seven percent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting the use of the PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} GHTV, the player is scored to track their performance, and <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> are {{compared}} to other players - both those playing {{at the same time}} as well as asynchronous scores from other players. To help boost their score, players can accumulate Hero Power in the same fashion as in the GH Live mode. Prior to a song, the player can choose to use Coins, the in-game currency, to purchase one of several Hero Powers which they can deploy during the song, improving their score and performance. Hero Powers include temporary boosts in scoring multipliers, ability to clear all notes for a short distance on the track, or to increase or decrease the density of notes. When a song is complete, the player is ranked based on their performance with the other tracked players, and awarded experience points, Coins, and other bonuses. Experience points are used to raise the player's rank in the GHTV metagame, allowing them to unlock player card skins and other features of GHTV, including Play tokens. Alternatively, players can use the paid, microtransaction currency Hero Cash to purchase access to content. In an update in December 2015, players on GHTV have an opportunity to be randomly pitted in a head-to-head challenge against another player of similar skill level, about twice every half-hour. Winning this head-to-head challenge can give the player an experience point boost.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away the Wild Card, individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> increased to that amount.|$|E

They could also implement achievements to the scoreboard based on a player's score.|$|R
50|$|The highest scoring is {{achieved}} by (1) scoring inside the highest scoring ring and (2) is done in one shot. Typically an archer is allowed one scoring shot unless he or she misses, which they are allowed another shot, but must reduce <b>their</b> <b>score</b> by half; if they miss, <b>their</b> <b>score</b> is zero and scoring for them is completed.|$|R

25|$|On the ACT, each {{question}} correctly answered is worth one raw point. There is no penalty for marking incorrect answers on the multiple-choice {{part of the}} test. Therefore, a student can answer all questions without suffering a decrease in their score for questions they answer incorrectly. This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve <b>their</b> <b>scores,</b> 22% score the same, and 23% see <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> decrease.|$|E

To effect this change, Harmonix had to wipe existing leaderboards, but in the future if similar exploits are found, {{they will be able to}} adjust leaderboards for specific song and instruments.|$|E
25|$|At the end {{of their}} third year, {{students}} participate in the national senior high school entrance exams and are assigned to senior high schools based upon <b>their</b> <b>scores.</b> Students may also participate in a separate national vocational school entrance exam if they wish to attend vocational school. In both cases, public schools are usually the most popular while private schools have traditionally been viewed as a backup for those unable to score high enough for public schools.|$|E
25|$|Human scoring is {{relatively}} expensive and often variable, {{which is why}} computer scoring is preferred when feasible. For example, some critics say that poorly paid employees will score tests badly. Agreement between scorers can vary between 60 and 85 percent, depending on the test and the scoring session. Sometimes states pay to have two or more scorers read each paper; if <b>their</b> <b>scores</b> do not agree, then the paper is passed to additional scorers.|$|E
