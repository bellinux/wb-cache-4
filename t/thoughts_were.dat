Some <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> {{included in}} The Brothers Karamazov, especially in book nine, volume III–V and book eleven, volume IX.|$|E
5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set {{his sights}} on Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed. In retrospect, Auerbach's <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to play defense was secondary.|$|E
5|$|However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul {{basketball}} coach Ray Meyer, who saw {{potential in the}} bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy, freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> revolutionary, {{because at the time}} it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} logical <b>thought</b> has <b>been</b> {{discussed}} since time known to rational mind {{but the notion}} of illogical <b>thought</b> <b>be</b> possible <b>is</b> rarely <b>thought</b> and in this paper, there is an attempt made to understand the notion of illogical thought by asking whether illogical <b>thought</b> <b>be</b> possible or not, {{and if it is}} not, why it is not and if it is yes, then how can it be. The paper comprises of two parts i,e. (i) Illogical <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> impossible. Why it is so? – Early Wittgenstein’s reply and (ii) Illogical <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> possible. How can it be? -Criticism to Early Wittgenstein...|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} {{with the status quo}} in its relations with Finland. This came {{as a result of a}} change in Soviet foreign policy, which now pursued the aim of recovering the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Soviets considered the old Empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory, and their <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> shaped by a historical precedent: as the Treaty of Nystad of 1721 was intended to protect Tsarist Saint Petersburg from the Swedes, the re-acquisition of Finland would protect the now Bolshevik Leningrad from the rising power of Nazi Germany. While in 1938 Sweden was no longer a major threat against Russia, the Soviets had not forgotten the role that the Finnish-controlled Åland islands had played as a base of operations for the German Expeditionary Force in the Finnish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The new Italian trend {{combined}} with existing national traditions {{to create a}} particular local Renaissance art. Acceptance of Renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country. Many young Hungarians studying at Italian universities came closer to the Florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with Florence evolved. The growing number of Italian traders moving to Hungary, specially to Buda, helped this process. New <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> carried by the humanist prelates, among them Vitéz János, archbishop of Esztergom, {{one of the founders}} of Hungarian humanism. During the long reign of emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg the Royal Castle of Buda became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. King Matthias Corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early Renaissance style and further expanded it.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} {{found that in}} a sample of mothers who had released their children for adoption four to 12 years prior, every participant had frequent thoughts of their lost child. For most, <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> both negative and positive in that they produced both feelings of sadness and joy. Those who experienced the greatest portion of positive <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> those who had open, rather than closed or time-limited mediated adoptions.|$|E

All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.|$|E
25|$|Princess Galyani Vadhana was {{interested}} in history and archaeology for many years. She thought these fields to be the foundations of other subjects and believed in applying reasoning to support historical ideas.

25|$|A {{news conference}} {{was held by}} Reporters Without Borders on the same day, which brought {{together}} former hostages in Iraq, Afghanistan and Gaza. Steve Centanni, who was held hostage for two weeks in Gaza in 2006, said that his <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> with Johnston, and ten top representatives of Europe's Muslims condemned the kidnapping and called for his release.|$|E

5000|$|The idea {{represented}} in the title—that <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> free—was expressed as early as in antiquity and became prominent again in the Middle Ages, when Walther von der Vogelweide (c.1170-1230) wrote: [...] ("yet still <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> free"). In the 12th century, Austrian minnesinger Dietmar von Aist (presumably) had composed the song [...] ("only <b>thoughts</b> <b>are</b> free"). About 1229, Freidank wrote: [...] ("this band may no one twine, that will my thoughts confine").|$|R
25|$|In 1972, {{the second}} feature film Snoopy, Come Home was released. This {{was the first}} time that Snoopy's <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> communicated to the audiences. The film's theme of loss made it have as much sadness as any {{animation}} centering on Charlie Brown. Snoopy and Charlie Brown's parting, Charlie Brown's inability to cope without his friend, and Snoopy's farewell to his former owner Lila are often pointed out as poignant moments in the history of Peanuts.|$|E
25|$|After Osanlou was {{dismissed}} from the United Bus Company of Tehran along with seventeen other activists in mid-2005, the bus operators movement started to gain momentum. Osanlou’s popularity amongst workers and his charismatic appeal were {{important factors in}} making him the rallying point for alienated labourers. Worker disdain led to rumblings of strike action and revolt, but such <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> quelled by reactionary security forces organized by {{the company and the}} government itself. During one of the many engagements in May, Osanlou was taken into custody after being treated for injuries. He was later released. Pressure from the theocratic regime to dissolve future activities by the union was largely unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Czartoryski was {{disappointed}} when his hopes held {{as late as}} the Congress of Vienna, that Alexander's might undertake reforms, failed to materialize. His subsequent <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> distilled in a book, completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, Essai sur la diplomatie (Essay on Diplomacy). This book, according to the historian Marian Kamil Dziewanowski, is indispensable {{to an understanding of the}} Prince's many activities conducted in Paris following the ill-fated Polish November 1830 Uprising. Czartoryski wanted to find a place for Poland in the Europe of the time. He sought to interest western Europeans in the adversities facing his stateless nation which he still considered to be an indispensable part of the European political structure.|$|E

25|$|Inside the {{pedestal}} of the statue, the Man in Black, {{who has taken}} the form of Locke, sends Ben to get Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). Richard, however, refuses to go inside and instead shows Locke's body to Ben. Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team from Flight 316 enter the statue with Ben. The Man in Black transforms into the Smoke Monster and easily kills Bram and his men, but spares Ben. The Man in Black then tells Ben what Locke's final <b>thoughts</b> <b>were,</b> and explains that his own true goal is to return home. The Man in Black finds this ironic because Locke wanted desperately to stay and live on the island. Outside, Richard sees the fireworks from the temple. The Man in Black then confronts Richard, who realizes who the man is, but the Man in Black quickly knocks him out and announces that he is disappointed in the Others as he carries Richard into the jungle.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} for the EGC is focused on freshwater fluxes. Because the EGC runs through the Greenland Sea and eventually through the Labrador Sea (as the West Greenland Current) it can have strong implications for the strengthening and or weakening of deep water formations in the Greenland and Labrador Seas. The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a density driven circulation in which a small perturbation in the density field could easily slow down or speed up the deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Jones et al. note {{that there are three}} different freshwater sources for the EGC: Pacific water, river runoff, and sea-ice meltwater. They find that the biggest contributor to the freshening of the EGC is due to river runoff, followed by Pacific water, and a distant last is sea-ice meltwater (nearly negligible). They find that even though these sources freshen the EGC, these specific sources do not penetrate very well into the central Greenland Sea where the deep convection takes place. They then decide that there must be some other freshwater influence in the central Greenland Sea. They believe it may be from solid sea ice being transported to the central Greenland Sea and then melting. Solid sea ice is very mobile, and winds can easily direct its flow along with ocean currents. Previous <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> that the recirculation of the EGC in the Greenland Sea via the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone helps lead to a freshening of the central Greenland Sea, however, Rudels et al. disproved this theory and said it must be due to solid sea ice melt and precipitation in the central Greenland Sea.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} in Paris that Acharya's <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> first turned towards socialism. This {{was similar to the}} lines of thought that {{appeared}} in the Indian revolutionary circles in Europe, especially in France, at this time. He was introduced to the Socialist circle in Paris in 1910, and enjoyed the congenial atmosphere and the thoughts and ideas that he shared. It was also {{with the help of the}} Paris Socialist circle, notably Jean Longuet, that the Paris Indian Society- which included Acharya, Har Dayal, Madam Cama and other notable names- brought pressure on the French Government when Savarkar was rearrested at Marseilles after escaping from a ship that was deporting him to India. Acharya made the most of the available press freedom and the socialist platform to press for the re-extradition of his erstwhile leader to France and build French public opinion in support of such moves. Under public pressure at home, the French Government conceded to make such a request to Britain. The matter was ultimately settled in the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, which ruled in favour of Britain. Acharya became extensively involved in the socialist movement. The Paris Indian Society at this time grew to be one of the most powerful Indian organisations outside India at the time, and grew to initiate contacts with not only French Socialists, but also those in continental Europe. It sent delegates at this time to the International Socialist Congress in August 1910, where Shyamji Krishna Varma and V.V.S. Iyer succeeded in having a resolution passed demanding Savarkar's release and his extradition to France. It also succeeded in bringing to the attention of the organisation the state of affairs in India.|$|E

500|$|According to the prison's correctional officers, once a convict {{arrived on}} the Alcatraz wharf, his first <b>thoughts</b> <b>were</b> on how to leave. During its 29 years of operation, the penitentiary claimed that no {{prisoner}} successfully escaped. A total of 36 prisoners made 14 escape attempts, two men trying twice; 23 were caught, six were shot and killed during their escape, two drowned, and five are listed as [...] "missing and presumed drowned".|$|E

50|$|Exploratory <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> an {{academic}} term {{used in the}} field of psychology to describe reasoning that neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to, or flaws in, a particular position, with the goal of seeking truth.

But if the essential meaning of the <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> disturbed, the relative clause is restrictive.|$|R
