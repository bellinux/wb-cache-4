50|$|One of the {{arguments}} put forward by abolitionists against protectionism is that small improvements in animal welfare serve <b>to</b> <b>salve</b> consciences by persuading the public that their use of animals is not unethical. Welfare reform can therefore be counter-productive. Abolitionists also argue that real reform is invariably unsuccessful, because industries that depend on animal use will not implement change that harms their profit margin. That is, the property status of animals prohibits reform that will harm their owners' interests. For that reason, abolitionists argue, it is the property status of animals that must be removed.|$|R
