5|$|Hard <b>Target</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on Laserdisc and VHS in 1994. In the United States, {{the film was}} the 14th highest selling laserdisc and the 46th most rented VHS film of 1994. Hard <b>Target</b> <b>was</b> {{released on}} DVD for Region 1 on July 1, 1998. A Region 2 DVD of the film was released on March 20, 2000.

These DVDs included Hard Target, as well as Timecop, Street Fighter, Lionheart, Sudden Death and The Quest.|$|E

Typically the duration that the {{interest rate}} <b>target</b> <b>is</b> kept constant will vary between months and years.

5|$|After 65 days of filming in New Orleans, Woo {{had trouble}} with the Motion Picture Association of America to secure the R rating that Universal wanted. Woo made dozens of cuts to the film until the MPAA allowed it an R rating. On its initial release, Hard <b>Target</b> <b>was</b> a {{financial}} success but received mixed reviews from film critics.|$|E
5|$|Casey's {{favorite}} <b>target</b> <b>was</b> {{wide receiver}} Sidney Snell, who caught a Tech-record eight touchdown receptions {{during the regular}} season. Snell accounted for 568 yards on 43 receptions of all types. Tight end Rob Purdham only caught seven passes during the regular season, but four of the catches were for touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|During the 1984 season, Virginia Tech's rushing {{offense was}} led by running back Maurice Williams, who had 149carries for 574yards and sixtouchdowns during the regular season. At quarterback, the Hokies {{featured}} Mark Cox, who completed 86passes for 983yards, fivetouchdowns, and eightinterceptions during the season. Cox's favorite <b>target</b> <b>was</b> tight end Joe Jones, who caught 39passes for 452yards and one touchdown during the season.|$|E
5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the <b>target</b> <b>was</b> to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the <b>target</b> <b>was</b> dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E
5|$|In {{their second}} match {{they beat the}} United Arab Emirates by two wickets with four balls to spare; the <b>target</b> <b>was</b> 279. Out of only five {{successful}} World Cup chases of 300 runs or more, Ireland have provided three.|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the target}} {{detection}} probability drop, <b>targets</b> <b>are</b> sometimes localized and sometimes not. Depending {{on the length of}} the continuous time interval within which the <b>target</b> <b>is</b> localized, the MTT will create and maintain the target tracks. If the <b>target</b> <b>is</b> localized rarely, then the target tracks will not be created or will disappear.|$|R

5|$|Morgan had his men tap the Union {{telegraph}} {{lines and}} send conflicting reports about {{his strength and}} destination. Most Union officials believed his <b>target</b> <b>was</b> Louisville, Kentucky. Not taking any chances, Governor of Indiana Oliver P. Morton telegraphed orders calling {{out all of the}} state's militia, the Indiana Legion, south of the National Road.|$|E
5|$|On 4 April 1945, 24 B-17s {{attacked}} fortified {{targets in}} Hamburg. The <b>target</b> <b>was</b> obscured by cloud so radar guidance {{was used to}} launch the bombs. A further mission in May 1945 was cancelled. A total of 158 bombs were dropped {{before the end of}} the war. No aircraft or aircrew were lost during the four Disney combat missions.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, 2015, {{the first}} <b>target,</b> , <b>was</b> chosen. Course {{adjustment}} {{took place in}} late October and early November 2015, leading to a flyby in January 2019. On July 1, 2016, NASA approved additional funding for New Horizons to visit the object.|$|E

5|$|The Disney bomb, by contrast, was {{designed}} {{from the start}} to penetrate the thick concrete roofs of fortified bunkers. Whereas the earthquake bomb's <b>target</b> <b>was</b> the bunker itself, the Disney bomb's <b>target</b> <b>was</b> the bunker's contents. To this end, the warhead was composed of an unusually thick steel shell containing a comparatively small amount of explosive. It was much slimmer than was usual for aircraft-dropped bombs, and a cluster of booster rockets accelerated the weapon as it fell. These features accord with Newton's approximation for impact depth and the empirical design equation known as Young's equation that states that the deepest target penetration is achieved by a projectile that is dense, long and thin (i.e. has a large sectional density), and strikes with a high velocity.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months later}} a second {{opportunity}} presented itself. Another old ship, the Haines, sank {{in shallow water}} while being towed off Plum Tree Island and became a hazard to navigation. The 2nd Bombardment Group redeemed itself by completely destroying the derelict from the air, even though their only visible <b>target</b> <b>was</b> a ten-foot-square float marker. This accomplishment, however, went entirely unpublicized.|$|E
5|$|Weinke's {{favorite}} <b>target</b> <b>was</b> game MVP Peter Warrick, {{but several}} other Seminoles also benefited from Weinke's passing efficiency. Ron Dugans caught five passes for 99yards and two touchdowns, Minnis caught two passes for 25yards, and Minor caught two for 23yards. For Virginia Tech, Davis caught seven passes for 108yards and a touchdown, Hawkins caught two passes for 49yards, and Kendrick caught two passes for 27yards.|$|E

50|$|Maximum {{effective}} indirect {{range of}} the OG-15V HE-Frag round against formation <b>targets</b> <b>is</b> 4400 m. Its effective direct fire range against small point <b>targets</b> <b>is</b> around 1000 m.|$|R

5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, the Persians made {{their way down the}} coast towards Attica. The Persians dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off on the island of Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next <b>target</b> <b>was</b> Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked the exits from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the <b>target</b> <b>was</b> obscured.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, von Neumann {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this <b>target</b> <b>was</b> dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E
