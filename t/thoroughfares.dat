5|$|Starting in 1950 {{the city}} has {{continuously}} developed and redeveloped its major streets, particularly relying on them for east-west traffic. Major east-west <b>thoroughfares</b> in Omaha include Fort, Ames, Maple, Blondo, Dodge, Pacific, Center, L, Q and Harrison streets. Major north-south <b>thoroughfares</b> in Omaha include North and South 24th streets, 30th street, Saddle Creek Road, and 72nd, 84th, 90th, and 120th streets.

5|$|Spokane's streets use {{a street}} grid that is {{oriented}} {{to the four}} cardinal directions; generally, the east–west roads are designated as avenues, and the north–south roads {{are referred to as}} streets. Major east–west <b>thoroughfares</b> in the city include Francis, Wellesley, Mission, Sprague, and 29th Avenues. Major north–south <b>thoroughfares</b> include Maple–Ash, Monroe, Division, Hamilton, Greene–Market (north of I-90), and Ray–Freya (south of I-90) Streets.

5|$|In 2013, Route 1/9 {{was one of}} {{two main}} <b>thoroughfares</b> in Hudson County (the other being Kennedy Boulevard) that were listed among the Tri-State Transportation Campaign's list of the top ten most {{dangerous}} roads for pedestrians in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Route 1/9, which tied for the #10 place on the list, was cited for the five pedestrian fatalities that occurred on it from 2009 to 2011.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{original}} incorporated city of Chicago in 1837, Rush Street is one of the city's oldest <b>thoroughfares.</b> Like Clark Street, parts of Rush Street roughly follow the path of an Indian trail called Green Bay trail (later Green Bay Road) that ran to Green Bay, Wisconsin. Early Rush Street was commonly agreed to be desirable place of residence, and hosted the first house designed by an architect in Chicago (designed for the first Mayor of Chicago William Ogden by John M. Van Osdel). The house, bounded by Erie, Ontario, Rush and Cass (now Wabash Avenue) Streets, did not survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the few major <b>thoroughfares</b> in Rome able to cope with a high volume of traffic without congestion, it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman {{community}} and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various Sacks of Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to Avignon during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained a maze of densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways.|$|E

5|$|Downtown Arlington {{is located}} near the {{junction}} of State Route 9 and State Route 530, which serve as the main highways to the city. From Arlington, State Route 9 travels north into Skagit County and south to Snohomish; and State Route 530 travels west to an interchange with Interstate 5, the main north–south highway between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, and east to Darrington. Within the city is an additional state highway, State Route 531, which connects Smokey Point, the municipal airport, and Gleneagle to Interstate 5 and State Route 9 {{in the southern part}} of the city. Other major arterial roads include Smokey Point Boulevard and 67th Avenue NE, which serve as north–south <b>thoroughfares</b> within Arlington.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{following}} {{what other}} states did, New York began to assign route numbers to its main <b>thoroughfares.</b> The Albany to Buffalo {{portion of the}} Yellowstone Trail, which ran through the cities of Syracuse and Utica, was assigned the number NY5A. The portion of the Yellowstone Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY5, which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south. The Buffalo to Albany portion of NY5's original alignment used a new road, Broadway Road, from Buffalo to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles to Albany. In between Avon and Skaneateles, NY5 and NY5A overlapped.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city <b>thoroughfares,</b> in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E

50|$|First Musquacook Lake is {{connected}} to Second Musquacook Lake by a short, broad <b>thoroughfare</b> which keeps both lakes at the same elevation. The first lake extends north from the <b>thoroughfare</b> to overflow into Musquacook Stream upstream of Horse Race Rapids. Searway Brook enters the east shore of the first lake. Summer dissolved oxygen concentrations are marginal below the 7 m thermocline, but lake trout and brook trout reach the first lake through the <b>thoroughfare</b> during cool weather.|$|R
5|$|Lawton is {{primarily}} served by Interstate 44, {{designated as the}} H. E. Bailey Turnpike. It connects the city to Oklahoma City to the northeast and to Wichita Falls, Texas, to the south. The city is also connected by US Highway 62, which connects to the regional towns of Altus {{to the west and}} Anadarko to the north. Other major <b>thoroughfares</b> include US Highway 277 and 281, which parallels the H. E. Bailey Turnpike to Wichita Falls to the south and leads to regional towns of Anadarko and Chickasha, respectively, to the north, and OK-7, which connects Lawton to Duncan.|$|E
5|$|Marquette's {{founding}} settlers {{arrived in}} the area on May 18, 1849, to establish the community, and the original <b>thoroughfares</b> were platted by 1855, including Washington and Front streets. The widest street in the city at , Baraga Avenue {{was intended to be}} the Marquette's main street when the downtown area was originally laid out, but businesses centered their locations along Washington Street instead. The community was incorporated as a village in 1859, and it was later reincorporated as a city on February 21, 1871. The original city hall was built in 1895 on Washington Street, and in 1910, the city started paving its streets, replacing wooden planks with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, as it could now be seen that the two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise the fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and <b>thoroughfares,</b> including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E

This intersection also serves as the termini for M-10 and Business Spur I-375 (BS I-375). M-3 follows Randolph Street northward under the Detroit People Mover past Cadillac Square. North of Monroe Avenue, the street runs through the Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District before M-3 crosses under the People Mover again and turns northeasterly along Gratiot Avenue, one of Detroit's five major <b>thoroughfares.</b> This street is a boulevard setup with four lanes divided with a median or center turn lane.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{street names}} {{are not used}} in the development. The main <b>thoroughfares</b> are styled blue, white, pink, yellow, orange, purple and green where street {{furniture}} and coloured ambient lighting will be colour-coded to match. A stylised map of the site has been devised. Landscape architects, Gillespies regenerated the brownfield site to create public spaces. The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal around which the buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 people. In front of The Studios there is a free-standing big screen, which is viewable from the piazza.|$|E
5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public <b>thoroughfares,</b> but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|E
