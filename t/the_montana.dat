5|$|Preliminary {{design work}} for <b>the</b> <b>Montana</b> class began before the US entry into World War II. The first two vessels were {{approved}} by Congress in 1939 following {{the passage of the}} Second Vinson Act. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor delayed construction of <b>the</b> <b>Montana</b> class. The success of carrier combat at the Battle of the Coral Sea and, to a greater extent, the Battle of Midway, diminished the value of the battleship. Consequently, the US Navy chose to cancel <b>the</b> <b>Montana</b> class in favor of more urgently needed aircraft carriers, amphibious and anti-submarine vessels.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} vigilante justice and <b>the</b> <b>Montana</b> Vigilantes began in 1863 {{in what was}} at the time a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory. Vigilante {{activities}} continued, although somewhat sporadically, through <b>the</b> <b>Montana</b> Territorial period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} the {{underwater}} protection on <b>the</b> <b>Montanas</b> was modeled on that of the North Carolina-class rather {{than that of the}} South Dakota and Iowa-classes. This was due to caisson tests in 1938 and 1939 that concluded that extending the main armor belt that tapers to the keel to act as one of the torpedo bulkheads had detrimental flooding effects due to the armor belt's excessive rigidity. <b>The</b> <b>Montanas</b> design had four torpedo bulkheads that would form a multi-layered side protection system. Of the four compartments, the outer two would be liquid loaded in order to allow the bulkheads to elastically deform and absorb the energy of a torpedo detonation. The greater beam of <b>the</b> <b>Montanas</b> would allow a higher system depth of [...] compared to [...] of the North Carolinas.|$|R

5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes {{was part of}} two migration routes along which settlers rushed to attempt to make their fortunes during the Alder Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of <b>the</b> <b>Montana</b> Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman Trail through Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of <b>the</b> <b>Montana</b> Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived to tear up Alder Gulch to gather more gold. Gold dredge placer mining and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the dredge tailings along Alder Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{construction}} of the Iowa class, the US Navy was not building a fast battleship class solely for the purpose of escorting Pacific-based aircraft carriers, and thus <b>the</b> <b>Montana</b> class would not be designed principally for escorting the fast carrier task forces; nonetheless they would have been equipped with a wide array of anti-aircraft guns to protect themselves and other ships (principally the US aircraft carriers) from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. If commissioned, the ships were expected to mount a considerable array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft weapons.|$|E

The fine in Montana for not wearing a seat belt in 2015 was $20.

Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither U.S. or state highways.|$|E
