5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but he was able <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife {{because he had been}} looking forward to scoring it.|$|E
5|$|Randy Orton began a {{feud with}} Ric Flair, after Flair {{was the one}} {{responsible}} for making Orton lose the match against Batista. Orton commented on every accomplishment that Flair had made and criticized him for calling Triple H the greatest wrestler of all. Flair retaliated to Orton's comments, stating that individuals like Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley, who Orton had previously feuded with, were not legends, therefore Orton was not a Legend Killer. Flair also stated that he and Orton would have a match at Taboo Tuesday and the fans would have the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> type of match they face in. At Taboo Tuesday, Orton and Flair met in a Steel Cage match, which was the fans selection. Orton won the match after delivering an RKO to Flair. After the match, Flair shook Orton's hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann, Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson, three children who had played the game Adventure and wanted to create a similar game in Swedish. The Cottage began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an amusement arcade <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> to play; as they found it more fun to move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm.|$|E

50|$|According to Hare, prescriptivists cannot {{argue that}} amoralists are logically wrong or contradictive. Everyone can <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> follow moral {{commands}} or not. This {{is the human}} condition according to the Christian reinterpretation of the Choice of Heracles. According to prescriptivism, morality is not about knowledge (of moral facts), but about character (<b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> do the right thing). Actors cannot externalize their responsibility and freedom of will towards some moral truth in the world, virtuous people don't need to wait for some cognition <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what's</b> right.|$|R
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E

25|$|Patrick Olivelle {{suggests}} that the Hindu ashrama system of life, created probably around the 4th-century BCE, {{was an attempt to}} institutionalize renunciation within the Brahmanical social structure. This system gave complete freedom to adults <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> they want to do, whether they want to be householders or sannyasins (ascetics), the monastic tradition was a voluntary institution. This voluntary principle, states Olivelle, was the same principle found in Buddhist and Jain monastic orders at that time.|$|E
25|$|Attentional control {{refers to}} an individual's {{capacity}} <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> they pay attention to and what they ignore.

5000|$|A key {{concept in}} {{defining}} simplicial homology {{is the notion}} of an orientation of a simplex. By definition, an orientation of a k-simplex is given by an ordering of the vertices, written as (v0,...,vk), with the rule that two orderings define the same orientation if and only if they differ by an even permutation. Thus every simplex has exactly two orientations, and switching the order of two vertices changes an orientation to the opposite orientation. For example, choosing an orientation of a 1-simplex amounts <b>to</b> <b>choosing</b> one of the two possible directions, and choosing an orientation of a 2-simplex amounts <b>to</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>what</b> [...] "counterclockwise" [...] should mean.|$|R

The working and middle classes did not have the luxury being able <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> they would eat and they believed that a mixed diet was a valuable source of energy.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the medical}} considerations, Jehovah Witnesses {{advocate}} that physicians should uphold {{the right of a}} patient <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion). Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out {{of his or her own}} requests. However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France.|$|E

Opponents also held that legal speech would be made criminal by COPA, and that adults would be prevented from seeing legal content {{if they did not}} have a credit card to get past security screens. It was also argued that in some cases fully complying with COPA would not have guaranteed freedom from prosecution (Stevens) and that the plan was flawed because some minors do have their own credit cards, and could thus go around the screens with ease.|$|E
25|$|A later {{addition}} was {{the ability}} to track the velocity of the targets, a concept taken from the US work on their X2 model. This used an integrating circuit to measure the difference in position between subsequent measurements of any given track. This information was also fed to a separate analog computer that automatically calculated intercept locations, making the plotting of multiple intercepts much easier. This version also added additional inputs that transmitted readiness information from the aircraft carriers and missile cruisers, allowing the intercept officers <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> weapons to assign to a given target. This information was passed from ship to ship using a new data link known as the Digital Plot Transmission (DPT) system that could also share the tracks.|$|E
25|$|The 21 past Dark Ones, led by Nimue, {{bring the}} {{residents}} {{to the lake}} that will {{take them to the}} Underworld, and act as a barrier to keep them from escaping. Hook appears to help Nimue carry out the plan as Emma is left to watch. Regina then reminds Hook that he is unable to destroy Emma's family because he has changed as a person, and urges him <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>what</b> kind of person he wants to be. Emma attempts to stop the Dark Ones from sacrificing her family, but Nimue starts choking Emma, despite being unable to kill her, to keep her from interfering. As Hook watches, he realizes the truth behind what Regina said, and uses Excalibur to absorb all of the darkness from Nimue and the Dark Ones into himself, which also traps all of the past Dark Ones inside Excalibur. Hook then asks Emma to kill him to destroy the Darkness, in order to allow him to die as a hero. A sad, crying Emma goes through with his wishes and kills Hook with Excalibur, which kills all of the previous Dark Ones. As Hook dies, his neck wound from Excalibur returns, and Emma is transformed back into her normal self, with Excalibur disintegrating afterwards.|$|E

50|$|In this interpretation, {{the theory}} is that the Invisible Hand states that if each {{consumer}} is allowed <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> freely <b>what</b> <b>to</b> buy and each producer is allowed <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> freely <b>what</b> <b>to</b> sell and how to produce it, the market will settle on a product distribution and prices that are beneficial to all the individual members of a community, and hence to the community as a whole. The {{reason for this is that}} self-interest drives actors to beneficial behavior in a case of serendipity. Efficient methods of production are adopted to maximize profits. Low prices are charged to maximize revenue through gain in market share by undercutting competitors. Investors invest in those industries most urgently needed to maximize returns, and withdraw capital from those less efficient in creating value. All these effects take place dynamically and automatically.|$|R
