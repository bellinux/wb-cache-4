5|$|In Saw, Jigsaw {{has just}} {{concluded}} the bathroom trap of Lawrence Gordon and Adam Stanheight, {{an incident that}} occurred {{at the end of}} the first film. David Tapp, a police officer who had his throat damaged by Jigsaw's knife and was later shot in the chest by a suspect named Zep Hindle, has been healed and is brought to Whitehurst insane asylum, an abandoned sanitarium with a reputation for medieval tactics and frequent patient abuse. <b>The</b> <b>asylum</b> has many areas, most of which contain a key trap scene for Tapp to solve. A large part of <b>the</b> <b>asylum</b> consists of cells that were at one time used to hold the criminally insane. Jigsaw placed traps all around <b>the</b> <b>asylum</b> to continue his tests of will for Detective Tapp and his apprentice, Amanda Young, who monitors Tapp as the story progresses.|$|E
5|$|In Saw, The Jigsaw Killer has healed Detective David Tapp {{from his}} gunshot wound, and places {{him in an}} {{abandoned}} insane asylum to teach him a lesson in life appreciation.

5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in <b>the</b> <b>asylum</b> warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of <b>the</b> <b>asylum</b> setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into <b>the</b> <b>asylum.</b> To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E

5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as <b>the</b> <b>Asylum</b> where they keep insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from <b>the</b> <b>Asylum.</b> The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: the survivor of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to have spent a year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's force-field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force-field is still too strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to protect them from the planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E

50|$|While {{superintendent}} of the hospital, Seldon H. Talcott began using a range of physical activity as treatment for mental disorders. In 1888, they founded a team composed of patients, staff, {{and some of the}} best amateur baseball players in the region. The team began play in 1889 as <b>the</b> <b>Asylums</b> playing other teams in the region. By 1890, the team was playing regional teams from New York City and elsewhere winning 21 games out of 25. This included a split with the Cuban Giants, one of the top baseball teams at the time. In 1891, they narrowly lost a game with the New York Giants, who had finished 3rd in the National League that year, 4-3. In 1892, the team went undefeated except for two narrow losses to the New York Giants defeating the Cuban Giants, the New York Gothams, and many other teams from New York and New Jersey. Over the next few years, a number of excellent semi-pro players played for <b>the</b> <b>Asylums.</b> Many were recruited directly from <b>the</b> <b>Asylums</b> to professional baseball. With increased caseloads in the 1890s, the baseball focus of the Middletown hospital decreased and <b>the</b> <b>Asylums</b> withered away.|$|R

Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Jokerwho is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake <b>the</b> <b>asylum.</b> Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing.

Cobbe alerted the Commissioners in Lunacy, whose report by Bryan Procter led to her release in May 1848. Louisa then sued her brother, cousin and brother-in-law, Frederick Ripley, for abduction and false imprisonment in Nottidge v.
