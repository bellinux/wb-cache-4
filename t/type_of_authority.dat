50|$|The first type {{discussed}} by Weber is Rational-legal authority. It is that form of authority which depends for its legitimacy on formal rules and established {{laws of the}} state, which are usually written down and are often very complex. The power of the rational legal authority is mentioned in the constitution. Modern societies depend on legal-rational authority. Government officials wield this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in most countries of the world. Bureaucracies {{are the result of}} this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{religion}} which evolves its own priesthood and {{establishes a}} set of laws and rules is likely to lose its charismatic character and move towards another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> For example, Muhammad, who had charismatic authority as [...] "The Prophet" [...] among his followers, was succeeded by the traditional authority and structure of Islam, a clear example of routinization.|$|E

50|$|The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> is Traditional authority, which {{derives from}} {{long-established}} customs, habits and social structures. When power passes {{from one generation}} to another, then it is known as traditional authority. The right of hereditary monarchs to rule furnishes an obvious example. The Tudor dynasty in England and the ruling families of Mewar, in Rajasthan (India) are some examples of traditional authority.|$|E

This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> has {{the confidence to}} leave the right of leaders to undertake the decisions and set the policy.

40|$|There are {{different}} {{and at times}} contradictory concepts of Charismatic and Farrahmandaneh authority. Some researchers and translators have used these concepts interchangeably. There are, however, fundamental differences between these two. Based on the three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in Weber`s view, in this article I have tried to clarify the meanings and boundaries of them. To do this, basic dimensions of the three Weberian <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> are discussed along with Farrahmandaneh authority in order to clarify the status <b>of</b> Farrahmandaneh <b>authority</b> in Weber`s intellectual system. Since the concept <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and different forms of it are understood and interpreted in different epistemic systems, to achieve a comprehensive understanding of it and in particular, to compare the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> Weberian <b>authority</b> with Farrahmandaneh authority, one has to rely on sociology, political science, and even history and literature. As far as the limits and {{scope of this article}} allow, the interdisciplinary nature of this concept has been in the forefront. The results show that despite some similarities, Farrahmandaneh authority has major differences with Charismatic authority. In fact, Farrahmandaneh authority is a kind <b>of</b> traditional <b>authority</b> which due to structural factors contains some dimensions <b>of</b> Charismatic <b>authority</b> as well. ...|$|R

50|$|The Church of England claimed this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> {{over the}} people of England, but the idea is no longer popular within the church. owing {{to a lack of}} commonly-accepted traditions and to {{disputes}} as to some peripheral doctrines. However, Anglicanism holds to a unique ecclesiology: in the Anglican view, the ancient and historic churches (such as the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Orienta churches) that maintained apostolic succession, belief, and practice are all branches of the Universal Church and {{there will always be a}} section of this tripartite church which will not fall into major heresy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, while Wyoming was {{transitioning}} from a territory into statehood, the WSGA {{was one of}} the few large scale organizations that wielded any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in the region. WSGA members also formed the core of the famous Cheyenne Club, located at 17th Street and Warren Avenue in Wyoming’s capital city. It was founded primarily by young men from prominent east coast, British, and European families and became one of the wealthiest and most exclusive establishments on the frontier. The membership not only lavishly entertained socialites, celebrities, and foreign dignitaries at the club, but also was highly instrumental in molding the state’s early political, economic, and social infrastructures.|$|E
5000|$|The two {{highest ranking}} {{ordinary}} magistrates, the consuls and praetors, held a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> called imperium (Latin for [...] "command"). Imperium allowed a magistrate to command a military force. Consuls held a higher grade of imperium than praetors. Consuls and praetors, {{as well as}} censors and curule aediles, were regarded as [...] "curule magistrates". They would sit on a curule chair, which {{was a symbol of}} state power. Consuls and praetors where attended by bodyguards called lictors. The lictors would carry fasces. The fasces, which consisted of a rod with an embedded axe, were symbols of the coercive power of the state. Quaestors were not curule magistrates, but rather, administrators and had little real power.|$|E

50|$|Max Weber, in his sociological and {{philosophical}} work, identified and distinguished three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> legitimate domination (Herrschaft in German, which generally means 'domination' or 'rule'), that have sometimes been rendered in English translation as <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> because domination isn't {{seen as a}} political concept in the first place. Weber defined domination (authority) as the chance of commands being obeyed by a specifiable group <b>of</b> people. Legitimate <b>authority</b> is that which is recognized as legitimate and justified by both the ruler and the ruled.|$|R
50|$|In 1905, Tikhomirov {{authored}} his largest work, the four-volume On Monarchist Statehood, which {{quickly became}} the ideological basis for the Russian monarchist movement. In it he asserted the existence of authority as a fundamental regulatory force in society. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> - democratic, aristocratic, or monarchic - is rooted to the moral and psychological state of the society. Tikhomirov wrote:If a powerful moral ideal exists in a society, an ideal calling all to voluntary obedience to, and service of, one another, then it brings about monarchy because {{the existence of this}} ideal negates the need for physical force (democracy) or the rule of an elite (aristocracy). All that is necessary is the continual expression of this moral ideal. The most capable vehicle for this expression is one individual placed in a position of complete independence from all external political forces.|$|E
50|$|Research has {{indicated}} that compliance techniques have become a major asset to numerous forms of advertising, including Internet shopping sites. Techniques are used to communicate essential information intended to persuade customers. Advertisements {{and other forms of}} marketing typically play on the customers' need for informative and normative social influence. The people in the advertisements and the ads themselves serve as a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> They are credible—especially in regards to the product. As a result, customers' need to be accurate drives them to comply with the ad's message and to purchase a product that an authority claims he or she needs. Secondly, people have the need to belong. Customers often comply with ads by purchasing certain merchandise in the hopes of affiliating with a particular group. Because compliance techniques play at psychological needs they are frequently successful in selling a product; the use of fear is often less persuasive.|$|E
5000|$|Sheikh Ghazi's {{selection}} as interim president, at first resisted and then {{accepted by the}} American administrators in Iraq, is further recognition of the tribal revival at this time. Although this post was described as largely ceremonial, it in fact exercised both symbolic and political sway. As a Sunni tribal leader, he reassured his fellow Sunnis while also representing a familiar <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> figure for the tribal Kurds, and embodying traditional values esteemed by Shiite religious figures. Faleh A. Jabar, {{a senior fellow at}} the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, called Sheikh Ghazi [...] "a tribal figure who knows modern ways, not a modern leader who knows tribal ways. He is clever, cautious in choosing words and values the seniority of age, a supreme value in tribal people. Being a sheikh, you have to give the lead to each and everyone except yourself." ...|$|E
