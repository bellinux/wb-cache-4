5|$|St Hill {{was born}} in Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1904, and {{according}} to the writer C. L. R. James, his family were lower middle-class. His brothers, Wilton and Cyl played cricket for Trinidad; in addition, the former played Test matches for the West Indies. St Hill first played in the Bonanza Cup, Trinidad's main cricket competition, for a club called Durban Cricket Club in 1922; critics judged him to be promising, but he had little success. The following year, he moved to play for Shannon. Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines. Shannon was a club associated with black lower middle-class players such as <b>teachers</b> <b>or</b> clerks. The team contained many strong bowlers, and St Hill opened the bowling.|$|E

5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, <b>teachers,</b> <b>or</b> caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, {{before his}} father imposed {{a ban on}} {{competitive}} cricket, Constantine had played briefly for Shannon Cricket Club; {{he returned to the}} club in 1920. Initially, he appeared in the second team, but after scoring 50 runs in an hour during his third game, was promoted to the first eleven. Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines; Shannon was mainly for black lower middle-class players such as <b>teachers</b> <b>or</b> clerks. The club was competitive and highly motivated, partly as a reaction to the racial discrimination that its players and supporters encountered in their daily lives. Constantine's cricket thrived in this atmosphere, and the club helped to form some of his political views. He particularly noticed that in Trinidadian and West Indian cricket, white and light-skinned players were often favoured over black players of greater ability.|$|E
