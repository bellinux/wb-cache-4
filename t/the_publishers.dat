5|$|After {{many years}} in which almost all of Gibbons's output {{has been out of}} print, in 2011 <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> Vintage Classics reissued {{paperback}} versions of Westwood, Starlight, and Conference at Cold Comfort Farm. They also announced plans to publish 11 of the other novels, on a print-on-demand basis.|$|E
5|$|Although the Attorney General, William de Grey, {{advised that}} <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> should again be prosecuted, Mansfield disagreed, {{saying that if}} they {{failed to respond to}} Junius, he would become bored and stop writing. Mansfield was evidently correct, because other than a letter printed on 5 October 1771, Junius ceased to write at the {{beginning}} of 1772.|$|E

50|$|After <b>the</b> funeral, <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> {{secretly}} exhumes Jerome's {{body from}} the tomb and has Jerome's skin, still bearing the writing, flayed and made into a grotesque pillow book of his own. Nagiko, now back in Japan, learns of <b>the</b> <b>publisher's</b> actions and becomes distraught and outraged. She sends a letter to <b>the</b> <b>publisher,</b> still keeping her identity a secret, demanding that particular book from <b>the</b> <b>publisher's</b> hands {{in exchange for the}} remaining books. <b>The</b> <b>publisher,</b> now obsessed with his mysterious writer and her work, agrees.|$|R
40|$|In literate societies, {{publication}} {{is a major}} mode of {{the dissemination}} of knowledge. Far from being a neutral middleman in this process, <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> influences both <b>the</b> production and consumption of intellectual works. <b>The</b> <b>publisher</b> forms {{an important part of}} the institutional setting in which authorship takes place. By commis- sioning authors to write some works, and through his influence at the editorial stage, <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> influences <b>the</b> content of what is written. <b>The</b> <b>publisher</b> acts as a gatekeeper, determining which works will be made avail- able to the public. He oversees the reproduction of works in multiple copies, determining the kind of book which is made from a work. Although normally not responsible for the distribution of books to consumers, <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> plays a role in distribution both across geographical space and to different groups of readers. Through his role at the stages of production, assessment, reproduction and distribution, <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> influences <b>the</b> consumption of knowledge. However, consumers also influence <b>the</b> <b>publisher,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> 2 ̆ 7 s decisions are made in light of his conception of the audience...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the less}} {{enthusiastic}} response The Flood garnered than its predecessor, the book still sold well. Soon after release, The Flood made <b>the</b> <b>Publishers</b> Weekly top ten bestsellers paperback list.

5|$|Parker Brothers/Hasbro now claims {{trademark}} {{rights to the}} name and its variants, and has asserted it against others such as <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> of Ghettopoly. Professor Anspach assigned the Anti-Monopoly trademark back to Parker Brothers, and Hasbro now owns it. Anspach's game remains in print. The previous publishers were a company called Talicor, but the game is currently distributed and sold by University Games worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{attempt at}} a BDM-type method was by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. [...] In 1797 he asked a {{publisher}} how much {{he would be willing}} to pay for his new poem Hermann and Dorothea and revealed that he had sent a sealed letter to his lawyer with a reserve amount. If <b>the</b> <b>publisher's</b> stated amount was greater than <b>the</b> reserve, <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> just paid <b>the</b> reserve amount. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> did not receive the poem. Unfortunately, Goethe's lawyer divulged the reserve amount to <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>publisher's</b> true willingness to pay was not revealed.|$|R

5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket. This project, too, {{became the subject of}} many {{iterations}} and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. <b>The</b> <b>publishers,</b> mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.|$|E
5|$|This, David's fourth book, {{reverted to}} some extent to {{the pattern of the}} first two, drawing {{extensively}} on her articles previously published in magazines. She had severed her ties with <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> Macdonalds, who had acquired the publishing rights to her first three books when her original publisher was forced out of business. Her new publisher was the Museum Press of London. The illustrations were by Adrian Daintrey.|$|E
5|$|Trollope's {{fortunes}} suffered {{because of}} the mode of the novel's publication. Owing to mismanagement by <b>the</b> <b>publishers,</b> it was not serialised in a popular magazine, as originally intended. Instead, it was issued as monthly numbers, a form of serialisation that had become unpopular with the reading public, and Trollope lost readers as a result.|$|E
30|$|Concerning the CDC error, <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> must be {{eliminated}} or replaced because the editor relationship, having a name similar <b>the</b> <b>publisher,</b> cannot be a dimension {{for the sale}} fact.

5|$|Two {{days after}} the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the cases of {{copyright}} infringement and won. <b>The</b> <b>publishers</b> declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay £700 in costs. The small profits Dickens earned from A Christmas Carol further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of Bradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript {{to his friend}} (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to <b>the</b> <b>publishers,</b> Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 {{on the recommendation of}} Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously. All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.|$|E
5|$|As Tokyo Mew Mew {{became a}} viable project, Kodansha hired Reiko Yoshida {{to be the}} series' {{scenario}} writer and story supervisor. Yoshida and two other editors determined each volume's plot, created a scenario by adding stage directions and dialogue, and presented it to Ikumi. Ikumi added her own ideas and changes, creating the manuscript's first draft, which was taken to <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> for final review and approval. This differs from most manga series, in which the manga writer also creates the scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{sponsored}} search auctions advertisers typically pay a fixed {{amount per}} click that their advertisements receive. In particular, the advertiser and <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> {{enter into a contract}} (e. g., <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> displays <b>the</b> ad; the advertiser pays <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> 10 cents per click), and each party’s subjective value for such a contract depends on their estimated click-through rates (CTR) for the ad. Starting from this motivating example, we define and analyze a class of contract auctions that generalize the classical second price auction. As an application, we introduce impression-plus-click pricing for sponsored search, in which advertisers pay {{a fixed amount}} per impression plus an additional amount if their ad is clicked. Of note, when the advertiser’s estimated CTR is higher than <b>the</b> <b>publisher’s</b> estimated CTR, both parties find negative click payments advantageous, where the advertiser pays <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> a premium for the impression but <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> then pays <b>the</b> advertiser per click. ...|$|R
5|$|As the {{paperback}} book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote {{that she was}} told to make the relationship end badly in Spring Fire because <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> {{were concerned about the}} books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service. Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.|$|E
5|$|Based on a 1961 William Overgard {{drawing for}} a Steve Roper cartoon story {{published}} by <b>the</b> <b>Publishers</b> Syndicate on August 6, 1961, Lichtenstein’s I Can See the Whole Room!...and There's Nobody in It! (1961) measures four-foot by four-foot {{and is in}} graphite and oil. The painting depicts a man looking {{through a hole in}} a door. His finger is extended to open a circular peephole, while simultaneously allowing the artist to present his face. The painting also uses a speech balloon.|$|E
5|$|Gyles v Wilcox (1740) 26 ER 489 was a {{decision}} of the Court of Chancery of England that established the doctrine of fair abridgement, which would later evolve into the concept of fair use. The case was heard and the opinion written by Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, and concerned Fletcher Gyles, a bookseller who had published a copy of Matthew Hale's Pleas of the Crown. Soon after the initial publication, <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> Wilcox and Nutt hired a writer named Barrow to abridge the book, and repackaged it as Modern Crown Law. Gyles sued for a stay on the book's publishing, claiming his rights under the Statute of Anne had been infringed.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, {{he made it clear}} to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication.

5|$|In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit as an {{addition}} to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by <b>the</b> <b>publishers</b> to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 {{and the only one}} not written by Potter. The book falls {{in the middle of the}} earlier series, rather than at the end, and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. It was a New York Times Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
