5|$|The 300 pages {{removed from}} the A Game of Thrones {{manuscript}} served as {{the opening of the}} second book, entitled A Clash of Kings. It was released in February 1999 in the United States, with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages. A Clash of Kings was the first book of <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Fire series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on The New York Times Best Seller list in 1999. After the success of The Lord of the Rings films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Fire series from various producers and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Books in <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Fire {{series are}} first {{published}} in hardcover and are later re-released as paperback editions. In the UK, Harper Voyager publishes special slipcased editions. The series has also been translated into more than 30 languages. All page totals given below are for the US first editions.|$|E

The analysis included the physical, chemical and isotopic properties of the gases trapped in <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>the</b> soluble <b>and</b> insoluble material in <b>the</b> melted <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water from <b>the</b> melted <b>ice.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>the</b> river <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> frazil <b>ice</b> were important for {{study of the}} ice-covered river. However, {{it was difficult to}} investigate <b>the</b> river <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> frazil <b>ice</b> thickness <b>and</b> behavior on the ice-covered river. We enabled to measure <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> layer thickness using the snow depth meter, the depth sounder, <b>and</b> SWIP(Shallow Water <b>Ice</b> Profiler). <b>And</b> we could investigate time series {{behavior of}} <b>the</b> river <b>ice</b> internal structure that was snowfalls, <b>the</b> river <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> frazil <b>ice.</b> Especially, we could understand the behavior of <b>the</b> suspended frazil <b>ice</b> that existed in water by using SWIP. As a result, <b>the</b> suspended frazil <b>ice</b> would originate in the weather condition such as the snowfalls and temperature. And at the Break-up, <b>the</b> suspended frazil <b>ice</b> would exist by high concentration from the upper stream transportation by the rise of the water temperature. This study presented the time series measurement technique of thickness and behavior of <b>the</b> river <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> frazil <b>ice...</b>|$|R

5|$|Leaving the Flames organization, McGrattan {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Anaheim Ducks, and was subsequently assigned to the AHL's San Diego Gulls for the 2015â€“16 season. During a January 19, 2016, game against the San Antonio Rampage, McGrattan was knocked unconscious {{in a fight with}} Daniel Maggio. The incident, in which he fell face-first to <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> had to be stretchered off the ice, renewed the debate over the place of fighting in hockey.|$|E
5|$|The club {{began the}} 1930s decade successfully, with Stanley Cup wins in 1930 and 1931. The Canadiens and its then-Montreal rival, the Montreal Maroons, {{declined}} both on <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> economically during the Great Depression. Losses grew {{to the point}} where the team owners considering selling the team to interests in Cleveland, Ohio, though local investors were ultimately found to finance the Canadiens. The Maroons still suspended operations, and several of their players moved to the Canadiens.|$|E
5|$|The media hype he has {{encountered}} has led Tavares to remain guarded when {{speaking to the}} media, while his teammates and family attempt to shield him from the spotlight where they can. However, Tavares {{is regarded as a}} natural leader on <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> a player who puts his team first. The Oshawa Generals named Tavares their team captain in 2008, while he also served as the alternate captain with the Canadian junior team in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The rest of {{the year}} (late summer and fall), {{walruses}} tend to form massive aggregations {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific walruses migrate from the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.|$|E
5|$|Wild had {{thoughts}} of a second, more productive season in <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> took {{the ship to}} Cape Town for a refit. Here, in June 1922, he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. The Quest voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, due to the event that defines it in public memory, overshadowing its other activities: Shackleton's untimely death.|$|E
5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, <b>the</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Sea <b>Ice</b> Physics <b>and</b> Ecosystem eXperiment (SIPEX) was an Australian {{contribution}} to the International Polar Year (IPY).

5|$|As plans {{moved forward}} the {{decision}} was made not just to play the game but make it an event celebrating New York hockey history. For the game the Crunch played their intrastate rivals the Binghamton Senators. The days before the game local youth hockey teams played on <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> then the day after there was a pond hockey tournament played on the rink featuring 16 local teams. The fairgrounds also featured VIP tents, fan zones, bands, and ice sculpting for the celebration, as well as appearances by former players for New York's various professional teams.|$|E
5|$|Endurance {{departed}} from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, first year ice was encountered, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, Endurance became frozen fast in an ice floe. On 24 February, realising {{that she would}} be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> its later movements put extreme pressures on the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and NÃ¦sheim {{held onto}} BÃ¥genholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first BÃ¥genholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to BÃ¥genholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> pulled her through at 19:40. BÃ¥genholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E

5|$|Ice {{was also}} transported by {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the {{first use of}} the technique being on the track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company. A special railroad car was built to insulate <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> equipment designed to allow the cars to be loaded. In 1842 a new railroad to Fitchburg was used to access the ice at Walden Pond. Ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally awkward to transport. By the 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across the North American continent.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, {{it was not possible}} to exactly confirm the locations of the holes, and nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Mulder finds Scully {{underground}} in Antarctica, {{in a large}} facility containing many {{humans in}} ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E

Since 1 October 2006, smoking is prohibited in the bistro coaches, similar to the restaurant cars, which have always been non-smoking.|$|R
5|$|Ships {{carrying}} ice {{needed to}} be particularly strong {{and there was a}} premium placed on recruiting good crews, able to move the cargo quickly to its location before it melted. By the end of the 19th century, the preferred choice was a wooden-hulled vessel, to avoid rust corrosion from the melting ice, while windmill pumps were installed to remove the excess water from the hull using bilge pumps. Ice cargoes tended to cause damage to ships in the longer term, as the constant melting of <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> the resulting water and steam encouraged dry rot. Shipment sizes varied; depending on the ports and route. The typical late 19th century U.S. vessel was a schooner, carrying around 600 tons (500,000kg) of ice; a large shipment from Norway to England might include up to 900 tons (800,000kg).|$|E
5|$|Six days later, on {{the advice}} of Stepan Khojiants, the village chief of Akhuri, the ascent was {{attempted}} from the northwest side. After reaching an elevation of , they turned back because they did not reach the summit before sundown. They reached the summit on their third attempt at 3:15 p.m. on October 9, 1829. Abovian dug a hole in <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> erected a wooden cross facing north. Abovian picked up a chunk of ice from the summit and carried it down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On November 8, Parrot and Abovian climbed up Lesser Ararat. Years later, in 1845, the German mineralogist Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich climbed Ararat with Abovian. Abovian's third and last ascent of Ararat was with the Englishman Henry Danby Seymour in 1846.|$|E
5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1â€“0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick on <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> {{when he saw the}} misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised. Parise nearly swung his stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice. Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted {{in the rest of the}} game being refereed capably.|$|E
