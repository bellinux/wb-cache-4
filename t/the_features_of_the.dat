5|$|Half-Life: Source {{has been}} criticized for not fully {{utilizing}} many of <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Source engine found in Half-Life 2, as it still uses textures and models from the original game. In response to this, a third-party mod remake called Black Mesa was developed. The first part of the Black Mesa modification was released on September 14, 2012, with the second promised to be coming later.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, it was {{announced}} that the series would be adapted for Russia. On September 20, 2010, the Russian adaptation premiered on Channel One. This adaptation uses many of <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original series, with some scenes and dialogue copied completely, but also introduces new storylines and characters which reflects the Russian reality.|$|E
5|$|The New Testament {{gives no}} {{description}} of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death—it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people it mentions.

5|$|Before {{the release}} of StarCraft, Blizzard Entertainment {{released}} a free-to-download game demo entitled Loomings, comprising three missions and a tutorial. The prequel was made available for the full game in October 1999 as a custom map campaign, adding two extra missions and hosting it on Battle.net. In addition, the full release of StarCraft included a secondary campaign entitled Enslavers. Consisting of five missions played as both the Terrans and the Protoss, Enslavers {{is set in the}} second campaign in StarCraft and follows the story of a Terran smuggler who manages to take control of a Zerg cerebrate and is pursued by both the Protoss and Terran Dominion. Enslavers acts as an exemplar single-player campaign for the game's level editor, highlighting how to use <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program.|$|E
5|$|Building on <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> XT, Ford Australia at {{one point}} {{considered}} not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 {{because of the new}} XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally aspirated engine was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came as standard.|$|E
5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate {{in the side of}} a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, and based on <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler {{referred to it as}} the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E
5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais retains <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{outgoing}} model {{but at a}} {{lower price}} point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the High Output Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, an upscale V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range based on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner, who, with his son (also an architect) Avery Coonley Faulkner, later became significant contributors {{to the design of}} George Washington University and American University in Washington, D.C. The design ties the building to the land {{in the style of the}} Prairie School, at the same time employing the handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American Arts and Crafts (or American Craftsman) style. The easy access to the outdoors, ground floor classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor play area are among <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design that would later be adopted by schools throughout the US after World War II.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{natural harbour}} around Wadamisaki {{peninsula}} has meant the port in Hyogo {{has been an}} important gateway to the Seto inland sea since the 8th century Nara period. In the 12th century, {{in the latter part of}} the Heian period, Taira no Kiyomori recognized the strategic benefit of the location and developed the harbor, including the building of , a man-made island completed in 1173 and described as 37 hectares in size in The Tale of the Heike. Kiyomori, the de facto ruler of Japan between 1160 and 1180, moved his official residence to Fukuhara, in what is modern-day Hyogo. Fukuhara became the capital of Japan for a brief period near the end of Kiyomori's rule. A monument erected shortly after his death, the Kiyomori-zuka, stands in the gardens of a shrine opposite Kiyomori Bridge, also named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of numbers}} and {{political}} {{isolation of the}} country at the time caused {{the creation of a new}} breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The middlegame is {{the part}} of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, but {{typically}} the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see start of the endgame.) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position, {{and at the same time}} take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pastoral {{scene in}} an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by {{the clock on the}} church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front {{part of the}} zygomatic arch, is narrow, with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front, but there is considerable variation in <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the bony palate, is very narrow. In the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, extend to near the front margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates {{the root of the}} incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the chewing edge in the horizontal plane) to slightly opisthodont (with the chewing edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E
5|$|Medieval: Total War was {{originally}} announced by The Creative Assembly on 3 August 2001, with the working title of Crusader: Total War. Development {{of the game}} started shortly {{after the release of}} Shogun: Total War. Early in development it was decided to change the name to Medieval: Total War; this was to have a name that better reflected the scope of the game. In a press release, The Creative Assembly announced that the game would be published by Activision instead of Electronic Arts, the publisher of the previous games. The Creative Assembly also outlined <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, including the game covering the medieval era from the 11th to 15th century, with players being able to participate in various historical scenarios of the time, such as the Hundred Years' War. Media releases over the subsequent months gave screenshots of the game, with more information on Medieval: Total War's features. The game uses an updated version of the game engine used in , allowing larger battles than previously possible with an increased troop limit of ten thousand. The improved game engine also allowed more battle maps than previously possible, now based upon where the conflicting armies are located on the strategy map. Other new battlefield enhancements included terrain detailed with villages and vegetation and improved castle siege mechanics, with players now having to focus on destroying the walls before assaulting and capturing the castle. The game features improved artificial intelligence from Shogun: Total War, with the individual unit AI and the tactical AI—which controls the overall army tactics—separated to more effectively control the opposing forces.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, saber-toothed cats {{have been}} artistically {{restored}} with external features {{similar to those}} of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G.J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.|$|E
