5|$|Due to flirtations with {{characters}} of various genders and sexuality, fans have speculated Deadpool as pan- or omnisexual. Writers Gerry Duggan and Gail Simone, {{as well as}} Terry Miller, {{the director of the}} Deadpool film, accepts the fan theory. However, Fabian Nicieza, one of the creators of the character, stated on Twitter that such speculation on his sexuality is invalid because his “brain cells are in CONSTANT FLUX. He can be gay one minute, hetero the next, etc.” <b>The</b> <b>comment</b> upset many fans, for it suggests that Deadpool’s sexuality is linked to his mental disorder.|$|E

Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. <b>The</b> <b>comment</b> resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates whether Web {{comments}} are of descriptive nature, that is, whether the combined text {{of a set}} of comments is similar in topic to <b>the</b> <b>commented</b> object. If so, comments may be used in place of the respective object in all kinds of cross-media re-trieval tasks. Our experiments reveal that comments on textual ob-jects are indeed descriptive: 10 comments suffice to expect a high similarity between <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> and <b>the</b> <b>commented</b> text; 100 - 500 comments suffice to replace <b>the</b> <b>commented</b> text in a ranking task, and to measure the contribution of the commenters beyond <b>the</b> <b>commented</b> text...|$|R

After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E

5|$|The team then faced Birmingham City at St Andrew's. Shortly after kick-off, defender Martin Taylor {{was sent}} off and took no further {{part in the}} game, after his tackle on Eduardo. The player's {{challenge}} left the Arsenal striker with a broken leg; he was ruled out from action {{for the rest of}} the season. James McFadden scored through a free-kick in the 28th minute, before two Theo Walcott goals in the second half put Arsenal in the lead. In stoppage time, Gaël Clichy was penalised for a foul on Stuart Parnaby in the penalty area; McFadden scored Birmingham's awarded penalty to draw the match 2–2. It prompted Gallas to throw a tantrum: he attacked an advertising board situated on the side of the pitch and rested alone on the pitch, while his players headed for the dressing room.

25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness {{has been found to}} be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's comment is deemed an appropriate mind-related comment if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> encouraged the infant to go on with his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> is unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|E

Behind the discussion about the offensiveness or otherwise of <b>the</b> <b>comments</b> is what they reveal about the place of women in public life in general, and political life in particular.
