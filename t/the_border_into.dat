5|$|Bond {{returns to}} Bratislava {{to track down}} the cellist, Kara Milovy. He determines that Koskov's entire {{defection}} was staged, and that Kara is actually Koskov's girlfriend. Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskov's and persuades her to accompany him to Vienna, supposedly to be reunited with him. They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB, crossing over <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Austria. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker.|$|E
5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas, the {{dictator}} of Argentina, had assisted the separatist rebels in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul during the 1830s, {{and continued to}} attempt its annexation. In addition to the threat to Brazil's territorial integrity, Rosas had ambitions to conquer Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. Brazil's Conservative Cabinet decided to form military alliances with the countries threatened by {{the dictator}}. On 4 September 1851, Brazil's army, commanded by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (then Count of Caxias), crossed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Uruguay.|$|E

5|$|In February 1916, Wilson enlisted as {{a private}} in the Maryland National Guard and was posted to Company H, 5th Maryland Infantry. This unit was called to active duty at Laurel, Maryland in June 1916 for service on the Mexican border. It was based at Eagle Pass, Texas, and, like most National Guard units, {{supported}} but did not directly participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition, although it did occasionally cross <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Mexico. Wilson was soon promoted to corporal, and later sergeant. The 5th Maryland Regiment returned to Maryland in February 1917.|$|E
5|$|James Bond is {{assigned}} to aid the defection of a KGB officer, General Georgi Koskov, covering his escape from a concert hall in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia during intermission. During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskov's escape is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he instead shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the Trans-Siberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Austria {{and then on to}} Britain.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII's {{underestimation}} of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, {{the army}} stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital {{with a small}} escort at midnight. Louis decided to go first to Lille, and then crossed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, staying in Ghent. Other leaders, most prominently Alexander I of Russia, debated whether {{in the case of}} a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orléans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.|$|E

5|$|Major land runs, {{including}} the Land Run of 1889, were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement starting at a precise time. Usually land {{was open to}} settlers on a first come first served basis. Those who broke the rules by crossing <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> the territory before the official opening time {{were said to have}} been crossing the border sooner, leading to the term sooners, which eventually became the state's official nickname.|$|E
5|$|Tension between Tutsi and Hutu {{had been}} {{escalating}} during the 1950s, and {{culminated in the}} 1959 Rwandan Revolution. Hutu activists began killing Tutsi, forcing more than 100,000 to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Kagame's family abandoned their home, living {{for two years in}} the far northeast of Rwanda and eventually crossing <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Uganda. They moved gradually north, and settled in the Nshungerezi refugee camp in the Toro sub-region in 1962. It was around this time that, as young boys, Kagame and his future comrade, Fred Rwigyema, first met one another.|$|E
5|$|The Australians crossed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> South Africa and Davidson scored 100 {{and took}} a total of 4/62 against Transvaal as Craig's men started with a nine-wicket win. The next match was against a South African XI, and was {{effectively}} a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Davidson scored 34 {{and took a}} total of 7/103 as the Australians crushed the hosts by an innings. He rounded off his Test preparation with match figures of 6/35 against Border and a 76 against Western Province.|$|E

5|$|The French Basque Country {{had been}} a {{favourite}} haven of ETA. Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership had lived there and {{used it as a}} base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. ETA commandos also operated from there, crossing <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led to complaints in Spain that French authorities were not doing enough to tackle ETA activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E
5|$|The Kosovo {{conflict}} escalated {{over the}} summer of 1998, and the KLA increasingly took to smuggling weapons and supplies from Albania across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Kosovo. In September, Yugoslav officials stated that 90 militants had been killed while attempting to illegally cross the border since January of that year. The Yugoslav Defense Ministry reported that 947 rifles, 161 light machine guns, 33 mortars, 55 mines, 3,295 hand grenades, and almost 350,000 rounds of ammunition had been confiscated over the same period.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican Revolutionary General Pancho Villa, who had at {{one time}} been {{supported}} by the United States, felt betrayed when the Americans backed Carranza. In January 1916, Villa's followers, known as Villistas, attacked a train and killed 16 American businessmen who were aboard. Two months later Villa's men crossed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> the United States and attacked the town of Columbus, New Mexico, killing an additional 19 Americans. Following these attacks, General Pershing took his forces into Mexico to pursue Pancho Villa.|$|E
50|$|Rio Muni {{had a small}} population, officially put at {{a little}} over 100,000 in the 1930s. Its people could easily escape over <b>the</b> <b>borders</b> <b>into</b> Cameroon or Gabon.

5|$|The Native Americans' victory {{celebrations}} were short-lived. Public {{shock and}} outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's {{knowledge about the}} remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> the North-West Territories, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon {{and the chance to}} return. When crossing <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.|$|E
5|$|The drone attacks {{carried out}} by the CIA in Pakistan rely on local informants, who can cross <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base were involved in the coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the Haqqani network, a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E
5|$|When Indonesian forces crossed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Sebatik Island, Sabah on 28 June 1965, HMAS Yarra {{was called}} on to carry out bombardments disrupting the {{withdrawal}} of the Indonesians. Yarra carried out two more bombardments of the border area on 5 and 10 July. During three runs, Yarra fired a total of 70 rounds on the enemy. On 13 August 1966, an agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia brought an end to the conflict.|$|E

When conflict erupted, Owumi was trapped in Mutassim Gaddafi's apartment without food or electricity for several days {{in the midst of}} the violence before crossing <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Egypt, where he was arrested and detained. After his release, before returning home, he won the league championship with El-Olympi. Following his traumatic experience in Libya, he began competing in the BBL, firstly with the Worcester Wolves, with whom he won a league title, and then the London Lions and Surrey Scorchers.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{reports of}} a rebellion at York, Marius heads north to aid the defeated legion stationed there.

Basilius, threatens and forces King Oswald into revealing the location of Commodus, who has been traded to the fearsome men north of Hadrian's Wall. Basilius orders Vitallion and Marius to retrieve him. After crossing <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Caledonia, the party is ambushed, Vitallion is taken hostage by barbarians, and Marius is separated from his legion. Marius makes his way into the enemy camp, freeing and rallying captured Roman soldiers along the way. He kills the barbarian leader Glott and rescues Commodus and Vitallion from being burned inside a giant Wicker man.|$|E
5|$|After the Polish {{units were}} {{defeated}} by the Russians at Šiauliai, Gen. Chłapowski decided to cross <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>into</b> Prussia and become interned there. Plater vocally criticized that decision, refused to follow orders and instead {{decided to try to}} break through to Warsaw and continue the struggle. However, soon after separating from the main force, accompanied by only two others, including her cousin (or uncle, sources vary), Cezary Plater, she became seriously ill. She never recovered, and she died in a manor of the Abłamowicz family in Justinavas on 23 December 1831. She was buried in the small village of Kapčiamiestis near Lazdijai. After the defeat of the uprising, her estate was confiscated by the Russian authorities.|$|E
