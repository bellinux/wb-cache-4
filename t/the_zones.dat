5|$|The OBRC Checklist {{divides the}} {{province}} into the Lowlands, Central, and South review zones and requests documentation of sightings of birds which are rare or accidental in one, two, {{or all of}} <b>the</b> <b>zones.</b> Of the 496 species on the list, 167 are noted as rare anywhere in the province and another 108 are rare {{in one or two}} of <b>the</b> <b>zones.</b> Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the occupation, the Allies {{controlled}} traffic between <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> to manage the flow of refugees and prevent the escape of former Nazi officials and intelligence officers. These controls were gradually lifted in the Western zones, but were tightened between Western and Soviet zones in 1946 to stem a flow of economic and political refugees from the Soviet zone. Between October 1945 and June 1946, 1.6million Germans left the Soviet zone for the west.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. <b>The</b> <b>zones</b> have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E
2500|$|Until November 1942, the Germans called <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> libre [...] "Unbesetztes Gebiet" [...] or unoccupied <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> <b>zone</b> libre {{was also}} nicknamed <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> nono by <b>the</b> French, {{shortened}} from non occupée (unoccupied). <b>The</b> occupied <b>zone</b> accordingly became <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> jaja (yes-yes <b>zone).</b> <b>The</b> <b>zone</b> libre was {{also called the}} royaume du maréchal (Marshal Philippe Pétain's kingdom) by the French author Jacques Delperrié de Bayac.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>zone</b> {{which extends}} {{from the base of}} <b>the</b> {{euphotic}} <b>zone</b> to about 200 metres is sometimes called <b>the</b> disphotic <b>zone.</b> [...] While there is some light, it is insufficient for photosynthesis, or at least insufficient for photosynthesis at a rate greater than respiration. <b>The</b> euphotic <b>zone</b> together with <b>the</b> disphotic <b>zone</b> coincides with <b>the</b> epipelagic <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> bottommost <b>zone,</b> below <b>the</b> euphotic <b>zone,</b> is called <b>the</b> aphotic <b>zone.</b> Most deep ocean waters belong to this zone.|$|R
5|$|Just {{before midnight}} August 31, the NK I Corps started its portion of The Great Naktong Offensive, a coordinated attack {{all along the}} Pusan Perimeter with a goal of {{breaking}} the UN defensive lines and capturing Pusan.

5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} {{in the clouds}} of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when {{they are exposed to}} ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. <b>The</b> <b>zones</b> are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.|$|E

5|$|As {{implemented}} in October 1970, the CDH system {{is divided into}} eight zones: six in the Lower Peninsula and two in the Upper Peninsula. This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south or west sides of <b>the</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. <b>The</b> <b>zones</b> appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E

5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are rewarded with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|During a {{night out}} in the one of <b>the</b> <b>Zones</b> – the cordoned off zone of {{decaying}} ghettos surrounding the City of London – Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike's former mistress. Before they leave <b>the</b> <b>Zones,</b> Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader {{might be a better}} option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to shop for arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Columbia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, {{there were}} major {{issues to be}} decided. Germany was still {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, made up of <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> occupied by the three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September the {{regional}} commands {{were replaced by}} six operational zones, headquartered in Osijek, Bjelovar, Zagreb, Karlovac, Rijeka and Split. <b>The</b> <b>zones</b> possessed uneven strength; those in Slavonia and Dalmatia were heavily equipped, and the Zagreb zone had twice the average troop strength. After capturing a stockpile of weapons during the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded to 60 reserve brigades and independent battalions {{by the end of}} October (in addition to the four all-professional guards brigades). Although each brigade was planned to have 1,800 troops, in reality their size varied from 500 to 2,500. Three named special-forces battalions were also established within the ZNG (in addition to the Zrinski Battalion): the Frankopan, Kralj Tomislav and Matija Vlačić Battalions.|$|E

Nevertheless, Al•Ith descends to Zone Four and they reluctantly marry. Ben Ata is not used to the company of women he cannot control, and Al•Ith has difficulty relating to this ill-bred man, but in time they grow accustomed to each other and gain new insights into each other's Zones. Al•Ith is appalled that all of Zone Four's wealth goes into its huge armies, leaving the rest of its population poor and underdeveloped; Ben Ata is astounded that Zone Three has no army at all.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E
