Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him cell phones and money, applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state. Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation. Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton. Darcus Allen {{was arrested and charged with}} aggravated first-degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver. Allen claims he did not know Clemmons' plans when he drove him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> shop, but authorities argued he had known for days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers.|$|E
5|$|Sky and Lana {{start to}} {{trust each other}} a little, and during a sleepover {{organised}} by Serena, they discover that they both like black and white films. They bond, and Lana later watches Sky fall asleep. Sky realises that Lana has hidden depths and tells her. Lana gets upset and tells Sky {{that she is not}} hiding anything. Sky calls a friend who attended Wattle Heights High with Lana and finds out about the bullying that caused Lana to change schools. During a playfight at a sleepover, Lana suddenly kisses Sky. She runs {{out of the house and}} goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coffee</b> Shop, where she finds Sindi. Lana reveals to Sindi that she is gay. Lana admits that she does not want to lose Sky as a friend and tries to pass the kiss off as a joke. Sky tells Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) about the kiss, and Lana is later outed at school.|$|E
5|$|When Tropical Storm Laura first {{passed the}} Cayman Islands, it {{produced}} up to 3inches (7.5cm) of rainfall. As it was slowly moving {{off of the}} coast of Cuba, Laura dropped heavy rainfall, including nearly 20inches (50cm) across most of the Isle of Youth; one station on the island reported 14inches (36cm) in 24hours. The highest total in the country was 32.5inches (83cm), and overall the storm impacted four provinces, including Isle of Youth, Pinar del Río, La Habana, {{and the city of}} Havana. On the Isle of Youth, Laura produced winds of 70mph (120km/h), with gusts to 80mph (130km/h). On the mainland, the storm destroyed 20homes and several tobacco sheds, with damage also reported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee,</b> sugar, fruit, and vegetable crops. Due to the flooding, officials forced 26,000people from their homes in Pinar del Río, and one person in that province drowned while crossing a river. The storm's passage was believed to have diverted a flock of great black-backed gulls toward Central America and north-coastal South America; the species is usually found in the Mid-Atlantic states, and were migrating to the Gulf Coast or Cuba when they were affected by the storm.|$|E

25|$|In the Philippines, coffee has {{a history}} as rich as its flavor. The first coffee tree was {{introduced}} in Lipa, Batangas in 1740 by a Spanish Franciscan monk. From there, coffee growing spread {{to other parts of}} Batangas like Ibaan, Lemery, San Jose, Taal, and Tanauan. Batangas owed much of its wealth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> plantations in these areas and Lipa eventually became the coffee capital of the Philippines.|$|E

25|$|The first coffeehouse in Austria {{opened in}} Vienna in 1683 after the Battle of Vienna, by using {{supplies}} from the spoils obtained after defeating the Turks.

25|$|The {{external}} difficulties had far-reaching consequences. The {{government was}} forced to suspend part of the country's debt payments and eventually to impose exchange controls. Excess coffee production led to increasing interventions in the coffee market. The state programs to support coffee prices went bankrupt in 1930. To avoid further decreases in coffee prices, the central government bought huge amounts of coffee, which was then destroyed. Central government intervention provided support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> sector and, through its linkages, {{to the rest of}} the economy.|$|E
25|$|By 1920, small growers {{had done}} more to develop the {{industry}} than any other group. For many decades they planted, processed and sold their coffee virtually unnoticed by Colombia's government. On the other hand, the large growers began voicing their opinions and grievances against the Government through the Agricultural Society of Colombia (Sociedad de Agricultores de Colombia). By {{the start of the}} 20th century, there were about 750 coffee farms and plantations. Between 1910 and 1932, this number had increased to more than 150,000 farms and plantations, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coffee</b> Census of 1932.|$|E

Governor Macías ordered Captain Salvador Meca and his 3rd company of the 25th Patria Battalion from Yauco to head for Guánica. Meca and his men were joined by Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig, who assumed command of the Spanish forces at Hacienda Desideria two miles (3km) from Guánica. Puig arrived with two companies known as [...] "Cazador Patria Battalion", and they were joined by Puerto Rican volunteers, the Civil Guards, and mounted guerrillas from the towns of Yauco and Sabana Grande.

500|$|The {{first season}} was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. NBC {{executives}} had {{worried that the}} coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> house concept. The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning. At {{the beginning of the}} second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed [...] "The Friends Stage" [...] after the series finale. Filming for the series began during the summer (June, July, and August in the US) of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters; a hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes. Each 22-minute episode took six hours to film—twice the length of most sitcom tapings—mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the forthcoming season, Wenger took the Arsenal squad to Austria, which would become the club's usual pre-season base. The players were given a night out {{as a reward for}} vigorous training, which midfielder Ray Parlour revealed was spent at local pub with the other English players, while the [...] "French lads" [...] headed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> shop and smoked. [...] "How are we going to win the league this year? We're all drunk and they're all smoking," [...] he recollected. Wenger continued to fine-tune the squad during this period. Having vetoed John Hartson's move to West Ham United in February 1997, he convinced French teenager Nicolas Anelka to join Arsenal. He raided his old club Monaco to acquire the services of Christopher Wreh, Gilles Grimandi and Emmanuel Petit. The latter two were defenders, but Wenger thought both were capable of playing in midfield. To address the shortcomings of playing expansive football, winger Marc Overmars was purchased from Ajax, while Paul Merson moved to Middlesbrough. Wenger assessed Arsenal lost the Premier League because of their poor home performances, and felt they needed more pace and power.|$|E
50|$|Imitation {{has several}} motivations. The {{high price of}} kopi luwak drives {{the search for a}} way to produce kopi luwak in large quantities. Kopi luwak {{production}} involves a great deal of labour, whether farmed or wild-gathered.

Practicing on his father, young Como mastered the skills well enough to have his own shop at age 14. One of Como's regular customers at the barber shop owned a Greek coffee house that included a barber shop area, and asked the young barber whether {{he would like to}} take over that portion of his shop. Como had so much work after moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> house, he had to hire two barbers to help with it. His customers worked mainly at the nearby steel mills. They were well-paid, did not mind spending money on themselves and enjoyed Como's song renditions. Perry did especially well when one of his customers would marry. The groom and his men would avail themselves of every treatment Como and his assistants had to offer. Como sang romantic songs while busying himself with the groom as the other two barbers worked {{with the rest of the}} groom's party. During the wedding preparation, the groom's friends and relatives would come into the shop with gifts of money for Como. He became so popular as a [...] "wedding barber" [...] in the Greek community that he was asked to provide his services in Pittsburgh and throughout Ohio.|$|E
500|$|Bernard Perusse of The Gazette {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than the 2006 biography [...] by Johnny Rogan.

[...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very informative about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is well worth the asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To Stop Now is more suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold the pictures in place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E
500|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} led {{to severe}} mudslides and flooding throughout southern Guerrero. Entire communities were nearly destroyed, with some remaining flooded {{for a week}} after the hurricane. The flooding washed out or destroyed thousands of acres of crops, and killed thousands of cattle. The flooding and mudslides isolated more than 45,000people from the outside world. The passage of the hurricane resulted in damage to houses, bridges, and electrical and water supply. About [...] fell in the city in a three-hour span, resulting in rivers overflowing its banks. About 1,100 vessels were stranded at port, and 35 ships sunk. Damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> industry was $80 million (1997 USD). One environmental agency remarked that it will take 15 years for coffee crops to recover. [...] According to one preliminary estimate, 123people died in Guerrero, primarily in Acapulco. Over 200were missing by four days after the hurricane due to being washed out to sea or buried in mudslides. A total of 50,000people were left homeless across the state. Striking the week after Tropical Storm Olaf, previously wet grounds combined with heavy rainfall from Pauline resulted in severe mudslides and flash flooding in shanty towns around Acapulco Bay. There, around 5,000homes were destroyed with another 25,000damaged, with 10,000people left homeless in and around the city. The luxury resort hotels near the beach were largely unaffected by the hurricane, though residents in the shanty towns lost what little they had. Much of the city was covered in mud, and 70percent of Acapulco was without water {{as a result of the}} hurricane. Most of the city's one million residents were left without power or telephone service. [...] Overall, total damage was nearly $300 million pesos.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{independence}} in 1821, Costa Rica had found no regular trade routes for its coffee in European markets. This {{was compounded by}} transportation problems.

The majority of freshman males live in Dominic Hall, while most freshman females reside in either Joan of Arc Hall (commonly referred to as JOA) or Baroody Hall. Dominic Hall is a freshman dorm, located adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coffee</b> Shop and in close proximity to Alumni Hall and Bradley House. Dominic Hall houses over 205 students, offering mostly doubles, very few singles and several [...] "quads", or four-person rooms. Dominic is affectionately nicknamed [...] "Dirty Dom"; however, new lights, windows, doors and ceiling tiles have been installed and the custodial staff cleans the hallways and communal bathrooms five days a week. Joan of Arc is a female freshman residence hall where double-type rooms predominate. However, freshmen may be placed in any residence hall on campus. The Lowers are located near the NHIOP at the bottom of Saint Anselm Drive; these apartments were built in the mid-1990s and have a kitchen, one and a half bathrooms, a family room and bedrooms. A similar setup is available in Uppers; however, these dorms are slightly newer and are the favorite of seniors because they are located closer to central campus. Traditionally, residence halls have been single sex, though this began to change in the 2007–2008 academic year, when Brady Hall had female residents on its third floor while the bottom two floors were male. Hilary, Bertrand and Brady Halls are some of the largest on campus, as they can house over 120 students each. Holy Cross Hall, formerly named Building M has mostly singles and very few doubles; these rooms connect to a central hallway, two bathrooms and a large common room to form a [...] "Pod".|$|E
