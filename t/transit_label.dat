2500|$|When the Sun {{does not}} at all transit into a new rāshi (30 sidereal zodiac) but simply keeps moving within a rāshi in a lunar month (i.e. before a new moon), then that lunar month will be named {{according}} to the first upcoming transit. It will also take the epithet adhik or [...] "extra". The transition of the sun from one rāśi to the next is called sankranti. [...] For example, if a lunar month elapsed without a sankranti and the next transit is into Mesha (Aries), then this month without <b>transit</b> is <b>labelled</b> Adhik Chaitra. The next month will be labeled according to its transit as usual and will get the epithet nija ("original") or shuddha ("clean"), in this case Nija Chaitra. [...] The terms Pratham (first) Chaitra and Dwitiya (second) Chaitra may also be used. Adhika māsa (month) {{is the first of}} two whereas an adhika tithi is the second of two.|$|R

40|$|The post-translational {{transport}} of cytoplasmically synthesized precursor proteins into chloroplasts requires proteins {{in the envelope}} membranes. To identify some of these proteins, label transfer cross-linking was performed using precursor to the small subunit of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (prSSU) that was blocked {{at an early stage}} of the transport process. Two envelope proteins were identified: an 86 -kD protein and a 75 -kD protein, both present in the outer membrane. Labeling of both proteins required prSSU and could not be accomplished with SSU lacking a <b>transit</b> peptide. <b>Labeling</b> of the 75 -kD protein occurred only when low levels of ATP were present, whereas labeling of the 86 -kD protein occurred in the absence of exogenous ATP. Although both labeled proteins were identified as proteins of the outer envelope membrane, the labeled form of the 75 -kD protein could only be detected in fractions containing mixed envelope membranes. Based on these observations, we propose that prSSU first binds in an ATP-independent fashion to the 86 -kD protein. The energy-requiring step is association with the 75 -kD protein and assembly of a translocation contact site between the inner and outer membrane of the chloroplastic envelope...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel state {{evolution}} method for establishing standard (strong) bisimulation, which gives a tractable verification approach for deterministic machines, possibly with infinite state-spaces, and operates at an abstract level. The problem of establishing equivalence {{is reduced to}} one of proving the validity {{of a set of}} simpler (first-order) logical verification conditions, generated from the state evolution expressions. The approach maintains a high degree of automation, a feature of state-based methods, whilst offering the potential of containing the usual growth in complexity of verification, one advantage of using theorem-proving techniques.

40|$|Answering {{point-to-point}} distance queries {{is important}} in many applications, including games, robotics and vehicle routing in operations research. Searching in a graph to an-swer distance queries on demand can often be too slow. An alternative strategy, taken in methods such as <b>Transit</b> and Hub <b>Labels,</b> is to pre-compute information that can help compute distances much faster. To be practical, such methods need to generate much less preprocessed data than a naive all-pairs distance table. We present Heuristic-Aid Compressed Distance Databases (HCDs), pre-computed data structures based on the observa-tion that heuristic distance estimations can sometimes coin-cide with true distances. Compared to a naive all-pairs dis-tance table, we report compression factors of two to three orders of magnitude {{in a wide range}} of maps, reducing the memory usage to a reasonable size. Compared to compressed path databases, our approach generally generates smaller databases, and answers query distances faster...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of the intrarenal {{hematocrit}} ratio vary widely, {{depending on}} the techniques used for its determination. Computation of blood volume from the product of mean <b>transit</b> time of <b>labeled</b> erythrocytes and albumin, and minute volume blood flow, yields values averaging approximately 90 % of the systemic vessel hematocrit. To the other extreme are values that are slightly {{less than half of}} the systemic hematocrit ratio based on the determination of total renal blood volume by labeled red cells and albumin. Intermediate values are obtained by methods involving draining the blood from the kidney and measuring its hematocrit ratio. The current investigation, by a technique of circulatory stop-flow, has shown that a substantial fluid shift occurs in the kidney within 2 minutes of circulatory arrest, so that interstitial fluid, supplemented by fluid reabsorbed by the nephrons, dilutes the erythrocytes within the peritubular capillaries to reduce the hematocrit ratio to almost half of the systemic figure. The drainage methods are subject to error as a result o...|$|R
40|$|Interfollicular {{epidermis}} {{from back}} and {{tail of the}} recessive mutant mouse ichthyosis (ic/ic) was studied by histologic, histochemical, ultrastructural, and autoradiographic techniques and compared to heterozygous and Swiss S mouse epidermis. In the ic/ic mouse the stratum corneum was thickened, the granular layer prominent, and the stratum spinosum hyperplastic. Staining reactions for certain respiratory and lysosomal enzymes were more pronounced in epidermis of both back and tail. Ultrastructural studies of ic/ic epidermis demonstrated excessively clumped tonofilaments and increased numbers of mitochondria, ribonuclear protein particles, and membrane-coating granules in the stratum spinosum cells. Dilated intercellular junctions between the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum cells were packed with membrane-coating and amorphous material. Profuse keratin-forming structures, abnormally large keratohyaline granules, and persistent mitochondria were seen in the stratum granulosum cells. In the stratum corneum, inclusions were prominent and persisted into the upper layers of cells, which were irregular in outline and greatly thickened. No differences in epidermal cell <b>transit</b> time or <b>labeling</b> index were demonstrated among {{the three types of}} mice...|$|R
40|$|Flow-sensitive {{alternating}} inversion recovery (FAIR) is a noninvasive {{method for}} perfusion imaging. It {{has been shown}} that the FAIR signal may depend on hemodynamic parameters other than perfusion, the most important one being <b>transit</b> delays of <b>labeled</b> spins to the observed tissue. These parameters are expected to change with ischemia. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of these changes on the interpretation of FAIR results in the case of altered perfusion. This was investigated in a rat model of transient cerebral ischemia. It was shown that the ratio of FAIR signal in the infarct compared to the contralateral side was lower at short inflow times, which suggests that transit times affected the effective FAIR signal. The FAIR results were compared with those from functional histology and dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, and the findings indicated that the altered kinetics of the FAIR signal were related to reduced and delayed inflow in the infarct region - not to a decrease in the number of functional vessels...|$|R
40|$|A major {{assumption}} in {{arterial spin labeling}} (ASL) MRI perfusion quantification is {{the time}} course of the signal on arrival in the capillary network. The normally assumed square label profile is not preserved during <b>transit</b> of the <b>label</b> through the vasculature. This change in profile can be attributed to a number of effects collectively denoted as dispersion. A number of models for this effect have been proposed, but they have been difficult to validate. In this study ASL data acquired whilst the label was still within larger arteries was used to compare models of label dispersion. Models were fit using a probabilistic algorithm and evaluated according to their ability to fit the data. Data from an elderly population were considered including both healthy controls and patients with a variety of vascular disease. The authors conclude that modeling ASL dispersion using a convolution of the ideal ASL label profile with a dispersion kernel is most appropriate, where the kernel itself {{takes the form of a}} gamma distribution. This model provided a best fit to the data considered, was consistent with the measured flow profile in arteries and was sufficiently mathematically simple to make it practical for ASL tissue perfusion quantification.

40|$|Previous {{observations}} from our laboratory {{have suggested that}} colonic filling from the ileum is characterised {{by a series of}} bolus movements. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that bolus transit of ileal contents into the colon would not distinguish between solids and liquids. After a manometric infusion assembly was positioned by mouth into the ileum of 13 healthy volunteers, a mixture of nutrients (75 kcal), incorporating a solid phase radiolabel (111 In labeled resin pellets) and a liquid phase marker (99 mTc-DTPA), was infused into the ileum. <b>Transit</b> of both <b>labels</b> from the ileum to colon was quantified scintigraphically and ileal motility was also recorded. When markers were infused into the proximal ileum, 100 cm proximal to the ileocolonic junction (six), there were clear cut examples of discriminant transit, when liquids moved more rapidly from the small to the large bowel than did solids. When isotopes were instilled into the distal ileum, less than 50 cm from the ileocolonic junction, no separate transit of the solid and liquid phases was observed. No specific motor pattern of the ileum was regularly associated with bolus filling of the colon. These results support the hypothesis that the distal ileum can discriminate between solids and liquids but that the ileocecal junction cannot...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the {{pathogenesis}} of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is multifactorial, abnormal function of the lower oesophageal sphincter has been established, {{and in some cases}} motility defects in the oesophageal body has been described. In some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease delayed gastric emptying has also been observed. METHODS: Oesophageal and gastric motor function, as evaluated by use of scintigraphy and manometry, were studied concomitantly in 105 patients with chronic, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease before and after antireflux surgery. In a subgroup of these patients (n = 29) similar data were retrieved also at 2. 7 years after antireflux surgery. RESULTS: Impaired oesophageal motor function expressed as delayed <b>transit</b> of a <b>labelled</b> bolus was closely associated with motor dysfunction also recorded in the stomach as determined by delayed emptying of labelled solid food items. A similar relationship was found when oesophageal motor dysfunction was characterized as the frequency of failed primary peristalses after water swallows during manometry. When the 105 patients were studied half a year after an antireflux operation, noncorrelation between oesophageal and gastric motor function could be recorded. CONCLUSIONS: These data further substantiate the view that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is associated with a disturbed motor function within the entire upper gastrointestinal tract...|$|R
40|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} {{based on}} ultrastructural correlation, specific labeling, and subcellular fractionation studies indicates {{that at least}} the early steps of monoterpene biosynthesis occur in plastids. (4 S) -Limonene synthase, {{which is responsible for}} the first dedicated step of monoterpene biosynthesis in mint species, appears to be translated as a preprotein bearing a long plastidial <b>transit</b> peptide. Immunogold <b>labeling</b> using polyclonal antibodies raised to the native enzyme demonstrated the specific localization of limonene synthase to the leucoplasts of peppermint (Mentha × piperita) oil gland secretory cells during the period of essential oil production. Labeling was shown to be absent from all other plastid types examined, including the basal and stalk cell plastids of the secretory phase glandular trichomes. Furthermore, in vitro translation of the preprotein and import experiments with isolated pea chloroplasts were consistent in demonstrating import of the nascent protein to the plastid stroma and proteolytic processing to the mature enzyme at this site. These experiments confirm that the leucoplastidome of the oil gland secretory cells is the exclusive location of limonene synthase, and almost certainly the preceding steps of monoterpene biosynthesis, in peppermint leaves. However, succeeding steps of monoterpene metabolism in mint appear to occur outside the leucoplasts of oil gland cells...|$|R

The new Indianapolis Regional Route will largely follow Indianapolis Boulevard, connecting Chicago's East Side neighborhood, parts of Hammond and East Chicago, terminating in northern Highland. The revamped local routes were not finalized until April 2010. RBA announced its intention to increase service on regional routes during morning and evening rush hours, running the buses once every half an hour. Between January and March 2010, RBA solicited comments and suggestions from the public about what kind of changes it should make. In the end of April 2010, RBA approved the changes.

40|$|Rats fed diets {{deficient}} in {{essential fatty acids}} (EFA) develop severe scaling in the skin, histologically characterized by acanthosis of the epidermis and hyperkeratosis. Epidermal cell proliferation kinetics in the EFA- deficient rat were studied as a potential animal model for human diseases of epidermal hyperplasia. EFA deficient rats were injected IP with tritiated thymidine (3 H-TdR). Serial punch biopsies from dorsal skin were obtained 1 - 30 hr after 3 H-TdR administration and processed by standard autoradiographic techniques. A composite percent labeled mitoses (PLM) curve was obtained by plotting the mean ratio of labeled mitoses/total mitoses at each time interval. The mitotic index was 1. 0 %. The labeling index determined 1 hr after 3 H-TdR injection was 11. 2 %. From these data the total germinative cell cycle was calculated to be 67 hr with {{the duration of the}} cell cycle phases: S, 7. 5 hr; G 2, 4. 5 hr; M, 0. 7 hr; and G 1, 54. 3 hr. The <b>transit</b> time for <b>labeled</b> basal cells to proceed from the basal layer to the uppermost stratum granulosum was 2 days. In normal control rats the labeling index was 2. 2 % and the transit time 6 days, reflecting much slower epidermal proliferation than in the EFA deficient rat. The similar kinetic characteristics of enhanced epidermal proliferative activity, rapid cell cycle and transit time, suggest that the EFA-deficient rat model may be suitable for examination of various problems relating to the chemotherapy of psoriasis and other hyperproliferative skin conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that a subgroup of QW 7437 microbubbles, dodecafluoropentane-based ultrasound contrast microspheres, resides for prolonged periods in the microvasculature. BACKGROUNDQW 7437 produces echo enhancement in myocardium which may persist relatively longer than opacification in the left ventricular cavity. The mechanism for this persistent enhancement remains unknown. METHODSThe <b>transit</b> of fluorescently <b>labeled</b> erythrocytes was examined by fluorescence intravital microscopy in the microvessels in five rat mesenteries. Ten rats were used to observe the behavior of fluorescently labeled QW 7437 microbubbles in the mesenteric microcirculation. RESULTSThere was no significant change in erythrocyte velocity in the arterioles and venules after the administration of QW 7437 microbubbles (0. 05 ml/kg) preactivated by negative hydrodynamic pressure. Of 552 microbubbles observed in four arterioles and five capillaries, 549 (99. 5 %) passed without stoppage (≥ 0. 1 s stoppage); only one stopped transiently in arteriole and two in capillaries, each for < 0. 5 s. Sixty-five of 478 microbubbles (13. 6 %) observed in six postcapillary venules 11 to 30 μm in diameter and 24 of 408 microbubbles (5. 9 %) in four venules 31 to 50 μm in diameter stopped transiently (0. 1 to 180 s) with an attachment to venular endothelium; the remaining microbubbles passed through the venules without stoppage. CONCLUSIONSProlonged survival as microbubbles in the circulation and transient stoppage of a subgroup of microbubbles in the microvasculature, particularly in venules, are potential mechanisms for the persistent tissue echo enhancement by QW 7437 microbubbles during contrast echocardiography...|$|R

Biol. 107 : 277 - 286), {{in combination}} with lectin precipitation, to analyze the apical and basolateral glycoprotein composition of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and to explore the role of glycosylation in the targeting of membrane glycoproteins. All six lectins used recognized both apical and basolateral glycoproteins, indicating {{that none of the}} sugar moieties detected were characteristic of the particular epithelial cell surface. Pulse-chase experiments coupled with domain-selective glycoprotein recovery were designed to detect the initial appearance of newly synthesized glycoproteins at the apical or basolateral cell surface. After a short pulse with a radioactive precursor, glycoproteins reaching each surface were biotinylated, extracted, and recovered via precipitation with immobilized streptavidin. Several basolateral glycoproteins (including two sulfated proteins) and at least two apical glycoproteins (one of them the major sulfated protein of MDCK cells) appeared at the corresponding surface after 20 - 40 min of chase, but were not detected in the opposite surface, suggesting that they were sorted intracellularly and vectorially delivered to their target membrane. Several "peripheral" apical proteins were detected at maximal levels on the apical surface immediately after the 15 -min pulse, suggesting a very fast intracellular <b>transit.</b> Finally, domain-selective <b>labeling</b> of surface carbohydrates with biotin hydrazide (after periodate oxidation) revealed strikingly different integral and peripheral glycoprotein patterns, resembling the Con A pattern, after labeling with sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimido-biotin.

40|$|Multiple {{indicator}} dilution {{studies of the}} pulmonary circulation were carried out in conscious, resting and exercising, and anesthetized dogs under conditions {{where there was no}} pulmonary edema. Labeled red cells, water, and albumin were injected together into the pulmonary artery, and effluent dilution patterns were obtained from the descending thoracic aorta. The product of the mean transit time differences between labeled water and red cells, and the pulmonary water flow was used to estimate extravascular parenchymatous water; and this was expressed as a proportion of the water content of the blood-drained lung at postmortem examination. These estimates of the proportional water content were found to increase with flow, and to approach an asymptotic value. Reconsideration of the flow patterns in capillaries, however, led to the postulate that extravascular water should be calculated, utilizing as the appropriate vascular reference a substance that uniformly labels the water in red cells and plasma, and which is confined to the circulation, rather than a tracer that only labels red cells. The mean transit time of this substance is approximated by the sum of the mean <b>transit</b> times of <b>labeled</b> red cells and albumin, each weighted according to the proportion of the water content of blood present in that phase. The values for lung water content so computed also increased with flow, and appeared to approach an asymptote that corresponded to approximately two-thirds of the wet lung weight. The estimated values for the water space after pentobarbital anesthesia corresponded to the lower values obtained in the resting conscious animals. When the anesthetized animals were also bled, the estimated water space was disproportionately large, in relation to the previous values. These experimental results support the hypothesis that dilutional estimates of the lung water space reflect pulmonary capillary filling; that this filling increases with exercise; and that a relative increase in filling also occurs as part of the response to hemorrhage...|$|R
