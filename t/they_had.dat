5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées.

5|$|As {{the reigning}} {{champions of the}} UEFA Champions League, Manchester United began their title defence at the group stage, {{for which they were}} given the top seed.

Nevertheless, United ended up being drawn into Group E with two teams <b>they</b> <b>had</b> played against before: Villarreal (whom <b>they</b> <b>had</b> drawn in 2005–06) and Celtic (2006–07); and one <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not: Aalborg BK.|$|E
