Gathering opinions of educational renewal experts and <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> on the mascil guideline document improves our understanding of characteristics of guideline documents. Opinions of experts were gathered using a two cycle Delphi study. Six experts on educational renewal were sent a questionnaire on the mascil guideline document. Answers were summarised and sent back for verification. Opinions of <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> were gathered using a questionnaire. Fifteen <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> filled in the questionnaire. Answers from both experts and <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> showed that guideline documents should start with examples, than give a thorough work plan on adaptation of tasks, and finally include a section on renewal theory. Usage of guideline documents should be coupled to professional development sessions and connected to experiences of daily practice. This possibly makes renewal projects more sustainable by enhancing implementation phase effectiveness...|$|R

This {{has led to a}} particular focus on dyslexic applicants and a questioning of their suitability for teaching. In 2003 the Disability Discrimination Act as applied to education also made it clear that disabled applicants (including those who are dyslexic) must not be discriminated against in the admissions process for teacher training. Initial <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> must therefore satisfy requirements from both a standards and an inclusion agenda when considering the admission of dyslexic individuals to their training courses.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, Papua New Guinea (PNG) has pursued {{educational}} reform in elementary teacher education. Because elementary teachers and teacher education {{are central to}} the reform agenda, {{there is a need to}} gain empirical evidence about how PNG teacher trainers’ understandings about learning and teaching impact on their practice. The study uses cultural-authorship as a theoretical framework to investigate the nature of changes in understanding about learning and teaching for 18 <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> as they progressed through a two-year Bachelor of Early Childhood upgrade course. It addresses the research question: What do elementary <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> in PNG understanding about learning and teaching and how has this changed during their course? The focus on such understandings provides valuable insights into their professional identities at a critical time in PNG’s education reform agenda. Analysis of journal entries at the beginning and end of the course showed that, over time, <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> described increasingly more complex ways of understanding learning and teaching. By the end of the degree program, <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> referred to the critical role of communities and families in educational processes and the notion of the teacher as a change agent. This watershed finding demonstrates notable shifts in teacher trainers’ professional identities from trainers to community leaders in elementary education...|$|R

30|$|Striking {{here is the}} {{divergence}} {{of views}} between raters E and F {{with regard to the}} need for language modification in class—whether a teacher should modify language so that all the students (including the weaker ones) can understand or whether she should retain her natural English flow as a model. The final decision, whatever it may be, must be the one adhered to, so long as it is made through “exhaustive discussions” between two “experienced assessors” who are also <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers.</b> Through such meaningful discussion, raters can become even better professionals, both as raters and as <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> and the quality of their assessment can be guaranteed. It {{is for this reason that}} assessors must be qualified and capable, not only as assessors but also as <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers.</b> To be equipped to give the right detailed suggestions, they must go through a number of assessor training sessions. Thus, the CLA-HK appears to be particularly successful when it comes to quality assessor training.|$|R

The findings suggest that training of trainers should be based on subject knowledge and must include lessons on attitudinal improvement. Rokiba AhmedM. in TESO...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} how {{the professional development}} and the training of Chemistry <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> can contribute to learning on experimentation in Science/Chemistry teaching.

Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} five teachers of specific subject disciplines and five of Chemistry teacher-training. The interpretation of the qualitative information was in the main founded on Ludwik Fleck’s epistemology, in particular in the exploration of the inter and intra-collective circulation category. The results corroborate the thesis that learning on experimental activities in Chemistry teaching can be mediated using inter and intra-collective circulation of learning on the subject at hand, and that such circulation occurs throughout a plurality of spaces and methodologies both in the professional development of Chemistry <b>teacher</b> <b>trainers</b> and in the early stage training of the future teachers of this science in basic education...|$|R

40|$|This text aims {{to present}} {{considerations}} previously introduced by ourselves in our Master's research, which {{brought up the}} relationships between <b>teacher's</b> <b>trainers,</b> <b>teachers</b> and teenager students, from the initial teacher's professional schooling to the practice at Basic Education. The first consideration emphasizes the almost non-existence of teenagers life approach {{in the experience of}} <b>teacher's</b> <b>trainers.</b> The absence of curricular subjects that discuss this stage of human development brings about a denial {{of the importance of the}} study of their specific life experiences. The second consideration is the strong identification of the education conception adopted by <b>teacher's</b> <b>trainers</b> with its manifestation in their pedagogical practice. Such manifestations, here, are the relationship that trainers establish with their graduate students, the conceptions held by <b>trainers</b> about <b>teacher's</b> schooling, the degree of insertion of trainers at third level education. And they are, to a great extent, resulting from the educational conception adopted by trainers, from the non-requirement of didactic schooling and/or of practices at those educational stages by the trainers, from the non-existence of a life-long schooling policy and even from the pedagogical and physical spaces that facilitate group practices of trainers. We acknowledged lack of bibliography concerning adolescents, poor adolescents, initial and life-long education of trainers of third level education as well as bibliography dealing with the relationship between these subjects and the subject people involved with them...|$|R
