5|$|The ACLU's {{support of}} the NLRB was a major {{development}} for the ACLU, because it {{marked the first time}} it accepted <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties. Until 1937, the ACLU felt that civil rights were best upheld by citizens and private organizations.|$|E
5|$|Jamila and the President {{opens with}} {{narration}} from Jamila (Atiqah Hasiholan), {{a victim of}} human trafficking, followed by several scenes showing her living a glamorous yet unfulfilling night life. After hearing a news report <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> minister, Nurdin (Adjie Pangestu), has been murdered, Jamila surrenders herself to the police. This surprises her would-be boyfriend, Ibrahim (Dwi Sasono), who feels badly for Jamila and begins working towards freeing her. Under the orders of the president, Jamila is placed in a prison outside Jakarta, where she receives rough treatment {{at the hands of}} the guards and warden, Ria (Christine Hakim).|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
50|$|Advocates of {{proportional}} representation suggest <b>that</b> <b>a</b> coalition <b>government</b> {{leads to more}} consensus-based politics, as <b>a</b> <b>government</b> comprising differing parties (often based on different ideologies) need to compromise about governmental policy. Another stated advantage is <b>that</b> <b>a</b> coalition <b>government</b> better reflects the popular opinion of the electorate within a country.|$|R
50|$|Supporters of {{austerity}} measures {{tend to use}} {{the metaphor}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government's</b> debt is like a household's debt. They intend to frighten people that the government's overspending leads to the government's default. But this metaphor is wrong.|$|R
40|$|Casual {{empiricism}} reveals <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government's</b> program implementation policy frequently {{fails to}} maximize the representative citizen's welfare. Inthis paper, I construct <b>a</b> model <b>that</b> incorporates political economy considerations and examine the equilibrium policy distortions <b>that</b> <b>a</b> coalition <b>government</b> begets. I show that coalition governments are fiscally profligate when program benefits are divisible and excessively conservative when these benefits are indivisible. In other words, program characteristics (divisible or indivisible) affect even the qualitative nature of coalition-related policy distortions. distributive program, coalition government, inefficiency,...|$|R
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{learns that}} she has a {{cancerous}} tumor between her sinus and cerebrum. She initially tells only Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) of the diagnosis, and is determined to continue to work. The agents head to Allentown, Pennsylvania to see Betsy Hagopian, a Mutual UFO Network member who was previously discovered to be suffering from similar symptoms. The agents learn that Betsy has died, yet find someone using her phone line. They trace the call to Kurt Crawford (David Lovgren), a fellow MUFON member. Crawford tells them that {{all but one of the}} MUFON members Scully previously met have died of cancer. Scully is skeptical of Mulder and Crawford's claims <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> conspiracy and her abduction are behind her illness.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition of the Senate. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, argued <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> majority of seats in the Senate resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian Democrats have been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control of the Senate, particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry. However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in the Senate in the mid-2000s, pointed out that their political rivals had previously cut off debate on more bills in the Senate than had his government.|$|E

5|$|When Stanley Baldwin {{retired in}} May 1937, Chamberlain {{took his place}} as Prime Minister. His premiership was {{dominated}} by the question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive Germany, and his actions at Munich were widely popular among Britons at the time. When Hitler continued his aggression, Chamberlain pledged Britain to defend Poland's independence if the latter were attacked, an alliance that brought Britain into war when Germany attacked Poland in 1939. Chamberlain resigned the premiership on 10 May 1940 after the Allies were forced to retreat from Norway, as he believed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> supported by all parties was essential, and the Labour and Liberal parties would not join a government headed by him. He was succeeded by Winston Churchill but remained very well-regarded in Parliament, especially among Conservatives. Before ill-health forced him to resign, he was an important member of Churchill's War Cabinet, heading it in the new premier's absence. Chamberlain died of cancer six months after leaving the premiership.|$|E
