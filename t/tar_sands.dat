40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processing}} conditions on oil recovery from <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> {{has been studied}} recently by using a linear, adiabatic tube reactor. Laboratory experiments have been conducted to evaluate the potential of combustion and hot-gas injection for the thermal recovery of oil from the Asphalt Ridge and the <b>Tar</b> <b>Sand</b> Triangle deposits in Utah. This paper discusses the saturated hydrocarbon distributions in the thermally produced oils and in the <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> bitumens. The oil produced by reverse combustion of Asphalt Ridge <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> contained 45 wt. X saturated hydrocarbons, and the oil produced by forward combustion of <b>Tar</b> <b>Sand</b> Triangle <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> contained 40 wt. % saturated hydrocarbons. Results from field ionization mass spectrometric analysis of the saturates indicated significantly larger amounts of material with carbon numbers less than C^Q were present in both product oils from combustion than {{were present in the}} original bitumens. The saturates in these product oils were comprised of mostly acyclic alkanes, mono-, and dicycloalkanes. Carbon number distributions of tetracyclo- and pentacycloalkanes (biological markers) were similar for both the product oil recovered by reverse combustion and the bitumen from Asphalt Ridge. The hot-gas injection process produced a greater amount of oil, containing more saturated hydrocarbons, than either combustion process. Significant amounts of medium-molecular-weight material from Cj 5 to C^y were present in oils produced by hot-gas injection. A comparison of the carbon number and Z-series distributions of saturates indicated that relatively greater amounts of branched alkanes and lower-numbered cyclic systems were present in product oils from combustion and hot-gas injection than in the original <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> bitumens. The saturated hydrocarbon distributions were responsible, in part, for {{the fact that some of}} the physicochemical properties of oils recovered by thermal processes were improved relative to the physicochemical properties of the bitumens.

40|$|High {{pressure}} accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) {{tests have}} been performed on three different crude oils at their respective reservoir pressures. The experiments on medium heavy Clair oil and heavy Wolf Lake oil used clean silica sand, incorporating 3 % kaolinite, to represent the reservoir matrix, whereas Athabasca <b>Tar</b> <b>Sand</b> was used in its preserved, virgin state. The Clair oil and Wolf Lake oil tests involved high initial water saturations in the reservoir, representative of a post-waterflooded or a post-steam injection state. A second test on Athabasca <b>Tar</b> <b>Sand</b> used a lower oil (bitumen) saturation, but without an adjustment of the original brine saturation. Although the medium Clair oil exhibited high exothermicity throughout the temperature range, the temperature detected for the onset of low temperature oxidation (LTO) was much higher than that for Athabasca <b>Tar</b> <b>Sand.</b> The calculated activation energies also indicate that Athabasca <b>Tar</b> <b>Sand</b> is very reactive in the LTO region. Furthermore, the overall continuity exhibited by the measured exotherms indicates that all three oils are potentially good candidates for in situ combustion as an oil recovery method...|$|R

25|$|In Canada, BP is {{involved}} in the extraction of oil sands, also known as <b>tar</b> <b>sands</b> or bituminous sands.

25|$|Oil sands, {{also known}} as <b>tar</b> <b>sands</b> or crude bitumen, or more {{technically}} bituminous sands, are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit. Oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay, and water, saturated with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen (or colloquially as tar due to its superficially similar appearance).|$|E
25|$|Heavy crude oil, {{which is}} much more viscous than {{conventional}} crude oil, and <b>tar</b> <b>sands,</b> where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen, a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield synthetic crude oil when heated (pyrolyzed). These materials have yet to be exploited commercially. These fuels can be employed in internal combustion engines, fossil fuel power stations and other uses.|$|E
40|$|Fungi {{associated}} with <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> samples from Ondo State, Nigeria were isolated and identified using standard microbiological method (serial dilution-spread plate technique).

25|$|For example, {{a reserve}} {{such as the}} Ogallala Aquifer can be mined {{at a rate that}} far exceeds replenishment. This turns much of the world's {{underground}} water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil.

25|$|The Athabasca {{oil sands}} or (<b>tar</b> <b>sands)</b> are large {{deposits}} of bitumen or extremely heavy crude oil, located in northeastern Alberta, Canada – roughly centred on the boomtown of Fort McMurray. These oil sands, hosted {{primarily in the}} McMurray Formation, consist of a mixture of crude bitumen (a semi-solid rock-like form of crude oil), silica sand, clay minerals, and water. The Athabasca deposit is the largest known reservoir of crude bitumen {{in the world and}} the largest of three major oil sands deposits in Alberta, along with the nearby Peace River and Cold Lake deposits (the latter stretching into Saskatchewan).|$|E
25|$|There is a {{difference}} between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca <b>tar</b> <b>sands</b> plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.|$|E

40|$|Nigeria is {{endowed with}} a large deposit of <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> in Ondo state, the {{response}} to leaching bene-ficiation treatment has not been elaborated. In this work, samples of <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> from Ondo state was leached with sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate as a preliminary step and thereafter with sodium hydroxide at varying contact times and molar concentrations. The bitumen samples as-received and as-leached were also subjected to solubility tests using toluene. The results obtained showed that sodium hydroxide gave a higher percentage bitumen recovery of 48 % as against 20. 95 % for sodium carbonate for the same leach contact time. The highest percentage recovery of bitumen of 53. 50 % and minimum percent bitumen loss of 1. 95 was obtained at mass ratio of 1 : 10 of sodium hydroxide to <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> and 15 minutes contact time. The solubility test showed that the leached bitumen was 97. 70 % pure and this implies a removal of about 92. 43 % of mineral matter in the bitumen. The high purity of the bitumen concentrate obtained is significant as the <b>tar</b> <b>sand</b> was sourced from a shallow pit and the leaching was carried out at the less expensive normal atmospheric pressure. The results obtained thus indicate that a much higher concentration ratio may be attained for deeper and less contaminated deposits subjected to high pressure autoclave leaching...|$|R

500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah.
