5|$|In {{the appeal}} against Prakash J.'s {{judgment}} to the Court of Appeal, also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996), {{counsel for the}} appellants argued that the restriction placed by the Minister on the importation, sale and distribution of the Jehovah's Witnesses publications was too wide and disproportionate. Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to carry out National Service was a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>national</b> <b>security.</b> The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to bring an application for judicial review of Order No. 405/1995.|$|E
5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E

5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989–1990), which held it is sufficient for the President to be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> in order for a detention order to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA.|$|E

Google Earth has been blocked by Google in Iran and Sudan since 2007, due to United States government export restrictions.

Of the 800,000 refugees vetted through the resettlement program in the United States between 2001 and 2016, only five were subsequently arrested on terrorism charges; and 17 of the 600,000 Iraqis and Syrians who arrived in Germany in 2015 were investigated for terrorism.

25|$|However, not all Canadians {{believed}} that the Japanese Canadians posed a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>national</b> <b>security,</b> including select senior officials of the RCMP, Royal Canadian Navy, Department of Labour and Fisheries, among other government agencies. Notable individuals including Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside, Assistant Under-Secretary at External Affairs during the internment of Japanese Canadians. Ann Sunahara argues that Keenleyside was a sympathetic administrator that advocated strongly against the removal of Japanese Canadians from the BC coast. He, unsuccessfully, tried to remind other government officials {{of the distinction between}} Japanese foreign nationals and Canadian citizens in regards to personal and civil rights.|$|E
25|$|Confederate Privateering {{was not as}} minor as many {{retrospective}} analyses have claimed. It {{posed the}} first <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> because it {{had the potential to}} have instantly put more hostile ships at sea than the U.S. Navy could effectively suppress while also striving to enforce a blockade. Furthermore, it resulted in Lincoln's first proclamation of a blockade, the first internationally recognized act of belligerence on his part, which helped to nudge the war into international waters; and it produced the first Union strategy for the conduct of war. President Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, ordered the Blockading Squadron to secure the primary privateering ports of the South, which was accomplished quickly by joint Army/Navy actions against Forts Hattaras and Clark at the inlet to the NC Sounds, Forts Beauregard and Walker at Port Royal Sound, and Ship Island near New Orleans—all by the end of 1861, while other military efforts, that is, purely Army efforts, stalled.|$|E

25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>national</b> <b>security.</b> One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E
25|$|Discontent among student organisations in Malaysian {{universities}} soon posed a {{new problem}} for the UMNO-led government. The student movement were influenced by anarchist sentiments that their overseas counterpart. However, Mahathir {{in his capacity as}} Minister for Education issued a stern warning to university students and faculty not to become involved in politics. However, amidst allegations that farmers in rural states were starving due to government policies, massive student demonstrations were held in December 1974. These were false allegation as there were no known facts that any of the farmers or their families died because of starvation. Most of the demonstrators were Malays, and their ringleaders, which included Anwar Ibrahim—founder of Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (the Islamic Youth Movement of Malaysia, or ABIM)—were detained under the Internal Security Act, which effectively allows the government to detain anyone it sees as a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> for an indefinite period. In 1975, Parliament passed amendments to the Universities and University Colleges Act (UUCA) which banned students from expressing support of or holding positions in any political party or trade union without written consent from the university's Vice-Chancellor. The act also banned political demonstrations from being held on university campuses. In 1976, however, mass demonstrations were held at the MARA Institute of Technology, protesting the UUCA. Mahathir then threatened to revoke the scholarships of the students, most of whom relied on public support to pay their way through university.|$|E
