25|$|At the Indian village, Anderson is ambushed by renegade Indian Two Feathers. After {{defeating}} him, Two Feathers praises Anderson's {{strength in}} battle, {{and out of}} sympathy because he once had a child he had lost, tells him the real location of Sarah: Bob Graham's estate, Big Rock ranch. Anderson blasts his way into Graham's villa, and finally confronts him. After a fierce gunfight, Graham is believed dead and falls to the ground, and Anderson reunites with his daughter. Graham, clinging to life and gun trained on Anderson, reveals <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who murdered Anderson's father. Just as Graham is about to finish off Anderson, Sarah manages to shoot Graham with Anderson's gun. After a tearful reunion, father and daughter ride into the sunset.|$|E
500|$|The {{first week}} of {{recording}} produced [...] "Go", [...] "Blood", [...] "Rats", and [...] "Leash" [...] before the band hit a lull. In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{years apart}} the two reunited {{to write their}} own {{material}} and [...] "create music based around our harmonies because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing that people really enjoyed about our performances in the band". Lucas had seen a folk group, Tiddas, performing [...] "Inside My Kitchen" [...] on TV music video program, rage, [...] "t was a revelation {{for me to see}} three women singing harmonies, playing acoustic guitar and telling their stories through song. Right then and there I decided that I wanted to play acoustic guitar, focus on my vocals and write songs".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1940, Ziolkowski spent three weeks with Standing Bear at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, {{discussing}} land ownership issues and learning about Crazy Horse and the Lakota way of life. According to Ziolkowski, [...] "Standing Bear grew very angry when {{he spoke of the}} broken Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> I'd read about in which the President promised the Black Hills would belong to the Indians forever. I remember how his old eyes flashed out of that dark mahogany face, then he would shake his head and fall silent for a long while." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen praised {{recording}} engineer Mark Rankin's contributions stating, [...] "I {{think it was}} pretty key to have Mark there. He went through the process with us, and now he's like a brother. He was completely an outsider to what we were doing, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing that we consciously decided. For this record {{we wanted to go}} out of our comfort zone, usually we’re around friends of ours. For this one, I think it was important to work with somebody who didn’t even know what some of our influences were. Someone completely out of the box for us, and I think he was key in making this record sound the way it does." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open Your Eyes (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets for a moment in time.") However, Open Your Eyes [...] was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The title single [...] managed to reach number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther. She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that nobody should follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> thing that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother said I {{had to get a}} job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't think this would happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her." [...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer). Young described Brett's style [...] "She seemed genuinely interested in the pop stars she interviewed, but she could also be intimidating at times." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Supergirl would air its second season on The CW instead of CBS, Pedowitz revealed that all four series—Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl—would crossover in the upcoming 2016–17 television season. In September 2016, Greg Berlanti, creator and executive producer on all four series, clarified that the crossover event would only officially involve The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow, though the event starts {{at the very end of}} the Supergirl episode [...] "Medusa", with Barry and Cisco Ramon arriving on Supergirl's Earth to recruit her. Andrew Kreisberg, executive producer on Arrow, The Flash and Supergirl, spoke more on why the crossover did not include Supergirl, saying that since [...] "Medusa" [...] also served as the mid-season finale for Supergirl, and the other three series have theirs in a subsequent episode after the crossover, [...] "We wanted to make sure that [...] spoke to what had been happening on the first seven episodes of Supergirl and not just as a tie in." [...] He added that, logistically, it would have been very difficult to incorporate the four series, also noting that finding the time for Melissa Benoist to shoot material for the other three series had its own complications, noting, [...] "Hopefully people didn't realize it, but Kara was not in a lot of episode 7 of Supergirl... specifically to free her up for five days so that she could appear in all these other episodes." [...] He expanded on these difficulties stating, [...] "The thing that we didn’t really plan on — because we weren’t aware that we were going to switch Supergirl from CBS to CW and it was really going to be part of it — <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> show that didn't have built-in shut-down days, so all the other ones did... Supergirl was the one we needed to shut down the most and it was the one that we didn’t have any opportunity to." ...|$|E
