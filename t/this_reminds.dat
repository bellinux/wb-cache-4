5|$|Unko is {{the student}} council {{president}} at Shimoshina. She is an intelligent and athletic girl. Although {{her name is}} actually Sadako, <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> her of the horror character Sadako, so she prefers to use Unko because she is afraid of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{departure}} leaves Bella {{depressed and}} isolated for months. Unable {{to understand her}} erratic and despondent actions, her father, Charlie, who works as the police chief of Forks, decides to send Bella {{to live with her}} mother in Jacksonville, Florida, but Bella opposes, and decides {{to spend more time with}} her other friends in Forks. After seeing a movie with Jessica, Bella sees a group of men on motorcycles. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> her of when Edward previously rescued her from a previous assault, and she sees his image, warning her to keep away. Bella discovers that any thrill-seeking activities she engages will evoke Edward's preserved image. She is also comforted by Jacob Black, a cheerful companion who helps to ease her pain over losing Edward. When Jacob suddenly begins avoiding her, Bella discovers that he, and others of his tribe, are descended from a long line of werewolves, and Jacob has just undergone his first transformation. Bella also learns that the werewolves are an age-old enemy of vampires. Jacob's pack members are on constant alert for Victoria, a vampire seeking to avenge the death of her mate, James, who was killed by Edward after James kidnapped and tried to kill Bella. They rescue Bella from Laurent when he tries to kill her. With Jacob busy coming to terms with his shape-shifting nature, Bella again finds herself alone, and she returns to seeking thrill-inducing activities.|$|E
25|$|In {{his spare}} time, Monk {{continues}} {{to search for}} information about his wife's death, and is plagued {{with the idea that}} he may never determine who killed Trudy. He dedicates his life to solving other murders because he feels this is fixing disorder in the world. He becomes especially intrigued when a woman is killed, or when someone is killed with some type of bomb, because <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> him of Trudy's murder.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} depicts complex {{personality and}} devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning to her right, {{her eyes are}} half closed, her hands are crossed in devotion; <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> {{that she is a}} virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people. At the same time, her head is surrounded by an aureola with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver clothes and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the Queen of Heaven. The painting also reminds of Tota pulchra es (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} of the second season, [...] "" [...] (1993), shows Tessa, MacLeod and Richie {{settling}} back to their antiques store in Seacouver and meeting the Watchers, a secret society that observes Immortals without interfering. In [...] "The Darkness" [...] (1993), Tessa meets a fortune teller named Greta (Traci Lords) who urges her to flee the city. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> MacLeod of another fortune teller, who, back in 1848, predicted that he would bury many women, but marries none. MacLeod impulsively asks Tessa to marry him, to which she agrees. The next day, Tessa is abducted by Pallin Wolf (Andrew Jackson), a renegade Watcher who wants to behead MacLeod. In the meantime, MacLeod tells Richie that he is getting married because of the thought of losing Tessa. Tessa holds her {{ground in front of}} Wolf and tries to escape, but Wolf brings her back to her cell. MacLeod finally finds them and kills Wolf, then sends Tessa home with Richie. On their way to the car, Tessa and Richie are shot dead by Marc Roszca (Travis MacDonald), a drug addict wanting their money. Richie's previously unknown immortality is revealed when he returns to life on the spot, but Tessa dies. MacLeod, devastated, leaves their home and sells the antique store.|$|E
500|$|Absolute Garbage {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinqumani gave a positive {{overview of the}} compilation, writing that the album [...] "serves as an anthropological study of the musical relics of a bygone era", while Laila Hassani of Heat summed up her five-star review by writing, [...] "Few modern female-fronted rock bands {{stand the test of}} time, but <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> you why, along with Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, Garbage are one of them." [...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, the sound of a briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever happens next, they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> Mr. Cooke of {{something}} (be it recorded) {{that he had}} for once forgotten. He lifted up {{the top of the}} refrigerator. The chief's eye followed him. But I was not going to permit this.|$|R
60|$|He rolled, at a rough estimate, thirty {{grains of}} quinine in a {{cigarette}} paper, regarded the result sourly for a moment, then swallowed it at a gulp. <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> Van Horn, who {{reached for the}} bottle and took a similar dose.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2010 Jordison {{was voted}} the best drummer of the {{previous}} 25 years by readers of Rhythm magazine, ahead of drummers such as Mike Portnoy, Neil Peart, Phil Collins, and Dave Grohl. When asked to comment he stated [...] "I'm {{at a loss for}} words. This is beyond unbelievable. Something like <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> me every day why I continue to do this." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Fearchar's daughters, called Euphemia, {{was married}} to Walter de Moravia, a magnate who ruled Duffus. [...] Walter's family were of Flemish origin, and had been planted in Moray by the Scottish crown as agents of royal authority, but were {{steadily}} building an independent power-base. Christina, another of Fearchar's daughters, {{was married to}} Amlaibh, the King of Mann and the Isles. If we are to use the chronology of the Chronicles of Mann, this happened sometime before 1223, but after 1188. Such a move is not surprising, as the Manx king ruled over the isle of Skye. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> us that Fearchar was not merely a slavish Scottish magnate with narrow local aspirations, but an ambitious Gaelic warlord with greater regional goals in the Norse-Gaelic world of the Irish Sea, the world of Alan, Lord of Galloway and the Manx kings.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> her to turn another page, {{and she had}} {{scarcely}} {{noted that}} it contained {{the picture of a}} monkey when the animal sprang from the book with a great crumpling of paper and landed upon the window seat beside her.|$|R
50|$|Tap Kalyanak (Renunciation):As Rishabhdev became {{engrossed in}} worldly affairs, Indra {{appeared}} before Him with Apsara Nilanjana. She danced before Him and suddenly disappeared, discarding her mortal coil. <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> Rishabhdev of the transient {{nature of the}} World and He decided to renounce it.|$|R
6000|$|... [15] How does <b>this</b> <b>remind</b> {{us of the}} awfully {{impressive}} {{cries of}} the man in the iron cage--'O, eternity, eternity! how shall I grapple with the misery that I must meet with in eternity!' 'A thousand deaths live in him, he not dead.'--Ed.|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> me of a circumstance. Just {{after we}} left Julesburg, on the Platte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Phew,' said Horse Egan, when a burial-party {{had taken}} over the burden. 'I'm {{powerful}} dhry, and <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> me there'll be no more beer at all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is encouraging," [...] said he. [...] "It is my {{dread of}} the water that has {{prevented}} me from returning to Sangoa, or even visiting my yacht. And <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> me of a favor I wish to ask." ...|$|E
50|$|All of <b>this</b> <b>reminded</b> {{the public}} heavily {{of how the}} Baltic Republics had been {{occupied}} and annexed {{only a few months}} earlier. It was no wonder that the average Finn feared that the Winter War had produced only a short delay of the same fate.|$|R
50|$|Mt. Assiniboine {{was named}} by George M. Dawson in 1885. When Dawson saw Mt. Assiniboine from Copper Mountain, {{he saw a}} plume of clouds {{trailing}} away from the top. <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> him of the plumes of smoke emanating from the teepees of Assiniboine Indians.|$|R
5000|$|The name {{derived from}} the {{location}} of the original settlement beside a khal ( [...] which means canal in Bengali) according to another theory, britishers when they visited city, saw the goddess with a skull garland. <b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> them the place golgotha.. Which later became kolkotha.|$|R
60|$|Look at {{the rapid}} {{manner in which}} the news of the Galveston {{disaster}} was made known to the entire world. <b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> me of an episode which occurred fifteen years ago when I was at church in Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, Jack, is a lady inquiring {{after your}} health. Betts, <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> {{me of the}} time Isaac came home wounded, after his escape from the Hurons. Strikes me he and his Indian bride should be about due here on a visit." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> me of a remark, I have {{elsewhere}} made {{respecting the}} expediency of separating the arguments addressed to, and valid for, a believer, from the proofs and vindications of Scripture intended {{to form the}} belief, or to convict the Infidel.|$|E
6000|$|We found Hans, {{who had not}} {{accompanied}} us, being {{a little}} shy of appearing in public just then, engaged in cleaning the rifles, and <b>this</b> <b>reminded</b> me of something.

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> Mr. Bob Sawyer {{that the}} boy in gray was looking on, with eyes wide open, and greedy ears. The {{incipient}} chemist having been lifted up by his coat collar, and dropped outside the door, Bob Sawyer assured Mr. Pickwick that he might speak without reserve.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, while {{assembling}} {{material for the}} producers of a documentary film about him (A Colored Life), Jeffries found his birth certificate; <b>this</b> <b>reminded</b> him that he actually was born in 1913 {{and that he had}} misrepresented his age after he left home to look for a job.|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. Good. [Reflectively] All the same, the Superman {{is a fine}} conception. There is {{something}} statuesque about it. [He places himself on the grave trap beside The Devil. It begins to descend slowly. Red glow from the abyss]. Ah, <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> me of old times.|$|E
60|$|When these {{thoughts}} became more rife in society, {{and began to}} {{take the form of}} speech, the year was getting old, and <b>this</b> <b>reminds</b> us of a little incident which took place many months previously, {{at the beginning of the}} year, and which we ought to record.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminds</b> me of Shakespeareâs âAroint thee, witch!â I find {{in several}} books of that age the words aloigne and eloigneâthat is,ââkeep your distance!â or âoff with you!â Perhaps âarointâ was a {{corruption}} of âaloigneâ by the vulgar. The common etymology from ronger to gnaw seems unsatisfactory.|$|E
5000|$|It {{reset the}} {{love affair with}} that team. People had become jaded, people had become upset {{with the idea that}} they just didn't see the success {{at the end of the}} rainbow. And now they had <b>this,</b> and <b>this</b> <b>reminded</b> them of how special this {{football}} team really is.|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> {{the poor}} {{children}} of all the troubles, about which {{they had come to}} their old friend. Bruno sat {{down on the floor and}} began crying.

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>reminded</b> {{our hero}} of his party, {{and the purpose}} of his {{entering}} the opera. He determined not to leave Caroline till her carriage was called; and he began to think that he really must go to the Alhambra, after all. He resolved to send them off at an early hour.|$|R
