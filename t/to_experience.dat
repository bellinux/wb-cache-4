5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research {{predicted}} {{that there would}} be an eastwards shift in activity during the season, with more tropical cyclones than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions. As a result, the island nations of Wallis and Futuna, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, and the Southern Cook Islands were predicted <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> a higher than average number of tropical cyclones. The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, French Polynesia, New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were predicted <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> an average number of tropical cyclones, while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were predicted <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> a reduced number of tropical cyclones. In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia as areas predicted <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> an above average number of tropical cyclones. In contrast, Vanuatu was predicted <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> below average cyclone activity. The Solomon Islands and Tonga were now predicted <b>to</b> <b>experience</b> a reduced number of tropical cyclones, with all other countries expected to face the same risk as the November outlook.|$|E
