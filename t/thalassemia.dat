5|$|During the 1990s, the {{identification}} of newly discovered genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics. Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe single nucleotide polymorphismsand their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for <b>Thalassemia</b> use genetic hybridization tests to identify the specific single nucleotide polymorphism causing an individual's disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its clinical application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a prenatal genetic test for <b>Thalassemia</b> that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes that cut DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of DNA strand depending on which allele (genetic variation) the fetus possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties Molecular Diagnostics.|$|E
25|$|Three main forms {{have been}} described: <b>thalassemia</b> major, <b>thalassemia</b> intermedia, and <b>thalassemia</b> minor. All people with <b>thalassemia</b> are {{susceptible}} to health complications that involve the spleen (which is often enlarged and frequently removed) and gallstones. These complications are mostly found in <b>thalassemia</b> major and intermedia patients. Individuals with beta <b>thalassemia</b> major usually present within {{the first two years}} of life with severe anemia, poor growth, and skeletal abnormalities during infancy. Untreated <b>thalassemia</b> major eventually leads to death, usually by heart failure; therefore, birth screening is very important.|$|E
50|$|Alpha <b>thalassemias</b> {{result from}} deletions {{of each of}} the alpha genes as well as deletions of both HBA2 and HBA1; some nondeletion alpha <b>thalassemias</b> have also been reported.|$|R
40|$|<b>Thalassemias</b> {{are genetically}} {{transmitted}} disorders. Depending upon whether the genetic defects or deletion lies in transmission of α or β globin chain gene, <b>thalassemias</b> are classified into α and β-thalassemias. Thus, <b>thalassemias</b> could be cured by introducing or correcting a gene into the hematopoietic compartment {{or a single}} stem cell. Initial attempts at gene transfer have proved unsuccessful due to limitations of available gene transfer vectors. The present review described the newer approaches to overcome these limitations, includes the introduction of lentiviral vectors. New approaches have also focused on targeting the specific mutation in the globin genes, correcting the DNA sequence or manipulating the development in DNA translocation and splicing to restore globin chain synthesis. This review mainly discusses the gene therapy strategies for the <b>thalassemias,</b> {{including the use of}} lentiviral vectors, generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, gene targeting, splice-switching and stop codon readthrough...|$|R
50|$|His {{research}} {{concentrated on}} the genetics of the haemoglobinopathies and, in particular, a group of inherited haematological disorders known as the <b>thalassemias</b> {{that are associated with}} abnormalities in the production of globin (the protein component of haemoglobin). Weatherall is one of the world's experts on the clinical and molecular basis of the <b>thalassemias</b> and the application of this information for the control and prevention of these diseases in the developing countries.|$|R
25|$|Family {{history and}} ancestry are factors that {{increase}} the risk of beta <b>thalassemia.</b> Depending on your family history, if your parents or grandparents suffered from beta <b>thalassemia</b> there is a high probability of the mutated gene being inherited by an offspring. Even if a child does not have beta <b>thalassemia</b> major, they can still be a carrier resulting in future offspring having beta <b>thalassemia.</b> Another risk factor is because of certain ancestry. Beta <b>thalassemia</b> occurs most often in people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin E/thalassemia: {{common in}} Cambodia, Thailand, {{and parts of}} India, it is {{clinically}} similar to β <b>thalassemia</b> major or <b>thalassemia</b> intermedia.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin C/thalassemia: {{common in}} Mediterranean and African populations, {{hemoglobin}} C/βo <b>thalassemia</b> causes a moderately severe hemolytic anemia with splenomegaly; hemoglobin C/β+ <b>thalassemia</b> produces a milder disease.|$|E
50|$|Elizabeta Nemeth is an American {{physiologist}} who {{has made}} many contributions {{to the understanding of}} inflammatory disorders, <b>thalassemias,</b> and iron overload diseases.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thalassemias,</b> the {{deficiency}} of the alpha and beta chains genes, cause extramedullary hematopoiesis. Symptoms include frontal bossing and malar (zygomatic bone/cheek) prominence.|$|R
40|$|Hemoglobin {{disorders}} {{consist of}} two different groups, the structural hemoglobin variants and the <b>thalassemias.</b> The structural hemoglobin variants typically {{are based on the}} point mutations in the alpha- or beta-globin chain that results in a single-amino acid substitution in the corresponding globin chain, whereas <b>thalassemias</b> are caused by quantitative reduction in globin chain synthesis. Various techniques are applied for the laboratory investigation of these diseases, among them mass spectrometry (MS) for the detection and identification of structural hemoglobin variants and array techniques for the <b>thalassemias.</b> In this review, we present in the first part the most important mass spectrometric techniques applied in hemoglobin variant detection and identification and discuss several important aspects of this analysis technique in hematology. In the second part, the DNA analysis techniques used in hemoglobin analysis, such as reverse hybridization or microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) techniques, are briefly discussed...|$|R
25|$|The beta form of <b>thalassemia</b> is {{particularly}} prevalent among Mediterranean peoples, and this geographical association {{is responsible for}} its naming. <b>Thalassemia</b> resulted in 25,000 deaths in 2013 down from 36,000 deaths in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Beta <b>thalassemia</b> is a {{hereditary}} disease {{allowing for a}} preventative treatment by carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis. It can be prevented if one parent has normal genes, giving rise to screenings that empower carriers to select partners with normal hemoglobin. A study aimed at detecting the genes that could give rise to offspring with sickle cell disease. Patients diagnosed with beta <b>thalassemia</b> have MCH ≤ 26 pg and an RDW < 19. Of 10,148 patients, 1,739 patients had a hemoglobin phenotype and RDW consistent with beta <b>thalassemia.</b> After the narrowing of patients, the HbA2 levels were tested presenting 77 patients with beta <b>thalassemia.</b> This screening procedure proved insensitive in populations of West African ancestry because of the indicators has high prevalence of alpha <b>thalassemia.</b> Countries have programs distributing information about the reproductive risks associated with carriers of haemoglobinopathies. <b>Thalassemia</b> carrier screening programs have educational programs in schools, armed forces, and through mass media {{as well as providing}} counseling to carriers and carrier couples. Screening has showed reduced incidence; by 1995 the prevalence in Italy reduced from 1:250 to 1:4000, and a 95% decrease in that region. The decrease in incidence has benefitted those affected with <b>thalassemia,</b> as the demand for blood has decreased, therefore improving the supply of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Thalassemias are genetic {{disorders}} {{inherited from}} a person's parents. There {{are two main}} types, alpha <b>thalassemia</b> and beta <b>thalassemia.</b> The severity of alpha and beta <b>thalassemia</b> depends on {{how many of the}} four genes for alpha globin or two genes for beta globin are missing. Diagnosis is typically by blood tests including a complete blood count, special hemoglobin tests, and genetic tests. Diagnosis may occur before birth through prenatal testing.|$|E
25|$|Exchange (or partial exchange) transfusions {{are done}} for removal of bilirubin, removal of {{antibodies}} and replacement of red cells (e.g., for anemia secondary to <b>thalassemias</b> and other hemoglobinopathies).|$|R
40|$|The general {{introduction}} {{provides an overview}} of present knowledge regarding hemoglobinopathies and <b>thalassemias,</b> with special attention to sickle cell disease (SCD), α-thalassemia and the screening and diagnosis of these disorders. The hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are a group of autosomal recessive diseases characterized by either the synthesis of a structurally abnormal globin chain or reduced synthesis of one or more normal globin chains. Both Hb structural and synthesis variants may interfere with Hb function, erythrocyte survival and blood flow (rheology) and thereby cause a variety of diseases collectively referred to as hemoglobinopathies and <b>thalassemias.</b> See: summary and future perspectives. ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>thalassemias</b> {{have a high}} {{incidence}} in a broad band extending from the Mediterranean basin and parts of Africa, throughout the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and into the Pacific Islands.|$|R
25|$|The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists {{recommends}} {{all people}} thinking of becoming pregnant be tested {{to see if}} they have <b>thalassemia.</b> Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who carry a <b>thalassemia</b> trait.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{blood transfusions}} {{can result in}} iron {{overload}}. The iron overload related to <b>thalassemia</b> may be treated by chelation therapy with the medications deferoxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox. These treatments have resulted in improving life expectancy in those with <b>thalassemia</b> major.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thalassemia</b> can be {{diagnosed}} via a complete blood count.|$|E
25|$|The <b>thalassemias</b> are {{classified}} {{according to which}} chain of the hemoglobin molecule is affected. In α-thalassemias, production of the α globin chain is affected, while in β-thalassemia, production of the β globin chain is affected.|$|R
25|$|Beta <b>thalassemias</b> {{are due to}} {{mutations}} in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, also inherited in an autosomal, recessive fashion. The severity of the disease depends {{on the nature of}} the mutation and on the presence of {{mutations in}} one or both alleles.|$|R
50|$|HPFH may {{alleviate}} {{the severity of}} certain hemoglobinopathies and <b>thalassemias,</b> and is selected for in populations with a high prevalence of these conditions (which in turn are often selected for in areas where malaria is endemic). Thus, {{it has been found}} to affect Americans of African and Greek descent.|$|R

25|$|<b>Thalassemia</b> is {{a genetic}} disease {{that results in}} the {{production}} of an abnormal ratio of hemoglobin subunits.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thalassemias</b> are hemoglobinopathies and are {{hereditary}} deseases {{which are}} characterized by disturbance in synthesis {{of one or more}} polypeptide chains of globin. <b>Thalassemias</b> are type of anemia of quantitative nature, where synthesized chain of hemoglobin are with normal structure, but not in adequate quantities. β-thalassemia is a desease characterized by production of large quantities of α-chains which exceedes the production of β-chains, whereas β-chains accumulate and precipitate into precursors of red blood cells and change their permeability, which leads to lysis of red blood cells. Within Research Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (RCGEB) is operating national reference laboratory for hemoglobinopathies, founded in 1970, where over the past 40 years examined more than 30, 000 individuals from our country. The analysis revealed that the average frequency of beta-thalassemia in Macedonia is 2. 6...|$|R

50|$|Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) {{is a rare}} blood disorder, {{similar to}} the <b>thalassemias.</b> CDA {{is one of many}} types of anemia, {{characterized}} by ineffective erythropoiesis, and resulting from a {{decrease in the number of}} red blood cells (RBCs) in the body and a less than normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood.|$|R
25|$|Evidence has {{accumulated}} {{that the first}} line of defense against malaria is provided by genetically controlled innate resistance, mainly exerted by abnormal hemoglobins and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The three major types of inherited genetic resistance - sickle cell disease, <b>thalassemias,</b> and G6PD deficiency - were present in the Mediterranean world by the time of the Roman Empire.|$|R
25|$|<b>Thalassemias</b> are {{inherited}} {{blood disorders}} characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production. Symptoms {{depend on the}} type and can vary from none to severe. Often there is mild to severe anemia (low red blood cells). Anemia can result in feeling tired and pale skin.
