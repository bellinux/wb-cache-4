5|$|Although calcium is in {{the same}} group as {{magnesium}} and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive, although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts. Organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of Yb2+ (102pm) and Ca2+ (100pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> stability. For example, calcium dicyclopentadienyl, Ca(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E
5|$|In-game, Terrans <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> {{traditional}} {{modes of}} warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles {{in combination with}} regular infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even tactical nuclear warheads, many Terran units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a melee combat unit. Terrans are more adaptive {{than the other two}} races and are able to produce units at an average expense. Primary base structures can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. Terran buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units.|$|E

5|$|Organostrontium {{compounds}} contain {{one or more}} strontium–carbon bonds. They {{have been}} reported as intermediates in Barbier-type reactions. Although strontium {{is in the same}} group as magnesium, and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive. Organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of these elements (Sr2+ 118pm; Eu2+ 117pm; Sm2+ 122pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> stability. For example, strontium dicyclopentadienyl, Sr(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{biological}} {{theories of}} group cooperation predict that (1) group members will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> judge cooperative co-members favorably, and freeriding co-members negatively and (2) members who themselves cooperate more frequently {{will be especially}} likely to make these social judgments. An experiment tested these predictions among Shuar hunter-horticulturalists. Subjects viewed depictions of pairs of workers who varied in {{the extent to which}} they had contributed to, and benefited from, a team project. Subjects were then asked to judge which worker deserved more respect, and which deserved more punishment. When judging between unequalcontributors, all subjects <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> more cooperative (i. e., higher-contributing) workers. However, when judging between equal-contributors/unequal-benefiters, male subjects who themselves often engaged in team cooperation <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> more cooperative (i. e., lower-benefiting) workers, while subjects who were female and who therefore rarely engaged in team cooperation <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> less cooperative (i. e., higher-benefiting) workers...|$|R
25|$|Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified {{geographically}} or ideologically. However, Whigs <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> {{a stronger}} legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, moral reform (such as the temperance movement), and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, hard money, and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery. The Whigs <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> control many newspapers, while Democrats were particularly adept at organizing the masses.|$|R
25|$|North American fighters <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> a more {{balanced}} stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side.

25|$|The mining {{process is}} ideally {{modelled}} on the extraction operations underway in Australia, where the strip mining {{is followed by}} rehabilitation of the mined areas including intensive re-vegetation with ecologically similar species, re-contouring of the land to its original shape, including dunes, and management of groundwater resources. Modern mining practices <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> dry mining rather than dredging operations, due to the advent of electrostatic mineral separation processes.|$|E

In 2012, Obama won 60% of voters with income under $50,000, and 45% of those with incomes higher than that. Bush won 41% of the poorest 20% of voters in 2004, 55% of the richest twenty percent, and 53% of those in between. In the 2006 House races, the voters with incomes over $50,000 were 49% Republican, while those under were 38%.|$|E

Throughout the south-central coast, bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in quipes or tipili (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican foods include chicharrón, yuca, casabe, pastelitos (empanadas), batata, yam, pasteles en hoja, chimichurris, and tostones.|$|E
25|$|Many linguists, however, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> {{the theory}} that {{speakers}} of Dravidian languages spread southwards and eastwards through the Indian subcontinent, {{based on the fact}} that the southern Dravidian languages show some signs of contact with linguistic groups which the northern Dravidian languages do not. Proto-Dravidian is thought to have differentiated into Proto-North Dravidian, Proto-Central Dravidian and Proto-South Dravidian around 1500 BCE, although some linguists have argued that the degree of differentiation between the sub-families points to an earlier split.|$|E
25|$|The {{segregation}} of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly due to competitive exclusion. In certain areas, grizzly bears outcompete black bears {{for the same}} resources. For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both. In regions where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients such as age of forest, elevation and openness of land. Grizzly bears <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears.|$|E

25|$|While {{a recent}} Gallup survey showed mass {{affluent}} households {{to be conservative}} on economic issues while liberal on social issues, the upper middle class seems to be relatively politically polarized. In the 2006 mid-term elections both Democrats and Republicans received over 40% of the vote from those with advanced degrees and those in households with six figure incomes. While households with incomes exceeding $100,000 <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> Republicans slightly, {{they are also the}} only income demographic where Ralph Nader won more than 1% of the vote. Among those with graduate degrees, a smaller group than those with six figure incomes, the majority tends to vote Democratic with roughly 1% having voted for Nader in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Indépendentistes {{are fully}} {{nationalist}} in outlook. They view {{the federal government}} as a successor state to the British Empire, and as a de facto colonizing agent of English Canada. Consequently, they demand complete independence for Quebec, which they view in the context of national liberation movements in Africa and the Caribbean of the 1960s. Independence is seen as the culmination of a natural societal progression, from colonization to provincial autonomy to outright independence. Accordingly, they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> assertive declarations of independence over negotiations, idealizing the Patriote movement of the 1830s. Their ideological origins can be found within the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale headed by Pierre Bourgault, a founding organization of the Parti Québécois.|$|E
25|$|Positional Plagiocephaly – IN 1992, to {{decrease}} the incidence of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics initiated the “Back to Sleep” campaign, which recommended that babies be put to sleep on their backs. While this almost halved the number of SIDS deaths, the campaign appeared to also help raise plagiocephaly incidence fivefold, to roughly one in sixty live births. Plagiocephaly is simply the flattening of one area of the skull, generally one babies <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> as they lie. While treatment is often as simply as repositioning the baby during sleep, in more pronounced cases helmet therapy may be put to use. In most cases, plagiocephaly is quite minor and easily resolved, with many more pediatric plastic surgeons becoming familiar with helmet therapy for more advanced cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The main {{currents}} of Eurocentric philosophy, broadly conceived: pragmatism, analytic philosophy, and continental philosophy, though {{each of these}} “movements ” ranges over extremely diverse undertakings, now appear to be converging {{on the question of}} the adequacy or inadequacy of some form of naturalism. Analytic philosophy has <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> reductive forms of naturalism (“naturalizing, ” in Quine’s and Davidson’s sense); continental philosophy <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor,</b> in what I call extranaturalism, the inadequacy of any usual form of naturalism (notably, along the lines explored by Husserl and Heidegger); and pragmatism <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> moderate but generous forms of naturalism that admit the uniqueness of the human person. The question that concerns me here is the prospect of a rapprochement among these currents, which I take to depend on a reconsideration of the paired innovations of Kant and Hegel. In these terms, pragmatism appears to have a distinct advantage, though its own fortunes depend on its ability to coopt the distinctive work of the continental...|$|R

25|$|Japan and South Korea <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> large {{infrastructure}} projects, so {{this project}} {{might seem to}} be fairly obvious politically, but this project has been the target of far right/nationalist political groups in both countries. Many South Koreans have advised caution in proceeding with the project due to worries of firms in the much larger Japanese economy becoming more dominant in South Korea due to the lower logistical expenses the tunnel would provide; this increased economic power would further expand the political power of Japan in the region. Similarly, many Japanese firms worry it may expand the increasing dominance of Korean firms in sectors such as consumer electronics. China’s increasing dominance in the region may, eventually, minimize these concerns making the project politically viable, but this is not yet the case.|$|E
25|$|Two common {{environments that}} <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> neoteny are high-altitude and cool environments because neotenous {{individuals}} {{have a higher}} fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form. This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness, also the conditions favor neoteny due {{to the ability of}} neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily. This trend {{can be seen in the}} comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes. The neotenous individuals have higher survivorship as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and cooler environment. Insects in cooler environments tend to show neoteny in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly, thus it is not advantageous for insects in that environment to metamorphose into adults.|$|E
25|$|Coin tossing is {{a simple}} and {{unbiased}} way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as {{which side of the}} field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>favor</b> one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.|$|E
