Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E

500|$|A {{parody of}} the song {{performed}} by Bieber caused controversy after a video of it was released by the entertainment news website TMZ on June 4, 2014. The video featured a then 14-year-old Bieber, parodying the song with the main lyric [...] "One less lonely nigger," [...] and {{that if he were}} to kill [...] "one less lonely nigger," [...] he'd be [...] "part of the KKK." [...] Sources stated that Bieber told his mentors, musical artists Usher and Will Smith, about the video after it was filmed, after which Usher showed Bieber some historically racist videos in an effort to teach him about the degradational intent of the word [...] "nigger" [...] and other racial epithets. On June 5, 2014, the rapper and president of Young Money Entertainment, Mack Maine chose to defend Bieber after the racist remarks. He said Maine says Bieber is still family for the artists on Young Money, according to TMZ. The publication reports that Maine says Bieber has black friends and that [...] "Bieber does not have a slave mentality." [...] According to Mack Maine, Bieber [...] "treats his people with respect." [...] Mack Maine has said that he brought up a racial joke in his past. [...] "I remember telling a White man, Chinese man, Black man joke as a kid that was terrible," [...] Maine says, [...] "and I told it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> because I thought they'd think it was funny." [...] Mack Maine also confirms that Young Money and Justin Bieber are slated to continue working together. On the same day, Bieber made an announcement of his apology for the parody.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{commentators}} {{had suggested}} that Bush forecast the selection of Gonzales with his comments defending the Attorney General made on July 6, 2005, in Copenhagen, Denmark.

2500|$|The Goons made a {{considerable}} {{impact on the}} humour of The Beatles, and especially on John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book The Goon Show Scripts for The New York Times. He wrote: [...] "I was 12 when The Goon Show first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof {{that the world was}} insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called The Daily Howl. I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends.</b> Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to The Goon Show." [...] Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.|$|E
2500|$|Sir , {{you will}} see that they want to place the word [...] "East Pakistan" [...] instead of [...] "East Bengal." [...] We had demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word [...] "Bengal" [...] has a history, has a {{tradition}} of its own. You can change it only after the people have been consulted. So far as the question of One Unit is concerned it can come in the Constitution. Why do {{you want it to be}} taken up just now? What about the state language, Bengali? We will be prepared to consider one-unit with all these things. So I appeal <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.|$|E

The runaway train passed [...] behind him moving at highway speed. Travelling with no signals, the train jumped the track, sending a river of burning oil into the lake. [...] "It was moving at a hellish speed ... no lights, no signals, nothing at all. There was no warning. It was a black blob {{that came out of}} nowhere.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 May, he was found hanged in a deserted lock-up garage he had broken into, in Shoreditch, London, after visiting Chariots Roman Spa, a local gay sauna. In his suicide note, he denied the charges, stating that the sex was consensual, {{and that he had}} fled to England because he felt he could not get a fair trial because of his homosexuality, and he added: [...] "I {{realised}} that I had already been presumed guilty. I do not want to give any more embarrassment <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and family." [...] An inquest held in London on 9 September heard evidence from a Scotland Yard detective that the Americans made no request for Fashanu to be found or arrested, and the Coroner stated that he was not a wanted man at the time he hanged himself. The Times and the BBC reported that an arrest warrant had been issued by Howard County District Court on 3 April, that he had been charged with second-degree sexual assault and first-degree and second-degree assaults punishable by up to 20 years in jail, and that Howard County police would have requested his extradition had they known he fled to England. The inquest recorded a verdict of suicide.|$|E

On June 22, Ford wrote to the Mayor and City Council of Nauvoo, proposing a trial by a non-Mormon jury in Carthage, the county seat, and guaranteed Smith's safety. Smith fled the jurisdiction to avoid arrest, crossing the Mississippi River into Iowa. [...] On June 23, a posse under the command of Ford entered Nauvoo to execute an arrest warrant, but they were unable to locate Smith. [...] After Smith was criticized by some followers, he returned and was reported to have said, [...] "If my life is of no value <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> it is of none to myself." [...] Smith reluctantly submitted to arrest. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me—he was murdered in cold blood." [...] On June 25, 1844, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, along with the other fifteen city council members and some friends, surrendered to Carthage constable William Bettisworth on the original charge of riot.|$|E

2500|$|In {{her teenage}} years, she {{was locked up}} in a Nigerian prison cell because of her femininity. Being imprisoned {{encouraged}} her to leave Nigeria, if she could not have left, the other option was to finally succeed in ending her life. She remembered her experiences in this poignant piece she wrote for Gay Star News on Transgender Day of Remembrance on 20 November 2013, which was re-published by some online news outlets:I wish I could tell the younger me who tried to commit suicide twice that life gets better and dreams do honestly come through. [...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> because they would not understand what I was going through. I found solace in music and dreams. I dreamt of being free to be myself, free of insults, free of judgment and free from harassments.
