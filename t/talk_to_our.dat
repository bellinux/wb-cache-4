2500|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of polling data {{of support for}} same-sex marriage in Australia and membership demographics of the SDA found that the socially conservative positions of the SDA leadership - particularly de Bruyn - {{are likely to be}} at odds with the rank-and-file of the union. The lobby group Australian Marriage Equality challenged the SDA to survey its membership before contributing further to the same-sex marriage debate in Australia. In response to a 2014 poll with 72 percent support for same-sex marriage, de Bruyn dismissed the figures but refused to poll his members on the issue. He says he [...] "knows they agree with him absolutely. When we <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> members about out these things they agree with us". Some SDA-aligned Labor MPs do not agree with the SDA's stance on same-sex marriage and in fact support same-sex marriage in defiance of the SDA, some South Australian examples being Kate Ellis, Amanda Rishworth and Nick Champion.|$|E

Will Atkins, said I, cannot you tell your wife {{she is in the}} wrong, and that her gods are idols, which can neither speak nor understand; but that our God, who has made, can destroy all things; that he rewards the good and punishes the wicked; and at last will bring us to judgment; cannot you tell her these things? That's true, said Atkins, but then she'll tell me it is utterly false, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, who hath been such a wicked creature. These words I interpreted to the priest. [...] "Oh!" [...] said he, [...] "tell him, his repentance will make him a very good minister to his spouse, and qualify him to preach on the mercy and long suffering of a merciful Being, who desires not the death of a sinner, and even defers damnation to the last judgment; this will lead him to the doctrine of the resurrection and will make him an excellent preacher to his wife." [...] I repeated this to Atkins, who being more than ordinary affected with it, replied, I know all this, Sir, and a great deal more; but how can I have the impudence to talk thus to my wife, given my conscience witnesses against me? Alas! said he (with tears in his eye, and giving a great sigh) as for repenting, that is for ever past me. Past you! Atkins, said I, what do you mean? You know well enough, said he, what I mean, I mean it is too late.|$|E

It was immediately obvious to me what an inspirational figure Denys was. He was highly intelligent, fascinated by Politics and totally involved in the life of Dean Close.

It was a time where controversial issues would often be discussed and Denys was marvellously open minded, prepared to listen to viewpoints with which he disagreed.

Importantly Denys was a man who saw the shades of grey in difficult issues.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Though many Jewish Israeli rappers {{are present}} in the country’s pop culture, fewer Palestinian hip-hop groups have surfaced, though one has gained {{widespread}} popularity. The group's name, DAM, is the Arabic verb for [...] "to last forever/eternity" [...] (دام) and the Hebrew word for [...] "blood" [...] (דם), but can also be an acronym for [...] "Da Arabian MCs." [...] DAM could be argued to be the polar opposite of Subliminal’s right-wing stance. Formed in 1998, DAM is noted as the first Arab-Israeli hip-hop group and consists of three Palestinian men who hold Israeli citizenship as well: Tamer Nafer, his brother Suhell, and a friend, Mahmoud Jreri. [...] Though the rappers mostly sing in Arabic, they do write songs in Hebrew and English as well, to ensure that they reach all of their intended audiences. The content of their songs is largely focused on the many conflicts existent between Israel and the Palestinians, including the issue of Palestinians feeling like second-class citizens of the country. DAM often challenges Zionism with their lyrics and accuses the Israeli government of racism and inequality. Many of their songs demand treatment equal to that offered to the Jewish citizens of Israel. According to lead rapper Nafer, “our message is one of humanity- but it’s also political- we make protest music.” DAM’s first single of 2001, “Meen Erhabe?” (or “Who’s the Terrorist?”) was not even released by an official recording label, but was still downloaded from online by over one million visitors. Their latest rap single, “Born Here,” is written and performed in Hebrew to further expand their audience. Nafar has also stated that the reasoning for the transition to Hebrew lyrics {{is to be able to}} transmit the messages of the injustices to the Israelis very clearly. Nafar has said that his position is to replace politicians; “Politicians don’t <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> generation. But politics is the way of our life, so I’m bringing the way of our life in their language.” [...] In November 2006, DAM ultimately released an official album, titled “Dedication.” ...|$|E

So one can imagine if {{we were able to}} convert the sound energy to electricity then we can charge our mobile phone just by <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> friends on mobile itself...|$|R

Tim Hilton writes thatThe Irish girl Rose was a puzzle, {{for she was}} precocious in some ways and not in others. Sometimes she had a surprising understanding of adult attitudes: at the next moment she was once more completely a child. She had a pretty way of making herself engaging, even coquettish, but could also be rather solemn. 'I don't {{know what to make}} of her', Ruskin confessed. '...She wears her round hat in the sauciest way possible—and is a firm—fiery little thing.Ruskin's interest in Rose grew into fascination and adoration for his pupil and their interaction consisted of extraordinary amounts of correspondence. In fact, Ruskin's first letter from Rose impressed him so much that he reprinted it in its entirety in Praeterita. WritingSome wise, and prettily mannered, people have told me I shouldn't say anything about Rosie at all. But I am too old now to take advice, and I won't have this following letter—the first she ever wrote me—moulder away, when I can read it no more, lost to all loving hearts. (Praeterita, The Works of John Ruskin, 529)The letter Rose writes is addressed [...] "Dearest St. Crumpet"—her pet name for him was [...] "St. Crumpet"—and contains sweet, affection, attentive notes about how much she and her family thought about Ruskin during their travels:I wish so very much that you were happy—God can make you so—We will try not to forget all you taught us—It was so nice of you. Thank you so much from both of us.--Mama is very glad you went to Dr. Ferguson. She says you must not give him up. How very kind of you to see & <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> old man.
