He argued that their rise was fueled by mobilizing resources and that their growth rates would inevitably slow. His article helped popularize the argument made by Lawrence Lau and Alwyn Young, among others, that the growth of economies in East Asia was not the result of new and original economic models, but rather from high capital investment and increasing labor force participation, and that <b>total</b> <b>factor</b> productivity had not increased. Krugman argued that in the long term, only increasing <b>total</b> <b>factor</b> productivity can lead to sustained economic growth. Krugman's article was highly criticized in many Asian countries when it first appeared, and subsequent studies disputed some of Krugman's conclusions. However, it also stimulated a great deal of research, and may have caused the Singapore government to provide incentives for technological progress.|$|E

2500|$|By placing high {{tariffs on}} imports and other protectionist, inward-looking trade policies, the {{citizens}} of any given country, using a simple supply-and-demand rationale, will substitute the less-expensive good for the more expensive. The primary industry of importance would gather its resources, such as labor from other industries in this situation; the industrial sector would use resources, capital, and labor from the agricultural sector. In time, a third-world country would look and behave similar to a first-world country, and with a new accumulation of capital and an increase of TFP (<b>total</b> <b>factor</b> productivity) the nation's industry would, in principle, be capable of trading internationally and competing in the world market. Bishwanath Goldar, in his paper ‘Import Substitution, Industrial Concentration and Productivity Growth in Indian Manufacturing’ wrote: [...] "Earlier studies on productivity for the industrial sector of developing countries have indicated that increases in <b>total</b> <b>factor</b> productivity, (TFP) are {{an important source of}} industrial growth," [...] (Goldar 143).

Implicitly TFP growth includes any permanent productivity improvements that result from improved management practices in the private or public sectors of the economy.

2500|$|Scholars {{disagree}} {{on how to}} quantify efficiency of slavery. In Time on the Cross, Fogel and Engerman equate efficiency to <b>total</b> <b>factor</b> productivity (TFP)—the output per average unit of input on a farm. Using this measurement, southern farms that enslaved black people using the Gang System were 35% more efficient than Northern farms which used free labor. Under the Gang System, groups of slaves perform synchronized tasks under the constant vigilance of an overseer. Each group was like {{a part of a}} machine. If perceived to be working below his capacity, a slave could be punished. Fogel argues that this kind of negative enforcement was not frequent and that slaves and free laborers had similar quality of life; however, there is controversy on this last point. A critique of Fogel and Engerman's view was published by Paul A. David in 1976. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association sought to study the views of economists and economic historians on the debate. The study found that 72 percent of economists and 65 percent of economic historians would generally agree that [...] "Slave agriculture was efficient compared with free agriculture. [...] Economies of scale, effective management, and intensive utilization of labor and capital made southern slave agriculture considerably more efficient than nonslave southern farming." [...] 48 percent of the economists agreed without provisos, while 24 percent agreed when provisos were included in the statement. On the other hand, 58 percent of economic historians and 42 percent of economists disagreed with Fogel and Engerman's [...] "proposition that the material (not psychological) conditions of the lives of slaves compared favorably with those of free industrial workers in the decades before the Civil War".|$|E

Accurate measurement of small radiation fields {{is a well-known}} challenge for many dosimeters. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure <b>total</b> scatter <b>factors</b> for stereotactic cones with plastic scintillation detector and its comparison against diode detector and theoretical estimates. Measurements were performed on Novalis Tx™ linear accelerator for 6 MV SRS beam with stereotactic cones of diameter 6 mm, 7. 5 mm, 10 mm, 12. 5 mm, and 15 mm. The advantage of plastic scintillator detector is in its energy dependence. The <b>total</b> scatter <b>factor</b> was measured in water at the depth of dose maximum. <b>Total</b> scatter <b>factor</b> with plastic scintillation detector was determined by normalizing the readings to field size of 10 cm × 10 cm. To overcome energy dependence of diode detector for the determination of scatter factor with diode detector, daisy chaining method was used. The plastic scintillator detector was calibrated against the ionization chamber, and the reproducibility in the measured doses was found to be within ± 1 %. <b>Total</b> scatter <b>factor</b> measured with plastic scintillation detector was 0. 728 ± 0. 3, 0. 783 ± 0. 05, 0. 866 ± 0. 55, 0. 885 ± 0. 5, and 0. 910 ± 0. 06 for cone sizes of 6 mm, 7. 5 mm, 10 mm, 12. 5 mm, and 15 mm, respectively. <b>Total</b> scatter <b>factor</b> measured with diode detector was 0. 733 ± 0. 03, 0. 782 ± 0. 02, 0. 834 ± 0. 07, 0. 854 ± 0. 02, and 0. 872 ± 0. 02 for cone sizes of 6 mm, 7. 5 mm, 10 mm, 12. 5 mm, and 15 mm, respectively.
