In the lyrics, Jackson again sings {{from the point}} of view of [...] "Damita Jo", in [...] "intermittent vocal bubbles" [...] to discuss the pleasures she intends to provide. Jackson states [...] "Relax, it's just sex", at the song's closing. The fourth track, [...] "Strawberry Bounce", depicts Jackson method acting a sensual display as alter ego [...] "Strawberry." [...] Characterizing herself as a one-woman gentleman's club, Jackson asks her partner to [...] "Let me be your playground." [...] The song morphs a sample of Jay-Z's vocals into its instrumentation of chimes, snapping rhythms, and synthesizers. Fusing new-school hip-hop with pop, Jackson sings [...] "watch the way I pump it, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> is gonna keep you comin'", in a feverish pant.

60|$|No {{description}} of London {{would be complete}} without a reference, however brief, to the singular salubrity and charm of the London climate. This is seen at its best during the autumn and winter months. The climate of London and indeed of England generally is due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> is thus: The Gulf Stream, as it nears the shores of the British Isles and feels the propinquity of Ireland, rises into the air, turns into soup, and comes down on London. At times the soup is thin and is in fact little more than a mist: at other times it has the consistency of a thick Potage St. Germain. London people are a little sensitive on the point and flatter their atmosphere by calling it a fog: but it is not: it is soup. The notion that no sunlight ever gets through and that in the London winter people never see the sun is of course a ridiculous error, circulated no doubt by the jealousy of foreign nations. I have myself seen the sun plainly visible in London, without the aid of glasses, on a November day in broad daylight; and again one night about four o'clock in the afternoon I saw the sun distinctly appear through the clouds. The whole subject of daylight in the London winter is, however, one which belongs rather to the technique of astronomy than to a book of description. In practice daylight is but little used. Electric lights are burned all the time in all houses, buildings, railway stations and clubs. This practice which is now universally observed is called Daylight Saving.|$|E

It focuses on the company’s unique relationship with one partner supplier – Denso – where contingency loss potential is the greatest. A literature review reveals some gaps between the English and Japanese literature.

She also identifies a future research question: might Toyota’s domestic success have arisen partly because its competitors did not understand <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked?...</b>|$|R
