40|$|Cold wire {{measurement}} of temperature fluctuations {{were made in}} a DERAT T' 2 induction powered cryogenic wind tunnel for 2 types of liquid nitrogen injectors. Thermal turbulence measured in the <b>tranquilization</b> <b>chamber</b> depends {{to a great extent}} on the injector used; for fine spray of nitrogen drops, this level of turbulence seemed completely acceptable. Fluctuations in static pressure taken from the walls of the vein by Kulite sensors showed that there was no increase in aerodynamic noise during cryogenic gusts...|$|E
