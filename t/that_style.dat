She was now the queen mother, though she did not use <b>that</b> <b>style,</b> and was instead known as Her Majesty Queen Mary.|$|E

5|$|Russell Sage built {{a row of}} Gothic Revival {{houses on}} Second Street in 1846 that survives, albeit without some of their {{original}} ornamentation. On the edges of town, some architects began exploring that style's Picturesque mode. A new row of townhouses at Washington Park went up, and another Second Street row followed in 1855. The following year, St. John's Episcopal Church, at First and Liberty Streets, was the first use of <b>that</b> <b>style</b> for a city church.|$|E
5|$|St. Paul's Place: Off State Street between Fourth and Fifth avenues. This is {{a street}} of six {{attached}} three-story brick rowhouses built ca. 1850. They feature {{a variation on}} Italianate norms with bracketed gables and rounded-arch windows and doors rarely seen with <b>that</b> <b>style</b> in an urban environment.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did not care for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that <b>that</b> <b>style</b> would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E

5|$|Other architects {{chose the}} era's simpler styles, like Arts and Crafts, as a contrast. The marble-and-brick 1905 YMCA {{building}} on Second Street, and the six-story Caldwell Apartments at State and Second streets {{are two of}} the district's best examples of <b>that</b> <b>style.</b> The latter building, built in 1907, was also the first large-scale apartment building in the city. The Colonial Revival style would also leave its mark in Troy with several buildings. Most notable among them is the Hendrick Hudson Hotel {{on the east side of}} Monument Square, a six-story structure that was the largest building ever built in the city at the time. Projects of similar scale, and the city's annexation of the village of Lansingburgh to its north, helped swell its population to over 72,000 in 1930, its alltime peak.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to <b>that</b> <b>style.</b> Stained glass, columns and a pediment are among the more noticeable features at a glance. The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features stained glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear driveway. Inside the building's third floor courtroom is more stained glass, {{in the form of}} a skylight. During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's courtroom.|$|E
5|$|The first {{railroad}} station in Erie {{was established in}} 1851 but was replaced with the Romanesque Revival-style Union Depot in 1866. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions by competing railroad companies which started {{not long after the}} establishment of Erie's first railroads, Union Depot became jointly owned and operated by the New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads. To meet the changing needs of the rapidly growing city, planners designed a more modern structure to replace the original depot. The new Art Deco Union Station, dedicated on December3, 1927, was the first {{railroad station}} of <b>that</b> <b>style</b> in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The mid-century houses {{show the}} {{influence}} of the Greek Revival style still popular {{at the time of their}} construction. Their form is rectilinear; their interiors follow <b>that</b> <b>style's</b> central-hall format. The eyebrow windows are a further touch common to such buildings.|$|R
50|$|The sanctum sanctorum of the Vadeshwaram Temple was {{constructed}} in a style known as Ashtadala (eight-petalled). Scholars state <b>that</b> this <b>style</b> is unique to the Vadeshwaram Temple and <b>that</b> this <b>style</b> {{does not exist in}} any other temple in India.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic <b>that</b> <b>style</b> may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{an alternative}} perspective {{on what is}} {{commonly referred to as}} styling. Adopting a neuroevolutionary perspective, it challenges the trivialization of this seminal facet of designing. Via its long evolutionary history in a hostile environment the brain specialized in visual knowledge, with language and later numeracy as comparatively minor add-ons. Visual knowledge acquisition became an evolutionary imperative, feeding the highly sophisticated neural storage and classification systems that accompanied this specialization. Styling is an extension of visual knowledge acquisition into visual knowledge creation. It is contended <b>that</b> <b>styling</b> is an evolutionary exaptation whereby the original brain function of visual knowledge acquisition was adapted to externalize visual information. This externalization subsequently became a powerful means of indicating group identity and allegiance, and laid the foundations of visual culture. The externalization it shares with the fine arts; the distinction being <b>that</b> <b>styling</b> is associated with purposive objects. Emerging evidence also indicates <b>that</b> <b>styling</b> predisposes us to positive or negative attitudes to such non-aesthetic features of products and services as usability and trust. As such, it emotionally primes us. Evidence is presented that suggests a process of deceptively high sophistication, and one that questions fundamental assumptions in this field...|$|R

25|$|The two churches grew {{with the}} village. In 1834 the Baptist church was renovated, and the Presbyterians {{built a new}} Greek Revival church. Many of the {{commercial}} buildings in <b>that</b> <b>style</b> along Main Street west of the crossroads were demolished when the Croton Aqueduct, a masonry underground tunnel, was built in 1839 to connect Croton Dam with the reservoirs in Central Park. The buildings in <b>that</b> <b>style</b> at 151–155 Main Street, built afterwards further east, survived and were the oldest buildings in the district when it was established, but are no longer extant. Only the clapboard Italianate house at 23 South Highland, {{one of the few}} residences in the district and now its oldest building, survives from the pre-Civil War period.|$|E

25|$|Later {{buildings}} {{show the}} rise of the Gothic Revival movement. The Central House's steeply-pitched front cross-gable is the most notable application, showing the sophistication of the Picturesque mode. It may have influenced the later additions in <b>that</b> <b>style</b> to some of the other buildings, most notably the Lawson House.|$|E
25|$|Miró {{has been}} a {{significant}} influence on late 20th-century art, in particular the American abstract expressionist artists such as Motherwell, Calder, Gorky, Pollock, Matta and Rothko, while his lyrical abstractions and color field paintings were precursors of <b>that</b> <b>style</b> by artists such as Helen Frankenthaler, Olitski and Louis and others.|$|E
