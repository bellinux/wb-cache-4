5|$|Malaysia's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} English Common Law. Although the {{judiciary}} is theoretically independent, its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency. The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts are the Syariah Courts, which apply Shariah law to Muslims {{in the areas of}} family law and religious observances. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E

50|$|In murder trials {{occurring}} after Furman v.

25|$|Beginning {{in about}} the 4th century, Japan became {{increasingly}} influenced by the Chinese judicial system, and gradually adopted a system of different punishments for different crimes, including <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> However, beginning in the Nara period, cruel punishments and <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>were</b> used less and less, probably {{as a result of}} the influence of Buddhist teachings, and <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> abolished completely in the Heian period. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> not used for the next 300 years, until the Genpei War.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> sanctioned in <b>the</b> {{codes of}} law {{of all the}} other pre-unitarian states, {{therefore}} when the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in 1860, legislation <b>was</b> divided, since <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> legal in all of Italy except for Tuscany.|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} case (1966) {{the court did}} not raise the issue as to whether <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> unconstitutional. In <b>the</b> second hearing, which also took place in 1968, the court did raise the issue but decided that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> neither cruel nor unusual. However, in view of Witherspoon, the court found that <b>the</b> defendants <b>death</b> sentence was unconstitutionally decided. In this third hearing, the court changed its mind and decided <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> cruel or unusual.|$|R

50|$|Before 1949 {{the usual}} {{punishment}} for Mord (§ 211) in Germany was capital punishment, except in less severe cases. In 1949, <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> abolished by <b>the</b> Grundgesetz in West Germany. In East Germany <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> abolished in 1987.

25|$|The {{case was}} struck {{down by the}} US Supreme Court in Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008), thus {{expanding}} Coker. The court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> unconstitutional in all cases that do not involve murder or crimes against the State.|$|E
25|$|Data {{shows that}} the {{application}} of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> strongly influenced by racial bias. Furthermore, some opponents {{argue that it is}} applied in an arbitrary manner by a criminal justice system that {{has been shown to be}} biased through the systemic influence of socio-economic, geographic, and gender factors. Another argument in the capital punishment debate is the cost.|$|E
25|$|His case, which appalled South Koreans, {{has fueled}} {{the debate on}} capital {{punishment}} in South Korea.

It appeared capital punishment might be abolished prior to Yoo's arrest, but support for the death penalty has grown since learning of his crimes.|$|E

50|$|In June 1991, Sit {{put forward}} a motion to urge the {{government}} to resume the carrying out of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> immediately. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Hong Kong was mandatory sentence for murder, however no executive had been carried out since 1967.

25|$|In the 2008 case Kennedy v. Louisiana, {{the court}} also held 5-4 that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, {{including}} child rape. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision. Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the 2008 presidential election and was criticized by both major party candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.|$|E
25|$|Coker v. Georgia, , {{held that}} the death penalty for rape of an adult woman was grossly disproportionate and {{excessive}} punishment, and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A few states continued to have child rape statutes that authorized the death penalty. In Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008), the court expanded Coker, ruling that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> unconstitutional in all cases that do not involve murder or crimes against the State.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> {{carried out}} by hanging in an {{execution}} chamber within the detention centre. When an execution order has been issued, the condemned prisoner is informed {{in the morning of}} their execution. The condemned is given a choice of the last meal. The prisoner's family and legal representatives, and also the general public, are informed only afterwards. Since 7 December 2007, the authorities have been releasing the names, natures of crime, and ages of executed prisoners.|$|E
5000|$|Brennan {{was also}} less {{interested}} in stare decisis or the avoidance of [...] "absolutist" [...] positions where <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> concerned. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, Brennan's closest ally in the court, concluded in Furman v. Georgia that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was,</b> in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> constitutional four years later. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall took turns, joined by the other, in issuing a dissent in every denial of certiorari in a capital case, and from every decision in a case which the court did take which failed to vacate a sentence of death.|$|R

25|$|Rajah {{proposed}} that, in {{the light}} of the Reyes, Hughes and Fox cases, the holding in Ong Ah Chuan that the mandatory death penalty is constitutional should no longer be relied on by the Singapore courts. Thus, provisions such as section 302 of the Penal Code, which imposes the penalty for the offence of murder, should be construed such that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> not mandatory in order to bring it into conformity with the Constitution pursuant to Article 162.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush is {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of capital punishment. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were executed in that state, maintaining its record as the leading state in executions. As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Although Bush's support of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> known, controversy broke in 1999 when journalist Tucker Carlson revealed that the Governor had mocked the plight of Karla Faye Tucker in an interview.|$|E

25|$|In the Caribbean countries, {{the death}} penalty exists at least de jure (except in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which {{abolished}} it in 1966 and 1987, respectively; in 2008, St. Kitts & Nevis hanged a murderer and became {{the only country in}} the Americas other than the United States to use {{the death penalty}} in the past ten years). In Central and South America, the death penalty exists in Belize and Guyana, though it has not been used for years. In Brazil, Chile, El Salvador and Peru, <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> used only in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime and was abolished for other crimes. Guatemala abolished it for civil cases in 2017.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court of Canada, in {{the case}} United States v. Burns, (2001), {{determined}} that Canada should not extradite persons to face trial in other countries for crimes punishable by death unless Canada has received an assurance that the foreign state will not apply the death penalty, essentially overruling Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice), (1991). This {{is similar to the}} extradition policies of other nations such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Israel, Mexico, Colombia and Australia, which also refuse to extradite prisoners who may be condemned to death. Extradition where <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> possible was ruled a violation of the European Convention of Human Rights {{in the case}} of Soering v United Kingdom outlawing the practice in member states of the Council of Europe, of which all of the European Union member states are part.|$|E

The Al Ma'unah group was later charged under Section 121 of the Penal Code, conviction under which carries with it two penalties in the alternative, death or life imprisonment, and a third sentence that if <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> not pronounced, a convicted person shall also be liable to a fine.|$|E
