5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> of the ores of other metals.

During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E

30|$|Although <b>the</b> above image <b>processing</b> {{algorithms}} {{in various}} modern product designs have obtained good image restoration quality, {{the time required}} for image processing is still too long, which is still not suitable for real-time applications. The fundamental reason for <b>the</b> slow image <b>processing</b> is that these algorithms are use nonlinear optimization design, the process contains {{a large number of}} iterations, and too many iterations affect <b>the</b> image <b>processing</b> time. For this problem, this paper reports on application of the embedded block optimization hierarchical tree algorithm to <b>the</b> image <b>processing</b> of modern product design.

5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E

It should be noted that for some state-of-the-art matrix-based subspace tracking schemes, such as the exponential window FAPI algorithm [6], they have been developed {{based on the fact that}} each new observation takes the form of a column vector.

5|$|Sodium is reabsorbed to {{maintain}} extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed {{to maintain}} serum potassium concentration within narrow limits. Sodium pumps in the renal tubules operate to reabsorb sodium. Potassium must be conserved also, but, because {{the amount of}} potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium. Since potassium is moved passively in counter flow to sodium {{in response to an}} apparent (but not actual) Donnan equilibrium, the urine can never sink below the concentration of potassium in serum except sometimes by actively excreting water at the end of <b>the</b> <b>processing.</b> Potassium is excreted twice and reabsorbed three times before the urine reaches the collecting tubules.
