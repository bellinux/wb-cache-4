5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>Counsel,</b> {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E
