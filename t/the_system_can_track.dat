40|$|Model-based 3 D object {{tracking}} is {{fast and}} robust using 3 D edges. However, traditional edge-based approaches have difficulty handling occluding contours of curved surfaces, {{since they are}} not static model edges but change with the viewpoint. In this {{paper we propose a}} unified approach to edge-based tracking where 3 D edges including occluding contours are utilized. This is achieved through an analysis of local surface differential geometry, which provides the foundation for incorporating occluding contours of curved surfaces into edge-based tracking. This approach uses a simple parametrization of both types of model edges within the same framework. The proposed method has been tested within the context of an existing edge-based tracking system. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>track</b> both types of model edges in a very fast and robust manner.

40|$|Abstract Studies on {{microscopic}} pedestrian requires {{large amounts}} of trajectory data from real-world pedestrian crowds. Such data collection, if done manually, needs tremendous effort and is very time consuming. Though many studies have asserted the possibility of automating this task using video cameras, we found {{that only a few}} have demonstrated good performance in very crowded situations or from a top-angled view scene. This paper deals with tracking pedestrian crowd under heavy occlusions from an angular scene. Our automated tracking system consists of two modules that perform sequentially. The first module detects moving objects as blobs. The second module is a tracking system. We employ probability distribution from the detection of each pedestrian and use Bayesian update to track the next position. The result of such tracking is a database of pedestrian trajectories over time and space. With certain prior information, we showed that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>track</b> {{a large number of people}} under occlusion and clutter scene. ...|$|E

40|$|A simple, compact, yet {{powerful}} robotic winch, called "Winch-Bot," {{is presented}} in this thesis. The Winch-Bot is an underactuated robot having only one controllable axis. Although hanging a load with merely one cable, {{it is capable of}} moving it in a large workspace by swinging the load dynamically based on parametric self-excitation. The generated trajectories can be used for a variety of tasks, from moving material to cyclic inspection of surfaces. The basic principle and design concept of the Winch-Bot are first described, followed by dynamic modeling and analysis. Two trajectory generation problems are solved. One is point-to-point transfer of a load, and the other is the tracking of a continuous path. It will be shown that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>track</b> a given geometric trajectory, although the tracking velocity cannot be determined arbitrarily due to the underactuated nature of dynamics.
