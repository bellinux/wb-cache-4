5|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} their new shadows, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that the villagers from Talta have started to head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> finds the villagers attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once the villagers are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After the base is destroyed, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> heads north in search of Nene. Nene captures Kluke, and places a collar around her neck which Nene alleges will explode. After reaching Nene, Zola separates from <b>the</b> <b>party</b> to buy them time to attack Nene. When <b>the</b> <b>party</b> attempts to remove Kluke's collar, Nene absorbs the party's shadows by placing collars on all of them. After taking their powers and placing them in himself, he removes their collars and attempts to kill them before they recover. Shu, despite being drained of magical ability, unconsciously teleports <b>the</b> <b>party</b> to the distant Devour village.|$|E
5|$|After its founding, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{promoted}} {{itself as}} the legitimate heir of the Socialist Party of America. Former Mayor of Milwaukee, Frank Zeidler, was elected the first national chairperson of <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> Zeidler also helped re-organizing <b>the</b> <b>party</b> structure during its early years. He was later nominated as the party's candidacy for the presidential office, with Zeidler believing <b>the</b> <b>party</b> {{would be able to}} collaborate with other socialist parties nationwide to spread the message of socialism.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 general election, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> contested five constituencies, despite {{previously}} indicating {{it would}} vie for ten. These were the Lincolnshire seats of Boston and Skegness and Brigg and Goole alongside the West Midlands seats of Meriden and Solihull; additionally contested was Cheadle, a constituency in Greater Manchester. Nattrass once again appeared on Daily Politics, interviewed by Jo Coburn on 1 April. No candidates were elected and <b>the</b> <b>party</b> accumulated a negligible vote share. Local {{elections in the}} same year saw <b>the</b> <b>party</b> unsuccessfully contest eight wards on East Lindsey District Council, with an additional candidate failing in his bid for election to Leicester City Council. The following year's local elections saw <b>the</b> <b>party</b> field a candidate for Exeter City Council, who was comfortably defeated. A day later, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> contested a local by-election for Croydon London Borough Council triggered by the resignation of Emily Benn; <b>the</b> <b>party</b> finished second last, above Winston McKenzie of the English Democrats. Independence from Europe failed to field any candidates in the 2017 local elections; incumbent Councillors Alan Jesson and John Beaver did not seek re-election and Chris Pain defected to the Lincolnshire Independents, leaving <b>the</b> <b>party</b> with no official political representation.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>party</b> was {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned by <b>the</b> <b>party</b> leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on}} the scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, <b>the</b> <b>party</b> wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E
