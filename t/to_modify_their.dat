5|$|Some enemies move in {{predictable}} {{patterns and}} others hunt the player. They range in resemblance from larva and vultures to spiders. While ascending the mountain, the player passes through themed biomes, such as forest, desert, and snow, and each {{section of the}} mountain introduces new enemies that force the player <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> strategy. TumbleSeed is depicted in a simple, colorful art style. Its characters are one-eyed, seed-shaped creatures who occasionally have hats. Their dialogue is visualized with speech bubbles, in text and emoji. Additionally, TumbleSeed includes other features including quests, leaderboards, and daily challenges.|$|E
5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses the different {{ages of the}} player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, interactions with the game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000. The character's {{creation is}} done in steps, with the player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender their character is, and the name they have. Next, they customize their character's primary attributes via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system – Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck – which is retained in Fallout 3, and determines the base level of the Skills the game uses. What three skills their character focuses on can either be left to the choices they make with a series of question, or by choosing manually what they desire. Character creation is not finalized until the player finally leaves Vault 101 and enters the Capital Wastelands, allowing players the option <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> character's appearance, primary attributes and Skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices.|$|E

5|$|With {{time running}} out, Phlox and T'Pol {{find a way}} to disrupt the virus using deadly levels of radiation. Archer and Phlox, while wearing {{environmental}} suits, escort Tucker and Sato to Sickbay for treatment. Sato soon goes into cardiac-arrest, and Archer removes his gloves and helmet to assist her, but she cannot be resuscitated. They then administer a dose of radiation to Tucker, but that too is ineffective. Phlox then leaves to resume work from the Bridge. Suddenly, Tucker and Sato are reanimated by the aliens, whowhile possessing the crewmenexplain the situation to a surprised Archer, who then makes an impassioned speech on behalf of his crew. The aliens decide <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> procedures, choosing to resurrect and cure the infected crew members, when they previously would have left them to die. The aliens erase the encounter from the crew's memory. Archer orders a warning beacon to be placed above the planet, and the aliens leave to begin planning first contact with more advanced humans at a later time.|$|E

25|$|Customization was {{significantly}} overhauled, specifically by allowing equipment {{and other items}} <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> appearance based on who it is equipped to. Depending upon which party member has received it, a piece of armour would automatically adjust its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining their identity. Players can craft and customize armour or weapons using the materials they have collected; rarer materials give the particular weapon or armour piece better attributes. Players can customize their keeps, such as rebuilding a garden as a Chantry church or a herb garden. These upgrades have minor effects on the Inquisitions espionage, commerce or military capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} needed <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> transmitters {{to allow}} for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift keyer that used a diode to switch a capacitor {{in and out of}} the circuit, shifting the transmitter’s frequency in synchronism with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80 meters but become progressively less stable on 40 meters, 20 meters and 15 meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a crystal-controlled high frequency oscillator with a variable low frequency oscillator, resulting in better frequency stability across all Amateur Radio HF bands.|$|E
25|$|The winter service uniform {{for both}} WR {{officers}} and enlisted was designed {{along the lines}} of the men's uniform. It was a forest green and consisted of a skirt, no higher than the bottom of the kneecap, and an unbelted jacket with three bronze buttons, a green cap trimmed with a scarlet cord. Marine Corps emblems were placed on the cap and on the uniform lapels; scarlet chevrons were sewn on the jacket's sleeves. Under the jacket, a khaki shirt and matching field scarf was worn. Added to the ensemble were dark brown gloves, shoulder bag, and shoes. For inclement weather, there was a green overcoat or a Khaki trench coat, a red muffler, and black boots, or rubbers. Neither officers nor enlisted members had dress uniforms although officers were able <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> winter service uniform into a dress uniform by substituting a white shirt and forest green tie in place of the regular khaki. The enlisted members were without such freedom.|$|E

25|$|Slum dwellers usually {{experience}} {{a high rate}} of disease. Diseases that have been reported in slums include cholera, HIV/AIDS, measles, malaria, dengue, typhoid, drug resistant tuberculosis, and other epidemics. Studies focus on children's health in slums address that cholera and diarrhea are especially common among young children. In Haiti (where a majority of the population live in poverty), after the 2010 earthquake, an outbreak of Cholera spread throughout the country, killing 8321 people. Besides children's vulnerability to diseases, many scholars also focus on high HIV/AID prevalence in slums among women. In some slums, gender inequality increases women's risk of HIV/AIDS. Mutual monogamy or using condoms are two main ways to prevent HIV/AIDS, but some women might not be able <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> behaviors due to masculine authority or violence. Furthermore, diseases can sometimes lead to high mortality in slums. According to a study in Nairobi's slums, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis attributed to about 50% of the mortality burden.|$|E
25|$|Applications such as Instagram {{have become}} a “body-image battleground”, while the “selfie” is now the {{universal}} lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others. Facebook and Snapchat also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the highpoints of their lives, a survey by Common Sense reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or {{if it did not}} receive the amount of attention they hoped for. Hence, this could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> photos {{in order to meet the}} media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the Renfrew Center Foundation, 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35 year old women edited their images before uploading. Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online. Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Quebec French is not standardised {{and as such}} {{is considered}} standard French. One {{of the reasons for}} this is to keep it in line with and mutually intelligible with Metropolitan French: there is a continuum of mutual intelligibility throughout France and Québec even if some minor differences in phonology and vocabulary exist. If a comparison can be made, the differences between both varieties are comparable to those between standard American and standard British English even if differences in phonology and prosody for the latter are probably greater than between Quebec and Metropolitan French, though American forms will be widely understood due to larger exposure of American English in English-speaking countries, notably due to the widespread diffusion of US films and series. Francophone Canadians abroad may have <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>their</b> accent somewhat in order to be more easily understood, but most are able to communicate readily with European francophones nonetheless. European pronunciation is usually not difficult for Canadians to understand; only differences in vocabulary present any problems. Nevertheless, the Quebec French accent is mostly closer to that of Poitou or of Normandy and also some parts of Wallonia.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} whether the feedback of laboratory use and cost data <b>to</b> clinicians <b>modifies</b> <b>their</b> request behaviour. METHODS: Over {{two years the}} effect of monthly feedback of clinical chemistry test use and revenue expenditure to three consultant physicians on their clinical chemistry and haematology requesting patterns was evaluated. Two physicians who received no information served as controls. RESULTS: Feedback over one year led to an immediate and sustained decrease of 15 %, 27 %, and 21 % in clinical chemistry requests (p less than 0. 01), tests (p less than 0. 001), and revenue expenditure (p less than 0. 001), respectively, and a 10 % reduction in haematology tests (p less than 0. 05) per outpatient visit. These changes persisted {{in the six months}} after the feedback was stopped. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that feedback of laboratory data <b>to</b> clinicians <b>modifies</b> <b>their</b> request behaviour and that supplying clinicians with information on what they do can influence the way they make decisions...|$|R
