5|$|In December 2007, DoD {{officials}} {{met with}} the White House Military Office to discuss the program's future; <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> apparently wanted to terminate the VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems. The White House overruled a decision to cancel; the program was effectively placed on hold while options were considered. In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010. The {{second phase of the}} development, VH-71B (Increment 2) was expected to start entering service in 2017.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December 1989, just 13 {{months after}} <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> {{disclosed}} {{the existence of}} the F-117A, it was used in combat for the first time. This was in Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama intended to dislodge and arrest General Manuel Noreiga.|$|E
25|$|On July 13, 2007, Henry Waxman and Tom Davis, {{the leading}} {{members of the}} House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{revealed}} that the Bush administration and <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> withheld key documents relating to Tillman's death and denied any new document release request from Congress citing executive privilege.|$|E

All of them, except <b>the</b> <b>pentagon,</b> <b>have</b> bilateral (reflection) symmetry through two perpendicular lines. Some have additional symmetries. Specifically, the decagon has tenfold rotational symmetry (rotation by 36°); and <b>the</b> <b>pentagon</b> <b>has</b> fivefold rotational symmetry (rotation by 72°).|$|R

25|$|The 9/11 Commission in the US {{concluded}} in 2004 that {{those responsible for}} flying the planes into World Trade Center and <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> used PC-based flight simulators for training. Despite the initial concerns of the involvement of virtual airlines in these terrorist activities, largely little has come from these claims to date and no changes have been noted as occurring in their operation as a result.|$|E
25|$|Following Horton's article, the British {{organization}} Reprieve, {{which represents}} numerous Guantanamo detainees, called {{again for the}} US government under President Barack Obama to conduct a new investigation of the incident. In response, the DOJ spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said it disputed certain facts in the article related to the soldiers' account of DOJ involvement. The administration said that <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> thoroughly investigated the events.|$|E
25|$|A June 11, 2005, Washington Post article {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> awarded three contracts, potentially worth up to $300 million over five years, to three companies that it hoped would inject more creativity into its psychological operations {{efforts to improve}} foreign public opinion about the United States, particularly the military. Lincoln Group won {{one of the three}} contracts; Science Applications International Corporation and SYColeman, Inc., a subsidiary of L-3 Communications, won the other two. All three companies declined to comment for the article.|$|E
50|$|On 6 May 2016, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>have</b> said Abu Waheeb {{was killed}} {{along with three}} others in a vehicle by a US airstrike near Rutba.|$|R
50|$|There are 15 {{classes of}} pentagons that can monohedrally tile the plane. None of <b>the</b> <b>pentagons</b> <b>have</b> any {{symmetry}} in general, although some have special cases with mirror symmetry.|$|R
5000|$|However, since <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> not {{published}} <b>the</b> alleged footage, no independent analysis of it <b>has</b> been possible. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> analysts <b>have</b> not spoken to any news organization besides CBS News. Additionally, the definitive report, later {{released by the}} US Army, did not mention any satellite images (not even in the confidential parts, that were accidentally made available), raising questions in the Italian media about whether this footage existed at all ...|$|R
25|$|From January 1997 until being {{sworn in}} as the 21st Secretary of Defense in January 2001, Rumsfeld served as Chairman of Gilead Sciences, Inc. Gilead Sciences is the {{developer}} of Tamiflu (Oseltamivir), which {{is used in the}} treatment of bird flu. As a result, Rumsfeld's holdings in the company grew significantly when avian flu became a subject of popular anxiety during his later term as Secretary of Defense. Following standard practice, Rumsfeld recused himself from any decisions involving Gilead, and he directed the Pentagon's General Counsel to issue instructions outlining what he could and could not be involved in if there were an avian flu pandemic and <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> to respond.|$|E
25|$|These {{problems}} came in {{the midst}} of a transfer of power at AMC from Paul Tippet to a French executive, Pierre Semerena. The new management responded with tactical moves by selling the lawn care Wheel Horse Products Division and signing an agreement to build Jeeps in the People's Republic of China. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> problems with AM General, a significant defense contractor, being managed by a partially French-government-owned firm. The U.S. government would not allow a foreign government to own a significant portion of an important defense supplier. As a result, the profitable AM General Division was sold. Another milestone was the departure of Dick Teague: AMC's design vice president for 26 years, he was responsible for many Jeep and AMC designs including the Rambler American, Javelin, Hornet, Gremlin, Pacer, and Matador coupe.|$|E
500|$|The State Department {{appeared}} {{to not be}} well-informed about the action, as Ball cabled Lodge {{a few hours after}} the coup started: [...] "We have so little info on motivations and other factors involved in current crisis that we leave to your judgment how to handle. Meantime we trust you will make very clear that we {{had nothing to do with}} coup. If you consider it advisable and possible there would seem to us to be merit in preserving Minh as head of Government since he appears to have best potentialities for rallying support of people." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> opposed the removal of Diệm and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Khánh later reflected: [...] "Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> had an {{information}} sharing arrangement, the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (DIBCIA) program, {{in place with}} some private defense contractors since 2007 to which access was widened in 2012.|$|R
500|$|On 19 August 1941, Groves {{was summoned}} to {{a meeting with the}} head of the Construction Division, Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. In {{attendance}} were Captain Clarence Renshaw, one of Groves' assistants; Major Hugh J. Casey, the chief of the Construction Division's Design and Engineering Section; and George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects. Casey and Bergstrom had designed an enormous office complex to house the War Department's 40,000 staff together in one building, a five-story, five-sided structure, which would ultimately become the Pentagon. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> a total square footage of —twice that of the Empire State Building—making it the largest office building in the world. The estimated cost was $35 million ($ with inflation), and Somervell wanted [...] of floor space available by 1 March 1942. Bergstrom became the architect-engineer with Renshaw in charge of construction, reporting directly to Groves. At its peak the project employed 13,000 persons. By the end of April, the first occupants were moving in and [...] of space was ready by the end of May. [...] In the end, the project cost some $63 million ($ with inflation).|$|E
2500|$|On April 24, 2007, Lynch gave congressional {{testimony}} before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> erroneously portrayed her as a [...] "Rambo from the hills of West Virginia" [...] when, in fact, she never fired a shot after her truck was ambushed.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Army Times in August 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> {{already decided}} to buy first-generation 14- to 24-ton MRAPI {{vehicles}} with extra Frag Kit6-derived armor, not the 30-ton MRAPII vehicles, when placing its final MRAP orders {{at the end of}} summer, after a field commander's report. The paper also reported that, in addition, the Pentagon may buy some shorter, lighter MRAPs in their final batch. A senior Pentagon official told them that [...] "the roads are caving in" [...] under the weight of MRAPs and [...] "We want it to weigh less than it weighs now".|$|E

5000|$|Even {{prominent}} {{supporters of}} the war have accepted that it was illegal. Richard Perle, a hawkish member of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> stated that [...] "international law ... would have required us to leave Saddam Hussein alone." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Yet the General {{claims a}} {{reduction}} in violence. That’s because, according to the New York Times, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> adopted a bizarre formula for keeping tabs on violence. For example, deaths by car bombs don’t count." ...|$|R
2500|$|The CIA, {{with the}} backing of <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon,</b> <b>had</b> {{originally}} requested permission to produce sonic booms over Havana on 14 April to create an air of confusion. [...] The request was a form of psychological warfare that had proven successful in the overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954. [...] The point was to create confusion in Havana and have it be a distraction to Castro if they could [...] "break all the windows in town". The request was denied, however, since officials thought such would be too obvious a sign of involvement by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} naval stand-offs between Iranian speedboats and U.S. {{warships}} in the Strait of Hormuz occurred in December 2007 and January 2008. U.S. officials accused Iran of harassing and provoking their naval vessels, but Iranian officials denied the allegations. On 14 January 2008, U.S. Navy officials appeared {{to contradict the}} Pentagon version of the 16 January event, in which <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> reported that U.S. vessels had almost fired on approaching Iranian boats. The Navy's regional commander, Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, said the Iranians had [...] "neither anti-ship missiles nor torpedoes" [...] and he [...] "wouldn't characterize the posture of the US 5th Fleet as afraid of these small boats".|$|E
2500|$|The {{invasion}} showed {{problems with}} the U.S. government's [...] "information apparatus," [...] which Time described as still being in [...] "some disarray" [...] {{three weeks after the}} invasion. [...] For example, the U.S. State Department falsely claimed that a mass grave had been discovered that held 100 bodies of islanders who had been killed by Communist forces. Major General Norman Schwarzkopf, deputy commander of the invasion force, said that 160 Grenadian soldiers and 71 Cubans had been killed during the invasion; <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> given a much lower count of 59 Cuban and Grenadian deaths. Ronald H. Cole's report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff showed an even lower count.|$|E
25|$|Feb 18, 2007: According to Scott Ritter, who reiterated {{his view}} that Iran will be {{attacked}} by <b>the</b> US, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> negotiated basing rights in Romania and Bulgaria so that B-1 and B-2 bombers can operate out of airfields there.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> also {{proposed}} to provide to Lebanon {{a contract for}} 10 EMB-314s. Six Tucanos with 2,000 advanced precision-kill weapon systems are going to Lebanon in 2015 via the US LAS program, but financed by Saudi Arabia at [...] million.|$|R

2500|$|Amidst {{the general}} alarm, more {{sanguine}} voices were also raised. The Truman Administration had months earlier written off Czechoslovakia {{as little more}} than a Soviet satellite; in November 1947 U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall told a cabinet meeting that the Soviets would probably soon consolidate their hold on Eastern Europe by clamping down on Czechoslovakia as a [...] "purely defensive move", and Kennan cabled from Manila that the Soviets seemed to be consolidating their defences, not preparing for aggression. He later wrote that the Prague coup and the Berlin Blockade were [...] "defensive reactions" [...] to the Marshall Plan's initial successes and to the Western decision to press for an independent West German state. This view of the event sees Truman's reaction as him seizing on a necessary crisis to sell the Marshall Plan and the rearmament programme <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> long been pushing.|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{week later}} the Los Angeles Times quoted a high ranking {{intelligence}} official who claimed that U.S. special forces were in fact inserted in a European country allied with the United States through NATO, in order {{to carry out a}} snatch operation under strikingly similar circumstances to the Krekar case. The revelation led to suspicion that the plan was in fact not cancelled, as <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> stated. According to the Norwegian newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad, which was the original source of the CIA agents' mission in Oslo, the U.S. special forces, most likely Navy SEALs, had been monitoring a [...] "militant leader" [...] over a period of time, and were in place ready to carry out the snatch. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Pentagon kept the allied country's government in the dark about the mission, which apparently failed or was aborted.|$|E
2500|$|On December 21, 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union {{released}} {{copies of}} internal memoranda from the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{that it had}} obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. These discussed torture and abuse at prisons in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan, and Iraq. One memorandum dated May 22, 2004 was from an individual described as the [...] "On Scene Commander – Baghdad," [...] but whose name had been redacted. This individual referred explicitly to an Executive Order that sanctioned the use of extraordinary interrogation tactics by U.S. military personnel. The torture methods sanctioned included sleep deprivation, hooding prisoners, playing loud music, removing all detainees' clothing, forcing them to stand in so-called [...] "stress positions", {{and the use of}} dogs. The author also stated that <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>had</b> limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the chain of command. The author identifies [...] "physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching" [...] as being outside the Executive Order. This was the first internal evidence since the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse affair became public in April 2004 that forms of coercion of captives had been mandated {{by the president of the}} United States.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to strain}} of United States Armed Forces, the U.S. State Department and <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> <b>has</b> also {{outsourced}} <b>the</b> expanded military training in Africa to three companies: Military Professional Resources Inc.
