5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} his work, Kraft found it {{increasingly}} stressful, {{especially since he}} did not consider {{himself to be a}} strong theoretician. In 1956, he was diagnosed with an ulcer and started <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a change of career.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that common-sense mental states {{simply do not}} exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E

5|$|Cinematographer Robert Richardson was a {{week and}} a half into {{shooting}} City of Hope for John Sayles when he got word that Stone was <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> making JFK. By the time principal photography wrapped on City of Hope, Richardson was ready to make Stone's film. To prepare, Richardson read up on various JFK assassination books starting with On the Trail of the Assassins and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Mary Anning (21 May 1799– 9 March 1847) was an English fossil collector, dealer, and {{paleontologist}} {{who became}} known {{around the world}} for important finds she made in Jurassic marine fossil beds in the cliffs along the English Channel at Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset in Southwest England. Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.|$|E

5|$|That man's a great director. He {{can make}} people feel {{perfectly}} natural. He's got what Chaplin did when he directed A Woman of Paris—he and Lewis Milestone and Mal St. Clair all have that same touch, they all belong to the new school of directors, it seems to me.

5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Platoon (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to {{research}} and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in Crime and Punishment. The director had been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{this kind of a}} movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.|$|E
5|$|All six main {{cast members}} from the pilot {{returned}} for the series; James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale play Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley, a couple in a fledgling relationship; John Thomson and Fay Ripley play Pete and Jenny Gifford, a married couple whose first child is born in the first episode; Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris play David and Karen Marsden, an upper-middle-class couple who are considering having a second child. Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it, in contrast to Bathurst, who viewed it as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E
50|$|This {{being the}} case, {{a single person}} could be {{described}} as hearing by one person and Deaf by another because the first person was <b>thinking</b> simply <b>about</b> the subject's sensitivity to sound whereas the other person was <b>thinking,</b> partially <b>about</b> the persons ability to rely on residual hearing, but also about their personal views, their identity, or perhaps their ignorance of cultural norms.|$|R

5|$|At the April 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, a film {{adaptation}} was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, {{directed by}} Luke Boyce and produced by Shatterglass Films, an independent film {{company based in}} Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed Revival since its debut, and had been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> adapting it long before he met the creators. A two-minute proof of concept teaser was shown at the expo.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the design of the blog. He {{eventually}} chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the church and its personnel, derived not only from {{contemporary}} continental movements {{but also from the}} rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
