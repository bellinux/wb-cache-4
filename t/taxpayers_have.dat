25|$|<b>Taxpayers</b> <b>have</b> {{attempted}} {{to argue that}} the Cordner Doctrine (see above) should not apply where the coins remain in circulation, as the coins in the Cordner case (gold coins) had been withdrawn from circulation. This argument has been rejected. In the Stoecklin case, the court ruled that the taxpayer who receives coins (in this case, silver dollar coins) as compensation for services is taxed at the fair market value of the coins, not the lower face value, {{regardless of whether or not}} the coins have been withdrawn from circulation. Similarly, in the case of United States v. Kahre, the criminal defendants’ arguments – that where gold or silver coins are currently circulating, the taxpayer may report the coins as income at their face value and not at the higher fair market value – were rejected. The Kahre case also made news because although the defendants lost their argument that the receipt of circulating coins could be taxed at the lower face value, the defendants were not convicted of the criminal charges against them, with the main defendant drawing a hung jury.|$|E

2500|$|The Court then enunciated {{what is now}} {{understood}} by Congress and the Courts to be the definition of taxable income, [...] "instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the <b>taxpayers</b> <b>have</b> complete dominion."

2500|$|In some cases, <b>taxpayers</b> <b>have</b> {{argued that}} section 6702, the [...] "frivolous {{argument}}" [...] penalty statute, is itself unconstitutional. That argument was rejected in Hazewinkel v. United States (taxpayer's arguments—that sections 6702 and 6703 violate both procedural and substantive due process {{because there is}} no right to a prior hearing, and that the word [...] "frivolous" [...] is unconstitutionally vague—were rejected). See also Pillsbury v. Commissioner, a case in which taxpayer Leecil Pillsbury's argument—that section 6702 violates the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause of the Constitution—was ruled to be without merit.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Souter wrote a dissent and {{was joined}} by Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer. Souter wrote that the {{majority}} opinion [...] "declares that Flast does not apply , but a search of that opinion for a suggestion that these <b>taxpayers</b> <b>have</b> any less stake in the outcome than the taxpayers in Flast will come up empty: the plurality makes no such finding, nor could it. Instead, the controlling opinion closes the door on these taxpayers because the Executive Branch, and not the Legislative Branch, caused their injury. I see no basis for this distinction in either logic or precedent, and respectfully dissent." ...|$|E
50|$|To use the {{doctrine}} of cash equivalence, a <b>taxpayer</b> must <b>have</b> either actually received an item, or constructively received an item. If either of these situations exist, a taxpayer must determine whether the item received is cash equivalence, using the six factors described in Cowden v. Commissioner. If the item is deemed cash equivalent, then the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>has</b> income. If it is not cash equivalent, the <b>taxpayer</b> does not <b>have</b> income.|$|R

In the case of an electronically filed tax return, the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>has</b> to provide certain specific information—a social security number for example—to [...] "sign" [...] the jurat. Having done this, the electronically submitted return is considered to have the same legal effect as if the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>had</b> actually and physically signed the return.|$|R
2500|$|Effective {{tax rates}} are {{typically}} lower than marginal rates due to various deductions, {{with some people}} actually having a negative liability. The individual income tax rates in the following chart include capital gains taxes, which have different marginal rates than regular income. Only the first $118,500 of someone's income is subject to social insurance (Social Security) taxes in 2016. [...] The table below also does not reflect changes, effective with 2013 law, which increased the average tax paid by the top 1% to the highest levels since 1979, at an effective rate of 33%, while most other <b>taxpayers</b> <b>have</b> remained near the lowest levels since 1979.|$|E
2500|$|Souter {{disagreed}} with the majority's reading of Bowen, saying in that case [...] "we already had found the statute valid on its face before we turned to the taxpayers' as-applied challenge...so the case cannot be read to hold that <b>taxpayers</b> <b>have</b> standing only to claim that congressional action, but not its implementation, violates the Establishment Clause." [...] Therefore after Bowen, the majority opinion's [...] "distinction between a 'congressional mandate' {{on the one hand}} and 'executive discretion' on the other...is at once arbitrary and hard to manage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all complaints must be about the exercise of 'executive discretion,' so there is no line to be drawn between Bowen and the case before us today." ...|$|E

Although Southeast taxpayers paid Stephens, Jr. for legal work, although pertinent Southeast garbage contract negotiations ceased nearly a year ago, although Southeast taxpayers are bound today under contract terms negotiated by Stephens, Jr. and the Southeast Town Board with a major campaign contributor presently under Federal indictment for alleged racketeering, Stephens, Jr. asserts that <b>taxpayers</b> <b>have</b> no right to see his legal work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the court}} stated {{clearly that the}} {{decision}} {{is limited to the}} contraceptive mandate (Syllabus p.4-5), the ruling is seen to have consequences extending far beyond contraception. Walter Dellinger, former acting solicitor general said, [...] "for the first time, commercial enterprises could successfully claim religious exemptions from laws that govern everyone else." [...] Fifteen states had filed a brief arguing that businesses would be able to deny coverage for transfusions, stem cell treatments, and psychiatric care. In line with the dissenting opinion, The American Prospect asked, [...] "ill the <b>taxpayers</b> <b>have</b> to send a check to employees if employers feel that minimum wage laws violate their religious beliefs?" [...] Jonathan Rauch, {{a senior fellow at the}} Brookings Institution, said that objections to paying health benefits for same-sex spouses will get traction. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLT) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights withdrew their support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) passed by the Senate, saying that its religious exemptions would allow companies to fire or refuse to hire LGBT workers in light of the Hobby Lobby ruling.

50|$|For example, {{suppose a}} {{taxpayer}} in Year One has an {{adjusted gross income}} of $100,000. Two percent of the adjusted gross income is $2,000. To be able to deduct miscellaneous itemized deductions in calculating taxable income, the taxpayer's miscellaneous itemized deductions must exceed $2,000. If the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>has</b> miscellaneous itemized deductions of $5,000, the taxpayer may deduct $3,000 ($5,000-$2,000=$3,000). If the <b>taxpayer</b> <b>has</b> miscellaneous itemized deductions of only $1,000, the taxpayer {{will not be able}} to deduct anything because their deductions do not exceed the $2,000 (2%) floor.|$|R
5000|$|A {{taxpayer}} is insolvent {{when their}} total liabilities exceed the {{fair market value}} of assets. [...] For example, if a <b>taxpayer</b> <b>has</b> $100,000 in liabilities, but only $50,000 in assets, they are considered insolvent under the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, a cancellation of a $20,000 debt will {{not need to be}} reported as gross income. However, if a debt of $60,000 was cancelled, the <b>taxpayer</b> will <b>have</b> $10,000 in gross income because their total liabilities no longer exceed their total assets (cancelling $60,000 in debt means the <b>taxpayer</b> now <b>has</b> only $40,000 in liabilities).|$|R
