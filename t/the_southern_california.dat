5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>California</b> Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E
