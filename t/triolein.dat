50|$|There is a {{persistent}} mistaken belief that when genuine olive oil (or, in some versions, {{extra virgin olive}} oil specifically) is refrigerated, it will solidify or become much more viscous. This mistaken belief is {{based on the fact that}} olive oil is composed mainly of the monounsaturated fat oleic acid, and pure oleic acid (<b>triolein)</b> has a melting point of 5˚C, which is slightly above the high end of proper refrigerator temperature. Thus, if olive oil were pure <b>triolein,</b> it would solidify in a properly set refrigerator. However, olive oil is a complex mixture with significant variability in its fatty acid structure, and can be anywhere from 55% to 83% oleic acid, with the remainder a mixture of polyunsaturated fat and saturated fat, as well as containing waxes, phytosterols, and other compounds that affect its melting temperature. Thus, in practice, many olive oils have significantly lower melting temperatures. In fact, one might expect a refined seed oil with very high oleic acid content (such as high oleic sunflower oil) to be more likely to solidify in the refrigerator, based on their fatty acid composition and lack of minor compounds.|$|E

There are several processes used to introduce hydroxyl groups onto the carbon chain of the fatty acids, {{and most of}} these involve oxidation of the C-C double bond. Treatment of the vegetal oils with ozone cleaves the double bond, and esters or alcohols can be made, depending on the conditions used to process the ozonolysis product.

The 50. 3 -MHz 13 C NMR spectrum of vesicles preparations containing 90 % isotopically substituted [1 - 13 C]triolein showed two carbonyl resonances at chemical shift values that indicate hydrogen bonding of H 2 O molecules with the carbonyl groups.

In contrast to zebrafish embryos, eggs of medaka naturally contain oil droplets which are involved in embryo developmental processes [10],[11],[29],[30]. Mortality rates in vehicle controls tend to zero after the pure injection of <b>triolein</b> [20]–[28]. Our results concerning low mortalities post oil injection into the embryos of D. rerio are in accordance with the results for medaka.

To clarify whether the injected oil droplet is generally assimilated at a later point in development of zebrafish embryos, a prolongation of the experiment may be considered.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} lipase (LipA) {{produced by}} Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD 413 {{is required for}} growth of the organism on <b>triolein,</b> since mutant strains that lack an active lipase fail to grow with <b>triolein</b> as the sole carbon source. Surprisingly, extracellular lipase activity and expression of the structural lipase gene (lipA), the latter measured through lacZ as a transcriptional reporter, are extremely low in <b>triolein</b> cultures of LipA+ strains. The explanation for this interesting paradox lies in the effect of fatty acids on the expression of lipA. We found that long-chain fatty acids, especially, strongly repress the expression of lipA, thereby negatively influencing the production of lipase. We propose the involvement of a fatty acyl-responsive DNA-binding protein in regulation of expression of the A. calcoaceticus lipBA operon. The potential biological significance of the observed physiological competition between expression and repression of lipA in the <b>triolein</b> medium is discussed. Activity of the extracellular lipase is also negatively affected by proteolytic degradation, as shown in in vitro stability experiments and by Western blotting (immunoblotting) of concentrated supernatants of stationary-phase cultures. In fact, the relatively high levels of extracellular lipase produced in the early stationary phase in media which contain hexadecane are due only to enhanced stability of the extracellular enzyme under those conditions. The rapid extracellular degradation of LipA of A. calcoaceticus BD 413 by an endogenous protease is remarkable and suggests that proteolytic degradation of the enzyme is another important factor in regulating the level of active extracellular lipase...|$|E

The Vmax value obtained from the incubation of the lipase {{with a wide range of}} substrates, including tributyrin, trimyristin and <b>triolein,</b> are expressed as µmole acid/min/mg protein for cocoa lipase. Vmax values decreased with the increase in the triacylglycerol chain-length, with Vmax values of 27. 78, 13. 16 and 11. 63 µmole acid/min/mg protein when incubated with tributyrin, trimyristin and <b>triolein,</b> respectively. Inhibition of lipase occurred in the presence of diisopropyl flourophosphate, N-bromosuccinimide and 5, 5 -dithiobis-(- 2 -nitrobenzoic acid) ...|$|E

Some cases, especially with trauma, result in fat embolism syndrome (FES), a serious manifestation of fat embolism. FES {{is reported to}} occur in 5 - 10 % of major trauma cases and can produce profound respiratory problems that may culminate in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Embolized fat is hydrolyzed by lipase into free fatty acids which have been shown by previous histological studies to be toxic to the lung. An animal model of fat embolism has been developed utilizing <b>triolein</b> given intravenously (i. v.) to rats. We hypothesized that i. v. <b>triolein</b> will produce histological changes in the lung {{that are similar to}} the changes seen in human FES. Methods: Following University animal care approval, unanesthetized Sprague Dawley rats (study n= 13, control n= 12) were injected with either <b>triolein,</b> 0. 2 mL (study) or saline, 0. 2 mL (control). Weights were recorded until necropsy at 3 weeks (n= 13) and 6 weeks (n= 12). Morphometric measurements were made on both H&E and fat-stained tissues from the lungs, heart, kidneys and spleen. All vessels were examined using high magnification fields. Arterial wall thickness (lumen patency) was calculated by vessel luminal and external diameters. The medial-adventitial ratio was calculated from the outer medial diameter divided by the outer adventitial diameter. These values were keyed into statistical software and analysis as a function of time and treatment was calculated using t-tests with significance noted at a p< 0. 05. Results: Gross pathological changes were seen in lung, heart, kidneys, liver and spleen of the <b>triolein</b> group. Pulmonary histological examination revealed diffuse intra-alveolar hemorrhages and edema with peri-bronchial inflammation. Vasculitis was more prominent in the peri-bronchial areas as well. Pulmonary arteries revealed significant medial thickening as compared with the control groups with lumen patency p= 0. 004. Adventitia/media ratio, with large variability in the <b>triolein</b> group, was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Our data showed that injected <b>triolein</b> remains in the rat lung after 3 and 6 weeks with associated vascular and septal damage in the lung tissue compared to controls. Discussion: This study is a continuation of our previous study showing an increase of severe pulmonary damage within 3 - 6 hours following <b>triolein</b> induced fat embolism in the rat, reaching a peak at 96 hrs post injection. Despite unmedicated recovery of general condition and body weight and reopening of the pulmonary arteries and arterioles, collagen and vasculitis persisted up to 6 weeks. Further studies are needed to verify the eventual recovery or the organ evolution toward chronic fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{composite}} adsorbent {{containing a}} kind of lipid-triolein is studied. The adsorbent is prepared by embedding <b>triolein</b> into cellulose acetate (CA) sphere. The preparation method, the physical-chemical properties of the adsorbent and the removal efficiency of two organochlorinated pesticides are studied. The adsorbent is stable in water and no <b>triolein</b> leaks into water for 465 h soaking. The adsorbent has high adsorption capacity for organochlorinated pesticides such as dieldrin and aldrin. The results suggest that triolein-containing adsorbent {{could serve as a}} good adsorbent for lipophilic organic pollutants. The adsorption rate for lipophilic pollutants is very fast and has relation with the logK(ow) of the compounds...|$|E
