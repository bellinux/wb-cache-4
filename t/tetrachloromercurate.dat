40|$|Discoveries {{of novel}} {{functional}} materials have played very important roles {{to the development}} of science and technologies and among the diverse materials, metal-organic framework (MOF) are rapidly emerging as a unique type of porous and organic/inorganic hybrid materials which can be simply self-assembled from their corresponding inorganic metal ions/clusters with organic linkers and can be straightforwardly characterized by various analytical methods. In terms of porosity, they are superior to other well-known porous materials; exhibiting extremely high porosity with surface area upto 7000 m 2 /g tunable pore size and metrics through the interplay of both organic and inorganic components with the pore sizes ranging from 3 to 100 Å and lowest framework density down to 0. 13 g/cm 3. The crystals of the [HgCl 4]- [C 5 H 6 N 2 Cl]+, a MoF has been achieved by solution growth through slow cooling technique. The hybrid derivative exists in the P 21 /c symmetry and is stabilized by holding the inorganic component (<b>tetrachloromercurate)</b> with the organic moiety through hydrogen bonding interactions. Which predict that such materials have potential electro-optical properties...|$|E

The crystal structures of these hybrid materials {{have been studied}} by X-ray diffraction, experimental and computational methods. [HgCl 4] 2 - anions have a distorted tetrahedral geometry and the tetrahedra hybrid structure exhibit interwoven inorganic-organic layers mingled through N-H δ+ [...] . Cl δ- hydrogen bonding interactions. The mercurophilic interactions [Hg [...] . Hg = 3. 984 (5) Å] and halogen interactions [Cl [...] . Cl = 3. 406 (2) Å] form 2 D parallelogram pattern of secondary interactions in [HM- 1] whereas for [HM- 2] crystal structure is stabilized by Cl [...] . Cl = 3. 357 (2) Å interactions. UV-vis absorption spectra depict the change in optical band gap from 3. 01 eV to 3. 42 eV on replacing the metal halide group, {{could be due to}} increase in optical absorption as a function of wavelength. The Raman and Hyper-Raman tensors calculations were performed based on single crystal X-ray data and the Lagrangian strain tensor calculations show the degree of lattice distortion = 1. 794 between [HM- 1] and [HM- 2] which are useful tools for the optical response properties of inorganic-organic hybrid derivatives. The photoluminescence emission spectra peaks were observed in the wavelength range of 371 to 598 nm for material [HM- 1] and  in the wavelength range of 384 to 600 nm for material [HM- 2] and lie in the visible range for both materials. </p...|$|E
