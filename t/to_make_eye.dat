Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> contact with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft {{was struck by a}} second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} similar in {{thematic}} content to Mötley Crüe's video for the single [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". But in contrast, this video tells the story from Madonna's point of view. [...] She looks down into the cubicles <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> contact with the men but {{they are unable to}} return it. She also looks assertively into the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them. Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being. Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as 'baby' while shaking her body.|$|E

500|$|A {{few members}} of Cho's family, those who {{remained}} in South Korea, had concerns about his behavior during his early childhood. Cho's relatives {{thought that he was}} selectively mute or mentally ill. According to Cho's uncle, Cho [...] "didn't say much and did not mix with other children." [...] Cho's maternal great-aunt described Cho as [...] "cold" [...] and a cause of family concern from as young as eight years old. According to his great-aunt, who met him twice, Cho was extremely shy and [...] "just would not talk at all." [...] He was otherwise considered [...] "well-behaved," [...] readily obeying verbal commands and cues. The great-aunt said she knew something was wrong after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister but little news about Cho. During an ABC News Nightline interview on August 30, 2007, Cho's grandfather reported his concerns about Cho's behavior during childhood. According to Cho's grandfather, Cho never looked up to him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> contact, never called him grandfather, and never moved to embrace him.|$|E
500|$|A common {{feature of}} this form of {{diagnosis}} within attachment therapy {{is the use of}} extensive lists of [...] "symptoms" [...] which include many behaviours that are likely to be a consequence of neglect or abuse, but are not related to attachment, or not related to any clinical disorder at all. Such lists have been described as [...] "wildly inclusive". The APSAC Taskforce (2006) gives examples of such lists ranging across multiple domains from some elements within the DSM-IV criteria to entirely non-specific behavior such as developmental lags, destructive behaviors, refusal <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> contact, cruelty to animals and siblings, lack of cause and effect thinking, preoccupation with fire, blood and gore, poor peer relationships, stealing, lying, lack of a conscience, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, poor impulse control, abnormal speech patterns, fighting for control over everything, and hoarding or gorging on food. Some checklists suggest that among infants, [...] "prefers dad to mom" [...] or [...] "wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible" [...] are indicative of attachment problems. The APSAC Taskforce expresses concern that high rates of false positive diagnoses are virtually certain and that posting these types of lists on web sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders." ...|$|E

Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and has not yet done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him, [...] "Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game." [...] Prince commented, [...] "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up.

2500|$|In a seeming anachronism, the {{painting}} shows sheep being shorn with blade shears {{rather than the}} machine shears which started to enter Australian shearing sheds in the late 1880s. Art historian Terry Smith's suggestion that Roberts presented a deliberately historical vision of shearing has been questioned on account of there being no evidence that electric shears had been introduced to [...] "Brocklesby" [...] {{at the time of}} {{the painting}}'s composition. The young man carrying the fleece on the left of the painting alludes to the figure of Esau in Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise at the Florence Baptistery. The model for the smiling tar-boy at the centre of the picture, the only figure <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> contact with the viewer, was actually a girl, 9-year-old Susan Bourne, who lived until 1979. She also assisted Roberts by kicking up dust in the shed to allow him to capture some of the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|As {{revealed}} in the closing credits, the character of Malcolm was inspired by Nadia Tass' late brother, John Tassopoulos, who died after suffering an epileptic seizure after {{being hit by a}} car in 1983. As portrayed by Friels, Malcolm exhibits many traits that are characteristic of someone with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome, including a peculiar walk, reluctance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> contact, poor social skills and a deep-focus, obsessive interest (in this case, trams).|$|E

He adopted this presence in reaction to many guitarists whose body histrionics and facial expressions gave the impression that they were playing very difficult parts on their instruments.

50|$|Since {{the puppet}} stage is {{normally}} positioned {{higher than the}} seated audience (in order to best hide the puppeteers and allow for the puppet {{to be the focus}} of the audience), the puppet should be able to lean forward slightly with its head tilted sometimes down, in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> contact with the audience.
