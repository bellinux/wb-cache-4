5|$|Lee's {{plan for}} July 2 called for Longstreet {{to attack the}} Union's left flank, which would be {{followed}} up by Hill's attack on Cemetery Ridge near the center, while Ewell demonstrated on the Union right. Longstreet {{was not ready to}} attack as early as Lee envisioned. He received permission from Lee to wait for Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade (Hood's division) to reach the field before he advanced any of his other brigades; Law marched his men quickly, covering 28 miles in eleven hours, but did not arrive until noon. Three of Longstreet's brigades were still in march column, and some distance from the attack positions they would need to reach. All of Longstreet's divisions were forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> detour while approaching the enemy position, misled by inadequate reconnaissance that failed to identify a completely concealed route.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, {{the members}} of TalkingHeads {{returned}} to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, Fear of Music, and decided {{to take time off}} to pursue personal interests. Byrne worked with Eno, the record's producer, on an experimental collaboration named My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at the Sigma Sound Studios branch in New York City; the singer and the location were later used during the recording of Remain in Light on Harrison's advice. Husband and wife Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth discussed the possibility of leaving the band after the latter suggested that Byrne's level of control was excessive. Frantz was not open to the idea of ending TalkingHeads, and the two decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. During the trip, the couple became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies and practised with several types of native percussion instruments. While in Jamaica they socialised with the famous reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie.|$|E

50|$|The {{time for}} {{consolidation}} to occur can be predicted. Sometimes consolidation can take years.

25|$|Hurricane Jeanne {{was first}} {{identified}} by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on September7, 2004 as a tropical wave {{off the coast of}} Africa. This system tracked west-northwest at a relatively slow pace, eventually reaching the Leeward Islands on September13. By this point, the wave had developed into a tropical depression, the eleventh of the season. Continuing its west-northwest track, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Jeanne before crossing Puerto Rico and attained hurricane intensity before making another landfall over the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. After briefly weakening to a tropical depression off the coast of Haiti, Jeanne turned sharply northward and regained tropical storm status. Weak steering currents {{in the vicinity of the}} storm caused it <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> clockwise loop roughly 575mi (925km) east of the Bahamas. During this loop, Jeanne re-attained hurricane status although it fluctuated in intensity due to the upwelling of cooler waters. By September24, the storm maintained a steady westward track and reached Category3 strength on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E

[...] Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm. He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties. The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid. Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid. Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area. In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet [...] wide referred to as Eloise Inlet. Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models.
