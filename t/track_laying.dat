5|$|Delays in <b>track</b> <b>laying</b> and depot {{construction}} affected vehicle testing. By September 2009, {{construction was}} reported to be nine months behind schedule, and CAF was due to deliver the first trams from its factory in Spain. With key project dependency out of synchronisation, TIE held discussions with Transport for London about delivering the trams to Croydon to conduct operational tests on the Tramlink network. Tram vehicle testing commenced in March 2010 on the Siemens test track in Wildenrath, Germany. The tests included recreating the steep gradients of Leith Walk, and using weights to simulate the heavy passenger load expected during a Murrayfield match day.|$|E
5|$|With {{the funds}} {{available}} from the UERL, construction began in July 1902 at Knightsbridge, before the formal approval of the merger of the B and GN Work proceeded quickly, enabling the UERL to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the tunnels had been completed and that <b>track</b> <b>laying</b> was about to begin. Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Except for Finsbury Park, where the platforms were {{close enough to the}} surface to be accessed by stairs, and Gillespie Road where a long ramp was used, each of the stations with platforms in tube tunnels was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E

50|$|This {{led to a}} {{shutdown}} of the racetrack {{at the end of}} 1975. With the exception of a couple races during the Emo Fall Fair in the mid 70s, the <b>track</b> <b>lay</b> dormant from 1977 to 1982.|$|R
25|$|In 1903, <b>track</b> <b>laying</b> began between Haifa and Daraa. The biggest {{challenge}} was the construction east of Samakh (Samakh–Daraa). The length {{of this section}} was 73km and the height difference was 529 m. Eight tunnels were dug for the section, totalling a length of 1,100 m and 329 bridges and aqueducts. These difficulties raised {{the price of the}} Haifa extension by tens of percents. A meter on the Damascus–Daraa section had an average cost of 2,070 Turkish liras, while a meter on the Daraa–Haifa line cost 3,480 liras.|$|E
25|$|The {{coalition}} government has given funding {{approval for the}} extension of the Midland Metro from Birmingham Snow Hill Station, passing through the shopping district to Birmingham New Street Station. The £127 million state-of-the-art, electrically powered light rail system will also provide quick and easy access to Birmingham's business district and the Jewellery Quarter. <b>Track</b> <b>laying</b> was due to start in 2013 with a completion date of 2015 however following a number of delays the extension was finally opened on 30 May 2016. The extension is forecast to boost the regional economy by £50 million a year and create up to 1,300 sustainable new jobs.|$|E
25|$|Between October 3, 2005 and mid-December, Amtrak {{worked on}} the number 2 track from Paoli to a point between Narberth and Merion stations. On March 20, 2006, Amtrak started working on the number 3 track, {{starting}} within Paoli interlocking and working east towards Overbrook. As of April 6, 2006, a <b>track</b> <b>laying</b> system (TLS) has completed work to approximately milepost 16.7. 110-mph service started on October 30, 2006 following completion of a $145 million upgrade of the 104-mile line. Push-pull express trains will cut journey time from the current two hours to 90minutes. Local service will improve to 105minutes. Three weekday and two weekend roundtrips will be added as well.|$|E

25|$|Construction {{started in}} April 2012 for a , seven station {{extension}} from Bearing Station (E14) to Samut Prakan Station (E23). The extension {{is being built}} by Ch. Karnchang. Two stations (E18 & E22) will be built at a later date. The extension is funded by the MRTA as it is outside BMA city limits. Construction is contracted to take 1,350 days and the extension is planned to open in 2017. In April 2013, the MRTA awarded Ch Karnchang the contract for <b>track</b> <b>laying</b> and electrical systems. As of June 2014, civil works were stated to be 28.3 percent complete. Construction was completed by 2017, but arguments over who should operate the line delayed the opening. One station, Samrong was opened on 3 April 2017.|$|E
25|$|The <b>track</b> <b>laying</b> {{was divided}} up into various parts. In {{advance of the}} track layers, {{surveyors}} consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work {{had to be done}} manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting {{a design}} speed of , track layout was {{designed}} {{with a minimum}} curve radius of , track-centre distance of , right-of-way width of , and a maximum gradient of 2.5%, except for 3.5% at one location. All but [...] of track is ballastless, combining slab track of Japanese manufacture on open line sections with switches from a German supplier. <b>Track</b> <b>laying</b> began in July 2003. The line was electrified with the 25 kV/60 Hz AC system. The signalling and train control system was laid out for bi-directional operation according to European specifications. Each track section has a checkpoint, and an automatic control system ensures that trains are spaced at least [...] apart to prevent collisions.|$|E

500|$|Laying {{of tracks}} started in 1936, and was {{assisted}} by two steam locomotives. The work started at Myrdal and reached Reinunga the first year, Kjosfossen Tunnel {{the second year}} and the Blomheller Tunnel in 1939. The first train to operate on a regular schedule was in October 1939, when a freight train between Myrdal and Berekvam ran three times a week. However, this service was stopped {{by the end of}} the month. With the German occupation of Norway in 1940, work started later in the season, but the German authorities wanted to speed up the work to make the line usable for steam trains that same year. They scheduled the line for completion in 1942. <b>Track</b> <b>laying</b> work was accelerated by increasing the number of workers from 58 to 195. Regular freight operation on the Flåm Line started on 1 August 1940, albeit limited to an axle load of [...] At the time there were four trains each day, two in each direction.|$|E
