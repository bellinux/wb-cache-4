25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>program,</b> CMS (that was not always {{the name of the}} responsible bureaucracy) has contracted with private insurance companies to operate as intermediaries between the government and medical providers to administer Part A and Part B benefits.

25|$|Many {{experts have}} {{suggested}} that establishing mechanisms to coordinate care for the dual-eligibles could yield substantial savings in <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>program,</b> mostly by reducing hospitalizations. Such programs would connect patients with primary care, create an individualized health plan, assist enrollees in receiving social and human services as well as medical care, reconcile medications prescribed by different doctors to ensure they do not undermine one another, and oversee behavior to improve health. The general ethos of these proposals is to “treat the patient, not the condition,” and maintain health while avoiding costly treatments.|$|E
25|$|Medicaid is {{a program}} that is not solely funded at the federal level. States provide {{up to half of}} the funding for the Medicaid program. In some states, {{counties}} also contribute funds. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>program,</b> Medicaid is a means-tested, needs-based social welfare or social protection program rather than a social insurance program. Eligibility is determined largely by income. The main criterion for Medicaid eligibility is limited income and financial resources, a criterion which plays no role in determining Medicare coverage. Medicaid covers a wider range of health care services than Medicare.|$|E
2500|$|Ezra Klein {{has written}} in the Washington Post in late August that, in his opinion, polls now {{indicate}} that senior citizens are becoming fearful of healthcare reform, due to concerns that funding subsidies for the uninsured would require cuts to <b>the</b> popular <b>Medicare</b> <b>program.</b> He said that the specific changes [...] "don't involve anything of the kind (most of the savings would come from reducing overpayments to the private insurers that participate in <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> Advantage program)". He argued that, as a result, an odd but potent political alliance has emerged with Republicans arguing to protect <b>the</b> existing <b>Medicare</b> <b>program</b> despite its position historically which has been to oppose Medicare as an entitlement.|$|R

25|$|Peter R. Orszag, {{the then}} {{director}} of the CBO, argued in June 2008 that <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>program</b> as currently structured is unsustainable without significant reform, as tax revenues dedicated to the program are not sufficient to cover its rapidly increasing expenditures. According to the CBO, spending on Medicare will grow from $485 billion during 2009 to $879 billion by 2018. President Obama said at a White House news conference on July 22 that, without changes, the system is guaranteed “to basically break the federal budget”. He argued {{that it is necessary}} to cut wasteful spending which is known to exist (over-testing, no IT, lack of co-ordination, hospital re-admissions) in order to cut costs in order to protect Medicare in the future and cut the projected national deficit.|$|E

2500|$|Medicare Part D {{went into}} effect on January 1, 2006. Anyone with Part A or B is {{eligible}} for Part D, which covers mostly self-administered drugs. It {{was made possible by}} the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. To receive this benefit, a person with Medicare must enroll in a stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) or Medicare Advantage plan with integrated prescription drug coverage (MA-PD). These plans are approved and regulated by <b>the</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>program,</b> but are actually designed and administered by private health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers. Unlike Original Medicare (Part A and B), Part D coverage is not standardized (though it is highly regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). Plans choose which drugs they wish to cover (but must cover at least two drugs in 148 different categories and cover all or [...] "substantially all" [...] drugs in the following protected classes of drugs: anti-cancer; anti-psychotic; anti-convulsant, anti-depressants, immuno-suppressant, and HIV and AIDS drugs). The plans can also specify with CMS approval at what level (or tier) they wish to cover it, and are encouraged to use step therapy. Some drugs are excluded from coverage altogether and Part D plans that cover excluded drugs are not allowed to pass those costs on to Medicare, and plans are required to repay CMS if they are found to have billed Medicare in these cases.|$|E
