40|$|At the Fifth International Workshop on Railway Noise in 1995, two papers {{reported}} apparently conflicting results {{relating to}} the effects of <b>transverse</b> <b>profiles</b> on noise. Remington and Webb reported theoretical results showing that conforming profiles could lead to a reduction in noise generation. Dings and Dittrich reported experimental results which showed apparently inconsistent roughness-to-noise behaviour between wheels with different braking systems. They suggested that these results could be explained by an increase in noise for a given roughness level when the profiles are conforming. This paper describes a new analytical investigation of the effects of <b>transverse</b> <b>profiles</b> which aims to resolve this conflict. It is based on new very detailed roughness measurements. The data were analyzed first using a discrete point reacting spring model (DPRS). The <b>transverse</b> <b>profiles</b> of the wheel and rail were replaced with circular <b>transverse</b> <b>profiles</b> of different radii of curvature. It was found that the average roughness across the contact zone decreased as the width of this zone was increased, but that these reductions were only modest. The DPRS predictions showed little or no decrease in interaction force with increasingly conforming profiles. The TWINS model has been used to perform calculations which confirmed that, for the roughness data examined, little noise reduction benefit could be expected from a conforming wheel, and in some circumstances it could lead to an increase in noise. TWINS was also used to study the effects of the actual <b>transverse</b> <b>profiles</b> in an attempt to explain more fully the measured results. Some useful conclusions are drawn, but a full explanation of the measured results has not yet been obtained as all three types of braking system lead to some degree of conforming profiles...|$|R

40|$|Based on the Huygens-Fresnel {{diffraction}} integral and Fourier transform, propagation {{expression of}} a chirped Gaussian pulse passing through a hard-edged aperture is derived. Intensity distributions of the pulse with different frequency chirp in the near-field and far-field are analyzed in detail by numerical calculations. In the near-field, amplitudes of the intensity peaks generated by the modulation of the hard-edged aperture decrease with increasing the frequency chirp, which results in the improving of the beam uniformity. A physical explanation for the smoothing effect brought by increasing the frequency chirp is given. The smoothing effect is achieved {{not only in the}} pulse with Gaussian <b>transverse</b> <b>profile</b> but also in the pulse with Hermite-Gaussian <b>transverse</b> <b>profile</b> when the frequency chirp increases.

40|$|There is a {{significant}} body of evidence to at least, on a qualitative level, demonstrate a relationship between pavement rutting and structural capacity. Further investigation of this relationship {{could lead to a}} better characterisation of pavement rutting, and a more efficient method of estimating structural capacity, especially at the network level. The objective of the research program was to investigate the relationship between pavement structural capacity and <b>transverse</b> <b>profile</b> shape and where suitable develop structural capacity prediction models. Five broad flexible pavement types, pertinent to this research program were adopted, comprising one unbound and four differing bound flexible pavements.

Four non-isothermal situations in which thermocapillary effects {{play a significant role}} are considered. Similarity solutions describing a thermocapillary-driven flow with a dry patch that is widening or narrowing due to either gravitational or surface-tension effects on a non-uniformly heated or cooled substrate are obtained, and we present examples of these solutions when the substrate temperature gradient depends on the longitudinal coordinate according to a general power law. When gravitational effects are strong the solution contains a free parameter, and for each value of this parameter there is a unique solution representing both a narrowing pendent dry patch and a widening sessile dry patch, whose <b>transverse</b> <b>profile</b> has a monotonically increasing shape. When surface tension effects are strong the solution also contains a free parameter, and for each value of this parameter there is both a unique solution representing a narrowing dry patch, whose <b>transverse</b> <b>profile</b> has a monotonically increasing shape, and a one-parameter family of solutions representing a widening dry patch, whose <b>transverse</b> <b>profile</b> has a capillary ridge near the contact line and decays in an oscillatory manner far from it.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the emission properties that a large-scale helical magnetic field imprints on AGN jet synchrotron radiation. A cylindrically symmetric relativistic jet and large-scale helical magnetic field produce significant asymmetrical features in <b>transverse</b> <b>profiles</b> of fractional linear polarization, intensity, Faraday rotation, and spectral index. The asymmetrical features of these <b>transverse</b> <b>profiles</b> correlate {{with one another}} in ways specified by the handedness of the helical field, the jet viewing angle (theta_ob), and the bulk Lorentz factor of the flow (Gamma). Thus, these correlations may be used to determine the structure of the magnetic field in the jet.
