Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

Their findings proposed {{the replacement of the}} complex with an eighteen- to twenty-three-story residential tower and a smaller new corner glass church, designed by the architectural firm of Franke, Gottsegen & Cox. [...] The design featured a “prow-shaped base of stone,” with a sweeping 125-foot glass carillon tower providing “a luminous well of light.” The current social outreach and education facilities would be doubled and the modern design, the architects asserted, would create a sense of refuge and “communitarian communality.” The architects described the design: [...] "...the crisscrossing of the structure, like a canopy of trees, but you won’t {{be able to see the}} top, which we <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> expression of sacredness,” adding, “the sanctuary is very flexible and interfaith use is possible so that space can be shared with other denominations.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Gibbons and {{his wife}} Dawn {{purchased}} [...] {{of land in the}} ranch country near Lamoille, Nevada, approximately 20 miles South of Elko, Nevada. The land belonged to former Nevada Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead. The Elko County Assessor said he felt pressure from the governor, governor's lawyer {{and a member of the}} Nevada Tax Commission to lower the tax liability. Under state law, such an agricultural tax break goes only to legitimate farm and ranch operations, and must generate at least $5,000 a year in income. If such a land is developed by million-dollar homes, property taxes would go up. [...] "To say I was put in an awkward position I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> understatement", Joe Aguirre, a Republican, told The Associated Press in 2008. [...] The opinion page of the Las Vegas Review-Journal said on the allegations that the deal might constitute fraud. Aguirre later admitted that his previous statements were made up on the Las Vegas Sun saying that he wasn't pressured into Gibbons tax break by Gibbons himself. The land deal was called off after Gibbons finalized the divorce from his wife.|$|E

As the two men walked home, the friend threatened to reveal the lover's secret--his tonsure--which would be fatal to his hopes. They quarrelled, parted, and the ex-priest lassoed his friend.

60|$|Let us compare, then, our complex {{idea of an}} {{immaterial}} spirit {{with our}} complex idea of body, and see whether there be any more obscurity in one than in the other, and in which most.

These, I think, are our complex ideas of soul and body, as contradistinguished; and now let us examine which has most obscurity in it, and difficulty to be apprehended. I know that people whose thoughts are immersed in matter, and have so subjected their minds to their senses that they seldom reflect on anything beyond them, are apt to say, they cannot comprehend a THINKING thing which perhaps is true: but I affirm, when they consider it well, they can no more comprehend an EXTENDED thing.|$|E

60|$|These we arrange and {{rearrange}} {{in various}} ways upon our floor, making a world of them. In doing so we have found out all sorts of pleasant facts, and also many undesirable possibilities; and very probably our experience will help a reader here and there to the former and save him from the latter. For instance, our planks and boards, and what one can do with them, {{have been a great}} discovery. Lots of boys and girls seem to be quite without planks and boards at all, and there is no regular trade in them. The toyshops, we found, did not keep anything of the kind we wanted, and our boards, which we had to get made by a carpenter, are the basis of half the games we play. The planks and boards we have are of various sizes. We began with three of two yards by one; they were made with cross pieces like small doors; but these we found unnecessarily large, and we would not get them now after our present experience. The best thickness, we <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inch for the larger sizes and three-quarters and a half inch for the smaller; and the best sizes are a yard square, thirty inches square, two feet, and eighteen inches square--one or two of each, and a greater number of smaller ones, 18 x 9, 9 x 9, and 9 x 4-1/2. With the larger ones we make islands and archipelagos on our floor while the floor is a sea, or we make a large island or a couple on the Venice pattern, or we pile the smaller on the larger to make hills when the floor is a level plain, or they roof in railway stations or serve as bridges, in such manner as I will presently illustrate. And these boards of ours pass into our next most important possession, which is our box of bricks.|$|E
60|$|General Remarks.--Four of {{the five}} species, forming this genus, though {{certainly}} distinct, are closely allied. I have already shown, that although the characters separating Lepas, Pæcilasma, and Dichelaspis are not very important, yet if they be neglected these three natural little groups must be confounded together. Dichelaspis is much more closely united to Pæcilasma than to Lepas, and, {{as far as the}} more important characters of the animal's body are concerned, there is no important difference between them. Consequently, I at first united Pæcilasma and Dichelaspis, but the latter forms so natural a genus, and is so easily distinguished externally, that I have thought it a pity to sacrifice it. The carina, (which seems to afford better characters than the other valves in Dichelaspis,) from generally running up between the terga and in ending downwards, in three of the species, in a deeply notched disc or fork, more resembles that in Lepas than in Pæcilasma; in the manner, however, in which the imbedded disc, in D. Warwickii and D. Grayii, nearly cuts off the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle, there is a resemblance to Pæcilasma eburnea. In {{the extent to which the}} valves are separated from each other, in the bilobed form of the scuta, (the two segments in Dichelaspis, perhaps, answering to the upper and lateral projections in the scuta of Conchoderma virgata,) and in the basal half of the scuta not descending to the base of the capitulum, there is a considerable resemblance to Conchoderma; in both genera the adductor muscle is attached under the umbones of the scuta; but the structure of the mouth and cirri and caudal appendages shows that the affinity is not stronger to Conchoderma than to Lepas. It appears at first probable, that Dichelaspis would present a much closer affinity to Pæcilasma fissa, in which, owing to the scuta being formed of two segments, there are seven valves, than to any other species of that genus; but in P. fissa the primordial valve is triangular and is situated on the basal segment, whereas, in Dichelaspis, it is elliptic and is seated between the two segments, and is more in connection with the occludent than with the basal segment; and this I cannot but <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important difference: in other respects, P. fissa shows no more affinity to Dichelaspis than do the other species of the genus. Finally, I may add that Dichelaspis bears nearly the same relation to Pæcilasma, as Conchoderma does to Lepas.|$|E
