5|$|In 1927, Earle Page {{handed down}} the first budget in deficit for the {{coalition}} government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> <b>to</b> {{be replaced by a}} funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the Financial Agreement of 1927, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.|$|E
5|$|The National Road, {{the first}} road {{funded by the}} U.S. federal government, was {{authorized}} by the United States Congress in 1806, and ran from Cumberland, Maryland, to Vandalia, Illinois. Construction started in 1811, and by 1837 the road reached Vandalia. Many sites from the National Road remain along Alt US40, in particular the LaVale toll gate house, built in 1836. Following {{the completion of the}} National Road in 1837, the federal government ceded the road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> operate as a toll road, and toll gate houses such as the one in LaVale were built along its path in preparation for the transfer. Tolls continued to be collected along the National Road at the LaVale toll house until the late nineteenth century. The LaVale toll house is {{the first of its kind}} to be built along the National Road, and it is the last standing toll house along the National Road in Maryland. The LaVale toll house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.|$|E

25|$|The AFL's {{free agents}} came from several sources. Some were players {{who could not}} find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the Canadian Football League.

25|$|Generally, a state's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, extending seaward to a distance {{of no more than}} 200 nautical miles (370km) out from its coastal baseline. The exception to this rule occurs when {{exclusive economic zone}}s would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nautical miles (740km) apart. When an overlap occurs, it is up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> delineate the actual maritime boundary. Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.|$|E

I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E

25|$|During this period, Clark {{continued}} {{her interest in}} encouraging new talent. These efforts also supported the launch of Herb Alpert and his A record label. In 1968, she brought French composer/arranger Michel Colombier <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> work as her musical director and introduced him to Alpert. Colombier went on to co-write the film score for Purple Rain with Prince, composed the acclaimed pop symphony Wings {{and a number of}} soundtracks for American films.

25|$|During {{his first}} term in the Senate, Taft criticized what he {{believed}} was the inefficiency and waste of many New Deal programs and {{of the need to}} let private enterprise and businesses restore the nation's economy instead of relying upon government programs to end the Great Depression. He condemned the New Deal as socialist and attacked deficit spending, high farm subsidies, governmental bureaucracy, the National Labor Relations Board, and nationalized health insurance. However, he did not always follow conservative ideology; for instance, after investigating the lack of adequate housing in the nation, he supported public housing programs. He also supported federal aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> fund public schools.|$|E

He opposes ending the Defense of Marriage Act, but otherwise favors leaving the issue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> decide.
