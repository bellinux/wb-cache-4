40|$|Dynamic {{translation}} {{is a popular}} technique to build Instruction Set Simulators (ISS). The dynamic translation process must be fast or the translation overhead will outweigh the benefits of reusing code previously translated. In real hardware, decoding and execution are performed by separate units in parallel. With the arrival of multi-core x 86 desktops, {{it is now possible}} to do translation and execution of the <b>target</b> processor’s <b>instructions</b> in parallel so that Dynamic Binary translation can be much faster. This thesis reports on a Multi-processing approach used for an ARM ISS called SimIt-ARM v 3. 0 [10]. The simulator is used in exploring different techniques to improve the performance of parallel dynamic translation. Experiments show that Multi-processing provides significant improvement in simulation performance.

50|$|There is a 10-word {{instruction}} stack. All addresses in {{the stack}} are fetched, {{without waiting for}} the instruction field to be processed. Therefore the fetch of the <b>target</b> <b>instruction</b> of a conditional branch precedes evaluation of the branch condition. During the execution of a 10-word (up to 40 instruction) loop, all the needed instructions remain in the stack, so no instructions are fetched, leaving small core memory free for data transfers.|$|E
50|$|Processor {{modeling}} {{is provided}} by the VMI API. These API functions provide the ability to easily describe the behavior of the processor.

VMI can be used for modeling 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit architectures. There is an interception mechanism enabling emulation of calls to functions in the application runtime libraries (such as write, fstat etc.) without requiring modification of either the processor model or the simulated application.|$|E
50|$|To {{make sure}} we respect {{the three types of}} dependencies, we {{construct}} a dependency graph, which is a directed graph where each vertex is an instruction and there is an edge from I1 to I2 if I1 must come before I2 due to a dependency. If loop-carried dependencies are left out, the dependency graph is a directed acyclic graph. Then, any topological sort of this graph is a valid instruction schedule. The edges of the graph are usually labelled with the latency of the dependence. This is the number of clock cycles that needs to elapse before the pipeline can proceed with the <b>target</b> <b>instruction</b> without stalling.|$|E

40|$|Background: General practitioners' (GPs) {{ability to}} recognize, {{diagnose}} and treat depression improved significantly after a comprehensive, 20 -h training programme. This study aims to evaluate {{in more detail}} {{the effects of the}} training on GPs' pharmacotherapy of depression and related issues. Methods: A pretest-posttest design was used. Both in the pre- and post-training phase, a sample was drawn from consecutive patients of the 17 participating GPs. In the pre-training phase we identified a sample of 31 cases with an ICD- 10 depression who received an antidepressant from their GP. The sample was followed for I year. Outcome measures were: type of antidepressant, dosage, duration and number of <b>target</b> <b>instructions</b> given by the GP. Then we trained the GPs. In the post-training phase, we identified a new sample (n = 47) from their practices and measured the same outcomes. Results: Improvements were seen in choice for modern antidepressant, adequate dosage, adequate duration, and number of <b>target</b> <b>instructions</b> given. Limitations: Observed changes can be due to a period effect, inherent in a pre-post design. Conclusions: A post-academic hands-on training of GPs can improve depression pharmacotherapy according to clinical guidelines with respect to choice of a modern antidepressant, adequate duration and psychoeducation.

40|$|An {{important}} question is to what extent visual attention {{is driven by the}} semantics of individual objects, rather than by their visual appearance. This study investigates the hypothesis that timing is a crucial factor in the occurrence and strength of semantic influences on visual orienting. To assess the dynamics of such influences, the <b>target</b> <b>instruction</b> was presented either before or after visual stimulus onset, while eye movements were continuously recorded throughout the search. The results show a substantial but delayed bias in orienting towards semantically related objects compared to visually related objects when <b>target</b> <b>instruction</b> is presented before visual stimulus onset. However, this delay can be completely undone by presenting the visual information before the <b>target</b> <b>instruction</b> (Experiment 1). Moreover, the absence or presence of visual competition does not change the temporal dynamics of the semantic bias (Experiment 2). Visual orienting is thus driven by priority settings that dynamically shift between visual and semantic representations, with each of these types of bias operating largely independently. The findings bridge the divide between the visual attention and the psycholinguistic literature...|$|E

40|$|When visual stimuli remain {{present during}} search, people {{spend more time}} {{fixating}} objects that are semantically or visually related to the <b>target</b> <b>instruction</b> than fixating unrelated objects.

We removed the visual display prior to search while continuously measuring eye movements towards locations previously occupied by objects. The target absent trials contained objects that were either visually or semantically related to the <b>target</b> <b>instruction.</b> When the overall mean proportion of fixation time was considered, we found biases towards the location previously occupied by the target, but failed to find biases towards visually or semantically related objects. However, in two experiments, the pattern of biases towards the target over time provided a reliable predictor for biases towards the visually and semantically related objects. We therefore conclude that visual and semantic representations alone can guide eye movements in memory search, but that orienting biases are weak when the stimuli are no longer present...|$|E

40|$|Closing the {{achievement}} gap in reading for struggling students is a goal that most urban schools are striving to achieve {{in this era of}} No Child Left Behind. Early intervention remains the best approach for successfully supporting those who struggle in the primary grades, but <b>instruction</b> must be <b>targeted</b> or matched to the assessed needs of the students as opposed to using 2 ̆ 2 one size fits all 2 ̆ 2 packages. After years of having too many of their struggling readers continue to struggle, the urban school in this research study implemented a newly designed <b>targeted</b> <b>instruction</b> model. This study investigated and documented the implementation of this new model which was designed for second and third grade struggling readers with assessed needs in decoding and fluency. A professional learning community intervention team was established and worked collaboratively to assess and identify struggling readers, analyze data, use data to group students, set goals, develop instructional plans, provide daily <b>targeted</b> <b>instruction,</b> monitor progress, and make joint decisions in modifying and designing new instructional plans. During this study, the researcher documented ways in which both the students and PLC team members responded and progressed throughout the implementation process. ^ A mixed method case study approach was utilized for this research with both quantitative and qualitative data collected.

Qualitative analysis yielded three emerging categories: (1) Benefits of team meetings, (2) Challenges and concerns, and (3) Recommendations and suggestions. Within these categories were themes which highlighted the successes and challenges the team experienced in meeting the needs of struggling readers.
