5|$|Onion powder is a {{seasoning}} {{widely used}} when the fresh ingredient is not available. It {{is made from}} finely ground, dehydrated onions, mainly <b>the</b> <b>pungent</b> varieties of bulb onions, and has a strong odour. Being dehydrated, it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties: yellow, red, and white.|$|E
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. <b>The</b> <b>pungent</b> odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of <b>the</b> <b>pungent,</b> {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
30|$|The unique flavor {{properties}} of ginger {{arise from the}} combination of pungency and aromatic essential oil. <b>The</b> main <b>pungent</b> compounds in fresh ginger {{are a series of}} homologous phenolic ketones known as gingerols. The gingerols are thermally unstable and are converted under high temperature to shogaol (Mishra 2009). Shogaols, which are more pungent than gingerols, are <b>the</b> major <b>pungent</b> compounds in dried ginger (Jolad et al. 2004).|$|R

5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour {{about three days}} after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer <b>the</b> <b>pungent</b> odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly durian fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from <b>the</b> <b>pungent</b> varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee's {{breath was}} thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was {{considered}} responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known {{at the time as}} kelp began on Stronsay in 1722. The product– soda ash– was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. <b>The</b> <b>pungent</b> smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.|$|E

25|$|Some {{destructive}} tests may, however, be necessary; for example, {{the application}} of diluted hydrochloric acid will cause the carbonates odontolite and magnesite to effervesce and howlite to turn green, while a heated probe may give rise to <b>the</b> <b>pungent</b> smell so indicative of plastic. Differences in specific gravity, refractive index, light absorption (as evident in a material's absorption spectrum), and other physical and optical properties are also considered as means of separation.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its range, {{small rodents}} (mice, voles, and rats) are the wildcat's primary prey, {{followed}} by birds (especially ducks and other waterfowl, galliformes, pigeons and passerines), dormice, hares, nutria, and insectivores. Unlike the housecat, the wildcat can consume large fragments of bone without ill-effect. Although it kills insectivores, such as moles and shrews, it rarely eats {{them because of}} <b>the</b> <b>pungent</b> scent glands on their flanks. When living close to human habitations, the wildcat can be a serious poultry predator. In the wild, the wildcat consumes up to 600grams of food daily.|$|E
25|$|Another {{case where}} {{forensic}} entomology was used successfully {{deals with a}} body being reported to be thrown down a well. When authorities searched for the well in southern Indiana, it was clear they found the correct one. Thousands of flies where flying over material blocking the well. <b>The</b> <b>pungent</b> smell {{and the fact that}} the flies could not access the body created this swarm. Given that vast number of wells in the area, the presence of the flies indicated the body’s presence allowing it to be found in a timely manner. The use of entomology is not only important in determining when a person has died, but also simply locating a corpse.|$|E

25|$|There are {{conflicting}} accounts about Tulsi leaves {{being used}} in the worship of the god Shiva, a rival sect (Shaiva) god to the Vaishnava Vishnu. While Bael leaves are often offered to Shiva, some authors note that Tulsi may also be offered to him. Tulsi worship is sometimes regarded the worship of Shiva, conveying the deity's omnipresence. Shiva's aniconic symbol - the linga - is sometimes prescribed to have made from the black soil from the roots of the Tulsi plant. However, Tulsi is taboo in worship of the Devi - the Hindu Divine Mother as <b>the</b> <b>pungent</b> aroma of the Tulsi plant angers her. It is also important for the worship of Hanuman. In Orissa, the Tulsi plant represents all local deities and rituals to propitiate them are offered in front of the plant. The Nayars of Malabar offer Tulsi plants to pacify evil spirits.|$|E

500|$|Written as he {{approached}} the end of his brief career, The Fairy-Queen contains some of Purcell's finest theatre music, as musicologists have agreed for generations. In particular, Constant Lambert was a great admirer; from it he arranged a suite and in collaboration with Edward Dent arranged the work to form the then new Covent Garden opera company's first postwar production. It shows to excellent effect Purcell's complete mastery of <b>the</b> <b>pungent</b> English style of Baroque counterpoint, as well as displaying his absorption of Italian influences. Several arias such as [...] "The Plaint", [...] "Thrice happy lovers" [...] and [...] "Hark! the echoing air" [...] have entered the discographic repertory of many singers outside their original context.|$|E

2500|$|Hans Christian Ørsted's {{discovery}} of the magnetic effect of electric currents in 1820 was immediately recognised as an important advance, although he left further work on electromagnetism to others.
