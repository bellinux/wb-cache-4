5|$|However, controversies over {{domestic}} reforms, Poland's 1999 {{entry into}} NATO, and the accession process <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Union, combined with AWS fights with its political allies (the Freedom Union—Unia Wolności) and infighting within AWS itself, {{as well as}} corruption, eventually resulted {{in the loss of}} much public support. AWS leader Marian Krzaklewski lost the 2000 presidential election, and in the 2001 parliamentary elections AWS failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament. After this debacle, Krzaklewski was replaced by Janusz Śniadek (in 2002) but the union decided to distance itself from politics.|$|E
50|$|<b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>Europeans,</b> <b>the</b> OU and its later {{affiliated}} Rabbinical Council of America, were a notch down in erudition, {{and perhaps}} a bit lax in religious law.

While not entirely antagonistic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> OU, the Agudath Harabonim clearly had a diverging agenda.|$|R

5|$|Hungary {{recognised}} Croatian independence on 15 January 1992 (with {{the rest}} of the European Economic Community member states), and established diplomatic relations with Croatia three days later.

As of December 2011, Hungary and Croatia have 96 treaties and agreements in force regulating a wide range of activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues). Furthermore, Hungary supported the Croatian NATO membership request and Croatian accession <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} France joining the Commonwealth.

In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.|$|E
