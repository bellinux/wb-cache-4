5|$|My {{heart goes}} out to the {{families}} of those lost in the Challenger disaster. The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E

The story of Artemisia formed an iconography for Catherine and reinforced her right to serve as regent. The later female regents Marie de' Medici (1610–20) and Anne of Austria (1643–60) revived this iconography in their own service.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

He said <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been convicted on circumstantial evidence; <b>that</b> was why <b>you</b> <b>had</b> got life {{imprisonment}} instead of hanging; <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> always stoutly maintained your innocence; <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were the black sheep of the Maryland Dettmars; that they moved heaven and earth for your pardon; that your prison conduct was most exemplary; that he was prosecuting attorney at the time <b>you</b> were convicted; <b>that</b> after <b>you</b> <b>had</b> served seven years he yielded to your family's plea and pardoned you; and that in his own mind existed a doubt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> killed McSweeny." ...|$|R
25|$|By {{the captain}} of the port in which you have cast anchor I have been courteously requested, as a soldier, and, above all, as a gentleman, to hold a conference with you, adding <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> advised him that war has been {{declared}} between our respective nations, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come for the purpose of occupying these Spanish islands.|$|E

25|$|When {{manipulating}} linked lists in-place, {{care must}} be taken to not use values <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> invalidated in previous assignments. This makes algorithms for inserting or deleting linked list nodes somewhat subtle. This section gives pseudocode for adding or removing nodes from singly, doubly, and circularly linked lists in-place. Throughout we will use null to refer to an end-of-list marker or sentinel, which may be implemented in a number of ways.|$|E

25|$|This conduct {{upon his}} part seems {{perfectly}} unaccountable...You know that I have always counselled you to bear everything and remain to the last. I thought {{it for the}} best.

25|$|Nevertheless, Wagner and Minna parted, Wagner {{to travel}} to Venice and Minna to take the waters at Brestenberg {{in an attempt to}} improve her {{worsening}} heart condition. Minna wrote to Mathilde before departing for Dresden: I must tell you with a bleeding heart <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> succeeded in separating my husband from me after nearly twenty-two years of marriage. May this noble deed contribute to your peace of mind, to your happiness.|$|E
25|$|You {{have also}} broken your word to your {{followers}} {{who signed the}} petitions that got you {{on the ballot in}} many states. You pledged you would not campaign as a spoiler and would avoid the swing states. Your recent campaign rhetoric and campaign schedule make it clear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> broken this pledge... Please accept that I, and {{the overwhelming majority of the}} environmental movement in this country, genuinely believe that your strategy is flawed, dangerous and reckless.|$|E

25|$|Imagine {{for example}} using a {{stopwatch}} to mark-off tiny increments {{of time as}} a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car.

25|$|You will go {{yourself}} to the prelate and will present to him this copy <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made.

They should all strive to make reparation for the outrages my Son is subjected to in the sacrament of his love. See the graces that will be poured forth on those who will wear it with confidence and help you to spread this devotion.|$|E
25|$|Anyone {{wishing to}} live and work in Serbia will be {{required}} to apply for a temporary residence permit. To obtain a temporary visa for employment purposes, you will need to secure a job offer from a Serbian company or government department, or a foreign company based in Serbia. The criteria for approval of an employment visa include suitable educational qualifications or work experience, a secured employment contract in Serbia, proof of adequate means of subsistence in Serbia, police confirmation <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no criminal record, and a satisfactory medical examination. All official documents must be translated into Serbian.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no; {{you were}} better employed. You need {{not tell me}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a {{pleasant}} evening. I see it in your eye. I perfectly see how the hours passed: <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> always something agreeable to listen to. In the intervals of the concert it was conversation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he protested, [...] "but I did {{not know}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> any plans. All <b>that</b> <b>you</b> told us on your return from Blakely was <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> failed.

25|$|If, therefore, it {{is claimed}} that your race {{is doomed to}} {{economic}} inferiority, you may confidently look {{to the home of}} your ancestors and say, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent. You may say that you go to work with bright hopes, and that you will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.|$|E
25|$|The kiss on {{the lips}} can be {{performed}} between two friends or family. This move aims to express the affection <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> for a friend. Unlike kissing for love, a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The {{kiss on the}} lips is a practice {{that can be found}} in the time of Patriarchs (Bible). In Ancient Greece, the kiss on the mouth was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank. In the Middle Ages, the kiss of peace was recommended by the Catholic Church. The kiss on the lips was also common among knights. The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even if I were discovered, it {{need not}} be known <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{assisted}} me, risaldar. You may be sure that I should never tell.

6000|$|... "Will you listen, dear Louis? We {{knew that}} it was our duty to bring you home; and as you would not let me come to you, and serve you, and assist you to come here where you are safe,--unless I owned <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been right, I said <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he replied; [...] "but Ajor has gone.

25|$|The {{substance}} of your answer was: That many people exhort others to charity from self-interest; that men of fortune must mind their fortune; that you cannot go about {{to look for}} poor people; {{that when you have}} seen them your-self, and relieved them, they were scarce ever satisfied; that many make an ill use of what you give them; that you cannot trust the account people give of themselves by letters; that nevertheless you do give to private persons by the hands of Colonel Hudson and others; <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> also given to several hospitals an hundred pounds at a time, but that you must support your family; that the Lowther family has continued above four hundred years; that you are for great things -- for public charities and for saving the nation from ruin; and that others may think as they please, but this is your way of thinking, and has been for many years...|$|E
25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> qualified for the Main).|$|E

6000|$|... "Come in with me," [...] he said. [...] "Lord Cromer {{will see}} you. He {{acknowledged}} at once, when I told him your story, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a strong claim for employment. The only point was as to your age.

6000|$|... "Then I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better let me lend you the rest, for the present," [...] he suggested.
