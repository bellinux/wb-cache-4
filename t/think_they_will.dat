500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What {{are they going to}} do with all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|Kevin McHale deemed [...] "Wheels" [...] the [...] "most serious" [...] {{episode of}} Glee so far. He enjoyed Artie's {{character}} {{development in the}} episode, explaining {{that when he was}} cast in the role, he did not know Artie's background and thus made up his own backstory for him. He believed that Artie became paralysed later in life, rather than being born that way, which was proven correct in [...] "Wheels". Of the burgeoning romance between Artie and Tina, McHale opined: [...] "I think Tina and Artie will be together. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be a couple for a long time." [...] He explained that {{from the beginning of the}} show's production, creator Ryan Murphy expressed the belief that Artie and Tina should be together, and so he and Jenna Ushkowitz deliberately sat close to one another during filming, assuming that it would eventually happen. McHale was shocked by Artie's reaction to Tina's faked stutter, and was initially unsure [...] "why he was being so dramatic". He concluded however: [...] "I really think Artie fell for Tina because they were set apart by their disabilities. They're already kind of outcasts being in glee, but within that group they shared a connection. So he based their whole relationship on that and when it went away, Artie didn't know what to do." [...] McHale and Ushkowitz hope that their characters will ultimately become a couple, as they are best friends in real life.|$|E
2500|$|Sharp himself {{warned that}} many of the tactics the {{movement}} were employing were not effective. In an Al Jazeera interview, he said, [...] "The [...] protesters don’t have a clear objective, something they can actually achieve. If they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> change the economic system by simply staying in a particular location, then {{they are likely to be}} very disappointed. Protest alone accomplishes very little." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further {{frustrating}} fans, {{it seemed}} as though ABC had seemingly removed all references to McClain and Dixie from their official All My Children website earlier that month, which further outraged fans. To this, McClain responded, [...] "I really am only the actor. I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> ever bring me back, especially if they have removed the Dixie CHARACTER bio from the website," [...] McClain relayed. [...] "It's over. It's all done. AMC is going to become something totally different than it once was. It will be all new, all different. Why? I can only conjecture." [...] Thinking of her fellow actors, she later urged viewers not to give up on the show: [...] "Do not stop watching All My Children," [...] McClain stated. [...] "There are some good actors on that show, the producers are trying new and innovative things, and the writers are trying out lots of concepts and ideas that you may ultimately find very entertaining." ...|$|E

2500|$|King {{played a}} major {{diplomatic}} role as Minister to the Court of St. James from 1796 to 1803, and again from 1825 to 1826. Although he was a leading Federalist, Thomas Jefferson kept him in office until King asked to be relieved. Some prominent accomplishments that King had from his time as a national diplomat include a term of friendly relations with Britain and the United States (at least until it became hostile in 1805). With that in mind, {{he was able to}} successfully reach a compromise on the passing of the Jay Treaty being an avid supporter of it. King was outspoken against potential Irish immigration to the United States in wake of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In a September 13, 1798 letter to the Duke of Portland, King said of potential Irish refugees, [...] "I certainly do not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be a desirable acquisition to any Nation, but in none would they be likely to prove more mischievous than in mine, where from the sameness of language and similarity of Laws and Institutions they have greater opportunities of propagating their principles than in any other Country." [...] Also, while in Britain, he was in close personal contact with South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda and facilitated Miranda's trip to the United States in search of support for his failed 1806 expedition to Venezuela.|$|E
2500|$|Skinny Puppy {{released}} {{their fourth}} album, VIVIsectVI, in 1988; the albums {{name is a}} pun intended to associate vivisection with Satanism (i.e. the [...] "666 sect"). The group's primary aim with the album was to bring attention {{to the topic of}} vivisection and other issues regarding animal rights. The album's subject matter also deals with subjects such as chemical warfare, environmental waste, and disease. Lead track [...] "Dogshit" [...] was released as a single in 1988 under the name [...] "Censor"; the name change was made by the band when it was decided that the single would not sell well with its original name. The single [...] "Testure", which denounced the testing of animals for research purposes, reached No.19 on Billboards Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. According to Ogre, [...] "Testure" [...] was intended to be accessible in the hope of spreading their [...] "anti-vivisectionist" [...] message. [...] "It's the only song I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be able to play on the radio" [...] said Ogre, continuing [...] "I hope they do play it because it's {{the only way we can}} go beyond our ranks and our loyal fans who already understand the message". [...] "Testure" [...] also featured several well-chosen samples from the film The Plague Dogs, an animated adventure about two dogs who escape from a research laboratory. Melody Maker named VIVIsectVI one of the best albums of 1988, scoring thirteenth place in the magazine's year end list.|$|E
2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making {{a big deal out of}} ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.". Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that [...] "Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television".|$|E

2500|$|... "awoke early, {{found out}} Boat landed at St. Paul's {{discharging}} flour. I {{took a walk}} up the steep bluff and took {{a view of the}} town generally. The Upper or new town is laid out on a wild looking place situated on high bluffs which have a steep face to the River & Rocks projecting. The lower, or Old French town, is composed of about 10 or 15 houses, some of them bark roofs. In this part is found Half breed Indians & French and Canadian French. This part stands on a lower ground just above a ravine where Carver’s Cave is. Site of upper town is more broken and it stands on a succession of benches of sand. There is a great many of people here. Many of them have for a covering their wagons and tents. There is two large frame hotels going up and a great many small frame building scattered among the bushes, for the greater part of the ground where the new town stands is not yet grubbed out, full of hazel bushes and scrub oaks. They area asking as high as $500 for lots. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> {{have a great deal of}} work to do here before they will have things as they should be. There is a slough 100 yards wide between the town and the river, over which they build a causeway to get from the River to the town. Between the river and the slough there is barely room for three or four warehouses. Two are here erecting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like many in {{the mid-19th}} century, the Mormons {{believed}} that {{the second coming of}} Jesus was imminent, and would be attended by great destruction. After this destruction occurred, some structure would be necessary to politically organize the survivors. Joseph Smith said he received a revelation on April 7, 1842 calling for the establishment of an organization called the Living Constitution, or later the Council of Fifty. This would serve as the foundation for the establishment of Christ's Millennial government. However the actual organization of the Council of Fifty by Joseph Smith in Nauvoo, Illinois on March 11, 1844, was due to a present danger rather than a millennial belief. William Law was organizing a band of men to overthrow and murder Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum Smith. On March 26, 1844, it appears Joseph conferred the keys of ecclesiastical authority on the Twelve Apostles in a meeting of the Council of Fifty, telling them [...] "It may be that my enemies will kill me...should any of you be killed, you can lay your hands upon others and fill up your quorum. ...if you are called to lay down your lives, die like men." [...] The timing of the last meeting of the Law conspiracy appears to have been Sunday, March 31, as Joseph told two young men who were infiltrating the conspiracy, [...] "If you have to die, die like men... but I hardly <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> , as you are so young." [...] The similarity in the foreboding sentiment expressed to the apostles and to the young spies is striking.|$|E
