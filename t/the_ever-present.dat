5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney. The surviving ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and Grade II listed building because of their historical importance, {{but there is no}} active management. <b>The</b> <b>ever-present</b> threat from the encroaching sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven's course through the marshes, and lead to the loss of the ruins.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle finger}} gesture {{was used in}} Ancient times {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and {{threaten}} the individual receiving the gesture. It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles; from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> threat of the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{floors of}} the rooms on this level are made from lime-ash plaster pressed into a bedding of straw and oak laths, which would have offered some {{protection}} against <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> risk of fire. All the first-floor rooms in the east range and all except the Prayer Room in the west range are closed to the public, some having been converted into accommodation for the National Trust staff who live on site. The Education Room in the east range, above what is today the restaurant, was in the mid-16th century a solar, and is now reserved for use by school groups.|$|E

50|$|Clyde used 33 players {{during the}} 2007-08 season, and another 3 were unused substitutes. David Hutton was <b>the</b> only <b>ever-present,</b> {{starting}} all 45 competitive matches.|$|R
50|$|Vic Watson {{finished}} {{the season as}} top scorer with 27 goals in league and cup games. Billy Moore was <b>the</b> only <b>ever-present</b> player, finishing <b>the</b> season with 51 appearances.|$|R
5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E

25|$|Another {{reason is}} to reduce <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> risk of the debtor abusing the {{sequestration}} procedure and resorting to sequestration when it holds little or no real benefit for creditors and simply gives the debtor a means of escaping his liabilities.|$|E

25|$|For spectators, {{there is}} <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> {{danger of being}} {{attacked}} from behind by a confetti-throwing Waggis, especially if not wearing a Carnival badge (see below) known as a Blaggedde (which sounds similar to plaquette to French and English listeners). It is an unwritten law that masked and/or costumed participants {{are not subject to}} confetti attacks.|$|E
25|$|The Vishnu avatars {{appear in}} Hindu mythology {{whenever}} the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos {{out of its}} balance. The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> forces of good and evil.|$|E
25|$|Once {{selected}} for the show, a camera crew filmed each teenager at home to get footage of them acting naturally in their home surroundings. The eight teenagers were taught for a week how {{to survive in a}} wilderness with limited supplies. They were also constantly filmed during this time, to acclimate them to <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> cameras and filmmakers.|$|E

50|$|Fight for the Rock is {{the third}} {{full-length}} album by the American heavy metal band Savatage, released in 1986. It is their first album with new bass player Johnny Lee Middleton, who has since become <b>the</b> only <b>ever-present</b> member on each Savatage record released.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} of affairs for Parliament was perhaps {{at its worst}} in January. The Royalist successes of November and December, <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> dread of foreign intervention, and the burden of new taxation—which Parliament now felt compelled to impose—disheartened its supporters. Disorder broke out in London, and, while the more determined of the rebels {{began to think of}} calling in the military assistance of the Scots, the majority were for peace on any conditions.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{and hunters}} {{continue}} to work together for the best good of all concerned parties: the reindeer, the hunters, the general populace of Greenland, and the very sensitive and vulnerable range grounds, since Greenland's tundra is more sensitive than elsewhere in the Arctic due to <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> inland ice sheet. This ice sheet acts like an open refrigerator door, stunting the growth of vegetation along the coastal regions and making recovery a slow process.|$|E
25|$|The UC Davis Arboretum is an {{arboretum}} and botanical garden. Plants {{from all}} over the world grow in different sections of the park. There are notable oak and native plant collections and a small redwood grove. A small waterway spans the arboretum along the bed of the old North Fork of Putah Creek. Occasionally herons, kingfishers, and cormorants can be seen around the waterways, as well as <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> ducks. Tours of the arboretum led by volunteer naturalists are often held for grade-school children.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Northwich were {{founder members}} {{of yet another}} league, when the Alliance Premier League (later the Football Conference) was formed.

50|$|The Carnival of Viareggio was {{established}} in 1873, while <b>the</b> now <b>ever-present</b> papier mâché - used to build the floats featured during its parades - was first introduced in 1925.

25|$|On 25 August a French {{aid worker}} was kidnapped in Chad. The {{kidnapping}} of foreigners along the Chad/Darfur border became more frequent in 2009. A French NGO worker was taken and then murdered on 29 October 2009, and an unidentified Red Cross worker was captured on 10 November 2009. Many NGOs and charities {{have begun to}} restrict the areas covered by their aid work in Niger, Chad, and Sudan due to <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> risk of bandits and kidnappers. The organizations are thus pulling out in fear of their workers' lives.|$|E
25|$|The single {{candle in}} the left-front holder of the ornate six-branched {{chandelier}} is possibly the candle used in traditional Flemish marriage customs. Lit in full daylight, like the sanctuary lamp in a church, the candle may allude {{to the presence of}} the Holy Ghost or <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> eye of God. Alternatively, Margaret Koster posits that the painting is a memorial portrait, as the single lit candle on Giovanni's side contrasts with the burnt-out candle whose wax stub can just be seen on his wife's side, evoking a common literary metaphor: he lives on, she is dead.|$|E
25|$|Smart's unsentimental {{paintings}} encompass lonely urban vistas {{that seem}} both disturbing and threatening. Isolated individuals seem lost in industrial wastelands, full of high rise construction, concrete street-scapes and an eerie feeling of harmony and equilibrium – where silence and stillness create a deathly ambience. 'The express rape of the landscape' is one title hanging over Smart's paintings, {{referring to the}} freeways, street signs, trucks, oil drums, containers, buildings and concrete dividers that are <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> subjects of his work. At the same time his paintings – full of bold colours and perfect symmetry – are beautiful. The repetition of road signs in his works, for example, suggest an inconclusive direction and a world outside the frame is tantalising suggested.|$|E

25|$|White separatists {{called the}} League Of American Nationalists (LOAN) arrive in Charming. LOAN's leader Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's enforcer, A.J. Weston, seek {{to drive the}} Sons of Anarchy from Charming. To {{send a message to}} SAMCRO, Zobelle orchestrates to have Gemma kidnapped and gang raped by Weston and two others. Due to the {{improper}} handling of an internal problem, the rift between Clay and Jax continues to widen as Jax challenges most of Clay's decisions and comes to a head when a lone car bomb nearly kills another member of SAMCRO. The second season sees SAMCRO battling LOAN for control of Charming, Jax and Clay veering further apart in their individual visions for the club, and evading <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> threat of the ATF.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Greek War of Independence {{broke out}} in 1821, several Greek Cypriots left for Greece to join the Greek forces. In response, the Ottoman {{governor}} of Cyprus arrested and executed 486 prominent Greek Cypriots, including the Archbishop of Cyprus, Kyprianos, and four other bishops. In 1828, modern Greece's first president Ioannis Kapodistrias called for union of Cyprus with Greece, and numerous minor uprisings took place. Reaction to Ottoman misrule led to uprisings by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, although none were successful. After centuries of neglect by the Turks, the unrelenting poverty {{of most of the}} people, and <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> tax collectors fuelled Greek nationalism, and by the 20th century idea of enosis, or union, with newly independent Greece was firmly rooted among Greek Cypriots.|$|E
25|$|This kind {{of damage}} made life in Fort Jackson a misery when {{combined}} with constant flooding from high water within the fort. The crew could be safe from mortar fragments and falling debris only within the dank and partially flooded casemates. Lack of shelter, food, blankets, sleeping quarters, drinkable water, along with the depressing effects of days of heavy, unanswered shelling were hard to bear. When combined with sickness and <b>the</b> <b>ever-present</b> corrosive fear, conditions were definitely a drain on morale. These factors contributed to the mutiny of the Fort Jackson garrison on April 28. This mutiny began a subsequent collapse of resistance downriver from the city. Fort St. Phillips was also surrendered, the CSS Louisiana blown up and even the Confederate fleet on Lake Pontchartrain was destroyed to avoid capture. The general collapse of morale began with the mutiny and greatly simplified the occupation of New Orleans by the Union navy.|$|E
50|$|Goalkeeper Tom Baddeley was <b>the</b> only <b>ever-present</b> {{throughout}} <b>the</b> season, with left-back Dick Ray missing {{just one}} game. Billy Beats, George Samuel Eccles, Meshach Dean, and Alf Wood, favourites of previous campaigns, rarely missed a match. At {{the end of}} the season Wood left for Southampton, and Ray for Manchester City. With their places filled with reserves the next season looked bleak.|$|R
50|$|During the {{following}} season Bradshaw was <b>the</b> only <b>ever-present</b> and scored seventeen times, in a Liverpool team that struggled and were eventually relegated {{back down to}} Division 2. Liverpool again topped the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1895-96 season with Bradshaw scoring twelve goals from his new position on the left-wing, his versatility giving Liverpool an extra dimension to their attack.|$|R
