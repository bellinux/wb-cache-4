25|$|At {{this time}} I visited {{one of our}} Advent sisters, and in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> bowed around the family altar. It was not an {{exciting}} occasion, and there were but five of us present, all females. While praying, the power of God came upon me as I never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God's glory, {{and seemed to be}} rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City...|$|E
25|$|I {{knew that}} the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most {{appropriate}} moment for the outbreak of the intifada.... The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in the morning, for it was not possible that Sharon would reach al-Haram al-Sharif just so, and walk away peacefully. I finished and went to al-Aqsa in <b>the</b> <b>morning....</b> <b>We</b> tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time.... After Sharon left, I remained for two hours in the presence of other people, we discussed the manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the south}} window, the first panel of {{which shows the}} {{archangel}} Michael holding a trumpet, representing the call to battle, and, above his head, a seated woman with children at her knee, symbolising the sacrifices {{of women and children}} in the name of liberty, honour, and justice, while in the lower portion an armoured figure bears the Crown of Victory in his hands. The second panel contains the inscriptions: AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN <b>THE</b> <b>MORNING</b> <b>WE</b> WILL REMEMBER THEM, taken from the work of Laurence Binyon, and FREEDOM IS THE SURE POSSESSION OF THOSE ALONE WHO HAVE COURAGE TO DEFEND IT, from Pericles, as well as, in the lower portion, an armoured figure holding a flambeau, and, in the upper part, St. George slaying the dragon. The third panel contains Lady Justice bearing the Scales of Justice and the Great Sword of Judgement, the sword-guard of which shows a figure in a crucifixion pose—representing suffering for both the victors and the defeated—and below her the words JUSTITIA LIBERTAS PERPETUO (Justice Liberty in Perpetuity). Beneath Lady Justice in this panel is the heroic figure of Canada wearing armour and helmet and holding the laurel wreath of victory, but looking mournfully at the Book of Remembrance, and behind her are two other persons, one symbolising Canadian motherhood and the other First Nations. The fourth quadrant shows Joan of Arc bearing a shield and standing before the royal coat of arms of France.|$|E

500|$|Judi Dench as Evelyn Greenslade, a {{recently}} widowed housewife whose house must {{be sold to}} pay off her husband's debts. Like his father, her son wants to [...] "care" [...] for her, without her input. At Sonny's home for the [...] "elderly and beautiful", she keeps a blog of her activities. She narrates throughout the film, from bookend to bookend, from the opening sequence to the Day 51 moral [...] "We get up in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> do our best".|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast. Why are you so hard on me?" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to a survivor, Aharon Reuven Bernzweig, [...] "right {{after eight}} o'clock in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> heard screams. Arabs had begun {{breaking}} into Jewish homes. The screams pierced {{the heart of}} the heavens. We didn't know what to do…. They were going from door to door, slaughtering everyone who was inside. The screams and the moans were terrible. People were crying Help! Help! But what could we do?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Chancellorsville {{campaign}} (April 30 to May 6, 1863) {{created some}} emergencies {{in and around}} Richmond. With very few troops available to counter a raid on the capital by Union Major General George Stoneman's 10,000-strong cavalry force, the Confederate War Department called on the returned Arkansas Post prisoners, then being housed in Petersburg awaiting the release of their officers, to help defend the capitol. On May 1, 1863, [...] "at 3 o'clock in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> are ordered to fall-in, are marched to the armory and every able man was issued full equipage for the field….” [...] That evening, the Arkansas Post Prisoners were marched from [...] "Moddle Farm" [...] into the northern suburbs of Richmond and to man the fortifications of the city’s defensive works.|$|E
2500|$|Stage 6 on Friday 26 October 1934 {{was meant}} to be a [...] ride from Omeo to Sale, however as the riders had been unable to leave Mt Buffalo, at 10:15pm that night the organisers decided that the {{following}} stage would be from Mt Buffalo to Sale, a distance of [...] The revised stage included what the Argus described as the most arduous climb ever attempted in Australia [...] being the climbs of Mt St Bernard and Hotham Heights as well as the increased distance of the stage, covering [...] Stuart did not start the stage. The stage was marred by numerous falls and punctures, which started on the descent from Mt Buffalo. Opperman’s account of the stage included that [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> left the Chalet the instructions to the riders were changed four times in half an hour. At first we were to be controlled down the hill, then the field were to be allowed to use their own discretion, and race down, and these instructions were cancelled and altered until no one felt sure exactly what was the case." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{the attack}} succeeded, II Battalion, SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 26 {{would be cut}} off and destroyed, leaving {{a gap in the}} {{positions}} of the 12th SS-Panzer Division exposing Carpiquet, the rear of Caen and the confluence of the Odon and Orne rivers. The 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade issued orders in the morning of 10 June to the 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse). At [...] on 11 June, the attack toward Cheux was ordered to begin as soon as possible that day. The commander of the 1st Hussars had no time conduct a reconnaissance with the R Group (a reconnaissance group composed of attached arms, an artillery representative and the squadron leaders) and then complete an appreciation of the situation before issuing orders; the squadron commanders would have then issued detailed orders to the troop leaders. The 6th CAR tried to get ready, [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> were told we were moving at [...] Sunday 11 June. I knew one tank would he left behind, but was told later that only eighteen took part in the shoot. There was no briefing." [...] Some of the 1st Hussar troops {{thought it would be a}} quiet HE shoot with the artillery.|$|E
60|$|AT early dawn of <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> saw <b>the</b> Peaks of Tahiti. In clear weather {{they may}} be seen at the distance of ninety miles.|$|R
60|$|This was {{our last}} {{excursion}} at Looe. <b>The</b> next <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> were {{again on the}} road, walking inland {{on our way to}} the town of Liskeard.|$|R
60|$|Early <b>the</b> next <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> reached Nassau, <b>the</b> largest {{town in the}} Bahamas, {{on one of the}} {{smallest}} islands, and found it semi-tropical enough to suit even Mr. Chipperton.|$|R
2500|$|... "Toward evening a {{party of}} hangmen arrived. The {{officers}} went in and informed the condemned men {{they were to be}} executed between four and five in the morning. Their reply was to sing [...] "Hatikvah" [...] and other songs in powerful voices. They then shouted to us that the hangings would begin at four o'clock, in this order: Avshalom Haviv, Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss. They added: 'Avenge our blood! Avenge our blood!' We shouted back, 'Be strong! We are with you, and thousands of Jewish youth are with you in spirit.' They replied, 'Thanks,' and went on singing. At two a Sephardi rabbi whom we could not recognize from afar [...] was brought and stayed in the cell 15 minutes. At four in the morning Avshalom began singing [...] "Hatikva," [...] and we joined in loudly, pressing against the bars. At once armed police came up to the visitors' fence near our cell. At 4:03 Avshalom was hanged. At 4:25 we were shaken by the powerful singing of Meir. Hardly able to breathe, we nevertheless joined in. He was hanged at 4:28. At five o'clock the voice of Yaakov, this time alone, penetrated our cell, singing [...] "Hatikva." [...] Again we joined in. Two minutes later he was hanged.... At dawn we informed the prison officers through an Arab warder that we would not be responsible for the life of any Englishman who dared enter the jail yard. We declared a fast and prayed. Later in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> found the following inscription {{on the wall of the}} cell of the condemned: 'They will not frighten the Hebrew youth in the Homeland with their hangings. Thousands will follow in our footsteps.' Next to it was the Irgun insignia and their three names in the order they were executed." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{faith was}} justified, for on our re-assembling in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{found that all}} had slept well and peaceably.|$|E

60|$|All seemed ended, and I misdoubted that {{we would}} scarce charge again so briskly in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> nay, <b>we</b> might well have to guard our own gates.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> next <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{started for}} Fin-ma-Coul's Crossing. When I reached the shooting-box, where Guy was {{entertaining}} a select company of friends, Flora Billingsgate greeted {{me with a}} saucy smile.|$|R
