40|$|Background: This study applies <b>the</b> <b>POETICs</b> {{framework}} (population, organization, environment, technology, {{institutions and}} culture) {{to an analysis}} of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in Japanese cities. The inclusion of institutional variables in the form of International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives membership, ISO 14001 implementation, and non-profit sector activity addresses the ecological limitations of the often used IPAT (impact = population × affluence × technology) approach. Results: Results suggest the weak existence of an environmental Kuznets curve, in which the wealthiest cities are reducing their emissions through increased efficiency. Significant institutional impacts are also found to hold in the predicted directions. Specifically, panel and cross-sectional regressions indicate that membership in the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives and non-profit organizational presence have negative effects on industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Conclusion: The presence of institutional drivers at the city level provides empirical support for <b>the</b> <b>POETICs</b> rubric, which recasts the ecological framing of the IPAT identity in a more sociologica...|$|R
