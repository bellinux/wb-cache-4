5|$|From 1950 to 1952, {{there were}} a series of {{disputes}} between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding Scientific Associates. When {{it was founded in}} October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech, and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in <b>technology</b> <b>transfer</b> to the marketplace. Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech. However, Rosselot's participation in Scientific Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent <b>technology</b> <b>transfer</b> by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E

5|$|Glen P. Robinson and {{six other}} Georgia Tech {{researchers}} (including Robinson's former professor and future EES director Jim Boyd and EES director Gerald Rosselot) each contributed $100 to found Scientific Associates (later known as Scientific Atlanta) on October 31, 1951, with the initial goal of marketing antenna structures developed by the radar branch of the EES. Robinson worked as the general manager without pay for the first year; after the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson (upon request) refunded {{five of the six}} other initial investors. Despite its rocky start, the company managed to succeed. In 1951, there was a dispute over station finances and Rosselot's hand in the foundation of Scientific Atlanta against Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson. Initially, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Atlanta, but later handed off responsibility to Glen P. Robinson; at issue were potential conflicts of interest with his role at Georgia Tech and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in <b>technology</b> <b>transfer</b> to the marketplace. Rosselot eventually resigned his post at Georgia Tech, but his participation ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and made way for further <b>technology</b> <b>transfer</b> efforts by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOffsets {{policy in}} {{sovereign}} technologies has evolved {{with the changing}} needs of States in terms of production and technology. Today States not only want to acquire complex systems such as weapons, transportation systems or energy system, {{they also want to}} produce them domestically and to master related technology. In past years, in offsets literature, <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> were considered as subproducts of defence systems negotiated in contracts. Today, <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> {{can be seen as a}} complete and strategic product that States want to achieve technological leaps to become more independent regarding maintenance and retrofit processes in the whole life-cycle of systems. As a consequence, the industry is adapting both its organization and supply chain to respond to market trends, especially with the integration of training in <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> contracts. This paper aims at assessing risks associated with training issues in <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> in the case of sovereign technologies. What is at stake for both States and firms that are involved in <b>technology</b> <b>transfers?</b> What is the potential loss of knowledge in the practice of training activity in <b>technology</b> <b>transfers?</b> Regarding this loss of knowledge, what are the riskiest channels in the training process for firms? What kind of strategies can firms develop to cope with the loss of knowledge? How to manage training in technology transfers?Our qualitative method is based on interviews with trainers involved in <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> in a panel of strategic French firms (energy, defence, transport). We conducted around 40 interviews in order to catch the perception of trainers regarding the risks associated with their activity and built a typology of “risky situations” where information and knowledge were not well controlled by firms. Our results show that firms involved in <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> should focus more on ex post stages of <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> contracts in order to master knowledge or at least reduce leaks of knowledge. We finally suggest some recommendations to firms to improve the management of training in a context of <b>technology</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a <b>technology</b> <b>transfer</b> between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E
40|$|Research and {{development}} is largely done by multinationals (MNEs) that <b>transfer</b> <b>technology</b> to their foreign subsidiaries. Trust {{might be an}} important determinant of the governance of <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> because trust can reduce the dependence of the subsidiary on the headquarters. We empirically investigate how widely held perceptions of the trustworthiness of the host economy influence international <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> that subsidiaries receive from their business group or from other international providers. We use firm-level data on R&D imports from foreign subsidiaries operating in Spain for the period 2005 to 2012, and a Eurobarometer measure of trust between citizens of European countries. We find that subsidiaries that belong to MNEs from countries with higher trust in Spaniards have fewer <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> within the business group and more from international market channels than subsidiaries from countries with lower trust in Spaniards.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an oligopolistic {{model in}} which firms can choose between three different modes of entry to address three broad questions: (1) What {{is the role of}} trade costs and start-up costs in the entry decision if cross-border acquisitions involve no <b>technology</b> <b>transfers?</b> (2) How does the level of harmonization of technologies between the multinational and the acquired firm change the optimal mode of entry? (3) What is the role of market concentration on the entry decision given positive levels of <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> to the acquired firm? We show {{that in the case of}} cross-border acquisitions higher tariffs may act as an entry barrier by raising the reservation price of the acquisition target. Our analysis also underlines the importance of the usefulness of <b>transferred</b> <b>technology.</b> Acquisitions become more likely as the degree of harmonization between the multinational's and acquired firm's assets increases. Finally, we demonstrate that market concentration plays a non-trivial role in the entry decision when the <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> are not complete or as useful on the multinational. foreign direct investment, entry modes, <b>technology</b> <b>transfers,</b> tariff-jumping,...|$|R
40|$|International <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> {{are crucial}} for {{developing}} economies since they may operate {{as one of}} the key drivers in the economies’ development path. Previous studies have acknowleged some channels of <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> for developing economies. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of how the <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> would occur and take effect in each of the recipient economies and their domestic companies are still to be explored. Furthermore, understanding domestic companies knowledge management is important since it would determine the absorptive capacity of the company toward advanced foreign technologies. This study uses a case of technologically intermediate-level Indonesian manufacturer to show evidence of international <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> and their impacts on the development of indigenous technological capabilities of the domestic company, as well as to examine the company’s knowledge management. This study confirmed some benefits of international <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> for the domestic company, especially through the major mechanisms of technical license assistances, capital goods imports, turnkey projects, technical consultancies, backward-vertical flows of foreign direct investment, and participation in overseas markets. However, the impacts toward the domestic company’s technological capabilities were generally at intermediate level. This implies that the domestic company needs to spend more investments on in-house R&D activities and to improve its knowledge management systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to advance {{understanding}} of the issues associated with international <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> for addressing climate change, and to clarify and expand the international negotiating agendas at the intersections of climate change issues with trade and investment issues. Compared with the currently dominant paradigm that emphasizes North-South <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> and financial flows, the paper presents an alternative paradigm that includes developing countries as sources as well as recipients of international <b>technology</b> <b>transfers.</b> The new paradigm thus incorporates a more expansive global representation of the geography of technology flows. The paradigm also includes a focus on different international institutional frameworks for facilitating the flows and reducing the barriers to them, especially institutions and barriers involving trade and foreign direct investment. Further, the paradigm {{takes into account the}} important role of multinational firms as both facilitators and inhibitors of <b>technology</b> <b>transfers.</b> Empirically, the paper examines the flows and barriers that can inhibit them.

In this paper, we develop a simple model to show that financial constraints may have an impact on technological knowledge that is transferred from a global buyer to a local supplier. The model predicts that, when capital markets are perfect, high <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> are inferred while the supplier is more likely to operate as an independent firm. When the supplier has limited access to credit, <b>technology</b> <b>transfers</b> are reduced and vertical integration may be the preferred organizational form. Empirically, we test whether stronger credit constraints and lower financial development are associated with lower <b>technology</b> <b>transfers,</b> using firm-level data across 17 countries. ∗ We thank Thierry Verdier for helpful comments and suggestions.
