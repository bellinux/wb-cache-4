5|$|In {{order to}} deal with {{implication}} of the traditional understanding of the Quranic verse , some philosophers argued that <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> should be interpreted metaphorically (e.g. <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> could have referred to a partial lunar eclipse in which then earth obscured part of the moon).|$|E
5|$|Giridhar's {{grandfather}} {{asked him}} to recite <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> always, and from then on, Giridhar has followed the practice of reciting it every time he takes water or food.|$|E

He concludes the commentary of each passage with the morals of <b>the</b> <b>verses.</b>|$|R

50|$|In ceremonies of the Colombian Artillery, <b>the</b> last <b>verse</b> is {{used instead}} of <b>the</b> first <b>verse.</b> <b>The</b> Colombian Cavalry {{traditionally}} uses <b>the</b> sixth <b>verse,</b> while <b>the</b> 4th <b>verse</b> {{is used by the}} Colombian Navy.|$|R
5|$|The Kena is {{the oldest}} of <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> Upanisads {{followed}} by probably the Katha, Isa, Svetasvatara, and Mundaka. All these Upanisads were composed probably {{in the last few}} centuries BCE.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>verse</b> 4 {{references}} {{a fragment}} each from section 3.2 of Mundaka Upanishad, and section 2.8 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|Verse 2, {{where the}} author wishes {{material}} prosperity upon Gaius {{similar to the}} prosperity of his soul, is a commonly used proof text within prosperity gospel teachings; opponents of the prosperity gospel consider <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> to {{be little more than}} well-wishing.|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> of <b>the</b> song the quinto {{is capable}} of sublime creativity, while musically {{subordinate}} to the lead vocalist. There are natural pauses in the cadence of <b>the</b> <b>verses,</b> typically one or two measures in length, where the quinto can play succinct phrases in the “holes” left by the singer. During <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> <b>the</b> quinto does not demonstrate technical virtuosity so much as taste and restraint.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1953 <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> from <b>the</b> lullaby, sung in Yiddish (that where {{performed}} by Solomon Mikhoels) were removed. After Stalin's death <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> were returned.|$|R
5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of groups of Jews venerating Ezra to an extent greater than mainstream Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> merely speaks {{of a small group of}} Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E
5|$|Classical Muslim {{scholars}} who {{were aware of}} Jewish and Christian denials of belief in the sonship of Ezra, explained {{that it was only}} one Jew or a small group of Jews who worshipped Uzayr, or that <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> refers to the extreme admiration of Jews for their doctors of law.|$|E
5|$|It is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} fourth chorus. It starts with an instrumental introduction, and uses a chord progression of C–B–Am7–G, that is also used during the verses and the chorus. In the first verse, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton, and Beckham sing each one line. The chords change to Dm11–Dm9–Dm11–Dm9–Dm7–Em7–F major7–G during the pre-chorus, followed by the chorus. The same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, {{the first part of the}} second verse consists on the repeated use of the words do and ba da, then Bunton and Chisholm sing the rest of <b>the</b> <b>verse.</b> The group then sing the bridge, and end the song repeating the chorus twice. The song uses <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> melody of When You Were Mine (Prince song) with slightly altered phrasing.|$|E
50|$|The song {{is written}} in the key of D minor. <b>The</b> <b>verses</b> follow <b>the</b> chord {{progression}} of Dm-Gm-C-F-Bb-Gm-Eb-A. <b>The</b> <b>verses</b> use circle of fifths, alongside a Neapolitan chord (Eb).|$|R
50|$|Unusually, as {{originally}} published <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> are in 2/4 time, while the chorus is in 3/4 (waltz) time. The chorus {{is much better}} known than <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> to later generations.|$|R
50|$|The Ofudesaki {{addresses}} {{these themes}} in different ways. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> employ simple metaphors and allegories. Other times <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> are instructions originally intended for specific people in Miki Nakayama's day.|$|R
5|$|Publisher Kaspar Braun, who {{commissioned}} Busch's first illustrations, {{had established}} the first workshop in Germany to use wood engraving. This letterpress printing technique {{was developed by}} English graphic artist Thomas Bewick {{near the end of}} the 18th century and became the most widely used reproduction system for illustrations over the years. Busch insisted on first making the drawings, afterwards writing <b>the</b> <b>verse.</b> Surviving preparatory drawings show line notes, ideas, and movement and physiognomy studies.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{theme is}} {{repeated}} throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's {{position in the}} song; {{it is unclear whether}} the song has just begun, is in <b>the</b> <b>verse,</b> or is in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E

5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete <b>the</b> <b>verse.</b> If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E
50|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of A major with the chord progression of Asus2-F#m7(add4)-C#m7 in <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> and Asus2-A-Asus2-A-E-D in the chorus. The song uses guitar reverb and echo in <b>the</b> <b>verses.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are two {{version of}} the song, one scream version with James on vocal singing <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> which was {{released}} as the album version and one with cleaner vocals where Tuck sings <b>the</b> <b>verses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The canonarch also reads <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> of <b>the</b> prokeimenon {{and related}} texts. In some churches {{many of the}} duties of the canonarch are assumed by deacon, such as {{chanting}} <b>the</b> <b>verses</b> of Theos Kyrios.|$|R
5|$|Shakespeare's first plays {{were written}} in the {{conventional}} style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from {{the needs of the}} characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century the rhyme has been seen {{as one of the most}} popular and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been {{referenced}} in both literature and popular culture. It was used by T. S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The Waste Land (1922). The final line of <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> was probably the inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|E
5|$|That wasn't just a {{faith in}} {{herself and her}} talent, but also the ability to let herself go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know {{that no matter what}} they were doing, no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed a little more to gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from <b>the</b> <b>verse</b> to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E
