25|$|It {{was only}} when the FCC {{returned}} an hour to the networks on Sundays (for news or family programming), which had been taken away from them four years earlier, in a 1975 amendment to the Access Rule, that CBS finally found a viable permanent timeslot for 60 Minutes. When a family-oriented drama, Three for the Road, ended after a 12-week run in the fall, the newsmagazine took its place at 7:00p.m. Eastern Time (6:00 Central) on December 7. It has aired at that time since, for 42 years , making 60 Minutes not only the longest-running prime <b>time</b> <b>program</b> currently in production, but also the television program (excluding daily programs such as evening newscasts or morning news-talk shows) broadcasting for the longest length of time at a single time period each week in U.S. television history.|$|E
25|$|The series {{did well}} in the Nielsen ratings in its first season (2004–2005) and was {{subsequently}} renewed for a second season (2005–2006). In the second season, Miguel A.

The show was pulled from its Thursday-night timeslot in December 2005, and NBC returned the show in a new timeslot (Tuesdays at 8pm) on March 7, 2006. Due in part to being in competition with American Idol, Joey was the lowest-rated prime <b>time</b> <b>program</b> of the week for NBC. The network pulled the series after the first Tuesday broadcast and its cancellation was announced on May 15, 2006. The remaining episodes have never been broadcast by NBC, but have been shown on various other networks around the world. Episode 5 and Episode 13 of season 1 were directed by David Schwimmer, who played Ross Geller in Friends.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Objectives of the Study: On June 30, 1977, Oregon {{passed a}} law authorizing five hours per week of {{released}} time for religious instruction {{on the high school}} level. The {{purpose of this study was}} to seek answers to five general questions: (1) What was the level of awareness of released-time programs? (2) What level of interest existed for the establishment of extended <b>programs</b> of released <b>time</b> for religious instruction? (3) What might be the impact of extended released time on the public high school? (4) What might be the impact of establishing extended released- <b>time</b> <b>programs</b> on churches? (5) What impact might released-time programs have on church-school interaction? Research Procedures: Three groups selected from Polk and Marion counties were administered a questionnaire which was developed for this research. The three groups were: citizens, public high school teachers, and church leaders. Of the 1, 978 questionnaires distributed, 830 useable returns were received. This was a response rate of 43. 4 percent. Because of this low response rate, generalizations beyond the actual respondents should be made with extreme care. The one-way analysis of variance statistic (F test) was used to determine significant differences among the responses of the three groups to the questionnaire. * The Least Significant Difference (LSD) statistic was used to identify where these differences occurred. An analysis of variance according to selected demographic data was also conducted. The demographic areas were: sex, age, marital status, annual income, highest education level completed, personal enrollment in released <b>time</b> <b>programs,</b> enrollment of children in released <b>time</b> <b>programs,</b> religious preference, and extent of church activity. For teachers, an analysis was conducted based on size of faculty at the high school where they were teaching. Conclusions: All five of the null hypotheses were rejected at the. 05 level of significance. There were significant differences among the three groups for each of the five areas of this study. Specifically this study found: 1. Teachers are less in favor of released time than are citizens or church leaders. 2. Church leaders are more in favor of released time than are teachers or citizens. 3. There was a general lack of awareness of released <b>time</b> <b>programs.</b> 4. There was considerable interest expressed toward the implementation of released <b>time</b> <b>programs.</b> 5. Males were more favorable toward released <b>time</b> <b>programs</b> than were females. 6. Those with children currently enrolled in released <b>time</b> <b>programs</b> were more favorable toward these programs than those who did not have children currently enrolled in released <b>time</b> <b>programs.</b> 7. Latter-Day Saints were more favorable toward released <b>time</b> <b>programs</b> than were other religious groups. 8. Respondents who were very active in their churches were more favorable toward released <b>time</b> <b>programs</b> than were those who were moderately active, slightly active, or inactive. 9. There were no differences in the responses of teachers toward released <b>time</b> <b>programs</b> based on the size of the faculty where they taught. * The. 05 level was used as the level of significance...|$|R

2500|$|Paley was not fond {{of one of}} the network's biggest stars. Arthur Godfrey {{had been}} working locally in Washington, DC and New York City hosting morning shows. Paley did not {{consider}} him worthy of CBS, being a mere local host. [...] When Paley went into the Army and took up his assignment in London, and Frank Stanton assumed his duties, he decided to try Godfrey on the network. [...] By the time Paley returned, Godfrey was a rising star on the network with his daily Arthur Godfrey <b>Time</b> <b>program.</b> Paley had to accept the entertainer, but the two were never friends. Godfrey would, on occasion, mock Paley and other CBS executives by name, on the air. [...] Godfrey's massive revenues from advertising on the popular morning programs and his two prime-time shows Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts and Arthur Godfrey and his Friends, protected him from any reprisals. [...] In private, Paley and his colleagues despised Godfrey.|$|E
