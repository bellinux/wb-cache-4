5|$|Because of the Pandavas' ruined {{financial}} state, Balarama's wife, Revati, {{refuses to}} honour {{her commitment to}} marry Sasirekha and Abhimanyu and expresses her support for the alliance with the Kauravas. Krishna, who is aware of Duryodhana and Shakuni's real intentions, orders his charioteer Daaruka to take Subhadra and Abhimanyu through the forests to Ghatotkacha hermitage. Ghatotkacha, {{who happens to be}} Abhimanyu's brother, at first thinks they are intruders in his forest and attacks them but later apologises for the misunderstanding. When Subhadra explains the change in the marriage arrangements, Ghatotkacha decides to wage war against both the Kauravas and Balarama. At the urging of his mother, Hidimbi, and Subhadra, Ghatotkacha abandons his plans and is advised instead to <b>try</b> <b>some</b> trickery in Dvaraka. With the knowledge of Krishna and Sasirekha's servant, he carries the sleeping Sasirekha in her bed from Dvaraka, and flies to his hermitage. Assuming Sasirekha's form, he returns to Dvaraka and, {{with the help of his}} assistants Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, wreaks havoc on her wedding to Lakshmana Kumara, preventing the marriage from being carried out.|$|E

25|$|The band {{first tried}} to reunite in 1989, after many {{requests}} from Tony Gordon, the group's former manager and Boy George's manager at that time. George agreed to <b>try</b> <b>some</b> songs {{with the band}} again, resulting in recording sessions and producing {{more than a dozen}} songs that are still unreleased to this day. George, however, was more excited about his future projects like his record label, More Protein, and his new acid house project Jesus Loves You. The proposed reunion ended up being cancelled.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{his college}} years, {{probably}} {{during the spring}} of 1854 while Ludlow was still at Princeton, his medical curiosity drew him to visit his “friend Anderson the apothecary” regularly. During these visits, Ludlow “made upon myself the trial of the effects of every strange drug and chemical which the laboratory could produce.” A few months before, Bayard Taylor’s Putnam’s Magazine article The Vision of Hasheesh had been devoured by Ludlow, and so when the cannabis-based tetanus remedy called Tilden’s extract came out he had to <b>try</b> <b>some.</b>|$|E

25|$|Christopher Eccleston {{discussed}} {{plans for}} the anniversary episode with Moffat, but eventually declined to return as the Ninth Doctor. Sylvester McCoy, who played the Seventh Doctor, claimed {{that none of the}} surviving actors who portrayed the Doctor prior to Eccleston were contacted regarding the special. Colin Baker confirmed this while being interviewed on Australian television alongside McCoy and Paul McGann. However, McGann {{went on to say that}} he could still be in the 50th but at the last moment. Radio Times reported rumours that a Doctor from the classic era (pre-2005) would feature in the special, citing unknown sources. Freema Agyeman and John Barrowman, who played Tenth Doctor companions Martha Jones and Jack Harkness, respectively, both stated they would not be in the 50th, but may return to the show at some point. Barrowman stated that he would have liked to be in it, but speculated that the producers wanted to <b>try</b> <b>some</b> different things.|$|E
500|$|Pop Warner was {{hesitant}} to allow Thorpe, his best {{track and field}} athlete, {{to compete in a}} physical game such as football. Thorpe, however, convinced Warner to let him <b>try</b> <b>some</b> rushing plays in practice against the school team's defense; Warner assumed he would be tackled easily and give up the idea. Thorpe [...] "ran around past and through them not once, but twice". He then walked over to Warner and said [...] "Nobody is going to tackle Jim", while flipping him the ball.|$|E
500|$|Conan O'Brien {{conceived}} the idea {{when he saw}} a billboard that just had the word [...] "Monorail" [...] on it, with no other details or explanation. He first pitched this episode at a story retreat to Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who said the episode was a little crazy and thought he should <b>try</b> <b>some</b> other material first. O'Brien had previously pitched episodes where Lisa had a rival and where Marge gets a job at the power plant and Mr. Burns falls in love with her; both went well. James L. Brooks [...] "absolutely loved" [...] this episode when O'Brien presented it.|$|E

[...] before Harrison states that {{he opened his eyes}} [...] "and I saw you". According to Christian theologian Dale Allison, the lyrics are a [...] "reflection on some sort of {{conversion}} experience", in which Harrison provides [...] "before and after" [...] comparisons. Before his spiritual awakening, Harrison sings of variously possessing, seeing, feeling and knowing [...] "ot a thing" [...] until, Allison writes, [...] "he called upon God's love, which then came into him." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I am sorry to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going to <b>try</b> <b>some</b> physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] on Harrison's otherwise self-produced 1973 album has confused some critics and reviewers. Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden noted: [...] "This {{was considered an}} underhand trick in some quarters. However, since the single had clearly not received the attention it merited, {{it could be argued}} that George was simply husbanding his resources carefully." [...] On release, in an otherwise highly favourable review for Material World, Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone called the song [...] "an overblown attempt to restate the [...] spiritual message in material terms: 'Won't you <b>try</b> <b>some</b> / Baby won't you buy some.'" [...] In Melody Maker, Michael Watts wrote that the song fitted the album-wide description of Harrison's personal journey to [...] "musical iconographer" [...] status from his Beatle past. Watts considered the arrangement the [...] "most imaginative" [...] on Material World and described the recording as [...] "a fairground sound, using harpsichord and couched in waltz-time".|$|E

500|$|Lou Lombardo, having {{previously}} worked with Peckinpah on Noon Wine, was personally {{hired by the}} director to edit The Wild Bunch. Peckinpah had wanted an editor who would be loyal to him. Lombardo's youth was also a plus, as he was not bound by traditional conventions. One of Lombardo's first contributions was to show Peckinpah an episode of the TV series Felony Squad he edited in 1967. The episode, entitled [...] "My Mommy Got Lost", included a slow motion sequence where Joe Don Baker is shot by the police. The scene mixed slow motion with normal speed, having been filmed at 24 frames per second but triple printed optically at 72 frames per second. [...] Peckinpah was reportedly thrilled and told Lombardo: [...] "Let's <b>try</b> <b>some</b> of that when we get down to Mexico!" [...] The director would film the major shootouts with six cameras, operating at various film rates, including 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second, 90 frames per second, and 120 frames per second. When the scenes were eventually cut together, the action would shift from slow to fast to slower still, giving time an elastic quality never before seen in motion pictures up to that time.|$|E
500|$|Enema of the State {{is mainly}} {{considered}} a pop punk album and is even considered a skate punk album. According to Mike Damante of the Daily Cougar, the album [...] "embraces the pop side of pop-punk". The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding [...] "adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over {{the care and}} feeding of girls." [...] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times called Enema of the State a sampling of [...] "ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection." [...] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences. Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—"more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it." [...] The band decided to emphasize arrangements, harmonies and melodic ideas rather than the fast-paced nature of Dude Ranch; the change was {{brought about by the}} band, rather than the label. Barker hoped to give the songs varying tempos, something missing in the group's prior recordings. [...] "I told Mark and Tom, 'It's going to be repetitive if all our songs have the same punk-rock beat all the time. Why don't we <b>try</b> <b>some</b> different tempos?'" [...] DeLonge noted he was open to his proposals, and responded, [...] "Dude, I just play guitar and write melodies. You own the beats. If you have an idea, that's what you're supposed to do." [...] DeLonge later reflected on his desire for a more [...] "pop" [...] sound: ...|$|E
