During the airborne attack on The Netherlands (Operation Market Garden, September 1944), the squadron dropped paratroops, <b>towed</b> <b>gliders,</b> and flew resupply missions. Several of its subordinate units also participated in the invasion of southern France in August 1944.

5000|$|The PZL-104 was {{designed}} for robust use in sports, civil aviation, with {{a strong emphasis on}} glider-towing and parachute training. The prototype of the initial Wilga Mark 1 variant was first flown on 24 April 1962 powered by an existing Polish [...] horizontally-opposed engine the PZL WN-6RB. The Wilga 1 prototype exposed a number of design faults, the most serious of which was excessive weight and a rear view restriction such that the crew could not easily see a <b>towed</b> <b>glider.</b> This resulted in an airframe review that thoroughly redesigned the aircraft, led by Bronisław Żurakowski and Andrzej Frydrychewicz.|$|E

40|$|Aircraft-based space-launch {{platforms}} allow {{operational flexibility}} and offer {{the potential for}} significant propellant savings for small-to-medium orbital payloads. The NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center’s <b>Towed</b> <b>Glider</b> Air-Launch System (TGALS) is a small-scale flight research project investigating the feasibility for a remotely-piloted, <b>towed,</b> <b>glider</b> system {{to act as a}} versatile air launch platform for nano-scale satellites. Removing the crew from the launch vehicle means that the system {{does not have to be}} human rated, and offers a potential for considerable cost savings. Utah State University is developing a small throttled launch-assist system for the TGALS platform. This 2 ̆ 2 stage zero 2 ̆ 2 design allows the TGALS platform to achieve the required flight path angle for the launch point, a condition that the TGALS cannot achieve without external propulsion. Throttling is required in order to achieve and sustain the proper launch attitude without structurally overloading the airframe. The hybrid rocket system employs gaseous-oxygen and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as propellants. This thesis summarizes the development and testing campaign, and presents results from the clean-sheet design through ground-based static fire testing. Development of the closed-loop throttle control system is presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} using an {{unmanned}} <b>towed</b> <b>glider</b> for high altitude scientific research {{had been previously}} proposed. This paper examines the feasibility of this concept by determining what impact the various characteristics of the tow line, glider and tow aircraft have on tow line drag. A description of the analysis and computer code used to generate the results is given. The parameters examined were glider altitude, tow aircraft glider separation distance, velocity, tow line drag coefficient and tow line material properties. The results from the analysis show that the tow line drag increases significantly with tow aircraft/glider separation. The drag increased from 940 N (211 lb) with a tow aircraft/glider separation of 3 km to 11, 970 N (2691 lb) with a tow aircraft/glider separation of 10 km. The results also show that by varying some of the initial assumptions significant reductions in tow line drag and weight can be obtained. The variables which had the greatest effect on reducing the tow line drag were the decrease in tow aircraft/glider separation distance, the increase in tow line strength and the decrease in glider Mach number...|$|E
