40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} a material but less understood {{component of the}} public audit marketplace, namely the provision of “audit-related” services to <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit clients. I use the benefit plan audit service setting to examine the company and benefit plan characteristics associated with auditor selection {{and the impact of}} audit-related services on <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit quality. I provide market evidence of distinct shifts {{in the use of the}} same audit firm for <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit and other audit-related services over time as well as characteristics of the choice of auditors. I then test whether having the same audit firm for both types of audit services is associated with <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit quality as measured by missed misstatements (revealed through future restatements). I find that companies that engage the same audit firm for their <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit and benefit plan audit are less likely to have subsequent restatements. I also test whether having the same audit firm for both types of audit services is associated with switching <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit firm. I find that companies that engage the same audit firm for their <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit and benefit plan audit are associated with a lower likelihood of switching their <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit firm. Overall, my results suggest that choosing the same auditor for both <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit and audit-related services is associated with a higher level of <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> audit quality consistent with knowledge spillover between <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> and benefit plan audits.

25|$|The {{compliance}} {{component of}} a Single Audit covers the study and understanding (planning stage) {{as well as the}} testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations.

Depending on the recipient, the Single Audit can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This is because there are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating.
