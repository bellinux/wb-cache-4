5|$|The {{seat was}} made more {{competitive}} in the 1997 boundary review by {{the formation of the}} North West Cambridgeshire seat, which incorporated the rural land outside Peterborough and several Conservative-inclined wards from the city. Since its formation, North West Cambridgeshire {{has been one of the}} safest Conservative seats in the country, whilst Peterborough was ranked 93rd in the Conservatives's one hundred most vulnerable seats (the ones which the other parties must take if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a change of government) and 73rd on Labour's target list; these factors led Mawhinney to stand in North West Cambridgeshire instead.|$|E

Seeking {{to understand what}} troubles her, Disney invites Travers to Disneyland, which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, {{and the addition of}} a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when Travers discovers that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} sale of {{the track}} bed was postponed following {{the prospect of a}} number of schemes to re-open the closed section of the line. But they were all unsuccessful, and {{it is for this reason}} that it took 15 years for the railway to become available to private buyers.

25|$|During the Lesser Lenten seasons (Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast and Dormition Fast) the Little Hours undergo changes {{similar to}} those during Great Lent, except the Lenten hymns are usually read instead of chanted, {{and there are no}} kathismata. In addition, on weekdays of the Lesser Fasts, an Inter-Hour (Greek: Mesorion) may be read {{immediately}} after each Hour (at least {{on the first day of}} the Fast). The Inter-Hours may also be read during Great Lent if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no reading from the Ladder of Divine Ascent at the Little Hours. The Inter-Hours follow the same general outline as the Little Hours, except they are shorter.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{resources}} management has, however, been criticized. CRM {{is conducted}} by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining {{the work to}} be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.|$|E

In 1982, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane said of Brady: [...] "this is the case if ever <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one when a man should stay in prison till he dies". The death, in November 2007, of John Straffen, who had spent 55 {{years in prison for}} murdering three children meant that Brady became the longest serving prisoner in England and Wales.|$|E

500|$|In a 1990 paper, [...] "Elephants Don't Play Chess," [...] {{robotics}} researcher Rodney Brooks took direct aim at {{the physical}} symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since [...] "the world is its own best model.

[...] In the 80s and 90s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model {{of the mind and}} argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis.|$|E
500|$|The Duchess of Marlborough was {{a capable}} {{business}} manager, unusual {{in a period}} when women were excluded from most things outside the management of their household. Her friend Arthur Maynwaring wrote that she was more capable of business than any man. Although she never came to like Blenheim Palace – describing it as [...] "that great heap of stones" [...] – she became more enthusiastic about its construction and wrote to the Duke of Somerset about the new waterworks: [...] "I {{believe it will be}} beautiful.

500|$|The {{method was}} {{developed}} by Willard Libby in the late 1940s and soon became a standard tool for archaeologists. Libby received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry {{for his work in}} 1960. The radiocarbon dating method is {{based on the fact that}} radiocarbon is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen. The resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis; animals then acquire [...] by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of [...] it contains begins to decrease as the [...] undergoes radioactive decay. Measuring the amount of [...] in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less [...] <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detected, and because the half-life of [...] (the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed) is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50,000 years ago, although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples.|$|E

In addition, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> two female and one male supernumeries. However, the male pensioners <b>were</b> <b>to</b> lose their Freeholder status. The ten pensions from the Ginge Petre endowment were subsequently supplemented by a further two from the Thorndon estate, drawn from a sum bequeathed for that purpose by Lady Emma Petre (1803–1861), the second wife of the 11th Baron. Another endowment, £50 from Miss Hannah Raynor (died 1806) was paid from Thorndon too.|$|R

500|$|The {{bombing was}} {{condemned}} by British Prime Minister John Major and his government, by the opposition, and by {{individual members of}} parliament (MPs) as a [...] "sickening", [...] "callous" [...] and [...] "barbaric" [...] terrorist attack. Early on, Major stated that, [...] "This explosion looks like {{the work of the}} IRA. It is the work of a few fanatics and... causes absolute revulsion in Ireland as it does here". Sinn Féin was criticised by Taoiseach John Bruton for being [...] "struck mute" [...] on the attack in the immediate aftermath. Bruton described the bombing as [...] "a {{slap in the face to}} people who've been trying, against perhaps their better instincts, to give Sinn Féin a chance to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire". [...] The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, stated he was [...] "deeply outraged by the bomb explosion" [...] and joined Bruton and Major in [...] "utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism". Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, stated that he was [...] "shocked and saddened" [...] by the bombing. He insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued [...] "it is sheer folly to return to the old agenda of excluding Sinn Féin and seeking to isolate republicans". On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it [...] "sincerely regretted" [...] causing injury to civilians. The IRA statement continued:The British Government has spent the last 22 months since August '94 trying to force the surrender of IRA weapons and the defeat of the republican struggle. We are still prepared to enhance the democratic peace process [...] but if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a lasting peace [...] then the British Government must put the democratic rights of all of the people of Ireland before its own party political self interest.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1987, {{one of his}} {{contributions}} to New Blackfriars sparked considerable controversy, when he seemingly attacked currents of Catholic theology which appeared to him to diverge from orthodox Catholicism and to [...] "imply that, from the very earliest times, the Catholic Church, claiming to have a mission from God to safeguard divinely revealed truth, has taught and insisted on the acceptance of falsehoods." [...] Dummett argued that [...] "the divergence which now obtains between what the Catholic Church purports to believe and what large or important sections of it in fact believe ought, in my view, to be tolerated no longer: not if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a rationale for belonging to that Church; not if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> any hope of reunion with {{the other half of}} Christendom; not if the Catholic Church is not to be a laughing-stock {{in the eyes of the}} world."
