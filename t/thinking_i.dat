Actor Josh Holloway was told that an emotional undercurrent of the episode concerned his failed relationship with Kate.

500|$|In 1954, a young filmmaker named Roger Corman {{received}} his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists' Highway Dragnet. Corman soon independently produced his first movie, Monster from the Ocean Floor, on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule. Among the six films {{he worked on}} in 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release, Apache Woman, and Day the World Ended, half of Arkoff and Nicholson's first twin-bill package. Corman {{would go on to}} direct over fifty feature films through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 movies to his credit. Often referred to as the [...] "King of the Bs", Corman has said that [...] "to my way of <b>thinking,</b> <b>I</b> never made a 'B' movie in my life", as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures. He prefers to describe his metier as [...] "low-budget exploitation films". In later years Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, would help launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Robert Towne, and Robert De Niro, among many others.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{finishing}} {{college in}} 1992, Welch and Rawlings moved to Nashville, Tennessee. [...] She recalled, [...] "I {{looked at my}} record collection and saw that all the music I loved {{had been made in}} Nashville—Bill Monroe, Dylan, the Stanley Brothers, Neil Young—so I moved there. Not ever <b>thinking</b> <b>I</b> was thirty years too late." [...] Rawlings soon followed. In Nashville, after singing [...] "Long Black Veil", the two first realized that their voices harmonized well and they started to perform as a duo. [...] They never considered using a working name, so the duo were simply billed as [...] "Gillian Welch". [...] A year after moving to Nashville, Welch found a manager, Denise Stiff, who already managed Alison Krauss. Both Welch and Stiff ignored frequent advice that Welch should stop playing with Rawlings and join a band. They eventually signed a recording contract with Almo Sounds. [...] Following a performance opening for Peter Rowan at the Station Inn, producer T-Bone Burnett expressed interest in recording an album. Burnett did not plan to disturb Welch's and Rawlings' preference for minimal instrumentation, and Welch agreed to take him on as a producer.|$|E
500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept <b>thinking</b> <b>I</b> must be really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E

500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was <b>thinking,</b> <b>I</b> hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

I’ve been a big fan of Janet since 'Con-tro-ol!'". Later, Dupri said that the closer he got to Jackson and Mariah's duet, the more he knew where it should be at, elaborating that he felt it was going to happen.

[...] If he is talented, he allows us to glimpse {{the truth of the}} work that is in itself a thing of genius and that is reflected in him. [...] He shouldn't dominate the music, but should dissolve into it." [...] Or, similarly: [...] "I am not a complete idiot, but whether from weakness or laziness have no talent for <b>thinking.</b> <b>I</b> know only how to reflect: I am a mirror [...] [...] [...] Logic does not exist for me. I float on the waves of art and life and never really know how to distinguish what belongs to the one or the other or what is common to both. Life unfolds for me like a theatre presenting a sequence of somewhat unreal sentiments; while the things of art are real to me and go straight to my heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Collective {{originally}} {{started out}} as an informal gathering of friends (many of them related to one another) who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment on East 36th Street in New York City to discuss philosophy. Barbara Branden said the group met [...] "because of a common interest in ideas". Greenspan recalled being drawn to Rand because of a shared belief in [...] "the importance of mathematics and intellectual rigor". The group met at Rand's apartment {{at least once a}} week, and would often discuss and debate into the early morning hours. About these discussions, Greenspan said, [...] "Talking to Ayn Rand was like starting a game of chess <b>thinking</b> <b>I</b> was good, and suddenly finding myself in checkmate." [...] Eventually, Rand also allowed them to begin reading the manuscript of Atlas Shrugged (1957) as she completed it. As the years went on, the Collective would proceed to play a larger, more formal role, promoting Rand's philosophy through the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI). Some Collective members gave lectures at the NBI in cities across the United States and wrote articles for its newsletters, The Objectivist Newsletter (1962–1965) and The Objectivist (1966–1971).|$|E
