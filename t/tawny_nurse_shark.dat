5|$|Compared to {{the nurse}} shark, the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> has a more placid {{disposition}} and will often allow divers to touch and play with it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> as Vulnerable worldwide, as it faces heavy fishing pressure and its low reproductive and dispersal rates limit {{the ability of}} over-exploited populations to recover. Furthermore, this shark's inshore habitat renders it susceptible to habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices (e.g. poisons and explosives, especially prevalent off Indonesia and the Philippines), and human harassment. Localized declines or extirpations of the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> have been documented off India and Thailand. Off Australia, this species has been assessed as of Least Concern, as there it is not targeted by fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Mating in the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is known}} to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non-viable egg capsules, {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E

5|$|Encounters with <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers {{are able to}} approach the sharks closely and even touch and play with them without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, and extremely powerful jaws. <b>Tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|R
500|$|Many <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> found off {{the coasts}} of Japan, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands lack a second dorsal fin. This {{physical}} abnormality has been speculated to result from pregnant females being exposed to water of unusually high salinity and/or temperature, possibly from human activity. In 1986, a [...] long adult male with both a missing dorsal fin and partial albinism (in the form of white body color with gray-brown eyes) was captured off Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. This anomalous individual is the largest albino shark known to date, having survived {{for a long time}} in the wild despite its lack of camouflage.|$|R
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific region. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa northward to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and India, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the Chagos Archipelago, the Seychelles, and the Maldives. In the western Pacific, it occurs from southern Japan and the coast of China to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to {{as far south as}} the northern coast of Australia. In the central Pacific, it has been reported from off New Caledonia, Samoa, Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Tahiti. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in the Pirabas Formation of northern Brazil, dating back to the Lower Miocene (2316 Ma). The presence of these fossils indicates that the range of the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> once extended to the tropical Atlantic Ocean, prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> has few natural predators; {{attacks on}} this {{species have been}} {{reported}} from bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran), while the related nurse shark {{has been known to}} fall prey to tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Known parasites of this species include five species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium, which infest the shark's spiral intestine.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is taken}} by {{commercial}} fisheries operating throughout its range, including off Pakistan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines; an exception is in Australian waters, {{where it is}} only taken in small numbers as bycatch. This shark is caught using demersal trawls, floating and fixed bottom gill nets, and on hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are used for shark fin soup, and the offal processed into fishmeal. In addition, the liver {{is a source of}} oil and vitamins, and the thick, tough skin is made into leather products. Off Queensland, Australia, the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> is valued by big-game anglers. When hooked, large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning. They are also capable of spitting a powerful jet of water into the faces of their captors, making grunting noises in between jets (making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise);whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking <b>nurse</b> <b>shark.</b> The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. <b>Tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|R
50|$|Grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks.</b> Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium is {{involved}} in a grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> breeding program in conjunction with Sea Life Manly Aquarium, aimed at conserving this endangered species, which is already extinct in Victoria. The Aquarium currently has one grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> and the program is looking at intra vitro fertilization (IVF) as a method of breeding.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are thought}} to take {{advantage}} of dormant fish which would otherwise be too fast for the sharks to catch; although their small mouths limit the size of prey items, the sharks' large throat cavities are used as a sort of bellows valve. In this way, <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are able to suck in their prey. <b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are also known to graze algae and coral.|$|R
5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{may be one}} of the few fishes {{specializing in}} preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting tawny nurse sharks swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{tends to}} spend the day resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos.|$|E
5|$|With a more {{streamlined}} form {{than other}} nurse sharks, the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is believed to}} be a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny nurse sharks are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active at all hours off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food. During the day, groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day.|$|E
50|$|The Ginglymostomatidae are a {{cosmopolitan}} family of carpet sharks, containing two monotypic genera of <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks.</b> Common in shallow, tropical and subtropical waters, these sharks are sluggish and docile bottom-dwellers. <b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> typically attack humans only if directly threatened.|$|R
50|$|The <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> has two rounded dorsal fins, rounded {{pectoral}} fins, {{an elongated}} caudal fin, {{and a broad}} head. Maximum adult length is currently documented as 3.08 m, whereas past reports of 4.5 m and corresponding weights of up to 330 kg {{are likely to have}} been exaggerated. Adult <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are brownish in color. Newly born <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> have a spotted coloration which fades with age and are about 30 cm in length when nascent.|$|R
50|$|The short-tail <b>nurse</b> <b>shark,</b> Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum, is a <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> in {{the family}} Ginglymostomatidae, {{the only member of}} the genus Pseudoginglymostoma.

25|$|Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific are {{dominated}} by whitetip, blacktip and grey reef shark. Coral reefs in the western Atlantic Ocean {{are dominated}} by the Caribbean reef shark. These sharks are all species of requiem shark, and all have the robust, streamlined bodies that are typical of the requiem shark. They are fast-swimming, agile predators that feed primarily on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Other species of reef sharks include the Galapagos shark, the <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> and hammerheads.|$|E

25|$|Tourism and {{recreational}} {{use of the}} Cape Byron Marine Park has impacted on the populations of Grey <b>Nurse</b> <b>Sharks</b> (Carcharias taurus). Grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> maintain the same nursery breeding grounds which are often disturbed by tourism activities such as divers and often the use of shark repellent. Shark netting protected swimmers on beaches has also been linked to mortality of grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks.</b> Increased boat traffic, pollution and fishing equipment are also {{a threat to the}} humpback whale on their migratory journey.|$|R

500|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by French naturalist René-Primevère Lesson as Scyllium ferrugineum, {{based on a}} [...] long specimen from New Guinea. His short account was published in 1831 in Voyage au tour du monde, sur la corvette La Coquille. A more detailed description, along with an illustration, was published by German naturalist Eduard Rüppell in 1837 as Nebrius concolor, based on a specimen from the Red Sea. Both names were retained, often in separate genera (Ginglymostoma and Nebrius respectively), until they were synonymized by Leonard Compagno in 1984. Compagno recognized that the tooth shape differences used to separate these species {{were the result of}} differences in age, with N. concolor representing younger individuals.|$|E

The eyes are small and face laterally, with prominent ridges over them and smaller spiracles behind. There are a pair of long, slender barbels {{in front of the}} nostrils. The mouth is small, with the lower lip divided into three lobes. There are 2933 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2628 tooth rows in the lower jaw, arranged in an imbricate (overlapping) pattern with the outermost 24 functional rows separated from the rest by a narrow space. Each tooth resembles a fan, with a broad base rising to a small, sharp central point flanked by 3 or more smaller cusps on both sides. As the shark ages, the teeth become relatively taller and thicker. The fourth and fifth pairs of gill slits are placed much closer together than the others.|$|E
