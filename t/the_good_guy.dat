5|$|Harry and Debbie punish Annie by not {{allowing}} {{her to go to}} Naomi's party. When they reconsider and decide to let her go, they discover that she has already left. Harry goes to the party to find Annie, but is instead told by Tracy that they have a son together, whom she gave up for adoption over twenty years ago. Adrianna, who had previously stolen money from Naomi's purse, claims to have found it and gives it back. Naomi checks her phone messages and learns that Ethan is cheating on her. Naomi asks Ethan if he is really cheating on her, and leaves the party after he fails to answer. Annie leaves with Silver for another party on the beach, where she apologizes to Ethan for revealing that he was cheating on Naomi. When she asks why he told the truth about Dixon not starting the fight, he replies that he is trying to be <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> he used to be. Annie, Silver, Dixon and Navid {{spend the rest of the}} night swimming at the beach. In the closing scenes, Kelly talks to the father of her four-year-old son, Adrianna pays her drug dealer with money she stole from Naomi, and Ethan visits Naomi's house.|$|E

500|$|Favorable {{reviews of}} Eragon often {{focused on the}} book's {{characters}} and plot.

[...] Chris Lawrence of About.com thought the book had all the [...] "traditional ingredients" [...] that make a fantasy novel [...] "enjoyable". The book was a [...] "fun read" [...] for him because it is [...] "quick and exciting" [...] and [...] "packed" [...] with action and magic. Lawrence concluded his review by giving the book a rating of 3.8/5, commenting that [...] "the characters are interesting, the plot is engrossing, and you know <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> will win in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Chad was {{initially}} {{characterized as a}} [...] "street-kid" [...] by the show's official website and [...] "a tough dude from the hood" [...] by David Alexander Nahmod of the Bay Area Reporter. Swaby called his character [...] "talented, ambitious, adventurous, passionate", and said that his guarded personality {{was a way of}} [...] "defying <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy,</b> bad guy stereotype". Chad originally served as the [...] "object of affection for both Simone and Whitney", but his role on the series was expanded following the casting of Divins. An article on Soaps.com wrote that Divins adapted the character from being a [...] "West Coast music producer to [...] ambitious and tortured Crane heir". Over the course of the show, Chad was defined by his relationships with his supposed half-sister Whitney and his nephew-niece, Vincent Clarkson. After Swaby left the show, he was disappointed by the direction Chad's storyline took.|$|E

500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben's unclear motives {{have led}} to {{speculation}} about his possible status as a villain. Ben Rawson-Jones from Digital Spy describes Ben as a [...] "supposed villain", pondering [...] "Could he really have been <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> all along" [...] following the fourth-season episode [...] "The Shape of Things to Come". Actor Michael Emerson suspects where Ben's loyalties lie will always be ambiguous, making this a [...] "wonderful role". He is rarely shown losing control of his emotions, but when he does, it is done in a big and childish way. Emerson explains [...] "He's cold because any trace of warmth makes him vulnerable to his enemies". Ben is also known for {{his commitment to the}} island and doing whatever is necessary to protect it. He has no qualms with Locke attempting to kill Naomi (Marsha Thomason) and even Jack after the survivors begin to call the freighter. He undertakes the risky and unpredictable step of moving the Island to prevent the freighter crew, and thus Charles Widmore, from finding it. He always has a plan and is described by Kevin Thompson from The Palm Beach Post as a [...] "know-it-all", which another reviewer thinks is because [...] " [...] talks quietly, in a menacingly measured drawl... with lots of pauses and emphases".|$|E

500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E
500|$|Eckhart's {{next project}} was Thank You for Smoking, {{in which he}} played Nick Naylor, a tobacco {{lobbyist}} whose firm researched the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: [...] "You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet {{do it with a}} smile on your face and have the audience like you. At one point, I'm doing a talk show with a kid who's dying of cancer, and he's going through chemotherapy and the whole thing, and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I'm <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy,</b> and I'm this guy's best friend. I mean, it's whacked out." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of USA Today wrote that he gave a [...] "standout, whip-smart performance" [...] citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him [...] "likable even in his cynicism." [...] In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of the film, it was reported that [...] "Under his chummy but compassionless smile" [...] Eckhart radiated charm and [...] "Naylor's true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words." ...|$|E
500|$|Nathan Drake {{has been}} {{compared}} to several other video game and film characters, most notably video game adventurer Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider franchise and film character Indiana Jones, due to the similarities between the characters and the narratives they appear in. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer and Lee Ferran of ABC News called these associations [...] "obvious" [...] and [...] "unavoidable". In fact, Drake has been called a mixture of the two characters. Drake was hailed as the [...] "new Lara Croft" [...] after the Uncharted series sold well, and his similarity to Croft has earned him the moniker [...] "bloke-" [...] or [...] "dude-raider". Michael Owen-Brown of The Advertiser remarked that Drake distinguished himself from Croft with his wit, while director of the Uncharted series Bruce Straley claimed that Drake had equaled Croft in popularity. CBS drew a strict distinction between Indiana Jones and Drake, pointing out that while Jones acts altruistically, Drake is in it for the profits. Avi Arad, producer of a planned Uncharted film, drew a similar conclusion, remarking that while Jones was always good, Drake is not necessarily <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy.</b> Designer Neil Druckmann stated that he believes Drake stands apart from Jones and Croft. Other reviewers have compared Drake to different characters, including Jack Colton from the film Romancing the Stone. North, who plays Drake, also voices The Prince in the 2008 video game Prince of Persia, and comparisons have been made between the two characters. The Prince {{has been described as a}} rougher, more abrasive form of Nathan Drake.|$|E

[...] When referring to Christopher Reeve's guest appearance on the show, the review {{went as far as}} calling it [...] "the best [...] the show has delivered in its current lifespan... Reeve is the best special guest star yet." [...] Another review called the show [...] "excellent" [...] and called the acting of Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk [...] "phenomenal". Jennifer Contino from Sequential Tart, a comic-book website, observed that the season was more about [...] "the characters and their relationships", rather than the show's reputable [...] "villain-of-the-week" [...] style.

2500|$|Of the {{decision}} to have Lexa betray Clarke, a significant moment for the series that allowed the writers to strain the characters' relationship, Rothenberg said Lexa {{was under the impression}} Clarke would likely die in the battle and Mount Weather would possibly remain to keep her people united. [...] "She was probably—master strategist that she is—thinking several moves ahead. Thinking she could keep her alliance together, the 12 clans, because they would still have this evil empire out there to unite them," [...] he stated. Lexa was not expecting Clarke to win, and to subsequently become a legend. [...] "Everywhere she goes it's like, 'I heard it was 5,000 people! No, I heard it was 10,000 people!' Everywhere she goes, [...] a legend now," [...] said Rothenberg. [...] "Certainly it means that her alliance now no longer has a real reason to be held together. [...] I'm really excited to play out the ramifications of all of that." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke would eventually {{come to terms with the}} likelihood that, if she had been in a similar position as Lexa, she would have done the same thing: Protect her own people at all costs. He said she did as much in the season 2 finale. [...] "That was kind of the theme of the entire season, which was how far can you go and still be <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> in order to save your people. Lexa had that choice in [...] 15.
