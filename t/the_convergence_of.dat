5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to <b>the</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>of</b> sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory.

A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E

The idea of perturbed two-grid methods proposed in [7] {{is used to}} estimate <b>the</b> <b>convergence</b> factor <b>of</b> multigrid methods with residual scaled by positive constant scaling factors. We will show that if <b>the</b> <b>convergence</b> factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-grid methods are uniformly bounded by σ (σ< 0. 5), then <b>the</b> <b>convergence</b> factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> W-cycle multigrid methods are uniformly bounded by σ/(1 −σ), whether the residuals are scaled at some or all levels. This result extends Notay’s Theorem 3. 1 in [7] to more general cases. The result also confirms the viewpoint that the W-cycle multigrid method will converge sufficiently well as long as <b>the</b> <b>convergence</b> factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-grid method is small enough. In the case where <b>the</b> <b>convergence</b> factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-grid method is not small enough, by appropriate choice of the cycle index γ, we can guarantee that <b>the</b> <b>convergence</b> factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multigrid methods with residual scaling techniques still has a uniform bound less than σ/(1 −σ). Numerical experiments are provided {{to show that the}} performance of multigrid methods can be improved by scaling the residual with a constant factor. <b>The</b> <b>convergence</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-grid methods and the multigrid methods show that the W-cycle multigrid methods perform better if <b>the</b> <b>convergence</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-grid method becomes smaller.
