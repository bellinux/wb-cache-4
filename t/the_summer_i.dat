Her {{father was}} a home builder and later {{successful}} real estate developer, while her mother worked as the bookkeeper for her father's business. [...] Early on, her parents encouraged her to read, leading to what would become her love of reading. She said, [...] "I learned [...] at home from my mother. When I was a little girl, my mother would read stories to me. I have loved books {{and going to the}} library ever since.

It was poppy and catchy and perfect for <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> <b>I</b> think my core audience is young teenage girls and gay guys. Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E

Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, even though my parents weren't too happy about it.
