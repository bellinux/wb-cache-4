Monte Carlo simulations for this Hamiltonian show a first-order cubic-tetragonal transition at 660 K. Resulting temperature dependence of spontaneous polarization, c/a ratio and unit-cell volume near the transition are in good agreement with experiment.

40|$|Non-compact lattice QED is {{simulated}} {{for various}} numbers of fermion species N_f ranging from 8 through 40 by the exact Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. Over this range of N_f, chiral symmetry breaking {{is found to}} be strongly correlated with the effective monopoles in the theory. For N_f between 8 and 16 the chiral symmetry breaking and monopole percolation transitions are second order and coincident. Assuming powerlaw critical behavior, the correlation length exponent for the chiral transition is identical to that of monopole percolation. This result supports the conjecture that monopole percolation "drives" the nontrivial chiral transition. For N_f between 20 and 32, the monopoles experience a first order condensation transition coincident with a first order chiral transition. For N_f as large as 40 both transitions are strongly suppressed.
