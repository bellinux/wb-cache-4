The behavior <b>of</b> <b>carbide</b> particle {{seems to}} have close relation with SR embrittlement, as they grow significantly in the time range of SR embrittlement. The number <b>of</b> <b>carbide</b> particles which observed on the fracture surface of the specimen suffered from SR embrittlement is larger than that in cross-section.
