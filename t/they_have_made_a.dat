25|$|Tram, {{streetcar}} or trolley {{systems were}} common throughout {{the industrialized world}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but they disappeared from many cities in the mid-20th century.

Many newer light rail systems share features with (or utilize) trams, although a distinction is often drawn between the two, especially if the line has significant off-street running.|$|E
25|$|A common {{example of}} a {{population}} bottleneck is the Northern elephant seal. Due to excessive hunting throughout the 19th century, {{the population of the}} northern elephant seal was reduced to 30 individuals or less. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> full recovery, with the total number of individuals at around 100,000 and growing. The effects of the bottleneck are visible, however. The seals {{are more likely to have}} serious problems with disease or genetic disorders, because there is almost no diversity in the population.|$|E
30|$|The hypercorrection {{results from}} the first two {{experiments}} were further clarified and bolstered by Experiment 3.

When <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been right, it seems plausible that <b>they</b> may <b>have</b> had some knowledge that the feedback they were given was wrong (when it was). Interestingly, though, they also hyper'corrected' when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> error in Phase 1 and they were given false feedback following their error.

25|$|Specialised {{arbitration}} {{organizations have}} been formed in order to settle disputes {{in the matter of}} specialised issues, they work in only a very limited field but are highly specialised in the work they do.

25|$|Some modern {{critics of}} the {{doctrine}} of Hell (such as Marilyn McCord Adams) claim that, even if Hell is seen as a choice rather than as punishment, it would be unreasonable for God to give such flawed and ignorant creatures as humans the awesome responsibility of their eternal destinies. Jonathan Kvanvig, in his book, The Problem of Hell, agrees that God would not allow one to be eternally damned by a decision made under the wrong circumstances. For instance, one should not always honor the choices of human beings, even when they are full adults, if, for instance, the choice is made while depressed or careless. On Kvanvig's view, God will abandon no person until <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> settled, final decision, under favorable circumstances, to reject God, but God will respect a choice made under the right circumstances. Once a person finally and competently chooses to reject God, out of respect for the person's autonomy, God allows them to be annihilated.|$|E
500|$|On August 13, 1882, {{the first}} {{passenger}} train {{passed through the}} Black Canyon. The editor of the Gunnison Review-Press rode {{in one of the}} observation cars; he remarked that the canyon was [...] "undoubtedly the largest and most rugged canyon in the world traversed by the iron horse. We had often heard of the scenery of this canyon, but no one can have the faintest conception of its grandeur and magnificence until <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> trip through it. It is a narrow gorge with walls of granite rising in some places to a height of thousands of feet…Throughout its entire length there is probably not {{a quarter of a mile}} of straight track on it. It is a serpentine road in every respect and the curves are frequent and sharp. In hundreds of places the walls of granite are perpendicular and in many places the road bed is blasted out in the side of the walls of rock which overhang the track." [...] He went on to proclaim, [...] "Another such a feat of railroad engineering probably can not be found in the world, and there is probably no section of Colorado or of the whole country where such a varied and interesting lot of scenery can be found." ...|$|E

[...] John Thompson in The Kenyon Review supports this contention stating that, [...] "For these poems, the question of propriety no longer exists. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> conquest: what they have won is a major expansion of the territory of poetry." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{discussion}} with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno {{for his own}} thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out {{the similarities and differences}} between [...] "true belief" [...] and [...] "knowledge". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to [...] "stay in their place" [...] and must be [...] "tethered" [...] by what he calls aitias logismos (the calculation of reason, or reasoned explanation), immediately adding that this is anamnesis, or recollection.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} Rundstedt's efforts {{was shown in}} October 1946, when the IMT handed down its verdicts. Keitel and Jodl were to hang, but the Army high command {{as a whole was}} acquitted. The verdict read: [...] "According to the indictment, this group {{consists}} of about 130 officers who held certain positions in the military hierarchy between 1938 and 1945... The Tribunal does not find that they were an organisation... They were only an aggregation of those who happened to hold high rank in a certain period... These men have, however, been a disgrace to the profession of arms, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mockery of obedience to orders. They were a ruthless military caste, and where guilty of crimes should be brought to trial as individuals." [...] Thus the possibility was left open that Rundstedt could still face individual prosecution for his actions.|$|E

2500|$|Their {{third album}} Elephunk began {{development}} on November 2, 2001, {{but was not}} released until 2003. It was the first album to feature the vocals of current member Fergie. Nicole Scherzinger was originally approached to join the Peas, but was forced to decline {{because she was a}} member of Eden's Crush and was under contract. Fergie joined the group in 2002, introduced to will.i.am by Dante Santiago. Elephunk is also the first album that indicated and demonstrated the new, polished pop sound designed to attract mass audiences. In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, Rolling Stone noted that since 2002, when the group [...] "hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs – a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their United Colors of Benetton worldview." ...|$|E

Lundvik prime a remote trigger for the nuclear bombs set on a timer, intent on finishing her mission. Lundvik, Clara, and Courtney argue what to do, and come to a conclusion to let the population of Earth decide. As shown in medias res at the start of the episode, Clara makes a plea over broadcast channels for Earth to decide the fate of the creature by leaving their lights on to allow the creature to live, or turning off their lights if they should destroy it. Over the next hour, they witness the lights on Earth turn off. Clara changes her mind at the last second and [...] manages to stop the countdown on the remote detonator. Shortly thereafter the Doctor arrives, assured that they have made the right choice, and evacuates them from the moon as it starts to crumble.|$|E
