40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that, {{depending}} on its severity and context, stress can affect neural plasticity. Most related studies focused on synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) of principle cells. However, {{evidence suggests that}} following high-frequency stimulation, which induces LTP in principal cells, modifications also {{take place at the}} level of complex interactions with interneurons within the dentate gyrus, that is, at the local circuit level. So far, the possible effects of stress on local circuit activity and plasticity were not studied. Therefore, we set out to examine the possible alterations in local circuit activity and plasticity following exposure to stress. Local circuit activity and plasticity were measured by using frequency dependant inhibition (FDI) and commissural modulation protocols following exposure to a 15 minute-forced swim <b>trial.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to stress did not alter FDI. The application of theta-burst stimulation (TBS) reduced FDI in both control and stressed rats, but this type of plasticity was greater in stressed rats. Commissural-induced inhibition was significantly higher in stressed rats both before and after applying theta-burst stimulation. These findings indicate that the exposure to acute stress affects aspects of local circuit activity and plasticity in the dentate gyrus. It is possible that these alterations underlie some of the behavioral consequences of the stress experience. Copyright © 2008 Orli Yarom et al.

40|$|Non-destructive {{estimation}} using {{digital cameras}} {{is a common}} approach for estimating leaf area index (LAI) of terrestrial vegetation. However, no attempt has been made so far to develop non-destructive approaches to LAI estimation for aquatic vegetation. Using the submerged plant species Potamogeton malainus, {{the objective of this}} study was to determine whether the gap fraction derived from vertical photographs could be used to estimate LAI of aquatic vegetation. Our results suggested that upward-oriented photographs taken from beneath the water surface were more suitable for distinguishing vegetation from other objects than were downward-oriented photographs taken from above the water surface. Exposure settings had a substantial influence on the identification of vegetation in upward-oriented photographs. Automatic exposure performed nearly as well as the optimal <b>trial</b> <b>exposure,</b> making it a good choice for operational convenience. Similar to terrestrial vegetation, our results suggested that photographs taken for the purpose of distinguishing gap fraction in aquatic vegetation should be taken under diffuse light conditions. Significant logarithmic relationships were observed between the vertical gap fraction derived from upward-oriented photographs and plant area index (PAI) and LAI derived from destructive harvesting. The model we developed to depict the relationship between PAI and gap fraction was similar to the modified theoretical Poisson model, with coefficients of 1. 82 and 1. 90 for our model and the theoretical model, respectively. This suggests that vertical upward-oriented photographs taken from below the water surface are a feasible alternative to destructive harvesting for estimating PAI and LAI for the submerged aquatic plant Potamogeton malainus...|$|E

40|$|Configuring {{the mind}} to perform a novel task is an effortful process {{and one that is}} related to {{differences}} in general intelligence. Previous research has suggested that when participants are given instructions for a future task, representations of the rules contained in the instructions can influence subsequent behavior, even when the rules are not necessary to perform the upcoming task. One hypothesis for the continued activation of rule representations suggests that the practice trials participants perform before the experimental trials may instantiate the unnecessary task rules into participants' mental model of the task (i. e., the task space). To test this hypothesis, EEGs were recorded as participants (N = 66) completed a multirule task designed to contrast the effects of increasing task structure complexity and practice <b>trial</b> <b>exposure.</b> The results showed that, as was predicted, performance is significantly poorer when more task rules are specified in the task instructions. Practice trials with the extra rule did not affect task performance, indicating that an unacted verbal instruction is sufficient to incorporate the rule into participants' mental model of the task. The EEG results showed that instruction complexity was linked to a phasic increase in frontal theta synchronization but reduced posterior alpha and beta desynchronization. These changes in synchronization occurred during a time period of low intertrial phase coherence and suggest that participants were "checking the task rules" amidst a trial. This transient neural activity may reflect compensatory mechanisms for dealing with increased mind-wandering that is more likely to occur in complex tasks...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate if morphine sensitization is associated to changes in the behavioral reactions to appetitive and aversive taste stimuli and in the response of in vivo DA transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core and medial prefrontal cortex (PFCX) to the same stimuli. METHODS: Rats were administered twice a day for three consecutive days with increasing doses of morphine [10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, subcutaneously (sc) ] or with saline. After 15 days of withdrawal, rats were infused intraorally with either an appetitive (sweet chocolate, 1 ml) or an aversive solution (quinine HCl 5 × 10 (- 4) M, 1 ml). The behavioral taste reactions were recorded during microdialysis of DA in the NAc shell and core and PFCX. RESULTS: Opiate sensitization did not affect behavioral reactions to intraoral chocolate or quinine. In rats naive to the taste stimuli, morphine sensitization was associated to potentiation of stimulatory DA response to appetitive and aversive taste stimuli in the NAc core. Morphine sensitization reciprocally affected habituation of DA responsiveness after one <b>trial</b> <b>exposure</b> to appetitive and aversive taste stimuli (abolition it in the shell, induction in the PFCX). No habituation of DA responsiveness to taste was observed in the NAc core in controls as well as in morphine-sensitized rats. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that opiate sensitization is associated to differential adaptive changes of the responsiveness of DA transmission to taste stimuli in DA terminal areas. ...|$|E

A two-mirror coelostat with 100 cm focal length lens produced a 9. 2 mm image of the Sun. The spectrograph using 140 cm focal length lens in Littrow mode and a grating with 600 lines per millimeter blazed at 2 mu m provided a dispersion of 30 m and 43 m per pixel in the fourth order around the green line and third order around the red line, respectively. Two Peltier cooled 1 k x 1 k CCD cameras, with a pixel size of 13 mu m square and 14 -bit readout at 10 MHz operated in frame transfer mode, were used to obtain the time sequence spectra in two emission lines simultaneously. The duration of totality was 341 s, but we could get spectra for 270 s after a <b>trial</b> <b>exposure</b> at an interval of 5 s. We report here on the detection of intensity, velocity, and line width oscillations with periodicity {{in the range of}} 25 - 50 s. These oscillations can be interpreted in terms of the presence of fast magnetoacoustic waves or torsional Alfv,n waves. The intensity ratios of green to red emission lines indicate the temperature of the corona to be 1. 65 MK in the equatorial region and 1. 40 MK in the polar region, relatively higher than the expected temperature during the low activity period.

The within-swim {{pattern of}} cycle periods in Tritonia {{swimming}} changed when the behavior was repeatedly elicited suggesting that an excitatory process reaches a ceiling or wanes over repeated <b>trials.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to subthreshold stimuli enhanced swimming {{in response to}} a subsequent super-threshold stimulus, perhaps using a similar excitatory process. In reduced preparations, subthreshold stimuli increased action potential activity in identified serotonergic neurons. Fi-nally, stimulating serotonergic neurons enhanced a fictive swimming pattern, much like subthreshold stimuli enhanced the swimming behavior. Both within-swim and across-swim changes in the swimming behavior may be caused by increased activ-ity in identified serotonergic neurons. Comparative study suggests that ancestral serotonergic systems facilitated network oscillations for the production of rhythmic behaviors such as feeding and locomotion. This concept of serotonin as oscillatizer is used to explain the role of serotonergic neurons in Tritonia. Implications for human mental health are discussed...|$|R

Methods: This study reports secondary analyses of longitudinal data from mothers and children (n= 340) participating in the NOURISH randomized controlled <b>trial.</b> <b>Exposure</b> was quantified as the number of food items (n= 55) tried by a child from specified lists at age 14 months. At age 3. 7 years, food preferences, intake patterns, and fussiness (also at age 14 months) were assessed using maternal-completed, established questionnaires. Child weight and length/height were measured by study staff at both age points. Multivariable linear regression models were tested to predict food preferences, intake patterns, fussy eating, and body mass index z score at age 3. 7 years adjusting for a range of maternal and child covariates. Results: Having tried a greater number of vegetables, fruits, and noncore foods at age 14 months predicted corresponding preferences and higher intakes at age 3. 7 years but did not predict child body mass index z score. Adjusting for fussiness at age 14 months, having tried more vegetables at age 14 months was associated with lower fussiness at age 3. 7 years. Conclusions: These prospective analyses support the hypothesis that early taste and texture experiences influence subsequent food preferences and acceptance.

40|$|Serotonin {{receptor}} 1 A gene (HTR 1 A) knockout mice show pronounced defensive behaviour {{and increased}} fear conditioning to ambiguous conditioned stimuli. Such behaviour is {{a hallmark of}} pathological human anxiety, as observed in panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). Thus, variations in HTR 1 A might contribute to neurophysiological differences within subgroups of PD/AG patients. Here, we tested this hypothesis by combining genetic with behavioural techniques and neuroimaging. In a clinical multicentre trial, patients with PD/AG received 12 sessions of manualized cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and were genotyped for HTR 1 A rs 6295. In four subsamples of this multicentre <b>trial,</b> <b>exposure</b> behaviour (n = 185), defensive reactivity measured using a behavioural avoidance test (BAT; before CBT: n = 245; after CBT: n = 171) and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data during fear conditioning were acquired before and after CBT (n = 39). HTR 1 A risk genotype (GG) carriers more often escaped during the BAT before treatment. Exploratory fMRI results suggest increased activation of the amygdala in response to threat as well as safety cues before and after treatment in GG carriers. Furthermore, GG carriers demonstrated reduced effects of CBT on differential conditioning in regions including the bilateral insulae and the anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, risk genotype carriers demonstrated reduced self-initiated exposure behaviour to aversive situations. This study demonstrates the effect of HTR 1 A variation on defensive behaviour, amygdala activity, CBT-induced neural plasticity and normalization of defence behaviour in PD/AG. Our results, therefore, translate evidence from animal studies to humans and suggest a central role for HTR 1 A in differentiating subgroups of patients with anxiety disorders.

Despite efforts to change young adults 2 ̆ 7 sexual risk behavior, perhaps evidence-based interventions developed to date are not as effective as possible because they have focused predominantly on preventing HIV-infection, with fewer interventions focused on preventing unplanned pregnancy or STI infection. Indeed, research indicates that young adults are motivated to use condoms to prevent an unplanned pregnancy or STI, but are relatively less motivated to use condoms to prevent HIV infection. ^ The present study compared the relative efficacy of three brief, theory-based, separately-focused interventions (i. e., pregnancy, STI, or HIV prevention-focused) on increasing condom use behavior and decreasing risky sexual behavior among young adults in a longitudinal, randomized controlled <b>trial.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to one of the three separately-focused interventions was disassociated from collection of the study outcome measures, which were assessed at three time points. A control condition was used as the standard-of-care comparison. Hypothesis 1 predicted that the three separately-focused interventions would be more effective at changing participants 2 ̆ 7 condom use and risky-sexual behavior compared to those in a control condition. Hypothesis 2 predicted that the pregnancy or STI prevention-focused interventions would be more effective at changing participants 2 ̆ 7 condom use and risky-sexual behavior compared to those in the HIV prevention-focused intervention.

Limitations of the present study, including sample size and those related to the separate-study design, are noted. Implications for future research and public health efforts to design, disseminate, and implement sexual risk-reduction interventions that are most effective at changing young adults 2 ̆ 7 behavior are discussed. ...|$|E

A significant body of evidence has accumulated demonstrating that antagonism of VEGF and its downstream pathways is clinically useful in a significant proportion {{of patients with}} metastatic clear cell carcinoma of the kidney. Enough data is now available to recommend that patients with metastatic clear cell carcinoma of the kidney should {{at some point during the}} course of their disease be offered entry into a clinical <b>trial</b> enabling <b>exposure</b> to a targeted inhibitor of VEGF or its signalling pathways. Assuming early clinical trial data is substantiated by ongoing registration studies, efforts should be made to minimise the time taken between licensing and general availability of these active agents...|$|R
40|$|Since spring 1998, a new disease causing high {{mortality}} has afflicted cultured ornamental {{and common}} carps (Cyprinus carpio) in Israel. The clinical {{signs of the}} disease are fatigue, gasping movements in shallow water, gill necrosis, sunken eyes, pale patches on the skin and increased mucus secretion. The disease was experimentally transmitted to koi and common carp of vari- ous ages by injection with affected tissue filtrates, cohabitation <b>trials</b> and <b>exposure</b> to the isolat- edviralagent. Immersionofhealthyfishintankscontaining 2. 7 x 104 plaqueformingunits(PFU) per l or intraperitoneal injection (0. 2 ml) of a viral inoculum of 1000 PFU/ml were sufficient to induce the terminal disease in over 80 % of the fish. Here we report that the disease is restrict- ed to C. carpio, that young fish of 2. 5 g and 6 g are {{more sensitive to the}} virus than adults (230 g) and that the virus remains active in the water for at least four hours...|$|R
40|$|Molluscicide baits {{based on}} {{different}} active ingredients {{were tested in}} a seven-day laboratory trial on juveniles and young adults of Arion lusitanicus Mabille slug collected in ruderal sites during June and July of 2008. Before setting the trial, the slugs were adapted to laboratory conditions. The testing was conducted using {{a modified version of}} the method proposed by Godan (1983) and Wiktor (1989). The slugs were kept in arenas under controlled conditions (20 - 24 oC temperature, 80 - 90 % relative air humidity, no air stream, diffuse daylight). Smaller(15. 5 x 15. 5 x 7 cm) and larger (28 x 17. 5 x 7 cm) arenas were used, depending on slug numbers, and different rates of food and bait were administered. Plastic boxes with perforated coverage, lined with multi-ply paper moistened on a daily basis, were used as arenas. The slugs were fed on fresh salad daily, while baits were administered in open 35 mm petri dishes once for the duration of experiment. The first <b>trial</b> involved single-slug <b>exposures</b> to bait in 20 arenas per each of four treatments with two replicates and a total of 160 slugs. The second <b>trial,</b> group <b>exposure,</b> involved four treatments of five slugs per arena in six replicates with a total of 120 slugs. The products Arion and Pužomor demonstrated the highest efficacy (77. 5 %) in the single-slug trial. The average efficacy of the product Carakol after seven days of exposure was 60. 0 %. Regarding group exposure, Pužomor pellets achieved 79. 3 % efficacy after three days and this efficacy rate remained for the rest of the experiment. On the seventh day ofexposure, Arion and Carakol had 33. 3 % and 40. 0 % efficacy, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{a wealth}} of {{literature}} links di-etary factors andcoronaryheart disease (CHD), {{the strength of the}} evidence supporting valid associations has not been evaluated systematically in a single investigation.

We used the Bradford Hill guidelines to derive a causation score based on 4 criteria (strength, consis-tency, temporality, and coherence) for each dietary ex-posure in cohort studies and examined for consistency with the findings of randomized trials.

40|$|Exposure {{therapy is}} {{traditionally}} conducted {{with an emphasis}} on the elimination of safety behaviors. However, theorists have recently suggested that the judicious use of safety behaviors may improve the tolerability of this treatment without reducing its efficacy. The present study tested this notion by randomly assigning participants with high claustrophobic fear to receive a single-session intervention with or without access to safety aids during early <b>exposure</b> <b>trials.</b> Improvement was generally equivalent between the treatment conditions, and no reliable benefits or drawbacks were associated with the judicious use of safety behaviors. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicokinetics}} of inhaled compounds {{is defined}} by exposure, absorption of the material and its local metabolites, the tissue–plasma concentration–time curve, distribution within the body, and overall metabolism and excretion. Under controlled conditions of animal studies and human clinical <b>trials,</b> total <b>exposures</b> and estimated doses of individual compounds or simple mixtures of aerosols, gases and PM can readily be defined. However, methods for defining the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic properties of mixtures at this time are ill {{equipped to deal with}} exposures to atmospheres that contain thousands of individual components at varying concentrations. In general, {{attempts have been made to}} model and define empirically the disposition of only very simple mixtures. For example, the most complex of toxicokinetic data and models generated have been with refined gasoline and seven to eight primary chemical components (Dennison et al., 2003, 2004). The caveat to these studies is that, unlike the variety of chemical components that are contained within combustion-derived materials, many liquid- and vapour-phase gasoline components have similar structure and generally similar pathways of absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion...|$|R
40|$|Non-specific immune {{response}} of greenback flounder, Rhombosolea tapirina, exposed to contaminated marine sediments was examined. Reference sediments from Port Sorell and contaminated sediments from Deceitful Cove, Tasmania, Australia were investigated. Hatchery-reared flounder {{were exposed to}} reference sediment, contaminated sediment or contaminated sediment and diet for 6 weeks. Phagocytic capacity and lysozyme response in flounder were examined on cessation of <b>exposure</b> <b>trial.</b> Significant {{differences were found in}} phagocyticcapacity and lysozyme response between treatments. Exposure to contaminated sediment, irrespective of diet or benthic disturbance elicited inhibition of phagocytic efficiency in flounder. Disturbance of contaminated sediment stimulated lysozyme activity. The immuneresponse in flounder indicates potential immunotoxicity of sediment from Deceitful Cove...|$|R
