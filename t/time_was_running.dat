5|$|In June 2015, lenders {{warned that}} <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> {{out for a}} deal to be agreed on a new bailout plan. On 17 June, Tsakalotos warned that Greece {{would not be able}} to repay its €1.6bn loan from the IMF at the end of the month unless a new bailout plan was agreed. The {{deadline}} for the renewal of Greece's bailout package was also looming at the end of June. On 26 June, an emergency cabinet meeting led to the calling of a referendum on the bailout deal proposed by the creditors. Capital controls and a bank holiday were announced on 28 June, with the Eurozone refusing an extension of the bailout plan and Greece defaulting on its loan to the IMF on 30 June.|$|E

25|$|After being {{granted a}} second chance, Siegel cracked down and did {{everything}} possible to turn the Flamingo into a success by making renovations and obtaining good press. He hired future newsman Hank Greenspun as a publicist. The hotel reopened on March 1, 1947,—with Lansky present—and began turning a profit. However, by the time profits began improving, the mob bosses above Siegel were tired of waiting. Although <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out, at age 41, Siegel had carved out {{a name for himself}} in the annals of organized crime and in Las Vegas history.|$|E
25|$|Both {{men were}} noted for their hitting ability and viewed attack as their most {{effective}} chance of survival. Regular boundaries and quickly-run singles took the score to 226, a seventh-wicket partnership of 134. Only seven runs were required with four wickets in hand as <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> short. Benaud hit a {{ball into the}} covers and the pair attempted a quick single when a direct hit from Joe Solomon saw Davidson run out. Australia needed six runs from the final over, in which Benaud was caught and the last two wickets fell to run outs while attempting the winning run.|$|E
25|$|The Mount Lowe Railway opened officially on July 4, 1893. Folks amassed {{themselves}} at the remote Mountain Junction. Up to this point {{there was only one}} means of public transportation from the valleys below to the hillside community of Altadena. It was the Los Angeles Terminal Railway which by this <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> from Terminal Island in San Pedro to Mountain Junction. The trains ran twice a day and, at that, very irregularly, so the only sure means of getting to Altadena on time was by your own horse and buggy. This lack of transportation coupled with Lowe’s inability to establish any at all would be in part the downfall of the railway.|$|E

25|$|The bishop's reeve in the {{southern}} Grisons, Benedikt Fontana, {{was forced to leave}} his seat on the Fürstenburg at Burgeis in the Vinschgau. He had called repeatedly to have strong troops sent to interfere with the preparations of the Habsburg army. The Three Leagues finally complied and assembled an army of about 6,300 men at Zuoz and marched to the Val Müstair. They knew that their <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out, because they had news of Maximilian being on his way with reinforcements. But the Letzi seemed an insurmountable barrier. The Habsburg army numbered some 12,000 men, of which 2,000 manned the fortifications themselves, while another 1,200 covered the flanks. Castle Rotund at Taufers in front of the barrier was also manned with Habsburg troops, and 200 men guarded the bridge at Marengo behind the Letzi. The rest of the Habsburg army camped at the villages in the Vinschgau.|$|E
25|$|If {{the contestants}} {{had the same}} score {{at the end of}} the game, the scores were reset and the contestants played one tiebreaker {{question}} each, again attempting to match all six celebrities. On Match Game PM, or on the syndicated daytime show if <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> short, a time-saving variant of the tie-breaker was used that reversed the game play. The contestants wrote their answers first on a card in secret, then the celebrities were canvassed to give their answers verbally. Originally, this included regulars Somers, Reilly and Dawson only, but when Dawson left the show, the canvass was expanded to include all six panelists in the usual order. The first celebrity response to match a contestant's answer gave that contestant the victory. If there was still no match, which was rare, the round was replayed with a new question. On the CBS version, the tie-breaker went on until there was a clear winner. If it came to the sudden-death tie-breaker, only the final question (the one that ultimately broke the tie) was kept and aired.|$|E
25|$|India's next {{match was}} against arch-rivals Pakistan at Sydney. It {{was the first}} time ever {{in the history of the}} Cricket World Cup that India and Pakistan played each other and therefore, the match was highly anticipated. India won the toss and batted first, posting a modest 216/7 in a match reduced to 49 overs due to rain, with the top {{contributors}} being Tendulkar (54 not out from 62 balls, 3 fours) and rookie opener Ajay Jadeja (46 from 77 balls, 2 fours). Pakistan's leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed was the pick of Pakistan's bowlers, taking 3/59, while fast bowler Aaqib Javed was economical, taking 2/28 in his 8 overs. In Pakistan's reply, only opener Aamer Sohail, who scored 62, could cross 50 runs with Kapil (2/30), Prabhakar (2/22) and rookie Javagal Srinath (2/37) taking 2 wickets each, as Pakistan crashed to 173 all out in the 49th over, losing by 43 runs, earning India its first win in the tournament, a famous victory which would begin an all-win record over the arch-rivals in subsequent Cricket World Cups (both 50-over and 20-over). The match also had its share of drama which is a regular feature in Indo-Pak cricket matches, with Javed Miandad imitating Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More's appealing behind the stumps. However, India's <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out and they had to play really well from then on to have any chance of reaching the semifinals.|$|E

[...] By 9 May, he felt that <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out, so he set out for Badajoz with all the men of ICorps and IVCorps of the Army of the South he could spare from the siege of Cadiz and the occupation of the rest of Andalusia. [...] Combined with the men of VCorps under Latour-Maubourg on the Andalusian border, Soult had a force of approximately 23,000 men and 35 artillery pieces cannon moving towards Badajoz. [...] His army was much smaller than that of the Allies, but he hoped the quality of his troops would compensate for his lack of numbers.|$|E
500|$|The {{best known}} case of post-uprising {{departure}} involved {{a group of}} Jewish Combat Organization fighters {{under the leadership of}} Icchak Cukierman and Marek Edelman, who had taken part in both the Ghetto and the Warsaw Uprisings. Originally, the former Ghetto fighters stayed together in a large group, but in the second week of October, some of them moved to a different location. Those remaining stayed in the same place on Promyka Street until mid-November, when they were contacted by Ala Margolis, a courier from the Home Army, who had previously managed to leave the city. Margolis and a [...] "rescue squadron" [...] of five people returned to get {{the rest of the group}} out. The Germans had begun a systematic search and destruction of ruined houses near the hiding place, which meant <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out. Dressed as nurses and doctors, with clothes and Red Cross IDs provided by Dr. Lesław Węgrzynowski, director of the Home Army sanitation unit, the rescue squadron and the seven in hiding made their way out of the city through two German checkpoints. The group consisted of five men and two women: Edelman, Cukierman, Cywia Lubetkin (later, Cukierman's wife), Tosia Goliborska, Julek Fiszgrund, Tuwia Borzykowski, and Zygmunt Warman. The first checkpoint was crossed during dinner, and the Germans did not bother to examine the group, but at the second, an SS officer noticed that Warman, who was lying in a stretcher, was wearing combat boots. He yelled, [...] "These are Polish bandits!", but one of the escorts dressed as a nurse quickly declared that the patients in the stretcher were ill with typhus. The SS soldiers backed off, and the group moved on its way.|$|E
500|$|Although {{time was}} plentiful, the pitch {{had begun to}} {{deteriorate}} and Australia look defeated after they had fallen to 5/57, prompting Davidson to join local batsman Ken Mackay at the crease. They took the score to 92 when Mackay fell and Australia's chances of winning looked remote as Davidson and Benaud reached tea at 6/109 with 124runs still required with only the tailenders were to follow. Despite this, Benaud told chairman of selectors Don Bradman that he would still be going for an improbable victory in accordance with his policy of aggressive strategy. With an attacking partnership, the pair took Australia to {{within sight of the}} target. The pair added 50 runs in 55 minutes. Davidson hooked leading paceman Wes Hall repeatedly and Benaud attacked the spinners when Worrell took Hall off. Both men were noted for their hitting ability and viewed attack as their most effective chance of survival. Davidson hit four fours from the leg spin of Sonny Ramadhin, and the deficit dwindled to 60 with one hour remaining and 27 with 30 minutes to go. The pair took 17 runs from the next two overs, and regular boundaries and quickly run singles took Australia into what looked like a victorious position. They took the score to 226 with a seventh wicket partnership of 134. Only seven runs were required with four wickets in hand as <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> short. Benaud hit a ball into the covers and the pair attempted a quick single, but a direct hit from Joe Solomon saw Davidson run out for his highest Test score of 80. Davidson reflected [...] "I was as dirty as anyone ever has been". Australia needed six runs from the final over with three wickets in hand but Benaud was caught and the last two players fell to run outs while attempting the winning run. The match was tie in Test cricket, and Davidson had achieved his unprecedented feat despite carrying a broken finger into the match. Bradman joked that he should break his finger before every match.|$|E

2500|$|As Shadow Chancellor he {{concentrated}} on tax reform. Jenkins, Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, wrote that he was never intimidated by him, and that Macleod concentrated on opposition rather than constructive proposals. Macleod planned to abolish Selective Employment Tax and to cut personal income tax, but not to increase indirect taxes, trusting that economic growth would make up the shortfall in revenue. He proposed a national lottery then opposed Jenkins when he proposed one; on another occasion he required Conservative MPs, to the irritation of some of them, {{to walk out of}} a select committee meeting in protest. Jenkins later recorded that Macleod was not “an amiable “shadow” … no doubt he was in pain … Perhaps he also had a premonition that <b>time</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> out for him.” ...|$|E
