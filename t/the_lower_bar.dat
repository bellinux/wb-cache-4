5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bar</b> of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E
60|$|He gripped <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bar</b> {{with his}} lean, sinewy hands, and setting his knee against the masonry beneath it, he exerted {{the whole of}} his huge {{strength}}--that awful strength acquired during those years of toil as a galley-slave, which even his debaucheries had not undermined. He felt his sinews straining until it seemed that they must crack; the sweat stood out upon his brow; his breathing grew stertorous.|$|E
60|$|The voices {{came from}} the other side of the hedge, on the {{opposite}} side of the lane. Reuben crossed noiselessly. There was a gate just where the cart had stopped, and the men had evidently got over it, to obtain the shelter of the hedge from the wind. Reuben felt the gate, which was old and rickety; then cautiously he placed his feet on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bar,</b> and leaned forward so as to look round the hedge.|$|E
60|$|As it happened, it did not. Having {{read the}} opening {{words of the}} note, Sam rocked violently; but his feet were twined about <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bars</b> and this saved him from overbalancing. Webster stepped back, relieved.|$|R

60|$|The cradle, which Frank and {{his comrades}} saw working {{not far from}} the pan-washer, was by no means a complex affair. It was a {{semi-circular}} trough hollowed out of a log six feet long by sixteen inches diameter. At one end of this was a perforated copper or iron plate, with a rim of iron or wood round it, on which the dirt was thrown, and water poured thereon, by one man, while the cradle was rocked by another. The gold, earth, and small gravel were thus separated from the larger stones, and washed down the trough, in which, at intervals, two tranverse bars were placed; the first of these arrested the gold, which from its great weight sunk to the bottom, while the gravel, and lighter substances, were swept away by the current. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bar</b> caught any particles that, by awkward management, might have passed the upper one.|$|E
6000|$|We {{got a good}} craft for our money, however. She was a large {{comfortable}} schooner, that {{mounted a}} few light guns, and our duty was far from heavy. The treatment {{turned out to be}} good, also, as some relief to our folly. One of our Henry Kneelands died of the [...] "horrors" [...] before we got to sea, and we buried him at the watering-place, near <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bar.</b> I must have been about four months in the Marion, during which time we visited the different keys, and went into Key West. At this place, our crew became sickly, and I was landed among others, and sent to a boarding-house. It was near a month before we could get the crew together again, when we sailed for Norfolk. At Norfolk, six of us had relapses, and were sent to the hospital; the cutter sailing without us. I never saw the craft afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|By {{and by a}} fat hen {{walked over}} to the bars of the cowyard and hopped up on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bar.</b> There she sat for some time. Then, making up her mind that she would see what was outside, she hopped down and {{walked over to the}} pile of old boards. Right then things {{happened}} all at once. That red spot behind the pile of old boards suddenly came to life. There was a quick spring, and that fat hen was seized by the neck so suddenly that she didn't have time to make a sound. At the same instant the black spot in the top of the tall tree came to life, and Blacky the Crow flew over to the roof of the barn, screaming at the top of his lungs. Now those who know Blacky well, know when he is screaming [...] "Fox! Fox! Fox!" [...] although it sounds as if he were saying [...] "Caw! Caw! Caw!" ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>lower</b> tie <b>bar</b> is an alloy/steel <b>bar</b> {{that ties}} <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> {{suspension}} pick-up points {{of a vehicle}} (with an independent suspension) together. It increases chassis rigidity by bracing {{the left and right}} lower-control-arm sheet metal mounting points. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> tie <b>bar</b> is designed to reduce the non-pivoting movement of the control arms and to stiffen the subframe to lessen the distortion of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> suspension, especially during hard cornering. As a result, it improves the handling and steering response of the vehicle. It may also provide additional benefits in front-wheel drive vehicles by reducing wheel hop and torque steer. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> may <b>lower</b> ground clearance by as much as 30 millimeters on some aftermarket installations.The <b>lower</b> tie <b>bar</b> is mostly an aftermarket car component. Some of the few exceptions to this rule are the Honda Integra and Civic Type-R, as well as the Daihatsu Charade GTti. Since <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> tie <b>bar</b> is one of the cheapest upgrade that tuners can install on their cars, it {{is probably one of the}} first performance accessories is acquired. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> tie <b>bar</b> is a bolt-on device and no stock parts will have to be replaced or removed when it is being installed on the vehicle (unless the vehicle already has one on it). These characteristics make <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> tie <b>bar</b> a popular performance upgrade among car tuning enthusiasts for its appearance and slight performance gain.|$|R
6000|$|The cradle is a {{very simple}} machine, being a semicircular trough, {{hollowed}} out of a log, from five to six feet long by sixteen inches in diameter. At one end {{of this is a}} perforated copper or iron plate, with a rim of wood round it, on which the [...] "dirt" [...] is thrown, and water poured thereon by one man, while the cradle is rocked by another. The gold and gravel are thus separated from the larger stones, and washed down the trough, in which, at intervals, two transverse bars, half-an-inch high, are placed; the first of these arrests the gold, which, from its great weight, sinks to the bottom, while the gravel and lighter substances are swept away by the current. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bar</b> catches any particles of gold that, by awkward management, may have passed the upper one. Three men usually worked together at a rocker, one digging, one carrying the [...] "dirt" [...] in a bucket, and one rocking the cradle.|$|E
60|$|I swam {{into this}} smooth water, {{followed}} closely by Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, who, however, soon became unable to use their oars, owing to {{the proximity of the}} rocks. Dropping these useful implements, they managed to paddle after me with their hands, and they were as much astonished as I was when, just after making the slight turn, we found stretched across the narrow passage a great iron bar about eight or ten inches above the water. A little farther on, and two or three feet above the water, another iron bar extended from one rocky wall to the other. Without uttering a word I examined <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bar,</b> and found one end of it fastened by means of a huge padlock to a great staple driven into the rock. The lock was securely wrapped {{in what appeared to be}} tarred canvas. A staple through an eyehole in the bar secured the other end of it to the rocks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the major}} conundrums in the {{evolution}} of vertebrate cranial design is the early loss and frequent redevelopment of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> temporal <b>bar</b> in diapsids. Whereas it has been proposed that the reduction of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> temporal <b>bar</b> allows for an increase in jaw adductor mass and bite force, this has never been tested experimentally. As the sole recent representative of the Rhynchocephalia, Sphenodon punctatus is different from other extant lepidosaurians in having a fully diapsid skull and in using translation to shear food rather than using the typical puncture-crushing of other lizards. In the present study, we show that S. punctatus has lower bite forces compared with extant lepidosaurians. Moreover, dissection of the jaw muscles of an adult S. punctatus shows that the mass of the external jaw adductor muscle is significantly smaller than that of lizards, probably accounting for <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> measured bite forces. An analysis of the transport cycles suggests a less efficient prey transport in S. punctatus compared with an agamid lizard of similar size in terms of handling time and number of cycles needed to crush similar prey. Modelling of biting in S. punctatus suggests a different role of the jaw adductor muscles during biting and a clear functional role for <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> temporal <b>bar.</b> Future finite element models may provide better insights into the function of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> temporal <b>bar</b> in S. punctatus...|$|R

For if you poked and poked, you raised white cumulus clouds of ash, and you were left at last with a few darkening and sulphurous embers. But even so, by continuous application, you could keep the room moderately warm, without feeling you were consuming the house's meat and drink in the grate. Which was one blessing.|$|R
