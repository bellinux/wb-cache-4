25|$|Equity {{is highly}} valued in Finland {{and the law}} {{provides}} same rights for all citizens, including in healthcare. There still exists some geographic and socioeconomic disparities. Perhaps {{one of the most}} important reasons for the socioeconomic differences in the use of services is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sector and occupational healthcare, which are less accessible to the low-income population, offer better access to services (e.g. a major difference is waiting times) than the municipal sector. Narrowing health gaps has been the objective of Finnish health policy since the 1980s, however, this objective has not been fully achieved.|$|E
25|$|Justice White {{concluded}} that {{nothing in the}} record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the riparian water rights of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River. White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to the federal government. There could be no doubt, White argued, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> landowners intended to give all of their riparian rights to the federal government, {{and there could be}} no doubt that the federal government intended to give all riparian rights to those to whom it sold the land.

These industries include the petrochemical, automotive, mining, steel, iron, copper, agriculture and telecommunications industries, ‘a unique {{situation in the}} Middle East’. Most of the companies developing high technologies remain state-owned, including in the automotive and pharmaceutical industries, despite plans to privatize 80% of state-owned companies by 2014. It was estimated in 2014 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sector accounted for about 30% of the Iranian pharmaceutical market.The Industrial Development and Renovation Organization (IDRO) controls about 290 state-owned companies. IDRO has set up special purpose companies in each high-tech sector to co-ordinate investment and business development. These entities are the Life Science Development Company, Information Technology Development Centre, Iran InfoTech Development Company and the Emad Semiconductor Company. In 2010, IDRO set up a capital fund to finance the intermediary stages of product- and technology-based business development within these companies.|$|E
25|$|Some Portuguese {{employers}} and families {{are of the}} opinion that the existence of private education institutions, where accessibility is based primarily on ability to pay, is not as fair as the public system and could gloom the meritocracy concept, leading to easier entrance criteria and lower teaching standards. Some private institutions are known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get higher grades - as long as they pay. Others claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> systems could prevent a significant portion of Portugal's population from being able to attend these schools that is also unfair. The quotas imposed on public education institutions to create room for students from former Portuguese colonies, who get automatically a place in those institutions also creates a big problem in terms of fairness, as some of these students can enter with very low grades excluding a portion of the Portuguese born students from studying in the public institutions and first choice courses they want.|$|E
25|$|When Malawi’s {{agricultural}} sector was liberalised, {{it was expected}} that the role of the parastatal ADMARC would be taken over by private traders, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sector would create an efficient marketing system that would stimulate the use of fertilizer and hybrid maize, which in turn would lead to expanded distribution networks. Liberalisation, it was hoped, would create an efficient and responsive private sector marketing system that would stimulate agricultural production. In Malawi, the withdrawal of ADMARC from most areas contributed to widespread food insecurity among smallholder farmers, especially those in remote areas. To fill up the vacuum created following the withdrawal of ADMARC, the Ministry of Agriculture launched a development programme to train agro-dealers preferably rural shop owners. This started in 2001 with financial support from the USAID, but the programme had limited success as the majority of those trained ceased to be active agro-dealers within a few years of training, and most continuing agro-dealers were not rural based small-businessmen, as to start a successful dealing business required more capital than these possessed.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, 33 {{percent of}} the journalists on SVT and SR {{supported}} the Left Party, which {{was about the same}} as journalists in commercial broadcasting and print media, but significantly more than among the general public, among whom 15 percent supported the Left Party. Support for the Left Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Party was stronger among journalists on SVT and SR than the general public, while the Moderate Party, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats had significantly less support among SVT and SR journalists than the public. However, the study concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> political opinions of the journalists had little impact on their work and that news stories are treated the same regardless of the political color of the journalist, worth mentioning as well is that SJF, the organisation in which the study was conducted partly is a unionbased organisation which could skew the accuracy of the representation within the selection (lessening the validity of the survey) as it is possible it excludes some rightwing journalists. The University of Gothenburg also made another study during the Swedish 2006 general election, comparing SVT's news programme Rapport to the country's five largest newspapers. The study concluded that Rapport's coverage of the election was the most balanced of them all.|$|E
