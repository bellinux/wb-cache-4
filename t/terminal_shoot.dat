60|$|Tendrils revolve by the {{curvature}} of their whole length, excepting the sensitive extremity and the base, which parts do not move, or move but little. The movement {{is of the}} same nature {{as that of the}} revolving internodes, and, from the observations of Sachs and H. de Vries, no doubt is due to the same cause, namely, the rapid growth of a longitudinal band, which travels round the tendril and successively bows each part to the opposite side. Hence, if a line be painted along that surface which happens at the time to be convex, the line becomes first lateral, then concave, then lateral, and ultimately again convex. This experiment can be tried only on the thicker tendrils, which are not affected by a thin crust of dried paint. The extremities are often slightly curved or hooked, and {{the curvature}} of this part is never reversed; in this respect they differ from the extremities of twining shoots, which not only reverse their curvature, or at least become periodically straight, but curve themselves in a greater degree than the lower part. In most other respects a tendril acts as if it were one of several revolving internodes, which all move together by successively bending to each point of the compass. There is, however, in many cases this unimportant difference, that the curving tendril is separated from the curving internode by a rigid petiole. With most tendril-bearers the summit of the stem or shoot projects above the point from which the tendril arises; and it is generally bent to one side, so as {{to be out of the}} way of the revolutions swept by the tendril. In those plants in which the <b>terminal</b> <b>shoot</b> is not sufficiently out of the way, as we have seen with the Echinocystis, as soon as the tendril comes in its revolving course to this point, it stiffens and straightens itself, and thus rising vertically up passes over the obstacle in an admirable manner.|$|E

5000|$|As a timber, both Swietenia macrophylla and Swietenia mahogoni {{are both}} grown in {{plantations}} in several Asian {{countries such as}} Fiji, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh and this plantation mahogany timber is {{the main source of}} the world's current supply of [...] "genuine mahogany", due to cultivation and trade of it in its native locations being restricted by the Convention On International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna CITES since the late 1990s. Trade in Swietenia grown and harvested in these non-native locations is not restricted. Species of this genus are only occasionally plantation-grown in Central America, in spite of the good growing conditions and high price of the wood, due to the ubiquitous presence of the mahogany shoot borer moth (also known as the cedar tip moth), Hypsipyla grandella, which damages the form of the tree by killing the <b>terminal</b> <b>shoot,</b> causing excessive branching. Control requires extensive and frequent spraying with pesticides, rendering the genus relatively uneconomic wherever the shoot borer is present.|$|E
5000|$|Yucca aloifolia {{has become}} {{naturalized}} in Bahamas, Argentina, Uruguay, Italy, Pakistan, South Africa, Queensland, New South Wales, and Mauritania. It {{is common in}} gardens and parks of the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain). Yucca aloifolia has an erect trunk, 3-5 in (7.6-12.7 cm) in diameter, reaching up to 5-20 ft (1.5-6.1 m) tall before it becomes top heavy and topples over. When this occurs, the tip turns upward and keeps on growing. The trunk is armed with sharp pointed straplike leaves each about 2 ft (0.6 m) long. The young leaves near the growing tip stand erect; older ones are reflexed downward, and the oldest wither and turn brown, hanging around the lower trunk like a Hawaiian skirt. Eventually {{the tip of the}} trunk develops a 2 ft (0.6 m) long spike of white, purplish-tinged flowers, each blossom about 4 in (12.7 cm) across. After flowering, the trunk stops growing, but one or more lateral buds are soon formed, and the uppermost becomes a new <b>terminal</b> <b>shoot.</b> Yucca aloifolia also produces new buds, or offshoots, near the base of the trunk, forming the typical thicket often observed in dry sandy and scrub beach areas of the southeastern United States[...]|$|E

40|$|On average, {{branches}} of Pinus contorta Dougl. bearing male cones had 35 fewer needle pairs than equivalent vegetative branches, and significantly fewer differentiated primordia (i. e., male cones + needle pairs + sterile cataphylls). It was {{estimated that the}} formation of male cones results in a 27 - 50 % {{reduction in the number}} of needles per male cone-bearing branch. In early spring, branches bearing male cones had on average 23 % (0. 44 g) more dry weight than vegetative branches. On average, 95 % of the dry weight of male cone-bearing branches was allocated to the <b>terminal</b> <b>shoot</b> (54 % of which was male cones) and 5 % to the lateral shoots. By comparison, vegetative branches allocated 85 % of their total dry weight to the <b>terminal</b> <b>shoot</b> and 15 % to the lateral shoots.

40|$|Chokecherry (Prunus virginiana L.) is {{a native}} North American plant that has {{potential}} as a regionally important alternative fruit crop. Seedlings from 13 open-pollinated populations were subjected to chilling temperatures (4 Â°C) for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 wk, and then held under long day conditions (16 h) at 20 Â± 2 Â°C for 4 wk. Bud break and shoot growth were then measured on replicate plants to determine chilling requirement for breaking bud dormancy. No significant bud break occurred when seedlings were chilled for less than 4 wk, whereas plants chilled for 10 wk showed 100 % bud break. The amount of chilling required to produce 50 % bud break (CB 50) differed among seedling populations, and ranged from 3. 1 to 8. 9 wk. The effect of chilling time on <b>terminal</b> <b>shoot</b> elongation also differed among seedling populations. Some populations showed maximum shoot growth after 8 wk of chilling, whereas shoot elongation in other populations continued to increase through 16 wk of chilling. For those populations that reached an obvious maximum growth within 16 wk of chilling, a chilling time to obtain 50 % of maximum growth (CG 50) was calculated. There was no correlation between CB 50 and CG 50. For {{the majority of the}} Intermountain West ecotypes tested, 10 wk of chilling at 4 Â°C maximized both bud break and <b>terminal</b> <b>shoot</b> growth...|$|E
