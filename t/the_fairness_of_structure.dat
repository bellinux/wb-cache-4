40|$|I {{created a}} course {{out of the}} VITA program that allows our {{students}} to meet the College’s Service Learning rquirement. This course certifies {{students to participate in}} the VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) Program. Students learn how to prepare basic tax returns. Students will be able to e-file these tax returns using TaxWise Software. The students will work at several VITA sites preparing tax returns for low-income taxpayers in the local community. The students will also identify social and political issues impacted by state and federal taxes. After completion of the VITA portion of the class, students will discuss topics such as <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>structure</b> and present informational sessions to the community on investment decisions, social security issues, and retirement decisions. A copy of the syllabus is attached for your review...|$|R
40|$|A {{good measure}} <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> is an {{essential}} prerequisite for a systematic development of fair resource allocation protocols {{as well as for}} a systematic evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> existing protocols. We propose the use of approximate majorization as a framework for quantifying <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> a resource allocation scheme. We demonstrate how approximate majorization subsumes and generalizes several natural measures <b>of</b> <b>fairness.</b> We then relate majorization to revenue maximization, and sketch an efficient algorithm to compute <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> a given allocation as well to find the fairest allocation. We believe that our framework is quite general and can be applied to several routing, bandwidth allocation, load balancing, and clustering problems. To illustrate the framework in a concrete setting, we perform a preliminary case study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> TCP as a bandwidth allocation protocol in communication networks, and of multi-path routing vs. single path routing. We discover several interesting trends about <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> TCP which merit further study. <b>The</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> TCP improves as the buffer sizes and/or link capacities are increased. In several realistic cases, <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> TCP is comparable to or better than that <b>of</b> max-min <b>fairness.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between beliefs in procedural fairness, humanitarian values, and attitudes toward asylum seekers amongst a sample of first year university students in Western Australia (N = 148). Beliefs in procedural fairness were measured in terms <b>of</b> beliefs in <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> decision making and beliefs in <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> treatment. Findings supported the hypotheses, in that beliefs in procedural fairness {{were significantly related to}} attitudes and humanitarian values. Regression analyses revealed that beliefs in <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> treatment and humanitarian values made unique contributions in predicting attitudes. However beliefs in <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> decision making did not make a unique contribution to the prediction of attitudes.

40|$|This thesis {{explored}} Canadian {{high performance}} Athletes' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SDRCC sport-specific arbitral process. Leventhal’s (1980) model of procedural justice judgment {{was found to}} be an effective tool for exploring Athletes’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process. Five of his six procedural justice antecedents: consistency, bias suppression, accuracy of information, representativeness, and ethicality influenced the Athletes’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process. Emergent data also revealed that <b>the</b> Athletes’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> were also influenced by three contextual factors and an additional antecedent of procedural justice. Efficiency of the process, inherent power imbalance between Athletes and NSOs, and the measurable effect of the process on personal and professional relationships differentiate sport-specific arbitration from most other processes of allocation. The data also indicated that the opportunity to voice one’s case was also an important determinant of the Athletes’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> microcredit interest rates. Since microfinance institutions provide {{credit for}} the poor at relatively high prices, <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> their interest rates has been repeatedly debated. We first apply Rawls' principles of justice {{to the case of}} microcredit interest rates and suggest some limitations related to the hypothesis of rationality of the borrowers and the level of inequality. We then suggest another framework based on the analysis of the distribution of the benefits generated by the transaction to assess <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> interest rates. We conceptualize this as the distribution of the bargaining range between the borrowers' and the institutions' reservation price and discuss what these reservation prices could be in the context of microfinance. © 2013 The Authors.

While <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal income tax is an important issue, little attention has been paid to a more important issue: <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire U.

Analysis of any particular tax reform proposal is incomplete without consideration of its impact on the overall distribution of taxes. ...|$|R
