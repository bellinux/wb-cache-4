5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on <b>the</b> <b>sentiments</b> expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked that these men, whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E

5|$|Madgulkar did {{not make}} any attempt to provide new {{interpretation}} or meaning to the Ramayana but told the same story in the simpler and poetic format. With inclusion of characters like Ahalya and Shabari, he included <b>the</b> <b>sentiments</b> of religious devotion (Bhakti) and also gave divine touch to the story while describing the marriage of Sita and Rama as a union of Maya and Brahman. He composed songs on all seven chapters or Kāṇḍa of Ramayana. Out of 56 songs, poet composed twelve songs on Balakanda, seven on Ayodhya Kanda, fourteen on Aranya Kanda, three on Kishkindha Kanda, four on Sundara Kanda, twelve on Yuddha Kanda and three on Uttara Kanda.|$|E

5|$|Some {{say that}} {{nothing could be more}} desperate than the measure, but I answer that the state of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of <b>the</b> <b>sentiments</b> which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E
5|$|By noon, the Lithuanians {{received}} a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis {{was not a}} suitable candidate for Prime Minister. The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov. Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued to disagree {{with the majority of}} his government, decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President. By late evening on June 15, Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys Musteikis reached Kybartai and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum. The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow Liepona rivulet. Smetona′s departure worked to the Soviets′ advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule {{and they were able to}} exploit <b>the</b> <b>sentiments</b> against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr. By fleeing, Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis Ulmanis and Estonian President Konstantin Päts, who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested. Under the Lithuanian constitution, Merkys became acting president.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} of the meic Somairle to establish the Benedictines on Iona completely contrasted the ecclesiastical actions of Somairle himself, and provoked a prompt and violent response from Colum Cille's familia. According to the Annals of Ulster, after Cellach, Abbot of Iona built the new monastery in 1204, a large force of Irishmen, led by the Bishops of Tyrone and Tirconell and the Abbots of Derry and Inishowen, made landfall on Iona and burnt the new buildings to the ground. <b>The</b> <b>sentiments</b> of the familia may well be preserved in a contemporary poem which portrays Colum Cille lamenting the violation of his rights, and cursing the meic Somairle. Unfortunately for the familia, the Benedictine presence on Iona was there to stay, and the old monastery of Colum Cille was nearly obliterated by the new monastery. Somairle's attempt to revive Iona brought him into conflict with secular and ecclesiastical power in northern Ireland. If Ragnall was indeed responsible for {{the foundation of the}} Benedictine monastery about four decades afterwards, it may indicate that he was following in his father's footsteps, and asserting himself as a king in the Isles.|$|E
30|$|Starting {{with the}} 3 D plots {{of the test}} period in Fig.  8 b, d, for the normal distribution, <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> {{strategy}} exhibits positive Sharpe ratios for positive values of μ. Thereby, the value of σ only plays a minor role {{for the performance of}} <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy. For <b>the</b> uniform distribution, the performance of <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy follows a similar pattern. <b>The</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy generates positive Sharpe ratios for parameter combinations that result in a positive mean for the view distribution. This is in line with our theory, as we expect the return being generated by the specified view to be positive.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the Sharpe ratio, the CER, {{as well as the}} annualized returns, <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> {{strategy}} outperforms all of the benchmark strategies. <b>The</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy has <b>the</b> highest Omega ratio, the lowest VaR and CVaR (both displayed in absolute values), and the lowest downside deviation (DD). As <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy of course is an active strategy, it exhibits a higher turnover than the rather passive benchmark strategies.|$|R

30|$|In the {{training}} period {{as well as}} in the test period, the ‘weighted negative pick matrix’ performs about equally well as the ‘negative pick matrix’. The application of the ‘positive pick matrix’ leads to <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy mostly being the worst or second worst performing strategy. This means that <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> measures can only be exploited for portfolio optimization if positive (negative) sentiment leads to a negative (positive) value in the pick matrix. This approach is consistent with the previous findings in <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> literature and its results seem very sound.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{empirical}}ly tests <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> and “noise ” {{effects in}} Singapore REITs (S-REIT) over the periods from January 2005 to December 2010. Our empirical {{results show that}} trading volume is significantly and negatively correlated with price to net asset value (P/NAV) premiums in the contemporary term. However, lagged trading volume is found to have positive effects on P/NAV premiums, which imply that herd activities of uninformed investors in the last period drive up REIT stock prices. The finding supports <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> hypothesis, but rejects the fundamental argument on P/NAV deviations. We find that <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> effects are asymmetric. <b>The</b> <b>sentiment</b> effects are not observed in the “hot ” markets during the pre-subprime crisis periods. However, the negative relations between trading volume and P/NAV premiums disappear in the post-crisis periods in 2008...|$|R

30|$|For {{the sake}} of better comparability, a {{normalization}} ratio is computed: PM_sent/PM_best, with PM_sent {{the value of the}} performance measure of <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy and PM_best its value for the best performing strategy. The ratio takes the value 1 if <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy is <b>the</b> best performing strategy for the respective performance measure and lag τ. For medium-term lags, starting at about 6  months, <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy always outperforms the best benchmark strategy in terms of annualized return, Sharpe ratio, Omega ratio, and CER. For shorter lags, the ratio is usually unity. However, {{it should be noted that}} the absolute differences between the Sharpe ratios of <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> strategy and <b>the</b> second best strategy are small for lags smaller than 6  months. 14 Furthermore, in the training period, ratios are clearly smaller than 1 for short lags (see, e.g., subfigure (a) of Fig. 10). Therefore, a clear pattern of <b>the</b> negative <b>sentiment</b> of sentiment is observable only in the medium term.|$|R

25|$|Mental {{prayer was}} defined by Fr. John Hardon in his Modern Catholic Dictionary {{as a form of}} prayer in which <b>the</b> <b>sentiments</b> {{expressed}} are one's own and not those of another person. Mental prayer is a form of prayer whereby one loves God through dialogue with him, meditating on his words, and contemplating him. It is a time of silence focused on God and one's relationship with him. It is distinguished from vocal prayers which use set prayers, although mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. Mental prayer can be divided into meditation, or active mental prayer; and contemplation, passive mental prayer.|$|E
30|$|Different topics convey {{different}} sentiment. Sentiment {{analysis can}} be applied to uncover the attitude of different communities toward various issues. We have already applied <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> analysis to various domains, such as: (i) to compare <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> leaning of different network communities towards various environmental topics (Sluban et al. 2015), (ii) to study the emotional dynamics of Facebook comments on conspiracy theories (Zollo et al. 2015), (iii) to analyze the effects of Twitter sentiment on stock prices (Ranco et al. 2015), (iv) to monitor <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> about political parties before and after the elections (Smailović et al. 2015), and (v) to rank the widely used emojis by sentiment (Kralj Novak et al. 2015).

40|$|Abstract. Supervised {{methods of}} {{sentiment}} orientation analysis have got {{more and more}} attention for which don’t require labeled corpus and can be applied to different domains. However, traditional methods mostly consider single words which ignore the dependencies between the words of each other. To solve the problem, this paper presents an unsupervised method for sentiment orientation analysis on micro-blog based on dependency parsing and HDP model. Firstly, this method uses dependency parsing to filter the words in the corpus. Secondly, the HDP model is used to mine the implicit topics in the document. Then, a sentiment dictionary is used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> distributions of <b>the</b> topics. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> orientation of <b>the</b> whole micro-blog is obtained on the basis of <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> distributions of <b>the</b> topics. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively identify <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> orientation of micro-blog...|$|R
