6000|$|Most of {{the spectators}} were too {{attentive}} to the play to have many thoughts for each other; but before long I noticed a lady who evidently had an eye for her neighbours {{as well as for}} the table. She was seated about half-way between my friend and me, and I presently observed that she was trying to catch his eye. Though at Homburg, as people said, [...] "one could never be sure," [...] I yet doubted whether this lady were one of those whose especial vocation it was to catch a gentleman's eye. She was youthful rather than elderly, and pretty rather than plain; indeed, a few minutes later, when I saw her smile, I thought her wonderfully pretty. She had a charming gray eye and a good deal of yellow hair disposed in picturesque disorder; and though her features were meagre and her complexion faded, she gave one a sense of sentimental, artificial gracefulness. She was dressed in white muslin very much puffed and filled, but a trifle the worse for wear, relieved here and there by a pale blue ribbon. I used to flatter myself on guessing at people's nationality by their faces, and, as a rule, I guessed aright. This faded, crumpled, vaporous beauty, I conceived, was a German--such a German, somehow, as I had seen imagined in literature. Was she not a friend of poets, a correspondent of philosophers, a muse, a priestess of aesthetics--something in the way of a Bettina, a Rahel? My conjectures, however, were speedily merged in wonderment as to what my diffident friend was making of her. She caught his eye at last, and raising an ungloved hand, covered altogether with blue-gemmed rings--turquoises, sapphires, and lapis--she beckoned him to come to her. The gesture was executed with a sort of practised coolness, and accompanied with an appealing smile. He stared a moment, rather blankly, unable to suppose that the invitation was addressed to him; then, as it was immediately repeated with a good deal of intensity, he blushed to the roots of his hair, wavered awkwardly, and at last made his way to the lady's chair. By the time he reached it he was crimson, and wiping his forehead with his pocket-handkerchief. She tilted back, looked up at him with the same smile, laid two fingers on his sleeve, and said something, interrogatively, to which he replied by a shake of the head. She was asking him, evidently, if he had ever played, and he was saying no. Old players have a fancy that when luck has turned her back on them they can put her into good-humour again by having their stakes placed by a novice. Our young man's physiognomy had seemed to his new acquaintance to express the perfection of inexperience, and, like a practical woman, she had determined to make him serve her <b>turn.</b> <b>Unlike</b> most of her neighbours, she had no little pile of gold before her, but she drew from her pocket a double napoleon, put it into his hand, and bade him place it on a number of his own choosing. He was evidently filled with a sort of delightful trouble; he enjoyed the adventure, but he shrank from the hazard. I would have staked the coin on its being his companion's last; for although she still smiled intently as she watched his hesitation, there was anything but indifference in her pale, pretty face. Suddenly, in desperation, he reached over and laid the piece on the table. My attention was diverted at this moment by my having to make way for a lady with a great many flounces, before me, to give up her chair to a rustling friend to whom she had promised it; when I again looked across at the lady in white muslin, she was drawing in a very goodly pile of gold with her little blue-gemmed claw. Good luck and bad, at the Homburg tables, were equally undemonstrative, and this happy adventuress rewarded her young friend for the sacrifice of his innocence with a single, rapid, upward smile. He had innocence enough left, however, to look round the table with a gleeful, conscious laugh, in the midst of which his eyes encountered my own. Then suddenly the familiar look which had vanished from his face flickered up unmistakably; it was the boyish laugh of a boyhood's friend. Stupid fellow that I was, I had been looking at Eugene Pickering! ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} enhancement effect of the low viscosity cutting fluid enriched with nano-droplets (NDCF) in ultra-precision <b>turning.</b> <b>Unlike</b> the conventional method in which the enhancement is done by adding nano-metric particles, no suspension particles are mixed to produce the NDCF in this paper. Instead, the NDCFs are produced by atomisation of the cutting fluid that circulates in a closed-loop treatment device. The atomisation process is found to reduce the viscosity of the NDCF significantly by the formation of nano-droplets (NDs). The reduced viscosity of the NDCFs could be increased by diluting them with water. The bench tests on wetting properties reveal that the NDCF demonstrates two distinct properties: a very linear spreading rate and a relatively low contact angle. These two properties assist the NDCF in penetrating deeper into the tool-chip and tool-work interfaces and hence provides a better lubrication effect at these interfaces. In this paper, the ultra-precision cylindrical turning experiments reveal that the droplet size of the NDCF is a more important factor than viscosity on affecting the surface finish in ultra-precision machining.

No research exists on children’s interpretations of what might have happened from one opening to next, yet this activity is important because children must fill in the natural gaps created by the page breaks to make meaning and to construct a continuous narrative. During a series of readalouds of five picturebooks, the classroom teacher asked the students to speculate on what might have happened “between ” the pages. Findings based on qualitative content analysis suggest that, with relatively little teacher direction, there were at least seven ways young children responded {{to the question of what}} happens in this liminal space: (1) speculating on actions the characters might have performed...|$|R

5000|$|Whenever a card in play is {{activated}} or otherwise used, such as resources, it {{is referred to}} as [...] "tapped" [...] and is generally unavailable for further use until the next <b>turn.</b> <b>Unlike</b> Magic, however, characters can attack and defend in the same turn, unless they are [...] "stunned" [...] in combat. Damage is calculated by adding the difference between an attacking character's attack and the defending character's defense, plus the resource cost of the card. Any damage not absorbed by a defending character is applied to the player's life total. [...] The location of a card on the playing field can affect its statistics; in order to attack, characters further away from the opponent must possess a projectile weapon or the ability to fly, for instance. [...] Adjacent characters with a matching team affiliation within the Marvel universe can also reinforce one another's attack and defense, such as the Spider Friends and X-Men.

5000|$|Once {{seated in}} the [...] "logs", riders are taken up a {{conveyor}} belt lift hill. Part of the hill loops underneath of {{another part of the}} ride.

When passing by treetops, the chute the ride is in expands (although rails keep the log on-track) to give the illusion the log is in a pond. A small conveyor belt then brings the log up a few feet to avoid log collisions, and takes a steep, tall drop. Next, due to the backfiring currents of the previous drop, rapids form. After passing more rails, the log takes a small turn and near a sawmill narrowly dodged by the nearby Alpengeist roller coaster. A safety recording is played in the sawmill, warning riders to [...] "remain seated". Once in the sawmill, another small conveyor belt takes the logs up a few feet to, again, avoid collisions. The log then takes its largest, most notable plunge over a large pool of water. A last, small hill drains excess water from the ride's chute and takes the logs on a sharp turn extremely close to Alpengeist's track. A pendulum is used on high-business days to separate logs into to different waiting lines, and brings riders back to the boarding cabin.|$|E
25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure.

I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings.

50|$|Players {{then proceed}} to {{alternate}} turns. At {{the start of}} each turn, all empty mana crystals for a player are refilled and they gain a new filled mana crystal, up to a maximum of ten. If a card with an Overload keyword is played, this will limit the number of available mana crystals during the following turn. The player then is required to draw a card from their deck; if they have run out of cards, their hero takes an increasing amount of damage on each successive draw, called Fatigue. During their turn, each player may choose to play any of their cards, use their hero power, and direct attacks against the opposing hero and their minions. Nearly all cards and hero powers cost a number of mana points, and the player must have at least that many filled mana crystals to perform that action, which then drains those crystals until their next <b>turn.</b> <b>Unlike</b> card games like Magic: The Gathering, the opposing player has no means to interrupt or counter the current player's action during their turns, though some card effects can be triggered by the other player's actions and are automatically handled by the game. Each player's turn is limited by a timer, pausing only during card animations; the player is warned when this countdown is nearly over by displaying a burning rope. If the countdown ends before they complete their turn, they forgo any further actions and their turn ends. Players can end their turn at any time before this, and the game will indicate to the player when they have exhausted all possible actions for a turn to allow them to end it early.|$|E

The properties of work material significantly affect the cutting force generated during turning process. Commercially available metal rods are inhomogeneous and hence, qualifying the right material is very crucial in micro <b>turning.</b> <b>Unlike</b> plates, the properties like grain size and density vary significantly at different locations of the round bars. Hence, it is found very important to systematically find right material for micro turning from the commercially available rods. In present study, an attempt has been made to study the grain size and density of blank material from different locations of a larger diameter shaft. The work material selected is a 32 mm diameter shaft of commercial brass, a non ferrous alloy of copper and zinc. Five samples from different radial locations are cut from this shaft. It is found that grains are coarser at centre and finer towards the periphery of the shaft. Further, local density is less at centre and high at periphery of the shaft...|$|R
