40|$|As solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are highly {{nonlinear}} systems, a single linear controller cannot perform satisfactorily {{over a wide}} range of operating conditions of the processes. This work studies multilinear-model predictive control of a tubular SOFC. <b>The</b> objective is <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> cell <b>outlet</b> voltage {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions by manipulating inlet fuel pressure (flow rate). A first-principles model of an ammonia fed-tubular solid oxide fuel cell is used for the controller design. The model accounts for diffusion, inherent impedance, transport (momentum, heat and mass transfer), electrochemical reactions, activation and concentration polarizations, and the ammonia decomposition reaction. The servo and regulatory performances of the multimodel predictive controller (MMPC) are compared with those of a single-model predictive controller (SMPC) and a proportional-integral (PI) controller. For small load changes, the MMPC, SMPC, and PI controller all provide zero offset, and the MMPC yields the best closed-loop performance. However, for large load changes, the SMPC and PI controller fail to provide zero offset; under these two controllers the closed-loop system with the large load changes is unstable...|$|R

40|$|The {{changes in}} the anode and cathode {{potentials}} of a phosphoric acid fuel cell under various conditions were studied using a single cell equipped with four reversible hydrogen electrodes located near the inlets and outlets. When pure hydro-gen gas {{was used as a}} <b>fuel,</b> <b>the</b> polarizations under load were homogeneous in the plane of the cell. However, when the re-formate gas was used, inhomogeneity in the plane arose under load. The cathode and anode potentials hifted in the posi-tive direction at <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> area. <b>The</b> potential shifts increased with an increase of fuel utilization or due <b>to</b> CO poisoning. <b>The</b> voltage loss due to CO poisoning (CO loss) caused an increase not only of the anode polarization but also of the cathode polarization in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet area. <b>The</b> increase of cathode polarization at <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet area was due to current convergence into <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet area. <b>The</b> potential shifts at <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> can be attributed to he acidity change of electro-lyte there. The local acidity change of electrolyte can arise from a local starvation of hydrogen and hence of protons. Half-cell investigations have been conducted to evaluate overpotentials of the electrodes in a phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC). For example, Appleby et al. (1 - 3) and Kunz et al.

40|$|High {{performance}} aircraft typically use hydrocarbon <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> regeneratively cool <b>the</b> airframe {{and engine}} components. As the coolant temperatures increase, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> may react with dissolved oxygen forming deposits that limit the regenerative cooling system performance. This study investigates the deposition of Jet A using a thermal stability experiment and {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling. The experimental portion {{of this study is}} performed with a high Reynolds number thermal stability (HiRets) tester in which fuel passes though an electrically heated tube and <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature is held constant. If the thermal stability temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is exceeded, deposits form and adhere <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inside of the tube creating an insulating layer between the tube and <b>the</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> HiRets tester measures the tube outer wall temperatures near <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>to</b> report <b>the</b> effect of deposition occurring inside the tube. Final deposits are also estimated with a carbon burn off analysis. The CFD model was developed and used <b>to</b> simulate <b>the</b> fluid dynamics, heat transfer, chemistry, and transport of the deposit precursors. The model is calibrated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experiment temperature results and carbon burn-off deposition results.

50|$|There {{are other}} ways of {{controlling}} fuel flow for example with the dash-pot throttle lever. The throttle has a gear which meshes with the control valve (like a rack and pinion) causing it to slide along a cylinder which has ports at various positions. Moving the throttle and hence sliding the valve along the cylinder, opens and closes these ports as designed. There are actually 2 valves viz. the throttle and the control valve. The control valve is used to control pressure {{on one side of}} the throttle valve such that it gives <b>the</b> right opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throttle control pressure. It does this by controlling <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> from within <b>the</b> cylinder.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> APU, a <b>fuel</b> pump boosted <b>the</b> {{hydrazine}} {{pressure and}} fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox. The waste gas, now cooler and at low pressure, was passed {{back over the}} gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard. The gearbox drove <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump, its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump <b>outlet</b> pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> was supplied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump.|$|R
500|$|The use of {{carburettors}} {{was calculated}} {{to give a}} higher specific power output, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's float controlled carburettor meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been {{forced out of the}} carburettor's float chamber by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> supply line <b>to</b> restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in <b>the</b> float chamber <b>to</b> contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>outlet</b> from <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> S.U. carburettor <b>to</b> exactly halfway up the side, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> flow equally well under negative or positive g.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the formation of one- and two-ring aromatic species in near atmospheric-pressure opposed-flow diffusion flames of 1, 3 -butadiene (1, 3 -CH).
