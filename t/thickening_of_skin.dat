5000|$|Amphibians {{infected}} with B. dendrobatidis {{have been known}} to show many different clinical signs. Perhaps the earliest sign of infection is anorexia, occurring as quickly as 8 days after being exposed [...] Individuals infected are also commonly found in a lethargic state, characterized by slow movements, and refuse to move when stimulated. Excessive shedding of skin is seen in most frog species affected by B. dendrobatidis. These pieces of shed skin are described as opaque, gray-white, and tan. Some of these patches of skin are also found adhered to the skin of the amphibians. These signs of infection are often seen 12-15 days following exposure. The most typical symptom of chytridiomycosis is <b>thickening</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin,</b> which promptly leads to the death of the infected individuals because those individuals cannot take in the proper nutrients, release toxins, or, in some cases, breathe. Other common signs are reddening of the skin, convulsions, and a loss of righting reflex [...] In tadpoles B. dendrobatidis affects the mouthparts, where keratin is present, leading to abnormal feeding behaviors or discoloration of the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Congenital {{generalized}} lipodystrophy (CGL) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder which manifests with insulin resistance, absence of subcutaneous fat and muscular hypertrophy. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in four genes {{are associated with the}} four subtypes of CGL. The condition appears in early childhood with accelerated linear growth, quick aging of bones, and a large appetite. As the child grows up, acanthosis nigricans (hyperpigmentation and <b>thickening</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin)</b> will begin to present itself throughout the body - mainly in the neck, trunk, and groin. The disorder also has characteristic features like hepatomegaly or an enlarged liver which arises from fatty liver and may lead to cirrhosis, muscle hypertrophy, lack of adipose tissue, splenomegaly, hirsutism (excessive hairiness) and hypertriglyceridemia. Fatty liver and muscle hypertrophy arise from the fact that lipids are instead stored in these areas; whereas in a healthy individual, lipids are distributed more uniformly throughout the body subcutaneously. The absence of adipose tissue where they normally occur causes the body to store fat in the remaining areas. Common cardiovascular problems related to this syndrome are cardiac hypertrophy and arterial hypertension (high blood pressure). This disorder can also cause metabolic syndrome. Most with the disorder also have a prominent umbilicus or umbilical hernia. Commonly, patients will also have acromegaly with enlargement of the hands, feet, and jaw. After puberty, additional symptoms can develop. In women, clitoromegaly and polycystic ovary syndrome can develop. This impairs fertility for women, and only a few documented cases of successful pregnancies in women with CGL exist. However, the fertility of men with the disorder is unaffected.|$|E

Case History A 39 -year old Malay male presented {{with a history of}} photosensitivity following exposure to sunlight. The skin became itchy for about 20 minutes and was followed by blister formation. The affected skin subsequently showed signs of peeling off.

40|$|We report here a novel {{role for}} Jun dimerization protein- 2 (JDP 2) as a {{regulator}} of {{the progression of}} normal cells through the cell cycle. To determine the role of JDP 2 in vivo, we generated Jdp 2 -knockout (Jdp 2 KO) mice by targeting exon- 1 to disrupt the site of initiation of transcription. The epidermal <b>thickening</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> from the Jdp 2 KO mice after treatment with 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA) proceeded more rapidly than that of control mice, and more proliferating cells were found at the epidermis. Fibroblasts derived from embryos of Jdp 2 KO mice proliferated faster and formed more colonies than fibroblasts from wild-type mice. JDP 2 was recruited to the promoter of the gene for cyclin-A 2 (ccna 2) at the AP- 1 site. Cells lacking Jdp 2 had elevated levels of cyclin-A 2 mRNA. Furthermore, reintroduction of JDP 2 resulted in the repression of transcription of ccna 2 and of cell-cycle progression. Thus, transcription of the gene for cyclin-A 2 {{appears to be a}} direct target of JDP 2 in the suppression of cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|Background Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a skin {{condition}} characterized by darkening and <b>thickening</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin.</b> AN {{has been reported}} to be linked to insulin resistance (IR), that associated with type 2 diabetes, in obese children in many country. Objective To determine the relation between acanthosis nigricans and insulin resistance in obese children. Methods We conducted a cross sectional study in Wenang District, Manado, from October 2009 until January 2010. We examined 54 obese children aged 10 - 14  years for insulin resistance using Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR). We analyzed the results byT-test and phi coefficient correlation. The value of P<O. 05 was significant in statistical analysis. Results Acanthosis nigricans was positive in 33 children. Insulin resistance was found in 34 from 54 subjects, 28 of them has AN and 6 has no AN. Obese children with AN had higher HOMA-IR than children without AN. Presence of AN was associated with IR (P<O. OOl, r= 0. 57). Conclusions There is a weak correlation between AN and IR in obese children. It is important to identify obese children with IR for early intervention and prevention of type   2 diabetes, but AN could not be a reliable marker of IR...|$|E
