5|$|In the empire, Frederick {{faced the}} {{opposition}} of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been in conflict with <b>the</b> <b>Swiss</b> Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, <b>the</b> <b>Swiss</b> had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with <b>the</b> <b>Swiss</b> in the War of Waldshut, which he could end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against <b>the</b> <b>Swiss,</b> and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, <b>the</b> <b>Swiss</b> and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold.|$|E

5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. <b>The</b> <b>Swiss</b> Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; <b>the</b> <b>Swiss</b> peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, <b>the</b> <b>Swiss</b> exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Basel had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war.

On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and <b>the</b> <b>Swiss</b> cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501.|$|E
