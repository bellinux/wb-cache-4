5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable to {{conceive}} children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not the biological father of her baby.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the alien {{substance}} Terrigen was released into the ecosystem, Joey Gutierrez developed metal-melting abilities. Unable to control this power, Gutierrez is confronted in the streets by soldiers {{who are willing to}} use lethal force to detain him. Gutierrez is saved by S.H.I.E.L.D., and Inhuman agent Daisy Johnson attempts to explain <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is also an Inhuman, with a dormant gene within him that was activated by the Terrigen. Struggling to help Gutierrez accept what has happened to him, Johnson seeks the help of Lincoln Campbell, the Inhuman who helped her transition but has now renounced the ways of the Inhumans, wishing to live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|There are {{variants}} {{within this}} tradition. Some versions give {{the credit for}} finding the child to Queen Kirupanci of Chandragiri. Others omit mention of the king of Chandragiri altogether, and omit reference to the Koovagam temple. Instead they focus on the demon Kuttacuran and an apparently impossible boon granted <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will be killed by a person having only a head and who was born from water. Vishnu, incarnated as Krishna, informs the gods that Aravan will kill this demon. With this in mind, the head of Aravan is consigned {{to the river and}} is transformed into a child called Kuttan ("born from water"), who kills the demon.|$|E
6000|$|... [Pleasantly.] You've been so very friendly, haven't you? If you {{suggested}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> ... <b>he's</b> standing in Henry's way....|$|R
6000|$|... "Afore people ’ad done {{talking about}} Bill, I’m blest if Peter Smith didn’t go and {{cultivate}} ’is garden {{in exactly the}} same way. The parson and ’is wife was away on their ’oliday, and nobody could say a word. The curate who ’ad come over to take ’is place for a time, and who took the names of people for the Flower Show, did point out <b>to</b> <b>’im</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was spoiling ’is chances, but Peter was so rude <b>to</b> <b>’im</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn’t stay long enough to say much.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to suggest," [...] the doctor said, [...] "that one of us puts it delicately <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a {{considerable}} expense to you. It needs something like <b>that</b> <b>to</b> stir <b>him</b> up. <b>He</b> could put on his hat and {{walk out of the}} place to-morrow if he liked." ...|$|R
5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was the son of}} Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the Spindly Torque {{to mount an}} assault on Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who pulls out a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus as he watches the Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, and bleeding heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the Resistance to fire the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E

60|$|Here Jennie gently touched Rollo again, <b>to</b> remind <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not <b>to</b> talk.|$|R
60|$|GERALD. I {{have written}} to Lord Illingworth <b>to</b> tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must marry you.|$|R
5|$|Though Taylor's {{friendship}} and partnership with Clough had been strong, their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion. While at Derby in 1971, Taylor was riled {{when he learned}} that Clough had failed to disclose <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had received a pay rise of £5,000 from chairman Sam Longson. He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do a larger share of the work with the players. The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough, by Taylor, an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor's work with Clough. Taylor had not told Clough that he was writing the book and did not give him a share of the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch {{maintained}} a 1.4 second lead over Kurt Busch by the 249th lap. Three laps later, Keselowski {{drove out of}} his garage to rejoin the race. By lap 262, drivers reported their cars were sliding in the corners as their tires became worn. Green flag pit stops began on lap 265; Kyle Busch maintained the lead {{at the end of}} the cycle, ahead of Reutimann and Kenseth. On the 290th lap, Kurt Busch's crew reported <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was running two laps short of fuel. Six laps later, Kyle Busch started to slow in the corners to conserve fuel. On the 298th lap, Martin dropped one position to run fifth. By the 302nd lap, overall speeds had dropped due to drivers starting to conserve fuel. Green flag pit stops began on lap 311, as Truex made a stop for fuel. Kyle Busch elected not to make a pit stop and increased his lead to four seconds by lap 314. Eight laps later, Kyle Busch was told by his team to reduce his speed. On lap 330, Kyle Busch drove to pit road, having run out of fuel, handing the lead to Kurt Busch. One lap later, Ambrose ran out of fuel, as Kurt Busch held the lead to win his second race of the 2009 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Kenseth in third, Martin in fourth, and Harvick in fifth. Stewart, Bowyer, Biffle, Burton and A. J. Allmendinger rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E
25|$|Hearing this, Görgei sent colonel András Gáspár with a {{division}} to, commanding <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must defend Hort with any cost.|$|E
60|$|She still clung <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> craving so <b>to</b> have <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{could not}} be reft away.|$|R
60|$|I ventured <b>to</b> remind <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might speak <b>to</b> Helena {{as well as}} to myself.|$|R
60|$|She {{had turned}} her {{shoulder}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should {{not see her}} face.|$|R
25|$|According to the {{historian}} Fred Prieberg, {{by the end}} of 1937 nobody who was correctly informed could accuse Furtwängler of working for the Nazis. For the Nazi leadership, especially for Hitler, it became necessary to prove <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not irreplaceable.|$|E
25|$|Gough – whom Haig {{had been}} subject to {{a great deal of}} {{political}} pressure to sack - dined with Haig on evening of 15 March. There is no indication that he was crying out for reinforcements. Gough later wrote in his memoirs that Haig had explained <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was concentrating on holding the Channel Ports.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July the King met Badoglio – {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had declared to friends that he would organize a putsch {{with or without the}} King – and informed him that he would be the new head of government. Victor Emmanuel explained <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was totally against a political government, and that in the first phase he should not seek an armistice.|$|E
50|$|Turk {{minister}} Ahmad Fanakati {{was jealous}} with Bayan's success and tried <b>to</b> calumniate <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> plundered Chinese commoners.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{started to}} p'int out {{one or two}} things <b>to</b> <b>'im</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> seemed <b>to</b> 'ave forgot, but 'e wouldn't listen. He was so excited <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't seem to know wot 'e was doing, and arter he 'ad got three more 'arf-pints waiting for me, all in a row on the counter, I 'ad <b>to</b> ask <b>'im</b> whether he thought I was there to do conjuring tricks, or wot?' ...|$|R
50|$|When he gets back, Jesse {{mentions}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> {{also heard}} <b>that</b> {{the nearby town}} of Horse Creek may offer the chief the job of Sheriff. They go to meet Ralph <b>to</b> inform <b>him</b> about the death and later they attend Janet's funeral. Later, the chief is eating dinner with his girlfriend and her kids at a restaurant, and another police officer comes over <b>to</b> inform <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Ralph has died.|$|R
25|$|Jean, {{the eldest}} child, was educated at the collège (grammar school) of Château-Thierry, {{and at the}} end of his school days he entered the Oratory in May 1641, and the seminary of Saint-Magloire in October of the same year; but a very short sojourn proved <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had mistaken his vocation. He then {{apparently}} studied law, and is said to have been admitted as avocat/lawyer.|$|E
25|$|Wayland {{asked his}} brother to collect feathers, with which he made himself wings. He flew to Niðung and {{revealed}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had killed his sons and made his daughter pregnant. He then flew away. Egill was ordered by the king to shoot him down. But Wayland had tied a bladder filled with blood under his arm. Egill hit it, thus deceiving the king, and Wayland returned to Zealand.|$|E
25|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} defeat, Xerxes {{presented}} Artemisia with two possible {{courses of action}} and asked her which she recommended. Either he would lead troops to the Peloponnese himself, or he would withdraw from Greece and leave his general Mardonius in charge. Artemisia suggested <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should retreat back to Asia Minor and she advocated the plan suggested by Mardonius, who requested 300,000 Persian soldiers with which he would defeat the Greeks in Xerxes' absence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Göring's statement, a joint Admiralty-Foreign Office note {{was sent to}} Henderson <b>to</b> inform <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should inform the Germans: ...|$|R

25|$|Some {{classical}} rabbinical sources {{argue that}} Joseph identified himself for other reasons. In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on {{the memory of}} Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph was so important <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had named his sons in Joseph's honour. These sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was {{no longer able to}} pretend to be a stranger.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Angelica informs Concetta that an {{old friend}} is coming to call. Senator Tassoni is a veteran of Garibaldi's Redshirts, a close friend and confidant of Tancredi, and former illicit lover of Angelica. Tassoni is shown in, and after {{speaking}} flatteringly of how well Tancredi spoke of her, confesses to Concetta that one night Tancredi tearfully confessed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had once told a lie to her, namely {{the story about the}} Redshirts' raid on a convent. Tassoni adds that Tancredi had carried the guilt of offending her with him all his life.|$|E
25|$|The two princes meet Satoko at the Imperial Theatre in Tokyo. She is courteous, and Kiyoaki {{concludes that}} she has burnt the letter. Chapter 9 portrays Shigeyuki Iinuma, a reactionary 23-year-old from Kagoshima, who has been Kiyoaki's tutor {{for the last six}} years. He bemoans his ineffectiveness, and the decadent state of Japan, while worshipping at the Matsugae family's shrine. Shortly after the new year, Kiyoaki reveals <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows of his affair with a maid, Miné, and blackmails him into concealing his own trysts with Satoko. Satoko's maid, old Tadeshina, {{promises}} to help.|$|E
60|$|It {{was painful}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> realise <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{returning}} to wealth and luxury, indeed, monopolising it,-—he the helpless, undeserving, indolent son, while all the others, and especially his mother, were left to poverty.|$|R
50|$|Stephen Glennard betrays {{a former}} love, selling her letters <b>to</b> <b>him</b> so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may {{raise the money}} to marry his {{beautiful}} fiancee.|$|R
