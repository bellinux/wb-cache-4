In California, <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> lost both games in a two-game series against the Fresno Monsters and in Washington <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> lost two of three against the Wenatchee Wild.|$|E
5|$|Back in Dawson Creek in November, <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> split {{a three-game}} {{series against the}} Monsters, 1-1-1, and won both games against the Chicago Hitmen. Following another 6-game road trip to Alaska, <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> {{continued}} into December winning approximately one-in-three games, with an 11-22-2 record near the mid-season break, when they traded their 20-year-old captain, Blaine Bokenfohr, to the Merritt Centennials in exchange for future considerations. Scott Fellnermayr became the new captain of <b>the</b> <b>Rage,</b> and would remain the captain {{for the remainder of}} the season and the next. In January, <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> split two-game series against the Wild and split another in Chicago. The team put together a six-game winning streak in January–February, winning games against the Brown Bears and the Avalanche before splitting a two-game series with the Monsters. On their next road trip, they lost their two games against the Wild and won the next three against the Monsters. The season ended in early March with Rage in fifth place with a 24-31-3 record, in the six-team West division.|$|E

5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> meter in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, replenish <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> meter instead of red orbs; <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> {{played in}} the 4,500 seat EnCana Events Centre where their first win came on September 24, 2010, against the Alaska Avalanche. Their final home game was a loss to the Wenatchee Wild in March 2012. The team's name and symbol was {{intended}} to represent an outward expression of passion and internal desire to dominate other teams. <b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> players, all aged between 15 and 20 years old in accordance with league rules, were active with charities and within the community. Prior to the team's formation, the ownership group attempted to establish the team in the British Columbia Hockey League but were refused with the league citing {{the lack of a}} competitive base for a northern division. The group also attempted to establish the team in the Alberta Junior Hockey League but that league was not interested in expanding or re-locating teams at that time. Another unsuccessful attempt at moving the team to either of those league was made before their dissolution.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the game}} world, the player finds chests colored green, blue, or red, and each chest {{contains}} orbs of the corresponding color. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic—allowing new, more powerful attacks—and replenishing <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> meter, which, if full, {{allows for the}} usage of <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> of the Gods ability. Red orbs are also collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. The player can also find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers in unmarked chests. The Eyes and Feathers increase {{the length of the}} Health and Magic Meters, respectively; finding eighteen of an item maximizes a meter and in turn, the player's power.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Raging</b> Bull has a ported {{barrel and}} a red rubber strip {{along the back of}} its grip (in some {{variants}} such as <b>the</b> <b>Raging</b> Hornet, this strip is yellow), which cushions the shooter's hand and lowers perceived recoil. Functionally, <b>the</b> <b>Raging</b> Bull has a manually operated front cylinder latch, whose release can be seen on the crane. Front cylinder latches are required for such high-powered double-action revolvers, and are found on the Ruger Super Redhawk and the S&W Model 500 revolver, but they are actuated by the rear cylinder latch. The manually operated latch on <b>the</b> <b>Raging</b> Bull is simpler (and thus less expensive to produce) yet equally strong, but requires two hands to open the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Karakuri Giant Gaingain (42-43): A {{blue and}} silver mecha created by Sargain using the Shinobi Medal Set system he had scanned from Megatagame Mark III. With {{the data that}} Sargain {{collected}} he manages to unlock <b>the</b> <b>Raging</b> Arrow making <b>the</b> mecha powerful enough to defeat Tenrai Senpuujin and Revolver Mammoth singlehandedly. It attacks with Bullet Punch, Dark Ultimate Secret Rock Slash, and Angry Black Break (with <b>the</b> <b>Raging</b> Arrow). Deciding to search out the Sadness Bow Sargain has Gaingain use <b>the</b> <b>Raging</b> Arrow to force the ninja out once more battling Tenrai Senpuujin until the ninja form Revolver Tenrai Senpuujin.

5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. <b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. <b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> {{along with}} the Fresno Monsters, Wenatchee Wild, and Alaska Avalanche, all {{declared}} dormancy for various reasons, not committing to playing the next season; <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> were pursuing entry into the AJHL. As the season was ending, the other teams in the division came out of dormancy; the Wenatchee team had their BCHL move denied and the Fresno Monsters were able to secure a lease agreement for their arena. The bid by the DC Rage Society to move the team into the AJHL, by purchasing {{the rights to the}} St. Albert Steel, failed as the Steel were moved to Whitecourt. While the team was achieving the expected levels of corporate sponsorship and had an average attendance of 1,010 people (13th best in the league of 28 teams), the Rage's costs (especially the travel costs) were higher than expected. In the first week of April 2012, a final appeal by the DC Rage Society to the City of Dawson Creek to cover certain fees was denied and the society announced the team was ending operations.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. <b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E

Kratos encountered Prometheus near Typhon's lair. Prometheus was eventually freed by Kratos, died by self-immolation in fire, and his ashes empowered Kratos, giving him the ability called <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> of the Titans.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> Against God (subtitle in US editions: How Atheism Led Me to Faith) is {{the fifth}} book by Peter Hitchens, first {{published}} in 2010. The book describes Hitchens's journey from atheism, far-left politics, and bohemianism, to Christianity and conservatism, detailing the influences on him {{that led to his}} conversion. The book is partly intended as a response to God Is Not Great, a book written by his brother Christopher Hitchens in 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> {{began the}} 2011–12 {{season with the}} NAHL's Showcase Tournament in Michigan where they lost to the Corpus Christi Ice Rays and the Kalamazoo Jr. K-Wings but beat the Michigan Warriors, before ending with a loss to the Coulee Region Chill. They started with a 3–7 record, winning {{two out of three}} games against the Minot Minotauros but then losing two games against the Monsters in Fresno and two games against the Bismarck Bobcats in Dawson Creek. Trying to add scoring, they {{acquired}} Shawn Mueller from the Chilliwack Chiefs. They fell to 5-13-1 after splitting a series in Minot, losing in Bismarck, and splitting a series against the Alaska Avalanche back in Dawson Creek. Between mid-November and the mid-season break the team played a 12-game road trip, spending the first two weekends in Alaska and the next two in Wenatchee and Fresno, and entered the break last in their division with a 7-24-2 overall record. They acquired defenceman Zach Ovics from the Nanaimo Clippers and goalie Paul Bourbeau from the Kenai River Brown Bears. In a January–February 11 game homestand, <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> only won 2 games, falling to 9-32-3, as they lost three to the Wild (all shut outs), two each to the Monsters and the Ice Dogs, and split their series against the Avalanche and Brown Bears. The team's struggles continued, losing two games each to the Monsters and the Ice Dogs. Against the Wild, they lost all three games in their homestand which ended with brawl. They ended the season going 1–2 in both Kenai River and Wenatchee and splitting the series against the Alaska Avalanche, 1-1-1. They played their last home game in mid-March losing to the Wenatchee Wild and ending the game with brawl. <b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> ended their season with a road trip, losing both three-game series 2–1 in Kenai River and then Wenatchee.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rage</b> were {{operated}} by a Dawson Creek-based non-profit group, the DC Rage Society. They obtained over $200,000 each year in financial support from the City of Dawson Creek who wanted the team to help fill the schedule of their new 6,500-seat arena. Compared to other NAHL teams, <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> received above average fan support with over 1,000 people attending each game. With few of the players were native to the Peace Region, billet families housed team players {{while they were in}} town. The team participated in visits to local elementary schools, hosted meet-and-greets with community members, and fund-raised for the local branch of the Canadian Cancer Society and other charities. Likewise, the community supported the team by fund-raising for pay for general team activities and for a scholarship fund for players going onto university. In August 2011, the team took over hosting duties (from the city's minor hockey association) of Dawson Creek's annual week-long hockey camp in which 95 players attended, as well, in the same month, they hosted an open house for Dawson Creek community members meet the team.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge <b>the</b> <b>rage</b> and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E

5|$|Joe Law of GameFocus criticized <b>the</b> <b>Rage</b> Gage system, {{stating that}} it had been done better in other games. However he cited the game's overall length a good thing as he felt the game had no replay value. Nick Valentino of GameZone praised the game, calling it the best RPG {{to make use of the}} Dragon Ball label, and the game was the perfect {{introduction}} into the franchise. Mike Moehnke of RPGamer cited the games as not being perfect, but was superior to the Super Famicom game Legend of the Super Saiyan. Kat Bailey of 1UP.com felt the game was made with children in mind, stating that the vibrant colors and the fast-paced gameplay would keep kids interested in the game.|$|E
