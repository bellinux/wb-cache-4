This encourages a blurring of old and new firm identities, because sectoral power is increasingly necessary to secure cost recovery.

Interest in the shares was particularly strong {{because it was the}} only Australian <b>tech</b> <b>stock</b> floating that year with a track record of actual profitability. Demands for a prospectus were so high that complaints were aired in the media by members of the public unable to obtain one. The chief beneficiaries of the float were the clients of the underwriters, JB Were and CommSec, some of whom made massive stag profits when the stock peaked at $8.20 on the day of its float, compared with the IPO price of $2.20. In 2000 the Victorian Auditor-General held an investigation into whether the stock was undervalued by the underwriters when listed, but concluded that the float had been carried out properly.|$|R

This argument suggests that Mr. Greenspan sought to enlist banks to expand lending and debt to stimulate asset prices and that the Federal Reserve and US Treasury Department would back any losses that might result.

Empirical results obtained from seven US <b>tech</b> <b>stocks</b> indicate that simple resistant levels outperform saucers patterns. Furthermore, positive statistical significant excess returns are being generated only in first sub-periods of examination. These returns decline or even vanish as the experiment proceeds to recent years. Our findings are aligned with the results reported by various former studies.

Such bubbles most often accompany the arrival of some new technology, such as the <b>tech</b> <b>stock</b> boom and bust of the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. We provide a rational explanation for investment bubbles based on the dynamics of learning in highly uncertain environments. Objec-tive information about the earnings potential of a new technology gives rise to a set of priors, or a belief function. A generalised form of BayesRule is used to update this set of priors using earnings data from the new economy. In each period, agents who are heterogeneous in their tolerance for ambiguity make optimal occupa-tional choices, with wages in the new economy set to clear the labour market. A preponderance of bad news about the new technology may nevertheless give rise to increasing rm formation around this technology, at least initially.

40|$|The paper {{delivers}} {{an analysis}} of the “New Economy ” focussing on the roles of new business models, the capital market and venture capital. The capital market created a double standard in the 1990 s: A high return on capital was required from old economy firms whereas money was thrown at new economy firms which had a business idea that stimulated the fantasies of financial investors but no earnings. Through the gradual burst of the <b>tech</b> <b>stock</b> bubble since spring 2000 it has come to the eyes of the public that many new economy start ups were unable to recover their costs. This paper shows that business models related to the internet can only work under certain conditions. The sectoral distribution of power, for example, determines the prospects of the single firms to realise e-commerce in a profitable way. Digital technologies do not necessarily enhance profitability. On the contrary, they can increase competition and lead to lower profit rates. The limitation of competition appears to be a central condition of successful cost recovery. The venture capital cycle has been an important driving force of the new econom...|$|R
40|$|This paper initiates a study {{into the}} century-old issue of market {{predictability}} {{from the perspective}} of computational complexity. We develop a simple agent-based model for a stock market where the agents are traders equipped with simple trading strategies, and their trades together determine the stock prices. Computer simulations show that a basic case of this model is already capable of generating price graphs which are visually similar to the recent price movements of high <b>tech</b> <b>stocks.</b> In the general model, we prove that if there are a large number of traders but they employ {{a relatively small number of}} strategies, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm for predicting future price movements with high accuracy. On the other hand, if the number of strategies is large, market prediction becomes complete in two new computational complexity classes CPP and BCPP, where P NP[O(log n) ] ⊆ BCPP ⊆ CPP = PP. These computational completeness results open up a novel possibility that the price graph of a actual stock could be sufficiently deterministic for various prediction goals but appear random to all polynomial-time prediction algorithms. ...|$|E

The Iceberg-trader has {{the freedom to}} expose his trading intentions or (partially) shield the true order size against other market participants. Order exposure can cause drastic market reactions (“market impact”) in the end leading to higher transaction costs. On the other hand the Iceberg trader faces a loss-in-priority when he hides his intentions, as most electronic limit order books penalize the usage of hidden liquidity. Thus the Iceberg-trader is faced with the problem {{to find the right}} trade-off. Our model provides optimal exposure strategies for Iceberg traders in limit order book markets. In particular, we provide a range of analytical statements that are in line with recent empirical findings on the determinants of trader’s exposure strategies.

We find major differences between tech sector and non-tech sector analysts. In tech sector reputable analysts significantly outperform less reputable analysts both at the personal and institutional level using the Carhart 4 -factor model. In contrast, reputable analysts in non-tech sector significantly outperform less reputable analysts only at the institutional level, and for sell recommendations only. These results are robust to controlling for technology index returns, and in fact are strengthened by it.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} importance of stock options {{as a component}} of executive compensation, {{it is important to understand}} their effectiveness in aligning executive interests with those of shareholders and their function as a retention device. With the collapse of the <b>tech</b> <b>stock</b> bubble in the past three years, compensation committees of an increasing number of firms have repriced previously granted stock options downward. While many authors argue that downward repricing is essential to intentivize executives and to retain valuable managers, repricing also creates a potential disincentive to performance by granting the executive a potential windfall while the stock price plummets. Previous studies have been focusing on the underlying factors that determine the repricing decision, and less research has been addressing the consequences from this board action. This paper examines the effect of stock option repricing on executive turnover. Do firms that choose to reprice experience a relatively lower turnover rate among its top executives when compared to firms faced with circumstances in which repricing might be chosen, but chose not to? This paper is divided into six sections. Section 2 discusses the theoretical background and the existing literature on the topic. Section 3 outlines the conceptual model and discusses the ideal data. Section 4 describes the actual data, and develops the actual model. Section 5 shows the regression results and discusses the findings, and section 6 concludes...|$|R
40|$|By {{the late}} 1990 s, {{shareholder}} value was the explicit, new {{priority for the}} old corporations in the US and UK where the stock market had gained an unprecedented influence on the behaviour of giant corporations. The business press obsessively discussed which managements were, and were not, delivering value and all the major US consulting firms had moved into selling value metrics and implementation packages promising to solve this question. Over this decade, share prices rose unsteadily in a long bull market which ended in the <b>tech</b> <b>stock</b> crash of Spring 2000 which, one year later, {{had turned into a}} bear market in a slowing US economy. All this poses new questions about whats at stake in the capital market's pressure on corporations for increased returns; and what's behind higher share prices and their collapse? The intellectual responses widened the debate but has led to increasing conceptual confusion: the journalistic term "shareholder value" has passed into academic usage; while neologisms such as financialisation are used differently by various authors. Against this background, our paper aims to discuss the existing terms and main definitions and to argue for a redefinition of the problem around a new generic concept of coupon pool capitalism. After this, the paper presents a brief empirical analysis of the dynamics of the coupon pool in the USA and UK.

40|$|In {{the spring}} 2001, {{the world economy}} is in a {{delicate}} situation. The vigorous growth momentum that prevailed in the recovery in 1999 and into 2000 is clearly gone. In {{the second half of}} 2000, global growth decelerated rapidly. In contrast to the last downturn of the world economy in 1997 / 98, the deceleration originated in the industrial countries, where growth rates were more or less cut in half compared to {{the first half of the}} year and the OECD leading indicator declined rapidly (Figure 1. 1). Major factors behind the slowdown were lagged effects of monetary tightening and the pronounced and sustained rise in oil prices. It has to be noted, however, that the loss of momentum was substantially larger than expected by most forecasters, including the AIECE institutes in fall of last year, although oil prices behaved largely as expected. The deceleration of activity was particularly pronounced in the IT sector, and the substantial weakening of demand for electronics equipment and IT consumer goods went in tandem with a dramatic decline in the price of <b>tech</b> <b>stocks</b> on a global scale. Indications that the global economy is at the brink of recession are, however, not conclusive.

40|$|The NASDAQ {{composite}} {{reached its}} record close of 5048. 62 {{more than five}} years ago on March 10, 2000. Many commentators have marked this anniversary over the past few weeks. Indeed, the NASDAQ collapse, as we have noted in past missives, ranks among the biggest market drops in world history comparable to the Tulip Bulb mania in Holland, the South Sea Bubble in the UK, the NIKKEI collapse in Japan and countless others. Much of the discussion regarding this anniversary has centered around when, if ever, the NASDAQ will regain its exalted status. The punditocracy points out that the Dow took 25 years to recover to its pre-crash highs in 1929. Gold and the Nikkei are still well short of previous highs. Clearly the consensus holds {{that it will be a}} very long time before the NASDAQ reaches its former high water market. Given the size of the bubble, this conclusion is probably correct, but it misses a more important point: will <b>tech</b> <b>stocks</b> be an interesting investment from these levels? To repeat a point made in earlier publications, tech has one attribute that is likely to continue to drive value: Moore’s Law, the doubling of semiconductor processing power every 18 months. Productivity enhancements of this magnitude are near certain to drive value over time. The question, as always, is what reality is being discounted in the stocks. Our sense is that the next big NASDAQ market move will come when fear and loathing give way to complete disinterest and under ownership. In our view, we are not there yet.
