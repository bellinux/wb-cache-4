5000|$|Both Cato and Pliny have {{described}} <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> systems, in 200 BC {{and the first}} century AD, respectively. According to the Johnston Farm website, <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> was first introduced to the United States in 1838, when John Johnston brought the practice from his native Scotland to his farm in Seneca County, New York. Johnston labored to lay 72 mi worth of clay tile on 320 acre. The effort paid off by increasing his wheat yield from 12 bushels per acre to 60 bu/acre. Johnston, [...] "...father of <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> in America...", continued to advocate <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> throughout his life, attributing his success as a farmer to the formula [...] "D,C, and D" [...] (dung, credit, and drainage).|$|E

5000|$|In agriculture, <b>tile</b> <b>{{drainage}}</b> {{is a type}} of {{drainage system}} that removes excess water from soil below the surface. Whereas irrigation is the practice of adding additional water when the soil is naturally too dry, drainage brings soil moisture levels down for optimal crop growth. While surface water can be drained via pumping and/or open ditches, <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> is often the best recourse for subsurface water.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Corn Belt is {{underlain}} by extensive <b>drainage</b> <b>tile</b> {{lines to}} support agricultural production, which significantly altered regional hydrology and nutrient transport processes. In, many cases, {{records of the}} precise location of main <b>drainage</b> <b>tile</b> lines are unavailable and can only be approximated using geospatial analyses. Using high-resolution topographic data, we estimated locations of <b>drainage</b> <b>tile</b> systems and compared the estimates to locations based on digitized tile maps {{for a set of}} drainage districts in Boone County, Iowa. We estimated spatial correspondence by percent error between generated <b>drainage</b> <b>tile</b> lines and actual locations of drainage lines. Our analysis suggest that the estimated <b>drainage</b> <b>tile</b> systems are reasonable representations of recorded main drainage lines for the set of drainage districts. This method of approximating <b>drainage</b> <b>tile</b> line locations can assist in estimating <b>drainage</b> <b>tile</b> line systems that do not belong to drainage districts and contain no records...|$|R
30|$|A second {{finding of}} this study was that TD 4 {{performed}} differently compared to the other 3 TD sites. This result is generally attributed to its catchment area and nutrient supply. TD 4 has a larger catchment area than those of TD 1 –TD 3, which could be judged by their discharges (Fig.  2). For example, on 28 th March, the discharge of TD 4 was 17  L/s contributing 9.05 % of downstream river discharge, whereas the contribution of TD 1 to downstream river was only 0.069 % with a discharge of 0.071  L/s. <b>Tile</b> <b>drainages</b> with larger catchments have a greater physical habitat complexity. Therefore there is a higher possibility of gathering other sources of diatoms and being colonized from neighboring water bodies. Furthermore, there was a wastewater treatment plant discharging into TD 4, which provided major nutrient inputs (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) for diatom growth. This implied that spatial variations of <b>tile</b> <b>drainages</b> were remarkable and should be noted in further investigations, especially with respect to hydrograph separation.|$|R
50|$|Mollie's only {{manufacturing}} facility was a <b>tile</b> mill. <b>Drainage</b> <b>tiles</b> were important in Blackford County during the 19th century {{because of the}} original swampy condition of the land. The tile mill manufactured drain tile, building blocks, and bricks. At {{least one of the}} two houses still standing in the Mollie was built by using bricks from the local tile factory. Tile mill products could easily be shipped on the nearby railroad.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tile</b> <b>drainage</b> got {{its name}} from tiles made from fired clay (ceramic), similar to {{terracotta}} pipes but not necessarily in a pipe shape. In the 19th century a C-channel tile atop a flat tile (mug and sole, respectively) were often used. Today, however, <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> can be any system operating on the same principle, often with plastic tubing called [...] "tile line". Precast concrete and ceramic are still used as well.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, there aren't {{consistent}} yield {{results in}} the Northern Cornbelt states; however, there is still interest in deep tillage within the agriculture industry. In areas that are not well-drained, deep tillage {{may be used as}} an alternative to installing more expensive <b>tile</b> <b>drainage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Drainage tile {{sometimes}} decreases {{soil erosion}} and runoff of some nutrients, including phosphorus. Phosphorus {{is an important}} nutrient to control {{because it is the}} limiting nutrient in most aquatic ecosystems. Thus phosphorus is the main culprit in eutrophication of surface water; however, the other limiting nutrient, nitrogen, causes substantial damage to waters. For example, nitrogen has been implicated in the gulf hypoxia. Drainage tile sometimes increases water quality because the water flows into the ground then the tile, instead of running off the field into a ditch, carrying soil and nutrients with it. The soil has a chance to filter the water before it enters the streams and rivers. However, by bypassing surface improvements like conservation tillage or riparian buffers, <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> can also create problems with water quality [...] and outflow from <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> tends to be extremely high in nitrogen. Furthermore, some <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> sometime contains very high levels of other chemicals. Since surface forms of conservation agriculture are less effective in tile-drained systems, other practices such as controlled drainage or constructed wetlands may be more effective. In very flat areas, where the natural topography does not provide the gradient necessary for water flow, [...] "agricultural wells" [...] can be dug to provide tile lines sufficient outlet. In these cases, it is the groundwater that stands to be polluted by unfiltered tile output.|$|E

Dickey Clay Manufacturing Company which started out creating ceramic pipes made of [...] "burnt clay" [...] {{that were used}} to drain farmland via <b>tile</b> <b>drainage.</b> The company had large plants in Pittsburg, Kansas and Deepwater, Missouri and made a fortune providing pipes for buried conduit lines of Bell Telephone.|$|E
50|$|Intensive {{livestock}} operations (ILO)/concentrated {{animal feeding}} operations (CAFOs) {{have led to}} challenges of livestock effluent disposal. Livestock effluent contains valuable nutrients, but the misapplication of these materials can lead to serious ecological problems, such as nutrient loading. Injecting effluent directly into the ground is one method employed by manure applicators to improve nutrient uptake. <b>Drainage</b> <b>tiles</b> may increase injected manure seepage into surface waterways from manure injection because liquid manure seeps through soils and then drains {{out of the field}} and into waterways via <b>drainage</b> <b>tiles.</b>|$|R

50|$|Salinity is an {{important}} land degradation problem. Soil salinity can be reduced by leaching soluble salts out of soil with excess irrigation water. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing in combination with <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> or another form of subsurface drainage. A comprehensive treatment of soil salinity {{is available from the}} United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.|$|E
50|$|Soil {{moisture}} content {{is an important}} factor in plant development, and must be maintained within a range throughout the growing period. The range of tolerable moisture conditions varies from crop to crop. Irrigation and fine-textured amendments can be used to increase soil moisture, whereas coarser-textured amendments and technologies such as <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> can be used to decrease it.|$|E
5000|$|Weeping tiles {{are often}} used for water {{drainage}} near basement foundations {{as a part of}} basement waterproofing, where they are called a French drain. They can be used in farmers' fields for the <b>tile</b> <b>drainage</b> of waterlogged fields. Such fields are called [...] "tiled." [...] Weeping tiles can be used anywhere that soil needs to be drained.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1850s {{the states}} began an {{organized}} attempt {{to drain the}} swamp for agricultural use and ease of travel. Various projects were undertaken over a 40-year period. Local resident James B. Hill, living in Bowling Green, Ohio, in the mid-19th century, made the quick drainage of the Black Swamp possible with his invention of the Buckeye Traction Ditcher. [...] Hill's ditching machine laid <b>drainage</b> <b>tiles</b> at a record pace. The area was largely settled {{over the next three}} decades. The development of railroads and a local <b>drainage</b> <b>tile</b> industry are thought to have contributed greatly to drainage and settlement.|$|R

50|$|The Raccoon River is a 30.8 mi {{tributary}} of the Des Moines River in central Iowa in the United States. As measured using the longest of its three forks, its length increases to 226 mi. Via the Des Moines River, {{it is part of}} the watershed of the Mississippi River. The river runs through an intensely cultivated area of croplands and livestock farming, receiving <b>Tile</b> <b>drainage</b> from slow-draining rich natural bottomlands.|$|E
50|$|Nitrogen is {{most often}} transported by water as nitrate (NO3). The {{nitrogen}} is usually added to a watershed as organic-N or ammonia (NH3), so nitrogen stays attached to the soil until oxidation converts it into nitrate. Since the nitrate is generally already incorporated into the soil, the water traveling through the soil (i.e., interflow and <b>tile</b> <b>drainage)</b> {{is the most likely}} to transport it, rather than surface runoff.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tile</b> <b>drainage</b> and the {{corresponding}} changes to the landscape - draining wetlands, wet soils, and channelizing streams - have contributed to more erosive rivers. This response of rivers due to drainage {{is the result of}} shortening the residence time of water on the landscape. For example, precipitation used to be held in wetlands and in/on the surface of soils, continuously evaporating or being used via transpiration of plants. Water would slowly drain through the landscape and eventually drain to rivers. The process of <b>tile</b> <b>drainage,</b> used to dry soils quickly and efficiently, results in an efficient transmission of water to the river - so efficient, in fact, that higher volumes of water are delivered to rivers. The effect of higher volumes of water is more energy in water - the dynamic equilibrium state that rivers existed in for centuries (slowly changing shape and continuously transporting limited sediment) was, and currently is, out of balance. The result of this loss of equilibrium is extreme amounts of bank erosion which results in over-burdensome sediment loads and critical impacts to natural environments and riverine habitats.|$|E

40|$|Lake Macatawa in Ottawa County, Michigan {{has long}} been plagued by excess {{nutrients}} causing it to become hypereutrophic. Algal blooms and turbid waters characterize the lake. Historically, the Macatawa River has burdened the lake with phosphorus-laden sediment from upstream farms with <b>drainage</b> <b>tiles</b> to the river. As {{one of the most}} eutrophic lakes in Michigan, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) developed a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for phosphorus in Lake Macatawa in 1997 (MDEQ, 2007). Since then, efforts have been made by local groups such as the Macatawa Area Coordinating Council (MACC) and the Macatawa Greenway Partnership (MGP) to reduce the phosphorus loading into the lake. A major area of focus in reducing phosphorus loading has become the Upper Mac on account of the runoff from farms there. In 2004, <b>drainage</b> <b>tiles</b> were broken, <b>drainage</b> ditches were plugged, 125 acres of wetlands were restored, and retention ponds were created in the Upper Mac (MGP, 2006). Additional retention ponds were added and a meander was re-engineered for the river from 2006 to 2007 (MGP, 2006). All of the work in the Upper Mac is expected to reduce phosphorus loading into Lake Macatawa by 16, 230 pounds per yea...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur study {{examines}} the source aquifers and stream inputs of the seasonal water and nitrogen dynamics of a headwater agricultural catchment {{to determine the}} dominant driving forces for the seasonal dynamics in the surface water nitrogen loads and concentrations. We found that the alternating aquifer contributions throughout {{the year of the}} deep and shallow aquifers were the main cause for the seasonality of the nitrate concentration. The deep aquifer water typically contributed 75 % of the total outlet discharge in the summer and 50 % in the winter when the shallow aquifer recharges due to low crop evapotranspiration. The shallow aquifer supplied {{the vast majority of the}} nitrogen load to the stream due to the significantly higher total nitrogen concentration (11 mg-N/l) compared to the deep aquifer (0. 50 mg-N/l). The main stream input pathway for the shallow aquifer nitrogen load was from the perennial <b>tile</b> <b>drainages</b> providing 60 % of the total load to the stream outlet, while only providing 26 % of the total flow volume. The diffuse groundwater input to the stream was the largest input to the stream (39 %), but only supplied 27 % to the total nitrogen load as the diffuse water was mostly composed of deep aquifer water...|$|R

50|$|States {{throughout}} the region faced similar limits to agricultural intensification. Many states offered government incentives to improve land for farming.
