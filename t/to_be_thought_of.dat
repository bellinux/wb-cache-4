5|$|The monarchy fell at a {{point when}} it had reached its highest {{popularity}} among Brazilians, {{due in part to}} the abolition of slavery on 13 May 1888. Indifferent to the new heroes, such as Tiradentes, imposed by the new republican government, Brazilians remained attached to the popular Emperor whom they regarded as a hero. He continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a national symbol, the Father of the People personified. This view was even stronger among those of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom. The afro-Brazilians demonstrated their feeling of loyalty towards the monarch in subtle ways, such as by having the Imperial Crown tattooed on their bodies.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She does not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E

25|$|The {{lumped element}} model, for instance, {{suggests}} that we think of circuits in terms of components with connections between them, with signals flowing instantaneously along the connections. This is a useful view, but not the only possible one. A different ontology arises {{if we need to}} attend to the electrodynamics in the device: Here signals propagate at finite speed and an object (like a resistor) that was previously viewed as a single component with an I/O behavior may now have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an extended medium through which an electromagnetic wave flows.|$|E
25|$|No {{significant}} {{contact with}} inhabitants {{in the area}} was recorded for decades, until {{around the time of}} the Crimean War (1853–56). British admirals arranged with Chief Joe Capilano that if there was an invasion, the British would defend the south shore of Burrard Inlet and the Squamish would defend the north. The British gave him and his men 60 muskets. Although the attack anticipated by the British never came, the guns were used by the Squamish to repel an attack by an indigenous raid from the Euclataws. Stanley Park was not attacked, but this was when it started <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a strategic military position.|$|E
25|$|Todd's {{spiritual journey}} was crafted {{as a man}} who wanted {{forgiveness}} for his past misdeeds. In the story, he reasons that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by telling this type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact that he initiated a gang rape on her. Despite the character's eagerness <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd feel any less horrible for having raped Marty.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, the VGC {{started to}} {{concentrate}} its efforts on bilingual families, though {{the improvement of}} the Flemish schools had an unexpected effect; monolingual French-speaking families also began {{to send their children to}} Flemish schools. This effect increased bit by bit, as bilingualism began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as normal. Even today, the Flemish educational system continues to attract those with a first language other than Dutch; in 2005, 20% of students go to Dutch-speaking high schools, and for daycares, that figure reaches 23%. In fact, it has got to the point where those with Dutch as a first language are now a minority in the Flemish schools, and as a result, measures have needed to be taken to sustain the quality of education.|$|E
25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my primary care physician as another. That {{is not to say that}} these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E
500|$|Descartes {{specifies}} two {{varieties of}} the conatus: conatus a centro and conatus recedendi. Conatus a centro, or [...] "tendency towards the center", {{is used by}} Descartes as a theory of gravity; conatus recendendi, or [...] "tendency away from the center", represents the centrifugal forces. These tendencies are not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> in terms of animate dispositions and intentions, nor as inherent properties or [...] "forces" [...] of things, {{but rather as a}} unifying, external characteristic of the physical universe itself which God has bestowed.|$|E
2500|$|When {{writing the}} TV series, Christopher Bond {{was brought in}} as the script {{associate}} and helped to adapt the series from radio to television. The American character was changed, {{and the idea of}} a character who appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an English gentleman but turns out not <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of.</b> It <b>was</b> then decided that this character needed someone who could reveal his real background, and his mother was created, although it was not until Spence had nearly finished the first series that she was written in from the beginning. [...] The characters of Brabinger and Marjory followed soon after. The first episode aired on 30 September 1979, a year after Keith had played Margo Leadbetter for the last time in The Good Life.|$|R

500|$|Brettingham's {{principal}} {{contribution to}} architecture {{is perhaps the}} design of the grand town house, unremarkable for its exterior but with a circulating plan for reception rooms suitable for entertaining within on a forgotten scale of lavishness. Many of these anachronistic palaces are now long demolished or have been transformed for other uses and are inaccessible for public viewing. Hence, what little remains in London of his work is unknown to the general public. Of Brettingham's work, only the buildings he remodelled have survived, and for this reason Brettingham now tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an [...] "improver" [...] rather than an architect of country houses.|$|E
500|$|ALP and HCE have a daughter, Issy – whose {{personality}} is often split (represented by her mirror-twin). Parrinder argues that [...] "as daughter and sister, {{she is an}} object of secret and repressed desire both to her father [...] and to her two brothers." [...] These twin sons of HCE and ALP consist of a writer called Shem the Penman and a postman {{by the name of}} Shaun the Post, who are rivals for replacing their father and for their sister Issy's affection. Shaun is portrayed as a dull postman, conforming to society's expectations, while Shem is a bright artist and sinister experimenter, often perceived as Joyce's alter-ego in the book. Hugh Staples finds that Shaun [...] "wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a man-about-town, a snappy dresser, a glutton and a gourmet... He is possessed of a musical voice and is a braggart. He is not happy in his work, which is that of a messenger or a postman; he would rather be a priest." [...] Shaun's sudden and somewhat unexpected promotion to the book's central character in Part III is explained by Tindall with the assertion that [...] "having disposed of old HCE, Shaun is becoming the new HCE." ...|$|E
500|$|Malone {{stated that}} Todd {{believes}} {{that he does not}} deserve forgiveness, which contributes to him embracing his worst qualities, something Malone felt worked better due to Howarth's acting choices, which prevented Todd from acquiring redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact he initiated her rape. As well as having Todd risk his freedom from prison and save Marty from a car crash, Todd donates his own blood to Marty to ensure she survives. A year later, he risks his life to save Patrick, Marty's lover, from death; this act leads to Todd's presumed death. Despite having the character yearn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a decent human being, the writers felt his good deeds should never make him feel any less horrible for having raped Marty. [...] Initially, Howarth disagreed, and did not consider the storylines to be redemptive. [...] " [...] not being redeemed at all," [...] he said. [...] "Todd, as I see it, is looking for a way to overcome this rage so he can live in society again. From now on, his menace will be on the surface, not exploding. It's more interesting if his violence is on the surface and that he play against it. That's where the subtlety is." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{rejection}} {{was actively}} advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine. [...] Quine advanced {{the view that}} in predicate-language sentences like Fx the [...] "x" [...] is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in [...] "For all things, {{it is the case}} that [...] [...] [...]" [...] but the [...] "F" [...] is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property). [...] For example, it might mean [...] " [...] [...] [...] is a dog." [...] But {{it makes no sense to}} think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by Boolos.|$|E
5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore.
