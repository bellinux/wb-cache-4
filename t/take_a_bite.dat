5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1988, the band started rehearsing material for a new album with producer André Jacquemin, who had worked on all the Monty Python’s records. The album <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bite</b> was published by GWR in October 1988 and follows in the steps of Nightmare at Maple Cross, presenting powerful and melodic metal songs, tinged with the humour typical of the band. To promote the album, Girlschool did a UK tour with Gary Glitter, followed by a North American tour. In 1989, they travelled across Europe with Dio and to the Soviet Union with Black Sabbath, {{till the end of}} the year. After their return from Russia, GWR did not renew their contract and the band practically broke up. Musical tastes were changing worldwide in favour of grunge and more extreme metal genres, compelling most acts originated from the new wave of British heavy metal to disband or to reduce their activities, and the same thing happened to Girlschool.|$|E
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks {{as if she might}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> out of the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E

I {{thought he was going to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E

5000|$|Once {{there existed}} a wise snake woman, Shahmaran, who loved a {{traveler}} named Tasmasp. He {{was in love}} with her. He listened to her wisdom and stories. But when he thought she had no more stories to tell, he decided to return to his country, however he took Shahmaran with him and hid her. When Tasmasp returned to his land, the king had become very ill. One of the king's advisers exclaimed {{that the only way to}} recover was to eat Shahmaran. They took people, one by one, into the hamam to see if snake scales would come up, and when Tasmsp went, he was forced to tell where Shahmaran was hiding. When they found her, she said, [...] "whomsoever <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> from my snake scales will gain the secrets of the world, but whomever <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> of my head will die instantly." [...] Tasmasp <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> of the head and the evil helper <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> of the scales, but the helper died, and Tasmasp was not affected at all. Shahmaran had helped her lover while simultaneously killing her enemy.|$|R
500|$|At home, Homer scolds Lisa for ruining his party, and she rebukes him {{for serving}} a meat-based dish. They fight and {{she leaves the}} house. Lisa soon decides that she can no longer fight the {{pressure}} to eat meat, prompting her to grab a hot dog from the grill at the Kwik-E-Mart and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite.</b> However, Apu, himself a vegan, reveals that she has eaten a tofu dog. Apu takes Lisa through a secret passageway to the Kwik-E-Mart roof, where they meet Paul and Linda McCartney. Being vegetarians, the McCartneys explain that they are old friends of Apu from Paul's days in India, and discuss their interest in animal rights. After a brief discussion, Lisa is committed once more to vegetarianism, but she realizes that she should tolerate those who disagree with her views. Inspired, Lisa begins to return home and finds Homer frantically searching for her. She apologizes to Homer, admitting she {{had no right to}} ruin his barbecue; he forgives her and offers her a [...] "veggie back" [...] ride home.|$|E
500|$|The Red Sox {{held their}} World Series victory parade on the {{following}} Saturday, October 30. The team was transported around on 17 duck boats equipped with loudspeakers so the players could talk to the spectators. Due to large interest in the parade, it was lengthened by officials the day before to include the Charles River, so that fans could watch from the Boston and Cambridge river banks. The parade did not however, include a staged rally. The parade began at 10a.m. local time at Fenway Park, turned east onto Boylston Street, then west onto Tremont Street and Storrow Drive before entering the river. One of the lanes on Massachusetts Avenue had to be closed to accommodate {{members of the media}} filming the parade as it passed under the Harvard Bridge. Ramírez was handed a sign by one of the spectators part of the way through the parade, which read, [...] "Jeter is playing golf today. This is better!" [...] He held on to this sign {{for the rest of the}} parade, in a similar way to what Tug McGraw said after the Philadelphia Phillies won the 1980 World Series, [...] "For once, we <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> out of the Big Apple". Over three million people were estimated to have attended the parade, making it the largest gathering ever in the city of Boston.|$|E
2500|$|The {{officials}} {{were unable to}} use their whistles after the opening kick-off. As referee Norm Schachter blew his metal whistle to signal the start of play, it froze to his lips. As he attempted to free the whistle from his lips, the skin ripped off and his lips began to bleed. The conditions were so hostile that instead of forming a scab, the blood simply froze to his lip. For {{the rest of the}} game, the officials used voice commands and calls to end plays and officiate the game. At one point during the game, CBS announcer Frank Gifford said on air, [...] "I'm going to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> of my coffee." ...|$|E

2500|$|The burger {{came at a}} {{point in}} the {{industry}} where fast casual restaurants were beginning to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> out of the industry as a whole. Burger King, and other chains, at first had not taken chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger as serious competition. Additionally, convenience stores such as 7-11 were also expanding their in-store foods with cheaper hot foods that challenged {{the lower end of the}} market. These two market trends had the effect of shaving sales from both ends of the menu, challenging the concept of the barbell strategy. As the chains tried to fight the encroachment of the competition from outside fast food industry, McDonald's and Wendy's chose to focus on their menus while Burger King focused its advertising on younger-skewing [...] "superfan". The result was that the other two chains' sales grew by 26% and 9% percent respectively, while Burger King’s remained flat.|$|E
