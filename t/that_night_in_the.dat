However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E

Warden was disappointed by the projected aircraft and asked if the Boeing team could come up with a proposal for a four-engine turbojet bomber. Joined by Ed Wells, Boeing vice president of engineering, the engineers worked <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hotel Van Cleve in Dayton, Ohio, redesigning Boeing's proposal as a four-engine turbojet bomber. On Friday, Colonel Warden looked over the information and asked for a better design.

The reward will be a cache of gold coins.|$|E

5|$|On the February 3, 2016 {{episode of}} Lucha Underground, Mundo faced Killshot in a winning effort. After the match, Mundo taunted Lucha Underground Champion Mil Muertes, {{only to be}} confronted by Cage. Mundo {{defeated}} Cage on February 24, after interference from the debuting Taya, subsequently becoming Mundo's valet. On the May 25 episode of Lucha Underground, Taya revealed to PJ Black and Jack Evans that their partner Fénix was injured by Mundo. As Mundo revealed himself as Fénix's replacement for their match, Black and Evans allied with the two. Later <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main event, Mundo, Black and Evans defeated Rey Mysterio Jr., Prince Puma and Dragon Azteca Jr. to win the Lucha Underground Trios Championship, the first championship for each in Lucha Underground. The week after, Mundo, Black and Evans, now collectively billed as Worldwide Underground, retained their championships in a rematch via disqualification. During the match, Mundo delivered a low blow to Azteca Jr. while Taya distracted the referee. After seeing Mundo's actions, Puma hit a low blow to Mundo, causing a disqualification towards Puma's team. On the June 8 episode of Lucha Underground, Mundo teamed up with Taya, Ivelisse, Fénix, King Cuerno and Pentagón Jr. in a 12-man tag team match where the winning team {{would go on to}} face each other in a six-man elimination match to determine the No. 1 contender for the Lucha Underground Championship.

The Allied force successfully held off all attacks during the day, but retreated from the Roncesvalles Pass <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of overwhelming French numerical superiority. Also on the 25th, a third French corps severely tried the British 2nd Division at the Battle of Maya. The British withdrew from the Maya Pass that evening. Wellington rallied his troops a short distance north of Pamplona and repelled the attacks of Soult's two corps at the Battle of Sorauren on 28 July.|$|E

25|$|The {{morning of}} 3 August marked {{the start of}} the very complex Battle of Lonato between the French and Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich's corps. Pijon was {{captured}} and his brigade was driven out of Lonato del Garda when Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko's Austrian column suddenly assaulted the town in the early hours. The defeated Quosdanovich decided to retreat into the mountains <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> confusion, one of his columns was cut off and elected to escape to the west. These troops arrived at Lonato at 5:00AM on 4August and were bluffed into surrendering by Bonaparte, who had only 1,200 troops on hand. Approximately 2,000 Austrians from Infantry Regiments De Vins Nr. 37 and Erbach Nr. 42 were made prisoners. This event released Pijon from captivity.|$|E
25|$|The landing {{was part}} of an {{extended}} campaign of similar incursions into Malaysian territory in the fall and winter of 1964 launched by Indonesian President Sukarno to add gravitas to his 17 August speech announcing a 'Year of Dangerous Living,' as well as to establish a base for a potential Communist rebellion. A first landing was launched <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pontian District of Johore, but was quickly halted by Commonwealth security forces. The operation at Kesang River was the sixth of the series of infiltration attempts, and in the night of 29 October two groups were landed, one {{on each side of the}} river. As with all previous attempts, the raiders were reported to local police by civilians and Commonwealth troops quickly swept the area and captured nearly all of the Indonesian forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{confrontation}} between Konnan and Pierroth Jr. {{was just a}} preview for their match later <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-final position of the show. The two faced off in a Dog collar match, which meant that the two were joined together by a long steel chain that was connected to a dog collar {{around the neck of}} each competitor. The collar was then locked to prevent one of the wrestlers from getting out of the collar during the match. At some point Pierroth Jr. either stole the key from the referee, or had a spare key hidden somewhere as he was able to take off his collar, use the freedom of movement to tie up Konnan and hit him repeatedly with the steel chain. With Konnan down Pierroth Jr. was able to touch the top turnbuckle on all four corners, which was how the match was won.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2000s, NBC's {{fortunes}} started to take a rapid turn for the worse. That year, NBC's longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series Survivor to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC's nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of Friends, Will & Grace, ER and Just Shoot Me! (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000–01 season) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Overall, NBC retook its first place lead that year, and spent much of the next four years (with the exception of the 2002–03 season, when it was briefly jumped again by CBS for first) in the top spot.|$|E
