5|$|At {{first the}} {{incursion}} was countered by the RAR, {{but after a}} tactical error in its third engagement with the guerrillas led to casualties, the African Rifles were joined by 2 Commando, RLI on 25 August 1967. The insurgents were consistently undone in their incursions by the suspicion of Rhodesia's rural blacks, whose tribal chiefs and headmen would often work together to inform the police and security forces of the infiltrators' presence. This proved to be no exception: when a cadre visited a local kraal early on 31 August to obtain food, an old woman invited him to stay and kept him there while she sent a young girl to alert the security forces. 7 Troop, 2 Commando arrived at 07:20 and captured the insurgent, who then guided 7 Troop, led by Lieutenant Charl Viljoen, and a platoon of RAR men to where his five comrades were encamped. The combined force surrounded the guerrillas and opened fire, killing four; the fifth escaped and returned to Zambia. The next day, on 1 September, some 2 Commando troops in ambush were informed by a <b>tractor</b> <b>driver</b> {{that he had been}} given money by 14 guerrillas the previous night to buy mielie-meal for them, and that they would be collecting it from him at his kraal that evening. A sweep was planned; the <b>tractor</b> <b>driver</b> was briefed and returned to the kraal with the mielie-meal while 2 Commando and the RAR formed a cordon around it. The following morning the soldiers performed their sweep but failed to find the enemy, who were already gone. The insurgents, who were actually 17 in number and all South African Umkhonto fighters, crossed the border into Botswana and were arrested there on 3 September. Of the 79 cadres who had crossed the border on 1 August, 29 were killed and 17 captured within Rhodesia, 29 were arrested in Botswana, where one also died, one was arrested in Durban and one escaped back to Zambia. One remained unaccounted for. Nickel was officially closed at 06:00 on 8 September 1967.|$|E

Influence of pesticides to exposed workers mainly depends on technology of pesticide application use.

Pesticides influence stem cells in bone marrow, then maturation process of blood elements and can damage mature blood cells in blood circulation.

40|$|In offset disc harrows, {{the angle}} between gangs may {{be changed to}} meet the field conditions. <b>Tractor</b> <b>drivers</b> usually use an angle close to maximum, {{increasing}} power requirements and therefore limiting the forward speed and, consequently, the work rate. The objective of this work was to study, in the specific soil conditions present in Southern Portuguese agriculture, the effect of working with a disc harrow at a reduced gang angle and at a higher forward speed, in terms of work rate, fuel consumption per hectare and distribution of dry soil aggregates. A trailed type medium-weight offset disc harrow (20 discs of 610 mm diameter) was used, pulled by a four wheel drive tractor. A portable computer based record system was used to collect engine speed, actual forward speed, slip, fuel consumption and draught force. Higher work rates and lower values of fuel consumption per hectare were attained, with no visible difference in soil tilth, by operating the disc harrow at a lower angle between disc gangs and shifting up to a higher gear ratio whilst maintaining engine speed. <b>Tractor</b> <b>drivers,</b> particularly those with tractors equipped with performance monitors should consider setting, by preliminary tests prior to the main field work, {{the right combination of}} gang angle and forward speed within the limits of quality of the work and the safety of the operation...|$|R
