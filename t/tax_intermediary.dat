40|$|The {{international}} {{tax system}} {{is in the midst}} of a contest between automatic information reporting and anonymous withholding models for ensuring that nations have the ability to tax offshore accounts. At stake is the extent of many countries’ capacity to tax investment income of individuals and profits of closely held businesses through an income tax in an increasingly financially integrated world. Incongruent initiatives of the European Union, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Switzerland, and the United States together represent an emerging international regime in which financial institutions act to facilitate countries’ ability to tax their residents’ offshore accounts. The growing consensus that financial institutions should act as cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>intermediaries</b> represents a remarkable shift in international norms that has yet to be recognized in the academic literature. The debate, however, is about how financial institutions should serve as cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> and for which countries. Different outcomes in this contest portend starkly different futures for the extent of cross-border tax administrative assistance available to most countries. The triumph of an automatic information reporting model over an anonymous withholding model is key to (1) allowing for the taxation of principal, (2) ensuring that most countries are included in the benefit of financial institutions serving as cross-border <b>tax</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> (3) encouraging taxpayer engagement with the polity, and (4) supporting sovereign policy flexibility, especially in emerging and developing economies.

Because of intermediation costs, local lenders are willing to diversify their portfolio by offering some direct lending to nearby entrepreneurs. We show that, in some cases, a fall in intermediation costs, by inducing local lenders to choose a safer portfolio, reduces entrepreneurs' effort and increases the probability of default.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a stylized general {{equilibrium}} model is constructed to analyze the relative efficiency of <b>taxing</b> financial <b>intermediaries.</b> A crucial feature of the model is that tax collection costs are endogenous, i. e. they result from primitive assumptions about information and transaction costs, instead of being assumed ad hoc. The model provides useful insights into the welfare costs and incidence of banks' reserve requirements or, equivalently, of a tax on deposits. In particular, it is shown that a tax on bank deposits {{can be part of}} an optimal tax system, provided banks' monopoly power is significant. However, if the banking industry is perfectly competitive, the first dollar of revenue is more efficiently collected by a uniform capital income tax, although a strictly positive welfare loss is incurred.

Corruption and political instability were measured by using corruption index and political instability index respectively. Time series data from 1980 - 2010 was used for regression analysis.

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that financial services - such as mobilizing savings, managing risk, allocating resources, and facilitating transactions - influence and are influenced by economic development. And financial crises - widespread bank failures, the collapse of stock markets - can impede and even reverse economic advances. With this in mind, the World Bank made special efforts in the 1980 s to help countries improve their financial systems and cope with financial crises that threatened economic prosperity. Bank programs focused on core financial themes (loosening up interest rates, reducing government involvement in credit allocation, rationalizing <b>taxes</b> on financial <b>intermediaries)</b> and on managing bank failures, rehabilitating insolvent banks, and training bank managers and supervisors. Recently, Bank programs have stressed the development of capital markets, especially stock markets, but {{little research has been}} done in measuring the level ofstock market development or understanding the relationship between the development of stock markets and the functioning of financial intermediaries. The authors did some preliminary research on these issues and suggest further topics for research. They propose different empirical indicators of stock market development.

They find that the relationship between the development of stock markets and the functioning of financial intermediaries may be complementary.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} administrative reforms which Thomas Stamford Raffles put into effect in colonial Java {{at the time of his}} rule as the Vice Governor of the British East India was the introduction of modern land tax system in the name of “land rent”. Under this system Javanese peasants were regarded as leaseholders of the state domain and were obliged to pay “rents” directly to the colonial government without <b>intermediary</b> <b>tax</b> collection by native local chiefs. To confirm the area of land held by each individual “cultivator” and to settle the amount of “rent” levied on it, so-called “detailed land settlement” survey was proclaimed by Raffles in 1814. When the present author carried out a small scale archive survey in 1988 at the National Archive of Indonesia on the local socio-economic history of Malang area, East Java, he discovered a manuscript document entitled Detailed Settlement van het Regentschap Malang. This document listed more than three thousands “cultivators” in 465 villages in 6 districts of this region and the area of cultivated land (sawah and legal, namely irrigated rice field and dry land) held by each “cultivator” together with the amount ot “land rent” levied on it. Evidently, this document was recorded by a local British official who was ordered to carry out land settlement survey in this area. By analyzing the data recorded in this document as well as some regional statistical data in Raffles'famous work: History of Java, this paper tried to throw light on the stratified feature of “cultivators”class and the actual mode of the newly introduced land tax system under which the colonial government controlled them. In addition, it was also tried to find out present villages which names are identical with those of old villages recorded in the Detailed Settlement van het Regentschap Malang to examine the continuity of village institutions in this region. The major findings of this historical data analysis are as follows: (1) Malang region at the time of Raffles was located in the frontier zone of Java from the viewpoint of either the degree of reclamation and peasants'settlement or the peneteration of effective colonial rule. This is confirmed by the interregional comparative analysis of Raffles'statistical data and the comparison of the names of old villages re-corded in the Detailed Settlement with present villages or hamlets in this region. The colonial government control of land and people was still so loose in this frontier zone that the population size of villages, the number of “cultivators” and the area of cultivated land were extremely underestimated. In addition, most of the villages seem to have not yet been firmly established and easy to disappear unlike villages in some areas of Central Java which had much longer history of settlement. (2) “Cultivators” class recorded in the Detailed Settlement was actually never the homogeneous group of independent farmers but was highly stratified in terms of land tenure. Such stratification among “cultivators” was most obviously observed in the north-central plain of the region where the traffic route ran through to the core area in the noth coast where the center of colonial rule and commercial activities was located. This part of region seems to have had the longest history of reclamation and peasants'settlement. On the contrary, the stratification of “cultivators” was less prominent in newly settled zone in the mountaineous or hilly areas at the remote corners of the region. While the highest strata of “cultivators” were considered to constitute the ruling class of peasant societies, the lowest strata of “cultivators” with the minimal land holding size were regarded to be dependent peasants who could not keep subsistence without working as wage laborers or share-croppers in the field of upper strata of “cultivators. ” Besides these tiny “cultivators” there must be fairly large number of landless people within villages whose names were not recorded in the Detailed Settlement but constituted also the pool of dependent labor for upper classes of villagers...|$|R
40|$|Corruption is {{considered}} to be a major problem across all parts of the world. However, corruption is arguably more prevalent in least developed countries when compared to developed industrialised nations. Bangladesh, in this regard, is no exception. The extent of corruption in Bangladesh reached such a record level that it was dubbed the most corrupt country in the world in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index for consecutive years between 2001 and 2005. The political economy of corruption in Bangladesh presents a frustrating picture of the problem that suggests that the apparent corrupt state of Bangladesh has primarily emanated from a longstanding nexus between corrupt politicians, public officials and other stakeholders, including businesspeople. Tax evasion is likely to play a significant role in creating and maintaining such a nexus resulting in a significant shortfall in the country’s overall revenue collection. Despite the importance of this intriguing scenario, very little empirical research has been conducted to date on tax evasion as a corrupt practice and the various politico-economic issues associated with it in Bangladesh. This study aims to identify and analyse the key issues associated with the tax policy formulation, implementation and compliance processes and their likely roles in facilitating tax evasion. It also seeks to investigate the involvement and nexus of various stakeholders and their alleged contribution to tax evasion in Bangladesh. Initially, the context of the thesis is established, relying on the background of the study and the literature on tax evasion and corruption. A number of relevant theories are identified as theoretical templates for assessing the problem in a Bangladesh context, viz., public choice theory, rent-seeking theory and the Allingham-Sandmo Model. A combination of deductive and inductive reasoning has been utilised to capture the complexity of the research. A conceptual framework and a set of propositions are framed on the basis of the literature. Based on a single-country-based case study approach, mixed methods have been employed to obtain insightful answers to the research problem. The study utilises both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Primary data were collected by conducting a survey utilising structured printed questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, and attendance at a roundtable seminar as a participant observer. Secondary data were collected from project reports, government publications and documents, books, journals, reports, newspapers and electronic media. The empirical findings suggest that the absence of a participatory policy making process, lack of research into, and reform of, the tax system, short-term oriented and politically motivated tax policies, loopholes, anomalies and complexities of tax laws and policies are responsible for creating scope for tax evasion. Institutional weaknesses of the tax administration, lack of professional support for tax officials and inappropriate behavioural aspects of tax officials have undermined the efficiency of the tax policy implementation process, resulting in widespread tax evasion. During the compliance process, the absence of a tax culture among income earners, inadequate taxpayer service, complexities and unfairness in tax estimation, weak enforcement and the negative image of the tax department work as influential driving forces for tax non-compliance. The empirical findings also revealed that the corrupt nexus of self-interested policy makers, rent-seeking tax officials, self-utility maximiser taxpayers, including businesspeople, professionals, self-employed persons, and their <b>intermediaries,</b> <b>tax</b> agents, facilitates tax evasion. This study provides policy implications and recommendations for combating tax evasion and corruption in the tax administration. It recommends comprehensive reform of the Income Tax Ordinance 1984, establishing a permanent autonomous tax research cell, ensuring participation of all stakeholders including taxpayers and the civil society in tax policy formulation. The study also flags an urgent need to strengthen the tax administration through providing adequate human resources, infrastructure and logistic support and automation, and enhancing its jurisdiction. Adequate wages and professional support for tax officials should immediately be provided. Strong tax enforcement, with an increased probability of detection of tax evasion, increased penalty rates and a reduction in tax rate would be effective measures to combat tax evasion. For establishing a tax paying culture, it is recommended to provide services to taxpayers such as taxpayer education and online facilities, simplify the complex and overly bureaucratic tax system, undertake systematic advertising and publicising of tax issues, and ensure transparency in spending the revenue raised. Discriminatory tax treatment, including the use of tax amnesties and tax exemptions should be discontinued. This study suggests implementing exemplary punishment of both tax evaders and corrupt tax officials to prevent tax evasion. Following an inductive process, this thesis also proposes a set of theoretical implications. As the thesis was limited to study the income tax evasion in socio-economic and administrative context of Bangladesh, generalising the findings regarding tax evasion to other countries may be problematical. The thesis is expected to partially meet an existing gap in the literature by investigating the problem of tax evasion from a developing country perspective which could act as a useful guide for the government of Bangladesh and its development partners to reform and improve the taxation regime. The research may also help stimulate future research on tax evasion and corruption from both developed and developing country perspectives...|$|R
