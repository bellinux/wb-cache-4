40|$|Abstract. Up to {{oriented}} homotopy equivalence, a PD 3 –pair (X, ∂X) with aspheri-cal boundary components {{is uniquely}} {{determined by the}} Π 1 –system {κi: Π 1 (∂Xi, ∗) → Π 1 (X, ∗) }i∈J, the orientation character ωX ∈ H 1 (X;Z/ 2 Z) {{and the image of}} the funda-mental class [X, ∂X] ∈ H 3 (X, ∂X;Zω) under the classifying map [3]. We call the triple ({κi}i∈J, ωX, [X, ∂X]) the fundamental triple of the PD 3 –pair (X, ∂X). Using Peter Hilton’s homotopy theory of modules, Turaev [12] gave a condition for realization in the absolute case of PD 3 –complexes X with ∂X = ∅. Given a finitely presentable group G and ω ∈ H 1 (G;Z/ 2 Z), he defined a homomorphism ν: H 3 (G;Zω) − → [F, I] where F is some Z[G]–module, I = ker aug and [A,B] denotes the group of homotopy classes of Z[G]–morphisms from the Z[G]–moduleA to the Z[G]–moduleB. Turaev showed that, given µ ∈ H 3 (G;Zω), the triple (G,ω, µ) is relized by a PD 3 –complex X if and only if ν(µ) is a class of homotopy equivalences of Z[G]–modules. Using Turaev’s construction of the homomorphism ν, we generalize the condition for realization to the case of PD 3 –pairs (X, ∂X), where ∂X is not necessarily empty. 1. Outline Section 2 is concerned with notation and the existence of Eilenberg–MacLane pairs. Section 3 discusses properties of the relative <b>twisted</b> <b>cap</b> product needed for the formu-lation of the realization condition and the proof of sufficiency in the Π 1 –injective case. In Section 4 we briefly revise the projective homotopy category of modules over a ring, also called the stable category. The final theorem of this section plays a crucial rôle in the construction of a PD 3 –pair from given invariants. The realization condition is formulated in Section 5 and Section 6 contains the proof of the realization theorem for the Π 1 –injective case. 2. Preliminaries Let G be a group, let Λ: = Z[G] be the integral group ring of G and let aug: Λ → Z denote the augmentation homomorphism determined by aug(g) : = 1 for all g ∈ G.

40|$|This was a {{collaborative}} report by 4 mechanical engineering students. A pharmaceutical company makes {{a product that}} requires them to extract medical grade salve from tubes {{so that it can}} be mixed with another salve. Currently, the company has workers manually <b>twist</b> off the <b>caps</b> and put the tubes into an extraction machine. This current method has caused several workers to develop wrist problems and does not allow the company to meet demand. A process was created to automate the removal of the caps from the salve tubes. A feed system was designed to be able to be able to be continuously loaded with multiple tubes and feed one tube at a time into the tube holder. A tube holder was designed to hold the body of a tube firmly so that the cap can be cut without salve being squeezed out. A cutting process was created based off of finite element analysis of the interaction of a blade tip and the tube. A blade cuts the cap off of the tube after it is fed into the tube holder. An assembly using two linear actuators was designed to move the tube holder over and up into the extraction machine consisting of a squeezing roll set. Motion analysis using data from real components found that the designed machine can run with a three second cycle time. This simulated cycle time would allow the company to meet their production demand. The designed machine would cost roughly $ 5, 487. B. A. (Bachelor of Arts...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Sensitization of {{robot hand}} is still {{remaining}} as crucial issue {{since most of}} robot hand systems nowadays are only capable to grasp a predefined specific object. It is still difficult for robot hand system to realize human-like tactile sensation. Some common problems in robot hand system are low accuracy sensing device, sensors are not robust enough for long time work and heavy duties, inconsistence tactile sensing detection and difficulties in control of sensing fusion with robot trajectory. These problems are apparently drawback the progress to commercializing robot hands as real consumer products. Approach: This study presented the application of optical three-axis tactile sensor to robot hand to improve sensitization quality in robotic hand system. The proposed tactile sensor system was designed with compliance modules to communicate with robot hand control system. The sensing principle used in this tactile sensor comparatively provides better sensing accuracy to detect contact phenomena from acquisition of three axial directions of forces. Methodology of force and slippage detection in the tactile sensor system was presented. Accordingly, the optimization of robot hand control algorithm {{to comply with the}} tactile sensor system was presented and verified in experiment of grasping and twisting. Results: The tactile sensor presented in this study is capable of detecting normal and shear force simultaneously. The proposed methodology was verified in experiment with paper cup and water, in which the result shows the robot control system managed to respond to the proposed object stiffness distinction parameters and effectively respond to sudden change of object weight during grasping. An experiment of grasping and twisting motions was conducted using a bottle cap. In order to perform simultaneous grasping and twisting tasks, optimization of the control algorithm was conducted with additional parameters to satisfy the desired tasks. Conclusion: Experimental result shows that the robot hand managed to perform grasping and <b>twisting</b> of bottle <b>cap</b> smoothly. The overall results revealed good performance of the proposed optical three-axis tactile sensor system and robot hand control algorithm for future application in a real artificial robot hand. In addition, slippage sensation measured in a robot control system could contribute a better maneuvering of the robot arm-finger system...|$|R
40|$|Author: Sosnick Lab, University of Chicago ### Description For protein concentration, gas {{pressure}} is applied directly to ultrafiltration cell. Solutes above the membrane's molecular weight (MW) cut-off are retained in cell, while water and solutes below the cut-off {{pass into the}} filtrate and out of cell. ![Table]([URL] "`Table 1 ") ### Membranes 1. YM 10 Ø 43 mm (for 8050), Amicon # 13622, 10 pack: $ 108 - YM 10 Ø 76 mm (for 8400), Amicon # 13642, 10 pack: $ 139 - **Prewash**: float membrane with glossy side down in beaker with distilled water for at least 1 hour changing water 3 times. All membranes are pretreated with glycerine to prevent drying, YM membranes are treated with sodium azide as a preservative. - **Cleaning**: rinse with 0. 1 M NaOH, followed by thorough flushing with distilled water. For strongly absorbed protein, soak in 0. 1 % protease solution and rinse thoroughly. - **Storage**: for reuse, store membranes in 10 % ethanol water solution at 4 °C. ### Assembly 1. Place membrane in holder, **shiny side up**; then place O-ring on top of membrane. Gently push O-ring down so that it contacts and seats membrane evenly in bottom of holder. **Handle membrane by its edges to avoid scratching or contaminating surface**. - Fit membrane holder into cell body, aligning tabs on sides of holder with slots in base of cell body. - Invert cell body and membrane holder; screw base firmly into bottom of cell body. A definite "stop" will be felt when base and body are fully engaged. Top of membrane holder will be flush with bottom of slots in cell body. - Push filtrate exit tubing onto exit spout of membrane support. - Place stirrer assembly into cell body. When properly installed, arms of stirrer assembly will rest on small ridge inside top of cell body. - Introduce sample into cell. - With a <b>twisting</b> motion, push <b>cap</b> down onto cell body, orienting gas inlet port on cap opposite filtrate exit port on holder. If cap assembly does not slide easily, lubricate O-ring lightly with petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to contact membrane!** - Set pressure-relief valve to horizontal (open) position. - Slide cell into retaining stand, fitting ring on cell base into hole in stand. Flattened edges on bottom flange of cap ensures that cell is inserted properly and prevents rotation of cell once inside stand. - Turn pressure-relief valve to vertical (closed) position. - Attach {{gas pressure}} line. ### Operation 1. Place cell on magnetic stirring table. - Connect inlet line to regulated gas pressure source (Nitrogen gas is recommended for pressurizing cell! Use of compressed air can cause large pH shifts due to dissolution of carbon dioxide. With sensitive solutions, oxidation can also occur, leading to other potential problems.) - Hold cell steady on the stirring table and pressurize according to instructions in membrane package. Generally ** 55 psi** (3. 7 kg/cm 2) is optimal, maximal 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) nitrogen gas pressure. Cap assembly moves upward, forming a secure lock with retaining stand once system is pressurized. - Turn on stirring table and adjust stirring rate until the vortex created is approximately one-third {{the depth of the}} liquid volume. - Monitor concentration. Do not allow retentate to run through. - Collect permeate. - Highly viscous solutions filter slowly, as do solutions containing particulate matter, such as colloids. Where the viscous agent (sucrose, glycerin, etc.) is to be removed, flow can often be increased by predilution. - **Prefilter or centrifuge** any solution containing particulate matter, such as cell debris or precipitates. - To maximize recovery of retained substances, continue stirring for a few minutes after depressurization. This will resuspend the polarized layer at the membrane surface. - When finished, turn off nitrogen pressure source and stirring table. - Vent pressure inside cell by slowly turning pressure-relief knob to horizontal position. Push cap down, then slide cell out from retaining stand. *Note: Overly rapid depressurization can cause the membrane to buckle up and rupture*. - Using a twisting motion, remove cell cap and the magnetic stirrer assembly. Always remove the cell top with the pressure-relief valve set to the horizontal (open) position. Removal in vertical (closed) position can create a partial vacuum which can rupture the membrane! Pour out solution. - Disassemble cell, then wash all components with a mild detergent/water solution, then rinse thoroughly. Caustic cleaning solutions may damage the anodized aluminum retaining stand. Leave ultrafiltration cell disassembled whenever it is unlikely to be used for several weeks. ### Limits - max. cell operating **pressure**: 75 psi (5. 3 kg/cm 2) - max. membrane operating pressure: 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) - pressure-relief valve preset: 90 psi (6. 3 kg/cm 2) - Although brief exposure to higher **temperatures** is possible, do not operate cell continuously above 85 °C (185 °F). - **pH** 2 to 10 - Do not use the following **chemicals**: Ketones (including acetone), Aromatic hydrocarbons (including toluene), Cellosolvers, Halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, Aliphatic esters, DMSO, Polar Aromatics. *Note:The spring in the pressure-relief valve is not compatible with 0. 1 N NaOH*. ### Sterilization Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells can be autoclaved at 121 °C (250 °F) for 30 minutes. They are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures, 70 % ethanol, isopropanol or 5 % formalin. **CAUTION**: Tighten the base partially before autoclaving. ### Maintenance - Replace O-rings {{at the first sign of}} damage or wear. - If installation or removal of cap assembly becomes difficult, lubricate cap O-ring with a small amount of petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to come in contact with membrane!** - Check stirrer periodically for rough edges that could possibly damage the membrane. - Replace transparent body immediately should it become cracked or crazed. ### Troubleshooting **Little or no filtrate obtained:** 1. Rotate pressure-relief valve to check for pressure. If not pressurized, check nitrogen source and regulator. - Make sure glossy side of disc membrane faces up. - If sample solution is highly viscous due to microsolutes, either dilute or diafilter to increase flow rate. - Check membrane holder and filtrate port for blockage. **Filtrate rate abnormally high:** 1. Check membrane for lesions, scratches, or roughness. - Make sure correct membrane type is being used. - Check stirrer assembly to ensure that stirring bar is not contacting the membrane surface. **Cell leaks:** 1. Be sure lower O-ring rests entirely on the membrane peripheral surface. - Check O-rings for nicks and cuts. - Make sure membrane support is seated properly, and that the base is screwed in firmly. - Make sure O-rings are not squeezed out of slots. - Check fittings on gas inlet tubing for correct order and position...|$|R
