5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed.</b> In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} that the DOTS (directly observed therapy, short course) strategy for tuberculosis (TB) control can contain the emergence and spread of drug resistance {{in the absence of}} second-line treatment. We compared drug-resistance levels between 1996 and 2001 in the south of Vietnam, an area with a well-functioning DOTS program. METHODS: Sputum specimens were collected from consecutively diagnosed patients with smear-positive TB at 40 randomly selected public TB clinics. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs. RESULTS: Among 888 new patients in 2001, resistance <b>to</b> any drug <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in 238 (26. 3 %), resistance <b>to</b> isoniazid <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in 154 (16. 6 %), resistance <b>to</b> rifampin <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in 22 (2. 0 %), resistance <b>to</b> ethambutol <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in 12 (1. 1 %), resistance <b>to</b> streptomycin <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in 173 (19. 4 %), and resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance [MDR]) <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in 20 (1. 8 % [95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 %- 3. 3 %]). Among 136 previously treated patients in 2001, any resistance <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in 89 (62. 9 %), and MDR <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> in 35 (23. 2 %). The prevalence of any drug resistance and of streptomycin resistance among new patients had decreased significantly (P <. 01) since 1996; there was no increase in the prevalence of MDR. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug resistance decreased despite high initial levels of resistance to isoniazid and streptomycin and despite the absence of second-line treatment. Therefore, a DOTS program can contain drug-resistant TB in this settin...|$|R

The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season, Gladys developed from a tropical wave while several hundred {{miles southwest of}} Cape Verde on September22. Initially, the tropical depression failed to strengthened significantly, but due to warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, it became Tropical Storm Gladys by September24. Despite entering a more unfavorable environment several hundred {{miles east of the}} northern Leeward Islands, Gladys became a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scaleon September28. Shortly thereafter, the storm reentered an area favorable for strengthening. Eventually, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery.|$|E

The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane (including one unnamed hurricane) of the 1968 season, Gladys formed on October13 in the western Caribbean from a broad disturbance related to a tropical wave. The storm moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane before striking Cuba on October16. Gladys later reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) just before making landfall near Homosassa on the western coast of Florida on October19. The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of Cape Hatteras on October20. The next day, Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia.|$|E
