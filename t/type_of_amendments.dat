Created through a partnership project between the City of Surrey and the University of British Columbia, the NCP includes an implicit commitment to sustainability through seven planning principles. These sustainable planning principles were compromised by amendments to the NCP to enable developers to build more ‘marketable’ projects. This analysis looks at what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> to the NCP were most prevalent, their cumulative impact in the neighbourhood as well as the sustainable planning principles affected. The NCP amendments are an example of the way the inherent conflict between land both as a social good and a private commodity is negotiated...|$|E
40|$|The study {{conducted}} a longitudinal analysis regarding Romanian profit tax regulations. Beginning {{with the first}} profit tax regulation implemented in 1991 and until now, we analyzed based on a empirical approach all {{changes that have occurred}} over time in the Romanian accounting environment. The motivation of the {{study conducted}} was based on the strong relationship between accounting and taxation in the Romanian accounting environment over time, the profit tax being one of the main items of this relation. This particular study is divided into five sections. After a short introduction and presenting the motivation of the study (section 1), in section 2 we conducted the literature review based on international and national studies regarding the profit tax regulations through the relationship between accounting and taxation. Section 3 presents a brief review of the main Romanian regulations that concerned the profit tax and the most important changes that have occurred over time. In section 4 we conducted the empirical analysis. In this section is realized a series of analysis, aiming the following: (1) the total number of regulations that have amend the main regulations presented in the previous section; (2) the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> implemented over regulations (abolishment, text amendment, adding new articles or alignments); (3) the total number of amendments approved by law withou...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{degradation}} of soil, reductions in plant growth, {{and increases in}} the frequency of wild fires are common consequences of forest operations in humid tropical forests. However, there is little available information on the interaction of plant growth, soil nutrients and microbial properties, especially in connection with man made rehabilitation of these soils. Therefore, the objectives of the work described in this thesis were as follows. Firstly, to quantify the effect of skid tracks in a forest plantation in Sabah, Malaysia, on the soil´s physical, chemical and biological properties, as well as plant production. Thirdly, to test and develop assays based on measurements of microbial respiration kinetics for assessing soil degradation and rehabilitation. Fourthly, to assess the effects of fire in a humid tropical Dipterocarp forest on the soil´s chemical and microbial properties. In the study area, where rehabilitation were tested, the growth, soil nutrient content, and soil pore distribution were severely affected by crawler tractors. About 10 days with little rain resulted in water potentials close to the permanent wilting point (- 1500 kPa) irrespective of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> applied, while outside skid tracks the soil dried at a slower rate. Fertilization and tilling of the tracks increased basal area growth of Acacia mangium from 1 to 7 m²ha⁻¹yr⁻¹, despite high soil bulk densities. Two years after the treatments many soil microbial properties had improved, although they had not returned to the levels observed outside the tracks. Microbial growth kinetics were shown to be promising tools for assessing the effect of soil disturbance and rehabilitation. The recommended water content for measurements of microbial respiration kinetics in Acrisols was - 15 to - 50 kPa. The effect of fire was either minor or positive on soil nutrient pools (partly due to the extensive leaf shedding that followed it), as measured by chemical methods. In contrast, microbially available N decreased by about 50 %...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) {{represents}} terrestrial biosphere 2 ̆ 7 s largest pool of organic carbon (OC) and {{an integral part}} of the global C cycle. Within forests of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) (Edgewater, MD), we established eight plots for long-term field manipulation experiment as well as soil and earthworm monitoring. Our objective was to compare sites with no record of significant agricultural disturbance or earthworm activity to successional forests recovering from past agriculture (60 - 132 y) that contained both native and non-native earthworms to assess dominant controlling factors for soil carbon stabilization in this complex system. Combining soil physical fractionation, organic chemical extraction techniques, and long-term microcosm laboratory incubations we were able to assess the distribution and also track the chemical fate of added plant litter into soil organic matter pools with different levels of physical and chemical protection and assess the relative importance of different SOM stabilization mechanisms of physical protection and biochemical recalcitrance to the overall stability, microbial accessibility, and temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon (SOC) at these sites. ^ We found that the presence of invasive earthworms at SERC prolonged the disturbance legacy of past agriculture activities by dramatically altering the nature of forest floor and O-horizon recovery, transporting annual input of C and N from forest floor to lower depth in the soil profile as well as increasing C and N within microaggregates. In addition, earthworms, through selective feeding habits, soil mixing dynamics, and presumed disruption of lignin degrading fungal networks, altered the SOC chemistry by promoting lignin enrichment in particulate organic matter (POM) soil pools. However, the overall stability of SOC at SERC forests, as assessed by long term soil incubations could not be attributed to any one protection or stabilization factor including chemical protection through binding with minerals, physical protection through aggregation and biochemical recalcitrance with increasing lignin concentration. In addition, other factors like soil pH and N concentration, which may also be influenced by earthworm activity or forest succession, may play an important role in driving SOC mineralization during incubation. ^ A 5 -year aboveground litter amendment experiment with both wood and leaf tissue conducted in this work illustrated how litter type interacted with earthworm abundance and species composition to control the capacity of forests to incorporate surface litter into soil fractions. For example, in young successional forests with relatively higher soil feeding endogeic earthworm species as well as higher overall earthworm abundances, amended woody tissue C was incorporated deeper depths and predominantly into POM fractions with respect to older successional sites. In addition, lignin phenols, predominantly derived from wood amendments, were selectively incorporated in both POM and silt+clay (SC) fractions in young forests but only incorporated into POM fractions in old forests. However, even with more than 2. 5 times background annual leaf litter input added annually over five years, neither total C content nor leaf-derived substituted fatty acids (SFA) concentrations increased in the old or young successional sites. ^ It was anticipated that in sites where wood amendments shifted the chemical trajectory of soil fractions to higher overall C and greater lignin soils would exhibit suppressed respiration rates and greater temperature sensitivity as compared to controls. Long-term soil incubation studies were used to assess the accessibility of and temperature sensitivity. In agreement with this hypothesis, it was found that with the incorporation of woody amendments, SOC mineralization was suppressed in both young and old forest soils, but with active pool being mostly affected in old forests while slow pool being mostly affected in young forest soils. This difference between young and old forest soils suggests that the abundant soil mixing earthworms in young sites partitioned woody carbon into more protected soil carbon pools. However, in contrast to the initial hypothesis, increased leaf litter input also had significant effect in stabilizing SOC. Specifically, with leaf amendments, C pool of old successional forests shifted to a proportionately larger active pool but with an much slower cycled slow pool, and in young forests, leaf amendments shifted soil C to a larger slow pool with similar MRT. Surprisingly, is in consistent with the result we obtained from the incubation study of background soil among different successional stages the temperature sensitivity was not affected by either <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> with distinct biochemical trajectory indicating biochemical recalcitrance is not the controlling factor on temperature sensitivity at SERC forests.

40|$|Doctoral thesisIn Ireland, the pig {{industry}} {{is concentrated in}} {{a small number of}} counties. Pig farms typically have a high stocking rate. Therefore, the disposal of slurry in a cost-effective and environmentally-responsible way is a serious issue for farmers. Slurry is commonly applied to land, but this may not be possible if the land is at, or approaching, phosphorus (P) saturation. As pig farmers dispose of slurry in the vicinity of their properties, most of the nearby land is at P saturation, so alternative treatment methods need to be utilised (e. g. constructed wetlands, anaerobic digestion, filtration) or the slurry needs to be transported to another location. These alternatives are not currently financially viable in Ireland. Existing legislation (S. I. 610 of 2010) and recent changes in the implementation of legislation governing the timing and quantities of slurry that may be applied to land, means that pig farmers will {{no longer be able to}} exceed the maximum legal application rate to land (from January 2017). European policy aiming to intensify pig production will only accentuate this problem. If pig farmers are forced, in exceptional circumstances, to land apply slurry to unsuitable land, surface and subsurface losses of nutrients and suspended solids (SS) may occur. This could be potentially problematic if the land is located in a critical source area (CSA), an area that is highly likely to pollute receiving waters. In these circumstances, a possible novel solution is to chemically amend the pig slurry prior to landspreading. This would mean that pig farmers may, in exceptional circumstances, utilise the land in the vicinity of their farms for landspreading, without releasing excessive nutrients and SS into receiving waters. However, knowledge gaps exist concerning the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> to be used, the characteristics of the soil on which they can be most effectively used, and their impact on incidental (short-term) and chronic (long-term) losses of nutrients, SS and greenhouse gas (GHG) to surface and subsurface water and the atmosphere. Therefore, the aims of this project were to: (1) identify the most appropriate chemical amendments, and their addition rates, to reduce P losses in runoff from pig slurry based on effectiveness, cost and feasibility; (2) investigate the impacts of these chemical amendments on nutrient losses in leachate, soil properties and GHG emissions; and (3) identify suitable soil types on which to landspread chemically-amended pig slurry. Laboratory bench-scale experiments were designed to identify the amendments which had the potential to reduce P in overland runoff and to quantify the stoichiometric rates at which to add them to the slurry. Based on effectiveness, cost and feasibility, the amendments identified were alum, which reduced dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in overlying water by 86 %, poly-aluminium chloride (PAC) (73 %) and ferric chloride (FeCl 3) (71 %). Following these bench-scale experiments, rainfall simulation experiments were conducted to quantify the impact of chemical amendments to slurry on surface runoff losses at various time intervals from the time of application. Poly-aluminium chloride performed best in these experiments. For the first time, the effect of these amendments on GHG emissions, soil properties and leachate was also examined. Chemical amendment did not adversely affect GHG emissions, soil properties or leachate from pig slurry, but FeCl 3 increased nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) losses. Finally, a 3 -mo incubation experiment was conducted using a range of soil types to examine the effect of amendments on the long-term plant availability of P in soil and P solubility. Alum reduced more water extractable P than PAC, but also resulted in less plant available P. Considering cost, surface runoff and subsurface leachate losses, GHG emissions and impacts on soil chemistry, PAC was found to be the most suitable amendment with which to chemically amend pig slurry. There is the potential, in combination with existing programmes of measures, to employ chemical amendment as a measure to mitigate the environmental impact arising from the landspreading of pig slurry. This should be conducted in targeted areas of the CSA and should take into account soil type and its chemical properties. Before implementation, these tests must first be validated in long-term testing at field-scale over a wide variety of soil types, and include repeated application and incorporation. At present, there is no provision in legislation for chemical amendments to be used as a mitigation measure in the land application of pig slurry, but if they are to be utilised, a regulatory framework will need to be introduced by the relevant bodies...|$|E

The decomposition of millet stalks and cattle manure applied in zai pits or at the soil surface was studied in Niger using litterbags, under controlled irrigation on-station in 1999 and on-farm in 1999 and 2000 at two locations (Damari and Kakassi) with contrasting soils. In addition, a satellite trial was conducted in 2000 on-farm at the same locations to study the relative contribution of termites to manure decomposition. Only at Damari did termite presence enhance manure decomposition, by a factor three for surface placement compared to the zai pits. At Damari, zai pits enhanced the decomposition when termite activity was suppressed. Whereas manure decomposition proceeded two to three times faster than that of millet stalks at Damari, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> had no effect on decomposition rate at Kakassi. Nutrient release followed the trend <b>of</b> organic <b>amendment</b> decomposition except for K. When applied prior to the rainy season, nutrient release rate <b>of</b> organic <b>amendments</b> strongly exceeded plant nutrient uptake, which could lead to important leaching losses during the first 4 - 6 weeks after sowing, especially for N and to a lesser extent for K. However, at harvest, total nutrient absorption by plants was generally higher than the total amount released. The results indicate a highly site-specific response <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> decomposition to zai and the need for a better timing <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> application to reduce potential leaching losses, possibly through a split application...|$|R
40|$|Zn {{accumulation}} in Solanum nigrum {{grown in}} naturally contaminated {{soil in the}} presence <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>amendments</b> was assessed. Under the same conditions, {{the response of the}} plant to inoculation with two different isolates of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Glomus claroideum and Glomus intraradices) was also evaluated. S. nigrum grown in the non-amended soil always presented higher Zn accumulation in the tissues, with the addition <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> inducing reductions <b>of</b> up to 80 and 40 %, for manure and compost, respectively, and enhancing plant biomass yields. The establishment of S. nigrum in the Zn contaminated soil combined with the application <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> led to a 70 - 80 % reduction in the amount of Zn leached through the soil. The use of S. nigrum in combination with manure appeared as an effective method for reducing the effects of soil contamination, diminishing Zn transfer to other environmental compartments via percolation...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{material}} of different origin {{is commonly used}} as fertiliser in agricultural practices. Clover and wheat straw are here {{used to determine the}} importance <b>of</b> organic <b>amendment</b> for population development of fungal feeding collembolans. Two fungal species, Alternaria infectoria and Mucor hiemalis, were inoculated in three growth substrates, clover amended soil, straw amended soil and non-amended soil, where both amendments and the soil originated from agricultural fields. Food choice as well as growth rate, survival and fecundity of the collembolan, Folsomia fimetaria, were measured when fed fungi grown in the three substrates. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> altered food quality of the two fungi, which was reflected in the collembolan food preference. Growth and fecundity of F. fimetaria were enhanced when fed M. hiemalis grown in both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> plant amended soils. F. fimetaria had a slightly higher fitness when fed A. infectoria grown in the straw amended soil, whereas it's fitness decreased when fed with A. infectoria grown in clover amended soil. We also examined how the predatory mite, Hypoaspis aculeifer, was attracted towards the two fungi as it uses the fungal odour as a potential cue of a prey habitat. H. aculeifer was attracted to both fungi when they were grown in clover amended soil where fungal growth also was observed to be massive. Thus, we conclude that amendment applications can cause effects that cascade through several trophic levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
