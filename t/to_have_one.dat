5|$|The {{species is}} partly self-compatible, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has {{nonetheless}} been shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> {{of the lowest}} outcrossing rates of any Banksia. This is probably caused by the small population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Today, silver bullion has the ISO 4217 {{currency}} code XAG, {{one of only}} four precious metals <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> (the others being palladium, platinum, and gold). Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.|$|E

5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood boards to allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal. Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

Students enrolled in the College of Education and Human Development may choose majors from among several teacher licensure areas, including early childhood (grades Pre-K to 3), Middle Childhood (grades 4 – 9), Adolescent-Young Adult (grades 7–12), Special Education (grades K–12), and foreign language (grades K–12). In addition, BGSU continues <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> of the top four programs in the United States for Industrial & Organizational Psychology per U.S. News & World Report.|$|E
5|$|Delta County has {{historically}} been advanced in education. Around the time that Cooper and the county were founded, there were already nine churches in the county. By 1880, that number had increased to nearly 30. There were a combined 998 students attending those schools, which operated 4½ months a year. In 1889, East Texas Normal College was founded in Cooper. The school did very well while located in Cooper, but the college moved to Commerce after the campus was destroyed in a fire in 1894. The school was later renamed East Texas State University, then Texas A University–Commerce. In 1896, Cooper reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> successful school located within the city proper.|$|E

After receiving 13 Emmy Award nominations and two wins for the final season, 30 Rock ended its critically acclaimed run with 112 Emmy award nominations.

In 1926, Ingram's marriage with his wife Jane was dissolved upon his instigation {{on the grounds of}} desertion on her behalf. On 10 February the following year, he married Lillian Wakeling (née Hart), a widow, at the Methodist parsonage, Malvern; the pair were later <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> son.|$|E
5|$|Frome is reputed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> or more {{systems of}} tunnels beneath {{the streets of}} the older parts of the town.

5|$|Many {{institutes of}} higher {{education}} teach music in Italy. About 75 music conservatories provide advanced training for future professional musicians. There are also many private music schools and workshops for instrument building and repair. Private teaching is also quite common in Italy. Elementary {{and high school students}} can expect <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic music theory, though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{announced}} his retirement from playing on March 21, 2015. Before the announcement, the Cleveland Cavaliers had said to Nash's agent that {{they were interested in}} him as a backup for Kyrie Irving if Nash asked for a buyout. Nash refused it, due to both his health concerns and wanting to retire as a Laker in gratitude for the opportunity given by the club. Nash was later on approached by another former team of his, the Dallas Mavericks, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> last season with them instead, but he declined due to his aforementioned health concerns.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May, with Chinese forces {{slackening}} their offensive, 3rd Ranger Company was recalled to Kimpo Airfield for parachute proficiency training, {{above the}} objections of the 3rd Infantry Division commanders who considered the company invaluable. The company spent several weeks in division reserve, and undertook various missions such as convoy security and guarding command posts, as well as surveillance and visiting patrols behind the front lines. In one of these rearguard actions, the Rangers evacuated a rundown village only <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> member of the unit, Corporal Dave Rauls, captured by three Chinese infiltrators.|$|E

5|$|Schooling is {{compulsory}} {{from the}} age of five, although free-of-charge kindergarten is available to all students beginning at age three. Approximately 94 per cent of three- and four-year-olds attend kindergarten. A number of private operators exist, but free state-run institutions are also popular. State-run Maltese kindergartens are required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> staff member present for every ten children present, while this ratio decreases to 1:20 for independently run institutions. During the kindergarten years, the focus is on play, not formal education. From kindergarten, students transition to primary school, which is compulsory {{from the age}} of five. Since 1980, all state-run primary schools have been co-educational, with many independent schools following suit. However, church-run primary schools are usually single-sex. Classes usually have a limit of thirty students, and a minimum teacher to student ratio has been set at 1:19 in all schools, whether they be state-run, church-run or independent.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, the Russian economy had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E
5|$|The cult members, squeamish about {{committing}} acts of violence, {{decide that}} Jacqueline, who is suicidal, should kill herself. When she refuses, they let her leave, but send an assassin to follow her. The assassin chases {{her through the}} darkened streets with a switchblade, but she eludes him and returns to her apartment above Dante's. She briefly encounters her neighbor, Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), {{a young woman with}} a terminal illness. Mimi confesses to Jacqueline that she's afraid to die, and plans <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> last night out on the town. Jacqueline enters her own apartment and hangs herself. The thud of the chair falling over is heard, but the sick woman does not recognize the sound as she leaves for the evening.|$|E
