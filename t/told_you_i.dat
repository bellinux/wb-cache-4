25|$|In 1975 Milligan fathered a son, James (born June 1976), in {{an affair}} with Margaret Maughan. Another child, a {{daughter}} Romany, is suspected {{to have been born}} at the same time, to a Canadian journalist named Roberta Watt. His last wife was Shelagh Sinclair, to whom he was married from 1983 to his death on 27 February 2002. Four of his children collaborated with documentary makers on a multi-platform programme called I <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>I</b> Was Ill: The Life and Legacy of Spike Milligan (2005), which then included an accompanying website (www.spikemilliganlegacy.com).|$|E

Then, when my belief on the subject could make no possible difference in your conduct, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>I</b> thought my uncle would do something for her. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so because <b>I</b> did think so,--and as your friend, <b>I</b> should have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> what <b>I</b> thought in any matter that concerned your interest." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>I</b> {{walked out}} into the open air with my grave and stern landlord. I could now see more {{perfectly}} than on the preceding night the secluded glen in which stood the two or three cottages which appeared to be the abode of him and his family.|$|R
500|$|... "The New Cup" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many noting {{that both the}} episode's plot and songs were particularly strong. According to Nielsen Media Research, on its initial broadcast, [...] "The New Cup" [...] was watched by over 500,000 people. Two songs from the episode, [...] "Sugalumps" [...] and [...] "You Don't Have to be a Prostitute", received positive critical acclaim and were later included on the band's second album I <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>I</b> Was Freaky.|$|E
2500|$|It was reputedly {{invented by}} the Australian leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett. Grimmet became so enamoured with the {{delivery}} {{that at times}} he bowled it almost as frequently as his stock leg break. The great Don Bradman once remarked to Grimmett {{that he must have}} forgotten how to bowl a leg break, as he bowled so many flippers. Ironically, Bradman was bowled shortly thereafter at a memorial match by Grimmett who produced a perfectly pitched stock ball that turned just enough to remove Bradman's off bail. [...] "There y'are Don, I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> could bowl a leg break" [...] was Grimmett's alleged response.|$|E
2500|$|Three months later, {{according}} to the caller, Ferrara learned of the Gardner theft and immediately realized that was what Donati had been referring to. Donati went to visit him again shortly afterwards at Plymouth state prison, {{where he had been}} moved as he was also facing a state murder charge. [...] "Was that you?" [...] he asked his onetime driver. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> would do it", Donati said. Ferrara counseled him not to attempt negotiations as the authorities would not be interested. [...] "They want me locked up forever, now more than ever," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|Don Felix. When thou didst reject my suit, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>I</b> {{would be}} revenged; I said a day would come when thou, so cold and haughty then, would kneel to me imploring mercy and <b>I</b> would deny <b>thee.</b> That time hath come, and I am deaf to all thy prayers.|$|R

2500|$|One of the band's songs {{entitled}} [...] "Blow Your House Down" [...] {{was featured}} in a Hollywood CGI animated film Hoodwinked, from The Weinstein Company. An instrumental version of the song was played {{in the background of}} the Granny Xtreme skiing scene. The film's soundtrack was released under Rykodisc. Most animations and visuals of Hoodwinked were created and processed at Digital Eye Candy, Makati City. One of the head animators behind the Hoodwinked team, Gorio Vicuna, is the one who designed and directed the album cover and sleeve layout of [...] "Beautiful Machines” album. A line in the lyrics of the song says “no one <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was abroad”, which in turn, the song was actually used in an international movie.|$|E
2500|$|Milligan {{died from}} kidney failure, {{at the age}} of 83, on 27 February 2002, at his home in Rye, Sussex. On the day of his funeral, 8 March 2002, his coffin was carried to St Thomas Church in Winchelsea, East Sussex, and was draped in the flag of Ireland. He had once quipped that he wanted his headstone to bear the words [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was ill." [...] He was buried at St Thomas' churchyard but the Chichester diocese refused to allow this epitaph. A {{compromise}} was reached with the Irish translation, Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite and in English, [...] "Love, light, peace". The additional epitaph [...] "Grá mór ort Shelagh" [...] can be read as [...] "Great love for you Shelagh".|$|E
2500|$|Peter Sellers died on 24 July 1980, aged 54. Michael Bentine died on 26 November 1996, aged 74. Harry Secombe died on 11 April 2001, aged 79. Milligan {{claimed to}} be {{relieved}} that Secombe had died before him, because had he died before Secombe then Secombe {{would have been in}} a position to sing at his funeral. Terence [...] "Spike" [...] Milligan died on 27 February 2002, aged 83; Secombe ended up singing at his funeral anyway, as a recording. Two years later Milligan's wish to have the words [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was ill" [...] inscribed on his gravestone was finally granted, although the church would only agree if the words were written in Irish, as Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite.|$|E

'Alack, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>I</b> am no priest,' {{said the}} hermit; 'but for such as I am, <b>I</b> bless <b>thee</b> {{with all my}} soul, thou fatherless lad,' and he laid {{his hand on the}} young lad's {{wondering}} brow, then bade him begone, since Simon and himself had much to say to one another.|$|R
2500|$|Mauer {{finished}} the 2006 regular {{season with a}} [...]347 batting average, edging the New York Yankees' Derek Jeter and Robinson Canó to win the American League batting title and become the first-ever American League catcher to win the crown and the first catcher to claim the title since Ernie Lombardi in 1942 with the Boston Braves. [...] His [...]347 average was {{the highest in the}} Major Leagues, a feat not achieved by the previous three catchers to win NL batting titles. He was the youngest player to win a batting title since Alex Rodriguez in 1996. After going 2-for-4 in the last game of the 2006 regular season, Mauer confessed to reporters, [...] "When I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t thinking about the batting title? [...] I was lying. [...] I’ve never been that nervous in my life. [...] I haven’t felt anything like that since Opening Day as a rookie." [...] Mauer won his first Silver Slugger Award in 2006, along with teammate Justin Morneau.|$|E
2500|$|... "First, I {{want to let}} {{you know}} that I came to join the revolution, not to kill the Cambodian people. Look at me now. Do you think ... am I a violent person? No. So, as far as my {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was the same as that of my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Knight was {{recorded}} berating an NCAA volunteer at a March 1995 post-game press conference following a 6560 loss to Missouri {{in the first}} round of the NCAA tournament held in Boise, Idaho. The volunteer, Rance Pugmire, informed the press that Knight would not be attending the press conference, when in reality, Knight was running a few minutes late and had planned on attending per NCAA rules. Knight was shown saying: [...] "You've only got two people that are going to tell you I'm not going to be here. One is our SID , and the other is me. Who the hell <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> wasn't going to be here? I'd like to know.
