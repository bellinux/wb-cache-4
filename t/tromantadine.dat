25|$|All medical {{applications}} known so far involve not pure adamantane, but its derivatives. The first adamantane derivative {{used as a}} drug was amantadine – first (1967) as an antiviral drug against various strains of flu and then to treat Parkinson's disease. Other drugs among adamantane derivatives include adapalene, adapromine, amantadine, bromantane, carmantadine, chlodantane, dopamantine, memantine, rimantadine, saxagliptin, <b>tromantadine,</b> and vildagliptin. Polymers of adamantane have been patented as antiviral agents against HIV.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tromantadine</b> is an {{antiviral}} medicine {{used to treat}} herpes simplex virus. It is available in a topical gel under trade names Viru-Merz and Viru-Merz Serol. Its performance is similar to aciclovir.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tromantadine</b> {{inhibits}} {{the early}} and late events in the virus replication cycle. It changes the glycoproteins of the host cells, therefore impeding the absorption of the virus. It inhibits penetration of the virus. It also prevents uncoating of the virions.|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{amantadine}} (1 -adamantanamine), <b>tromantadine</b> (N- 1 -adamantyl-N-[2 -(dimethyl amino) ethoxy]acetamide hydrochloride) inhibits {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (KOS strain) -induced cytopathic effect and virus replication with limited toxicity to the cells. Vero and HEp- 2 cells tolerated up to 2 mg of <b>tromantadine</b> per 2 X 10 (6) cells for 24 -, 48 -, or 96 -h incubation periods with little change in cell morphology. Treatment of the cells with 10 to 50 micrograms of <b>tromantadine</b> reduced {{herpes simplex virus}}-induced cytopathic effect. Treatment with 100 to 500 micrograms of <b>tromantadine</b> inhibited herpes simplex virus-induced cytopathic effect and reduced virus production. Complete inhibition of virus production was observed with treatments of 500 micrograms to 1 mg. The antiherpetic activity of <b>tromantadine</b> was dependent upon the viral inoculum size {{and the time of}} addition of the compound with respect to infection. Virion synthesis and viral polypeptide synthesis were inhibited by addition of <b>tromantadine</b> at the time of infection or 4 h postinfection. The results are consistent with <b>tromantadine</b> inhibition of an early event in herpes simplex virus infection, before macromolecular synthesis, and a late event, such as assembly or release of virus...|$|E
40|$|A simple, sensitive, {{rapid and}} precise method was {{developed}} using voltammetric techniques namely; cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse and square wave voltammetry for {{the determination of}} <b>Tromantadine</b> Hydrochloride (TH) at three different working electrodes namely; glassy carbon (GCE), carbon paste (CPE) and pencil graphite (PGE) electrodes. Firstly, we began with cyclic voltammetric analyses to optimize the voltammetric conditions. TH cyclic voltammogram revealed a well-defined irreversible anodic peak at about 0. 751 V, 0. 692 V and 0. 784 V at GCE, CPE and PGE, respectively. The oxidation process was shown to be irreversible diffusion-controlled for GCE and PGE and adsorptive stripping for CPE. Based on this study, a sensitive quantitative method is recommended for the determination of TH as a pure raw material and in its pharmaceutical formula. The proposed method is validated and compared with the results obtained from the reported valid method. It revealed good accuracy and reproducible results.

40|$|AbstractAmantadine {{and related}} {{compounds}} stabilized {{the structure of}} purified pig brain clathrin coated vesicles (CCV) at biologically relevant concentrations. Incubation of purified CCV for 30 min at 25 °C or 37 °C caused the release clathrin, as determined by a centrifugation assay, {{and a reduction in}} the number of coated vesicles, by electron microscopy. Amantadine (10 mM), <b>tromantadine</b> (1 mM), amidine D 295 (cyclohexylcarboximidamide-(N-benzyl) hydrochloride) (10 mM), chloroquin (0. 1 mM) and monodansyleadaverine (10 mM) significantly reduced the extent of dissociation...|$|E
