5|$|Via {{its website}} on February 11, WWE {{announced}} that the 2009 Draft was to take place on April 13 at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. All wrestlers, general managers, and commentators were eligible to be drafted. A supplemental draft was announced for April 15. It was announced {{on the day of}} the televised draft that for the third consecutive year, matches would determine which brand received a draft pick, and that 12 superstars were to switch brands. As in previous drafts, the purpose of the 2009 WWE draft was to increase television ratings of WWE programming and <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> the roster with new storylines for each brand.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays <b>to</b> <b>refresh.</b> For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
5|$|In Bandung, Hasan {{works for}} the Japanese {{occupation}} government and lives an ascetic lifestyle, often fasting {{for days on end}} and dunking himself into a river <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> his body between evening and morning prayers. While there, he meets his childhood friend Rusli, who introduces Hasan to his friend Kartini. Seeing that Rusli and Kartini are atheistic Marxist-Leninists, Hasan considers it his duty to return them to Islam. However, he finds himself unable to address Rusli's arguments against religion and begins doubting his faith. Soon Hasan becomes increasingly divorced from his religious upbringing, at one time skipping the mandatory maghrib prayer to watch a movie with Kartini. Through Rusli, Hasan is introduced to people from different ideologies, including the anarcho-nihilist playboy Anwar; he also begins courting Kartini.|$|E

50|$|In the Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) Officers and NCOs can {{be ordered}} <b>to</b> <b>refresher</b> {{training}} for 100 days {{in addition to their}} original military service and the rank and file (privates and other lower ranks) for 75 or 40 days. The amount of refresher training that a reservist is called to depends on the importance of the reservists assignment, deployment, the amount of special training (i.e. training that requires constant upkeep of skills) and willingness. The aim is to train the most important wartime units at intervals of about 5 years. The average duration of the exercises is approximately 5 days and nights. Many never get called <b>to</b> <b>refresher</b> training, some get called frequently and some even apply for voluntary additional training. The obligation for refresher training ends at the age of 60 for Officers and NCOs and at 50 for the lower ranks.|$|R
5|$|In 1989, the {{character}} {{was used to}} highlight another important gynaecological health issue, fibroids. The storyline sees Pauline ignoring health problems, such as chronic fatigue, and using homoeopathic preparations rather than seeking medical assistance. Her fibroids are discovered by chance, when {{the character}} Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) knocks her down in his Austin Mini. In the 1989 Boxing Day episode, Pauline spends time in hospital, recovering from a necessary hysterectomy. Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline's illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer. This was a decision {{that had been made}} by the show's boss, Mike Gibbon, <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> the format by replacing some of the serial's older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving Pauline a mystery illness. The newly appointed executive producer, Michael Ferguson, decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that Pauline, as one of the soap's original characters, was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable.|$|E
5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough <b>to</b> <b>refresh</b> the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E

40|$|DRAM {{requires}} periodic <b>refresh</b> <b>to</b> prevent {{data loss}} from charge leakage. There exists two main refresh methods em-ployed {{in the majority}} of today’s DRAM systems. The first method is <b>to</b> carry out <b>refresh</b> operations at the rank level, called all-bank refresh (REFab), which is mainly used by commodity DDR DRAM [6]. Because all-bank refresh prevents all banks within an entire DRAM rank from serving memory requests, it significantly degrades performance. The second method is <b>to</b> perform <b>refreshes</b> at the bank level, called per-bank refresh (REFpb), which is currently supported in LPDDR DRAM used in mobile platforms [7]. In contrast to REFab, REFpb enables a bank to be accessed while another bank is being refreshed, alleviating part of the negative performance impact of refresh. Unfortunately, there are two shortcomings of per-bank re-fresh. First, <b>refreshes</b> <b>to</b> different banks are scheduled in a strict round-robin order as specified by the LPDDR standard [7]. Us-ing this static policy may force a busy bank <b>to</b> be <b>refreshed,</b> delaying the memory requests queued in that bank, while other idle banks are available <b>to</b> be <b>refreshed.</b> Second, refreshing banks cannot concurrently serve memory requests. Further-more, the negative performance impact of DRAM refresh be-comes exacerbated as DRAM density increases in the future. Figure 1 shows the average performance degradation of all-bank/per-bank <b>refresh</b> compared <b>to</b> ideal baseline without any refreshes. 1 Although REFpb performs slightly better than REFab, the performance loss is still significant, especially as the den-sity grows (16. 6 % loss at 32 Gb). Therefore, the goal of our paper [1] is to provide practical mechanisms to overcome these two shortcomings to mitigate the performance overhead of DRAM refresh...|$|R
