500|$|The Huffington Post Michael Pascua praised Dempsey's character, in {{comparison}} to his performance in [...] "Good Mourning", writing: [...] "Derek was set up as a real character in the second half, not just a one-sided McDreamy. First, Arizona and Derek finally fix the problem with Andy, then the two had some genuine interaction. Derek confronted Alex about his problems with Izzie. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> talk to Mark about the hospital's situation and ended the episode by confronting a very edgy Bailey. Miraculously, he {{had the time to}} have a lot of sex with Meredith." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance, commenting: [...] "Lexie continued to evolve. I loved the anxiety that Lexie had with Callie. She wasn't really a doctor in any sense in this episode, just a friend to lean on." [...] Though he was impressed with the majority of the episode, Pascua had mixed feelings on the character of Stevens, attributing it to his dislike of Heigl.|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, saying [...] "The Walking Dead <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> {{remind us that}} there is – figuratively and literally – a {{light at the end of}} the tunnel after last week’s grim events. The intention seems to be to present us with the notion that there is, perhaps, such a thing as a happy ending just as we head into the season closer. The bright and shiny Stepford Wives feel of Terminus may be bit manufactured, but we won’t really know if this was the set up for a sucker-punch until we see the events of next week’s “A” play out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Bowdish, a Bethlehem Police detective, stated that, {{as medical}} {{personnel}} attended to Joan Porco at her home, he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> ask her whether she could identify her attacker. Bowdish {{said that when}} he asked Joan if a family member had done it, Joan used her head to indicate [...] "yes". Bowdish has maintained that when he asked her whether it had been her older son Jonathan, a Naval officer stationed in South Carolina during the attack, she shook her head, indicating it was not, but that she nodded her head up and down, indicating [...] "yes", when he asked her whether Christopher was responsible. Joan Porco's alleged identification of her son Christopher may explain why Bethlehem Police pursued her son soon after the incident, rather than conducting a broader investigation of potential suspects. She also answered in similar ways to other separate questions.|$|E
