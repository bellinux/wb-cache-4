40|$|This {{study has}} {{increased}} the viability of miniature ion <b>thruster</b> technology, advanced state-of-the-art discharge modeling, and revealed important aspects of discharge plasma processes. These extensions of existing ion <b>thruster</b> technology and understanding are necessary to fulfill the needs of future space missions. Experimental comparisons of the discharge performance of an array of miniature (3 cm diameter) ion <b>thruster</b> discharge configurations were conducted and showed that a 3 -ring configuration with length-to-diameter of 1. 0 exhibited the best performance. A compact and lightweight version of this configuration, using small accelerator grid holes, exhibited discharge losses of 250 - 550 eV/ion and propellant efficiency {{of as much as}} 87 %. This performance represents a significant advancement in miniature (less than 5 cm diameter) ion <b>thruster</b> technology and demonstrates that a miniature ion <b>thruster</b> of low magnet and <b>thruster</b> weight can yield desirable performance. A multi-component hybrid 2 -D computational Discharge Model was developed to help identify important ion <b>thruster</b> discharge processes and investigate miniaturization issues. Combining experimental and computational results reveals that magnetic field optimization for a miniature ion <b>thruster</b> is bracketed by considerations of primary electron utilization and discharge stability. Discharge Model analysis of the larger (30 cm diameter) NSTAR <b>thruster</b> revealed that the peak observed in the NSTAR beam profile is due to double ions that are created by over-confinement of primary electrons on the <b>thruster</b> axis. Design sensitivity results show that, at the NSTAR <b>thruster</b> scale, efficient confinement of primary electrons is relatively easy to achieve; therefore, efforts to improve <b>thruster</b> performance should focus on effectively utilizing the primary electrons to minimize double ion production and maximize the number of single ions extracted to the beam. The observations from this study have furthered the understanding of discharge processes and should improve future ion <b>thruster</b> design and modeling efforts.
