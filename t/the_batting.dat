5|$|In 1936 Mitchell-Innes {{was elected}} {{captain of the}} Oxford team. The side lacked <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> {{strength}} of the previous years, and {{he was forced to}} move himself from his preferred position of batting at number three or four, to open <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> during the season. <b>The</b> <b>batting</b> suffered a further blow just prior to the University match when Roger Kimpton suffered an injury and was unable to play. Along with Kimpton, Mitchell-Innes led <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> averages by a large margin, having scored 917 runs at 43.66. He also reached his highest score in first-class cricket against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, scoring 207 runs. Oxford lost more matches than they won during the season, including an eight-wicket loss to Cambridge in the University match. Despite the loss, the match was Mitchell-Innes' most successful contest against Cambridge, as he scored 43 and 84. During this season, Mitchell-Innes had his most effective spell as a bowler, taking 22 wickets for Oxford at an average of 26.27, but Bolton described the team's bowling performances as unremarkable.|$|E

50|$|Rinehart later {{denied that}} <b>The</b> <b>Bat</b> was {{connected}} to The Circular Staircase after the works similarities led to legal troubles over film rights.

However, Selig re-released the 1915 Circular Staircase under <b>the</b> title <b>The</b> <b>Bat.</b> Rinehart tried to file suit to keep Selig from using <b>the</b> title. <b>The</b> <b>Bat</b> led to several adaptations of its own. In 1926 Rinehart licensed a novelization of <b>The</b> <b>Bat,</b> published under her name but written by Stephen Vincent Benét, partly to distance <b>The</b> <b>Bat</b> from <b>The</b> Circular Staircase.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bat</b> is {{currently}} {{on display in the}} Baseball Hall of Fame, where it has been since 1987. During a broadcast of Mike & Mike in the Morning, ESPN analyst Tim Kurkjian stated that Brett used <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> for a few games after the incident until being cautioned that <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> would be worthless if broken.

50|$|According to Oaxacan mythology, <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> nocturnal {{nature can}} be traced back to its ancient jealousy of birds' feathers. One day, as the myth goes, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> felt {{isolated}} and undesirable, and told God that he was cold. God, fair and just, turned to birds in the animal kingdom and asked if they would show compassion and donate a feather to <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> to help him keep warm. The birds all agreed and began to pluck one feather from their bodies to give to <b>the</b> <b>bat.</b> With all of these feathers, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> became even more magnificent-looking than all birds, and was able to spread color to the night sky. During daylight, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> created rainbows that reflected vibrant colors from the sun. With his new beauty and abilities, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> soon became arrogant and conceited. The birds grew tired of <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> self-glorification and decided to fly up to heaven and ask God to do something. When the birds told God of <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> behaviour, He was surprised and decided to take a look Himself. When on earth, God called on <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> to show him what he was doing. <b>The</b> <b>bat</b> began to fly across the light blue sky where, one by one, each feather began to fall out, uncovering <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> natural, ugly-looking body. When all his feathers were gone, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> became distressed and ashamed of his appearance. He decided to hide in caves during the day and only come out during the night to search for his long-lost feathers.|$|R

5|$|Macartney's batting in the Test {{series was}} largely unsuccessful. He made two fifties, but {{otherwise}} {{failed to pass}} 20 and ended with 153 runs at 19.13. In his era, the expectation was that batsmen {{would be able to}} bat in a variety of positions and Macartney was gradually moved from seventh down to tenth in <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> order {{by the end of the}} tour. Largely due to his efforts at Headingley, his bowling figures were more impressive; he ended the Tests with 16 wickets at 16.13. At this stage of his career, Macartney was regarded as a bowling all-rounder. He was only eighth on <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> averages for the tour, with 503 first-class runs at 16.77, but took 71 wickets at an average of 17.46 in eight matches.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trampoline}} effect, {{which is}} common terminology for baseball players, is the phenomenon when the baseball [...] "jumps" [...] off <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> at contact. <b>The</b> bat-ball collision {{can be demonstrated}} from the physics of elastic collisions. The stiffer the barrel of <b>the</b> <b>bat,</b> <b>the</b> slower the baseball comes off <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> because it loses energy in the collision. The softer the barrel of <b>the</b> <b>bat,</b> <b>the</b> faster the baseball comes off <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> because it retains its energy applied by the pitcher. The trampoline effect has been experimentally tested, and results show that composite bats outperform all-aluminum <b>bats.</b> <b>The</b> reason why composite bats outperform other aluminum <b>bats</b> is that <b>the</b> trampoline effect can essentially be [...] "tuned." [...] Composite materials have properties that are different in all directions, or anisotropy, which allows <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> manufacturer to design <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> stiff longitudinally (along the handle) and softer circumferentially (around the barrel). This softer barrel allows the ball to come off with less energy loss while maintaining the stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> in <b>the</b> handle.|$|R

50|$|According to a {{particular}} East Nigerian tale, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> developed its nocturnal habits after causing {{the death of his}} partner, <b>the</b> bush-rat. <b>The</b> <b>bat</b> and <b>the</b> bush-rat would share activities, such as rummaging through the grass and trees, hunting, talking and bonding during the day. When at night, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> and <b>the</b> bush-rat would alternate in cooking duties, cooking what was caught, and eat together. It appeared to be a dedicated partnership, but <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> hated <b>the</b> bush-rat immensely. The bush-rat always found <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> soup more appetising, so when eating dinner one night, asked <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> why <b>the</b> soup tasted better than his own and also asked how it was made. <b>The</b> <b>bat</b> agreed to show him how to make it the next day, but instead was forming a malicious plan.|$|R

5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced {{by the fact that}} a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more.

5|$|England batted for {{the second}} time, and after lunch on the fourth afternoon, Bradman set fields to {{restrict}} the scoring, as England passed 100 without loss. Washbrook then hooked Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take the catch. He repeated the shot soon after and Harvey took the catch at 1/129, so the Australian captain's miss cost little. Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 2/129. During most of the afternoon, Bradman used a strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells, and set a defensive, well-spread field for Johnson, who had been repeatedly attacked by the batsmen. England then reached 8/362 at the close, a lead of 400. England batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 8/365. As <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> team is allowed to choose which (if any) roller can be used {{at the start of}} the day's play, this ploy allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia in order to make <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> conditions harder for England. At the start of any innings, <b>the</b> <b>batting</b> captain also has the choice of having the pitch rolled. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would disadvantage his batsmen.|$|E
