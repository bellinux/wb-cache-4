English-language educational programme You Say the Word began in 1971, catering to non-English-speaking immigrants. Long-running entertainment program Variety Italian Style premiered in 1974, with Malcom Elliott initially hosting the short-lived Tonight Show in 1981 being replaced by John <b>Tingle</b> a year later.

40|$|Background: Chemotherapy-induced {{peripheral}} neuropathy (CIPN) {{is characterized by}} numbness, <b>tingling,</b> and shooting/burning pain. This analysis was performed to describe the relationship between numbness, <b>tingling,</b> and shooting/burning pain in patients with CIPN, as reported using the EORTC QLQ-CIPN 20 (CIPN 20). Methods: Baseline CIPN 20 data were provided for all patients on a prospective trial designed to treat patients with bothersome CIPN. Baseline frequencies for {{the items on the}} CIPN 20 are primarily described by descriptive statistics and histograms, with correlational analyses between individual items. Results: A majority of the 199 patients accrued to this study reported "quite a bit" to "very much" numbness (57 %) or <b>tingling</b> (63 %) in the hands compared to "a little" or "not at all" (numbness (43 %), <b>tingling</b> (38 %)). Fewer patients reported "quite a bit" to "very much" shooting/burning pain in the hands (18 %). Numbness and <b>tingling</b> in the hands were highly correlated (r[*]=[*] 0. 69), while neither were highly correlated with shooting/burning pain. Similar results were observed in the feet. More severe ratings for <b>tingling</b> and shooting/burning pain were ascribed to the lower extremities, as opposed to the upper extremities. Conclusions: In patients with CIPN, severe sensory neuropathy symptoms (numbness, <b>tingling)</b> commonly exist without severe neuropathic pain symptoms (shooting/burning pain), while the reverse is not common. Symptoms in the feet should be evaluated distinctly from those in the hands as the experience of symptoms is not identical, for individual patients, in upper versus lower extremities...|$|R

25|$|Captain Edward John Smith, {{the most}} senior of the White Star Line's captains, was {{transferred}} from Olympic to take command of Titanic. Henry <b>Tingle</b> Wilde also came across from Olympic to take the post of Chief Mate. Titanics previously designated Chief Mate and First Officer, William McMaster Murdoch and Charles Lightoller, were bumped down to the ranks of First and Second Officer respectively. The original Second Officer, David Blair, was dropped altogether. The Third Officer was Herbert Pitman MBE, the only deck officer {{who was not a}} member of the Royal Naval Reserve. Pitman was the second to last surviving officer.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} about 12:45a.m., an hour after Titanic struck the iceberg at 11:40p.m. on 14 April, that the first {{lifeboat}} was lowered into the sea. The boats were lowered in sequence, from the middle forward then aft, with First Officer William McMaster Murdoch, Third Officer Herbert Pitman and Fifth Officer Harold Lowe working on the starboard side, and Chief Officer Henry <b>Tingle</b> Wilde and Second Officer Charles Lightoller working on the port side, {{with the assistance of}} Captain Edward Smith. The collapsible boats were dealt with last, as they could not be launched until the forward davits were clear.|$|E
25|$|The series {{continued}} with Scream 3, which received its premiere on February 3, 2000 at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood, California and was generally released on February 4, 2000. Like previous entries, {{the film was}} directed by Craven, but Williamson was unable to formulate a complete script due to {{his commitment to the}} short-lived television series Wasteland and his original film Teaching Mrs. <b>Tingle</b> (1999), being replaced by Ehren Kruger who finalized a script based on several ideas supplied by Williamson. The film focuses on Sidney Prescott who faces a new Ghostface killer and the truth about her mother that led {{to the start of the}} Ghostface killings. The film, like its predecessors, featured characters who were self-aware of horror conventions, in this case the rules and structure of the final entry in a movie trilogy. Scream 3 was considerably less successful than the previous two installments, suffering both financially and critically, commentators noting that the film had become akin to the horror films it originally parodied in Scream and Scream 2. Others were critical of the change in tone, focusing more on humor instead of horror and violence. However, critics who reacted positively were supportive of this change in tone and praised the film for successfully completing the film trilogy.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} difficulties in daily activities and <b>tingling</b> from patients having treatment of FOLFOX chemotherapy after colon resection. Method: This study included 103 patients hospitalized for FOLFOX chemotherapy in one of the university affiliated hospital from August 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009. Data were collected using the questionnaire comprised general symptoms, <b>tingling,</b> difficulties in daily activities and coping behavior. Using the SPSS 14. 0 program, data analytic methods include Chi-Square test, ANOVA, Scheffe's test. Results: The <b>tingling</b> sensation occurred in hands, feet, mouth, throat. Contacts with cold objects and the number of chemotherapy cycle worsen <b>tingling</b> sensation. Patients experienced difficulties in daily activities such as personal hygiene, kitchen work, eating cold food, sleeping cold, using fine motors like button up, writing, or using knife. The coping behavior included drinking warm water, sleeping warm, using gloves and socks, wearing comfortable shoes, massaging hands and getting help from supporters. Conclusion: An educational guideline for promoting coping behavior to relieve <b>tingling</b> sensation and difficulty in daily living in patients wit...|$|R

IGN editor Fran Mirabella said the cartoon look [...] "works very nicely" [...] and that [...] "it feels very much like Zelda". The whimsical style was compared to [...] and promotional artwork from previous Zelda games.

[...] Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. [...] "Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)" ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas became {{involved}} with the Miami Theater, and wrote some one-act plays that were fashionable in the 1930s. One, entitled [...] "The Gallows Gate", was about an argument between a mother and father regarding the character of their son who is sentenced to hang. She got the idea from her father, who had witnessed hangings when {{he lived in the}} West and was unnerved by the creaking sound of the rope bearing the weight of the hanging body. The play won a state competition, and eventually $500 in a national competition after it was written into three acts. With William W. Muir, husband of reporter Helen Muir, she authored a play called [...] "Storm Warnings" [...] loosely based on the life of mobster Al Capone. Some of Capone’s henchmen showed up at the theater, “add an extra <b>tingle</b> for the audience that night”, though no actual problems arose. Douglas wrote the foreword to the Work Projects Administration's guide to Miami and environs, published in 1941 as part of the Federal Writers' Project's American Guide Series.|$|E
