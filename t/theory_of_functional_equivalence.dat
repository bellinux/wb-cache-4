Starting from the general qualitative concept of orbital signature, the paper (i) {{develops a}} general monotonicity-ofsignatures property for arbitrary unimodal functions, (ii) characterizes the signature repertoires of arbitrary unimodal functions, and (iii) develops the resulting theory of system equivalence for signature-distinct unimodals. The systems encompassed by this theory subsume those having dense orbital behavior (a class already considered in part by the authors) and the developed theory has potential applicability to the biological sciences, as well as to system theory in general...|$|E

It can be applied as a guiding criterion in Chinese idiom translation. This paper attempts to apply the functional equivalence theory to the English translation of Chinese idioms so as to overcome the difficulties encountered by translation practitioners. After the study on literal, free translation and other feasible translating methods, the author believes {{that it is only}} the equivalence in both meaning and function that the essence of Chinese idiom translation counts on. In other words, after reading the translation, the target language readers should react the same as the source language readers do to the biggest degree...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{consists of}} the Czech translation of a part of Arnaud Tomès's foreword to J. -P. Sartre's essay Esquisse d'une théorie des émotions (Sketch for a Theory of the Emotions) and of a theoretic annotation of this translation. The source text was written for a 2010 reprint of Sartre's essay and comprises a thorough analysis of Sartre's conception of emotions based upon E. Husserl's phenomenology. The annotation, which centres on the source text's analysis, the applied translation method and procedures together with encountered translation problems, is based upon an adapted version of Christiane Nord's Model and the <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>Equivalence</b> as described by Dagmar Knittl.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out what kind of shifts exist in the {{translation}} of inter-sentential conjunctive relations in the novel, Animal Farm, from English to Hausa based on Catford‘s (1965) notion of shifts in translation. The two novels used as the sources of data for this study were the source text in English, Animal Farm and its target language translation in Hausa, Gandun Dabbobi. Two hundred and fifty-two sentences containing inter-sentential conjunctive relations were extracted from each text, making the total number of five hundred and four sentences from both texts. Halliday and Hasan‘s (1976) Table of Conjunctive Relations was used to identify the different conjunctive relations. Equally, the effects of the shifts on the target language were also studied and explained in the data. This was done using Nida‘s (1964) <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> formal and <b>functional</b> <b>equivalence.</b> Thirty different forms of shifts were found under three out of the five major classifications of shifts according to Catford (1965). These included seven forms of structure shifts, seven forms of unit shifts, with class shifts being the most common with sixteen different forms. Furthermore, this study also revealed that all the categories of conjunctive relations: additives, adversatives, causal and temporal were shifted in the translation but their shifts differed between one class of conjunctions to another. The findings also show that, apart from shifts, other strategies of translation such as maintaining formal correspondence and omissions were also found along with shifts in the translation of inter-sentential conjunctive relations from English to Hausa...|$|R

40|$|After 700 {{years of}} common-law history and nearly 200 years of {{constitutional}} history, the Supreme Court {{concluded that the}} constitutionally permissible minimum jury size could not be inferred from the language or {{the history of the}} Constitution. The answer, said the Court in Williams v. Florida, could be found only through a “functional analysis” of the performance of smaller juries (that is, empirical examination of the behavior of different-sized juries). The Court implicitly abandoned that analysis in Ballew v. Georgia, when it held that juries with fewer than six members were unconstitutional-a decision based on nothing more than the ipse dixit of the Justices. This Essay sets out the historical and empirical infirmities of the Williams line of cases. It summarizes the jury sizes required in criminal prosecutions throughout the United States; examines the Sixth Amendment history of the jury trial; argues that this history supports the position that the Constitution intended twelve-person juries; reviews Florida’s jury trial history; and summarizes the empirical research undertaken since Williams. This Essay concludes that at present no sound basis exists in law for knowing the minimum size of a constitutionally permissible jury. Williams, having become a dead letter in Ballew, should either be ratified (and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>equivalence</b> applied conscientiously) or be formally reversed to allow courts either to develop a sound theory of the constitutionality of jury size or to restore the jury to its traditional size...|$|E
40|$|The {{film is a}} {{means of}} mass {{entertainment}} which has become part of our daily lives. As more and more English films are imported to China, intercultural communication becomes an important component in the mass media. It allows film translators to make adaptation based on the source text in order to create accessible text which fulfills the need of the target community. However, due to the eminent cultural differences, film as a branch of literary translation, when translated, critical factors such as history and tradition must be carefully reviewed. Film translators are required to make appropriate adaptations based on the source text, retain the intended message of the source language, and eliminate the cultural gaps so that the target language audience can better comprehend and appreciate the film correctly. However, even in Chinese speaking areas such as Chinese Mainland and Taiwan the linguistic translation strategies adopted in the same film are disparate. In order {{to improve the quality of}} film translation, we need to have some systematic theories to guide translators on how to make flexible adaptations. Hoping to provide a new perspective for common film translation studies in Chinese Mainland and Taiwan, this explanatory study of film translation focuses on the different methods adopted by translators during the process of translating a foreign film in Chinese Mainland and Taiwan through a theoretical exploration of the translation, attempting to find a norm and to formulate a guiding theory for translation in Chinese speaking areas. This paper attempts to construct a theoretical framework for this intercultural production. It first gives a brief introduction of the state of the art in film translation, its gaining popularity, and its empowerment potentials. Then the paper proposes to integrate different theoretical traditions in translation studies in order to formulate a conceptual and theoretical framework that could be used to better comprehend the social dynamics surrounding subtitling, editing, revising and marketing strategies. <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>equivalence,</b> relevance theory and reception theory are critically reviewed and integrated. It also argues that audiences and translators are playing a decisive role in film translation...|$|E

40|$|Motor imagery, or {{the mental}} {{rehearsal}} of {{actions in the}} absence of physical movement, is an increasingly popular construct in fields such as neuroscience, cognitive psychology and sport psychology. Unfortunately, few models of motor imagery have been postulated to date. Nevertheless, based on the hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>functional</b> <b>equivalence</b> between imagery, perception and motor execution, Holmes and Collins in 2001 developed the PETTLEP model of motor imagery in an effort to provide evidence-based guidelines for imagery practice in sport psychology.
