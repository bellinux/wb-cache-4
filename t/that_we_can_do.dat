The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which {{is the end of}} our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E

25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E

500|$|In March 1921, strikes {{erupted in}} Petrograd when workers {{took to the}} streets {{demanding}} better food rations and more union autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: [...] "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal." [...] The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. [...] "More and more", she wrote, [...] "we {{have come to the conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing here.

500|$|Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke {{said that}} [...] "It {{was such a}} major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, {{and we had to}} do it in {{different}} stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's taken two years– getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, a {{news conference}} {{was held in the}} grand showroom. Giles {{emphasized}} the importance of the route as an indication of the future, both for civil and military aircraft. He warned: [...] "Now that we have proved <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it, we must now remember that any future enemy will also be able to do it". LeMay declared that he wanted a second chance to prove that the B-29 was capable of flying 6,500 miles nonstop. He said, [...] "When we took off at Hokkaido we had a little headwind and expected it. However, all our information indicated that once we passed Fairbanks it would drop. We didn't need a tailwind. All we needed was a nice normal wind to arrive on schedule. The buffeting headwind averaged 70 mph" [...] (110km/h). After the reporters were finished, Giles presented all the airmen with the Distinguished Flying Cross. Giles told the men that each one could keep his personal military equipment as a memento of the flight, including parachutes. They were offered free rides home on military aircraft. Potts refused the parachute and the ride, telling Giles, [...] "Thank you, general, I think I'll take the train!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared in the}} subsequent press conference where Alonso said {{that the decision to}} run a shorter second stint than Kubica (between the first and second pit stops) was his decision: [...] "Sometimes you can do it, sometimes you can't but today the car was perfect and I was able to do it." [...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling I have now is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E
500|$|It was a {{night of}} {{contrasting}} emotions at Home Park. A 2–0 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle's relegation to League One and Newcastle's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt. Hours after the match, the club's board declared that it remained determined to steer {{it to the top}} flight of English football. Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club, vowing to put things right. [...] "I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start," [...] he said. [...] "The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership. Now we've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but I firmly believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Argyle's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest, who had already qualified for the play-off's, and they secured a comfortable 3–0 victory against the relegated side. The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May. Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that." [...] Work on a new state-of-the-art Fibrelastic pitch at Home Park began the following week.|$|E

Reasonable exercise stimulates cartilage growth and reduces degeneration (though excessive exercise can do harm too), and also regular long walks in early or mild dysplasia can help prevent loss of muscle mass to the hips. Medication can reduce pain and discomfort, and also reduce damaging inflammation.|$|E

According to Corbyn, [...] "This war is about oil, control and a message {{to the rest of the}} world and region <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it if we want to".
