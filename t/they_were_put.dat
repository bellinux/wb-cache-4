5|$|After {{the loss}} of Invincible, the two {{surviving}} ships had an uneventful time {{for the rest of}} the war conducting patrols of the North Sea, as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into reserve in early 1919 and sold for scrapping on 1 December 1921.|$|E
5|$|Two French-made s were {{commissioned}} in 1928–1929. Both were {{captured by the}} Italians during the April 1941 invasion, after which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into service as training and experimentation boats under new names.

In 2010, the Bermuda Triangle ride closed, sitting dormant until mid-2012 when construction for the Storm Coaster began. After demolition works were completed, track for the Storm Coaster arrived at Sea World, taking five months to erect. Storm Coaster officially {{opened to the public}} on 6 December 2013.|$|E

5|$|Wholesale funding {{disappeared}} in September 2008 {{leading to the}} collapse of Glitnir, Kaupthing and Landsbanki. Due {{to the size of the}} combined balance sheet of those banks the government of Iceland did not have the means to save those banks. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into receivership instead with their boards replaced. Nevertheless, the failed banks were restructured by dividing them into a new and an old bank in order to avoid a credit crunch.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{the residents}} formed the Vigilance Association {{with the intent}} of protecting their interests during the establishment of the new capital territory. Legal challenges to the resumption of the land were unsuccessful, but the Vigilance Association did win some concessions: the government agreed to pay for the improvements to the land, and did so at the value when the land was acquired; and the landowners gained the right of first refusal on their old properties when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> up for lease. As of 2010 all residential land in the ACT is held on a 99-year crown lease.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, 1862, Cox {{began moving}} his Kanawha Division toward Washington as {{reinforcement}} for Major General John Pope's Army of Virginia. Exceptions to Cox's orders were the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry and two regiments of Ohio infantry, which {{remained in the}} area for defensive purposes. The three regiments moved to Kanawha Falls in what is now south central West Virginia, {{at the beginning of the}} Kanawha River—which flows to the Ohio River. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> under the command of Colonel Joseph Andrew Jackson Lightburn. Thus, the two battalions of 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry were reunited, with Colonel John C. Paxton commanding the cavalry regiment. Confederate leaders soon learned of the force reduction, and made plans to drive the Union army out of the Kanawha Valley.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th RCT front, at {{the eastern}} end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support {{battalion}} to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach. Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred yards to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it – <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> out of action for several hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of St James' Church {{was commissioned by}} Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1819, designed by the convict architect Francis Greenway and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using convict labour. Governor Macquarie and Commissioner John Bigge laid the foundation stone on Thursday, 7 October 1819. The building was originally intended {{to serve as a}} courthouse as Macquarie had plans for a large cathedral to be built on the present location of St Andrew's Cathedral but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> on hold by the intervention of Bigge who had been appointed to conduct a Royal Commission into the colonial government. Bigge initially approved of the courthouse project but by February 1820, less than four months after his arrival, he strongly recommended its conversion into a church.|$|E

5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also {{accepted into the}} military in the U.S. Women's Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation of the American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by {{the military in the}} 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the Hall are {{decorated}} with paintings of noted patrons or members of the Inn, including Nicholas Bacon and Elizabeth I. During the Second World War the Hall {{was one of those}} buildings badly damaged during the Blitz. The Treasurers' Arms and paintings had been moved to a place of safety and were not damaged; during the rebuilding after the War <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> back in the Hall, where they remain. The rebuilt hall was designed by Edward Maufe, and was formally opened in 1951 by the Duke of Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|When Galveston's {{second major}} {{hurricane}} hit the Texas coastline in mid-August 1915, {{most of the}} Army units had scattered to safe locations away from the storm's path, with a few units remaining in the secure buildings of Fort Crockett or in downtown Galveston. The Middletons chose to ride out the storm at the Hagemann house. Following the storm cleanup, in October 1915, the 7th Regiment was ordered to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas as events in Mexico flared up again. Here <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> {{under the command of}} Brigadier General John Pershing, a highly capable officer who had skipped three ranks by being promoted from captain to brigadier general for his exceptional service during the Philippine-American War.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{then went}} to Maine and the Virginia Capes for battle practice, after which {{she went into the}} Philadelphia Naval Yard for an overhaul. After more than 15 weeks, Connecticut emerged on 15 January 1915 and steamed south to Cuba, where she {{conducted}} training exercises. During maneuvers there in March 1915, a chain wrapped around her starboard propeller, breaking the shaft and forcing her return to Philadelphia for repairs. She remained there until 31 July, when she embarked 433 men from the Second Regiment, First Brigade, of the United States Marine Corps for transport to Port-au-Prince, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> ashore on 5 August as part of the US occupation of Haiti. Connecticut delivered supplies to amphibious troops in Cap-Haïtien on 5 September and remained near Haiti for the next few months, supporting landing parties ashore, including detachments of Marines and sailors from Connecticut under the command of Major Smedley Butler. After departing Haiti, Connecticut arrived in Philadelphia on 15 December and was placed into the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Braathens SAFE {{started looking for}} a {{replacement}} for the aging DC-3s and Herons. An order was placed with Fokker for the delivery of their new Fokker F-27 Friendship, a two-engine turboprop with cabin pressurization. Braathens SAFE was the second airline to receive the plane, after Aer Lingus. The first craft, LN-SUN, was delivered in December 1958, with the second, LN-SUO, delivered the following year. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into service on the main routes: once daily Oslo–Trondheim, once daily Oslo–Ålesund, twice daily Oslo–Stavanger, including one stopping at Kristiansand, and one trip daily Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim. The delivery of the Friendships made the Herons unnecessary, and these were sold. The two DC-3s were kept as a reserve, and {{were used for the}} first part of the summer schedules because of late delivery of LN-SUO. They were also used for charter. The airports at Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg had too short runways for the Friendship, and these destinations were terminated.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September 1996, NSB's {{administration}} {{recommended that}} the purchase be terminated. However, this was put on hold by the board. Instead, a renegotiated contract was signed, whereby Siemens was obliged to deliver the locomotives, as specified, by mid-1997. If not, the two parties agreed that the contract would be terminated. By late 1996, five locomotives had been delivered, and these were returned to Kiel for upgrades. The first returned to Norway on 30 November 1996, after the ventilator motors had been upgraded, new oil coolers installed and other minor upgrades had been performed. From January 1997, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into regular use with freight trains on the Nordland Line. In mid-1997, number 664 was damaged in a fire caused by an incorrectly mounted exhaust system. In October 1997, cracks {{were found in the}} wheels, and all units were taken out of service while they were being fixed.|$|E
5|$|Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse {{remained}} in the armored squadron for the training cruises starting in 1879 through 1883, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into reserve and replaced by newer vessels, including the four s. The two ships were reactivated in 1889 to participate in cruises following the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These included a state visit to Great Britain in August 1889 and {{a tour of the}} Mediterranean in the winter of 1889–1890. The two ships resumed their duties in the training cycles into the early 1890s. Although Preussen was withdrawn from active service in 1891, Friedrich der Grosse continued to serve until the end of 1894. Upon leaving active duty, both ships were used in secondary roles as harbor ships and later as coal hulks for torpedo boats. They were both ultimately sold for scrapping in 1919 following the end of World War I. Both vessels were broken up by 1920.|$|E
5|$|Since {{fractional}} {{currency in}} three-cent denominations {{did not appear}} until late 1864, the cent was the only means then circulating of making change from the five-cent note, and came, in 1862 and 1863, to command a premium when sold in lots, of about 4%. The Philadelphia Mint tried {{to keep up with}} demand, limiting public purchases of cents to five dollars, and sending shipments to major cities. Despite these attempts, Mint Director James Pollock noted in his annual reports that cents were almost unobtainable, hoarded despite the fact that their metallic value remained less than one cent each. Numismatist Neil Carothers theorized that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> aside by the public as the only circulating federal coinage, made of metal {{at a time when the}} public was forced to accept flimsy pieces of paper instead of silver and gold.|$|E
