5|$|The Raptor's {{aerodynamic}} performance, sensor fusion, and stealth {{work together}} for increased effectiveness. Altitude, speed, and advanced active and passive sensors allow the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> targets at considerable ranges and increase weapons range; altitude and speed also complement stealth's ability to increase the aircraft's survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} {{commissioned}} during World War II, the Iowa-class battleships came equipped with two aircraft catapults designed to launch floatplanes. Initially, the Iowas carried the Vought OS2U Kingfisher and Curtiss SC Seahawk, {{both of which}} were employed <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> for the battleship's main gun batteries—and, in a secondary capacity, perform search-and-rescue missions.|$|E
5|$|According to folklore, the priory {{is haunted}} by {{the ghost of a}} monk in a black habit who returns {{annually}} to check that its buried treasure has not been disturbed. He is said to arrive at midnight on the year's first new moon to lower a ghostly drawbridge spanning a vanished moat. In 1966 and 1967 a hundred people turned out to watch and allegedly managed <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> a cowled figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up saw nothing.|$|E

In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine, the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> the fall of shells and eliminated {{the problem of the}} ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast.

5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target.

5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis makes it easy <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E

5|$|Princess Royal {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their {{guns on the}} target, the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as {{it was easier for}} the director <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.|$|E
5|$|Some Tornado {{variants}} carry different avionics and equipment, {{depending on}} their mission. The Tornado ECR is devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) missions, operated by Germany and Italy. The Tornado ECR is equipped with an emitter-locator system (ELS) <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> radar use. German ECRs have a Honeywell infrared imaging system for reconnaissance flights. RAF and RSAF Tornados have the Laser Range Finder and Marked Target Seekers (LRMTS) for targeting laser-guided munitions. In 1991, the RAF introduced TIALD, allowing Tornado GR1s to laser-designate their own targets.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

50|$|The roll yield is {{the yield}} that a futures {{investor}} captures as their long {{position in a}} futures contract converges <b>to</b> the <b>spot</b> price; in a backwardated futures market the price rolls up <b>to</b> the <b>spot</b> price, so the roll yield is positive, whereas when the market is in contango the price rolls down <b>to</b> the <b>spot</b> price, so the roll yield is negative. The spot price can stay constant, but the investor will still earn returns from buying discounted futures contracts, which continuously roll up <b>to</b> the constant <b>spot</b> price.|$|R
5|$|The {{search in}} {{databases}} of stellar objects performed by Batygin and Brown has already excluded {{much of the}} sky the predicted planet could be in, save the direction of its aphelion, or in the difficult <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> backgrounds where the orbit crosses {{the plane of the}} Milky Way, where most stars lie.

5|$|Whilst nearly {{fifteen of}} the tenders {{remained}} wedded {{to their original}} locomotives, others received new partners - the very first tender to be manufactured swapped partners seven times. After the Second World War, when the streamlined tenders were de-streamlined, it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> any mismatches. The most readily visible mismatches were those of locomotives Nos. 6249–6252 where pre-produced Type 'A' streamlined tenders were married to unstreamlined locomotives.|$|E
5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E

5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden {{close to the ground}} and therefore difficult for passers-by <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high fire danger.|$|E
