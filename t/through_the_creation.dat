40|$|Introduction: Wikis are {{multiuser}} platforms {{that have}} been used with positive results for learning in higher education. As knowledge artefacts they include both semiotic and material aspects that could potentially be realized through collaborative learning and the assessment of interprofessional and problem based learning using portfolios. Purpose: The aim of the present study is to investigate students’ perceptions of learning <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> collaborative <b>creation</b> and use of wikis. Method: Sixteen students from an interprofessional course module participated in the study. The thesis uses semi-structured interviews with a qualitative phenomenographic approach. Results: The informants’ perceptions of learning <b>through</b> <b>the</b> collaborative <b>creation</b> and use of wikis are described as a four category hierarchy that represents the outcome space: Course task oriented compilation of texts Preparatory exam compendium Representative knowledge artefact Knowledge artefact for future professional practice Conclusion: Students’ different perceptions of learning <b>through</b> <b>the</b> collaborative <b>creation</b> and use of wikis as presented as the outcome space can be understood as variations of how they perceive the resulting product, the process involved and the orientation of the wiki work, from a surface and task oriented work to deeper contextual learning. Well designed, wiki support problem based learning and assessment using portfolios as well as interprofessional learning for future professional practice. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{political}} and economic power increasingly concentrated in Lima, the capital city, several administrations tried to decentralize the country with little success. The 1979 Peruvian Constitution contained provisions for the decentralization of power <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of autonomous regions, {{but they were not}} implemented. During the later years of the 19851990 presidency of Alan García, the government faced the prospect of losing the 1990 presidential elections because of a widespread economic crisis and faltering public support. As a way of creating an alternative source of power, the regime established twelve autonomous regions on January 20, 1989 in the hope of winning some elections at this level. However, due to the haste of their creation, these regional governments were not provided with fiscal resources of their own so they depended on the goodwill of the central government for funding.|$|E
5|$|By {{succeeding}} her husband, Ranavalona {{became the}} first female sovereign of the Kingdom of Imerina {{since its founding in}} 1540. Her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the traditional culture of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of new forms of kinship, the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the Vazimba, described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of Andriamanelo (1540–1575), founder of the Kingdom of Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen Rafohy (1530–1540).|$|E

5|$|Until the Parliament Act 1911, {{there was}} no way to resolve contradictions between the two houses of {{parliament}} except <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of additional peers by the monarch. Queen Anne had created 12 Tory peers to vote through the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The Reform Act 1832 was passed when the House of Lords dropped opposition—William IV had threatened to create 80 new peers by request of the prime minister, Earl Grey—creating an informal convention that the Lords would give way when the public was behind the House of Commons. For example, Irish disestablishment, which had been a major bone of contention between the two main parties since the 1830s, was—following intervention by the queen—passed by the Lords in 1869 after W.E. Gladstone won the 1868 election on the issue. However, in practice, this gave the Lords a right to demand that such public support be present and to decide the timing of a general election.|$|E

5|$|The long {{civil war}} {{shattered}} {{the social and}} political order of the early Abbasid state, and a new system began to emerge under al-Ma'mun, which would characterize the middle period of the Abbasid Caliphate. The most tangible change was in the elites who supported the new regime: the abnaʾ, the old Arab families {{and the members of the}} Abbasid dynasty itself lost their positions in the administrative and military machinery, and with them their influence and power. The provinces of the Caliphate were now grouped into larger units, often controlled by a hereditary dynasty, like the Tahirids in Khurasan or the Samanids in Transoxiana, usually of Iranian descent. At the same time, however, al-Ma'mun tried to lessen his dependence on the Iranian element of his empire, and counterbalanced them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> of two new military corps: his brother Abu Ishaq's Turkish slaves, and the Arab tribal army of the Byzantine frontier, which was now reorganized and placed under the command of al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas. This system was further elaborated and acquired its definite characteristics in the reign of Abu Ishaq (al-Mu'tasim), who created a tightly controlled, centralized state, and expanded his Turkish corps into an effective military force with which he waged campaigns against the Byzantines and internal rebellions alike. The Turkish leaders came to political power as provincial governors, while the old Arab and Iranian elites were completely sidelined. Al-Ma'mun's victory also had repercussions in the Abbasid official theological doctrine: in 829, al-Ma'mun adopted Mu'tazilism, in an attempt reconcile doctrinal differences in Islam and reduce social inequities.|$|E
