Despite oil palm industry is the fourth largest contributor to the national economy, this industry has been suffering from shortage of labour. Increasing land usage for the oil palm industry raises number of worker demand and increase the production cost. Thus, farm mechanization such as tractor mounted mechanical grabber loader with trailer is introduced for in-field collection and evacuation of FFB to reduce manpower dependency as well lowering the production cost. The data is measured and collected directly at the Johawaki Plantation estate in Lekir, Perak {{with the cooperation of}} the managing staff. This study compares the material capacity, effective field capacity and production cost between mechanical grabber loader and semi-mechanised <b>tractor</b> <b>loader</b> for in field FFB collection operation. Result indicates that material capacity, tonne per hour increased by 1. 4 times with mechanical grabber loader compared to semi-mechanised <b>tractor</b> <b>loader.</b> Furthermore, the effective capacity of mechanical grabber is 2. 56 hectare/hour which is higher compared to semi-mechanised <b>tractor</b> <b>loader,</b> 2 hectare/hour.

40|$|Abstract: Using {{a compact}} {{agricultural}} tractor, an automated mobile platform {{is being developed}} to support precise agricultural tasks. The task being considered is fruit picking, however the platform developed should be generic. The need for precise control of the <b>tractor,</b> <b>loader</b> mechanism and the task implement attached to the tractor, is paramount. Development of the automated mobile platform {{can be broken down}} into various components, namely, the steering, loader, and traction control systems, and safety system. Development for each system includes modifications to hardware, and design of appropriate software to drive the systems automatically. Much work is needed to provide the expert control for the types of precision tasks envisaged. Preliminary work shows simple control of the steering and loader systems. Copyright c 2005 IFA...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the operator's {{workplace}} is constructed and investigated considering {{the specifics of}} work, ergonomics and comfort requirements. Two software programs, „SolidWorks“ and „CATIA“, {{have been used for}} this project. The „SolidWorks“ program has been used to design the workplace of an operator considering the construction of an electric loader and all the needed controls for it. The „CATIA“ software program has been used to inspect the reach zones and the field of view of the model designed using 5 th, 50 th and 95 th percentile operators. The anthropometric data is estimated and presented schematically. The field of view is compared to another tractor which uses the same loader. The risk category of the electric loader is determined, and the protective structure is selected accordingly. In order to avoid rolling over, the primary roll over angles are calculated in some cases. The real-life operator's workplace based on the model designed is tested and the results obtained are compared to the requirements discussed in the theoretic analysis. The present thesis can be used in the future {{as an example of how}} to design and construct other similar work specifics, i. e. workplaces of <b>tractor,</b> <b>loader</b> and other machinery operators...|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{the four}} valve {{independent}} metering configuration {{is to be}} investigated. The Independent metering concept will be emphasized and compared to spool valve coupled metering conventional technologies. Research focuses on the energy savings potential of the four valve independent metering configuration in addition to improving performance. The basic model {{of interest in this}} research is an actuator that is controlled by the four valve independent metering configuration to move beam like members of mobile hydraulic equipment such as <b>tractor</b> <b>loader</b> backhoes, excavators, and telehandlers. Five distinct (or discrete) metering modes that exist in the literature are initially studied: Powered Extension, High Side Regeneration Extension, Low Side Regeneration Extension, Powered Retraction, and Low Side Regeneration Retraction. The energy saving potential of these modes is studied and comparisons between this system and a conventional spool valve controlled actuator are conducted. The problem of switching between these five modes is treated as an optimal control problem of a switched dynamic system. Before solving the optimal control problem, a dynamic model for the system of interest is first derived. The model is experimentally validated. General theory for the optimal control problem is derived and then applied to the hydraulic system of interest. The results are then interpreted and explained by looking into the force-speed capability of modes. The effect of mode switching on system performance is studied as well. The basic mechanical system used for this analysis is a continuous rotating beam that undergoes structural vibrations due to mode switching in the driving hydraulic actuator. A fully coupled actuator-beam model is investigated. A non-dimensional analysis is pursued to generalize the study results. The optimal switching analysis and the vibrational study lead to the idea of Continuously Variable Modes (CVMs). Instead of having five distinct modes that determines the flow path by opening two of the four valves in the assembly, three Continuously Variable Modes are presented as an alternative way of controlling the four-valve configuration. These three CVMs combine the distinct modes and use three of the four valves to provide the fluid flow path. The five distinct modes become a special case of these three CVMs. It is going to be shown that CVMs have more force-speed capabilities than the distinct modes and provide for better velocity and vibrational performance by virtue of always offering a continuous flow path. The theory behind CVMs is presented and experimental validation follows. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Wayne J.

40|$|A {{serial bus}} called ISOBUS based on CAN is {{becoming}} more and more common in the agriculture and forestry industry. The bus specifies communication between tractors and their implements. Earlier each implement had its own monitor to show its functionalities, which could lead to a lot of monitors in the tractor cabin. ISOBUS requires only one monitor, called VT (Virtual Terminal), regardless of the manufacturer of the implement. The aim of this thesis is to implement ISOBUS at Ålö’s ECU (Electronic Control Unit) so that it can present its functionalities to VT. The aim is to integrate a purchased third party commercial ISOBUS library on ECU. The amount of work to achieve ISOBUS compatibility without third party library shall be estimated, and if there is time the task shall also be carried out. An object pool based on Ålö’s existing interface shall be created, where the object pool is the graphical interface shown at VT. A demonstrator of ISOBUS VT shall be done. To implement the third party library hardware functions towards the CAN-bus was required. The hardware functions include receiving messages from a buffer and send messages directly on the bus. For the library to be alive and running it had to be initialized and a periodic call to the library had to be done. The result is that the library was implemented on ECU and data flows between ECU and VT. To achieve ISOBUS compatibility without third party library the existing protocol on Ålö’s ECU has to be removed by a base support for ISOBUS. Then a last part must be written to achieve full compatibility. Commands that the ISOBUS standard defines between ECU and VT has to be written, and callback functions that is called when VT sends commands to ECU. Management of answers and errors also have to be implemented. ISOBUS compatibility without third party library wasn’t carried out, but the amount of work was estimated and a general description of what has to be done is written. The conclusion is that it requires a lot of work and scrutiny of the standard. The advantage is that you get an insight into how the system works and the ability to influence functionalities yourself. The object pool design was based on Ålö’s existing interface. Menu systems was implemented, and a linear bar graph and a meter have the possibilities to show height and angle of the <b>tractor</b> <b>loader</b> bucket. Different ways to show a menu system has been discussed. The result is an object pool with the basic functions for Ålö’s interface, the demonstrator presents these functionalities. The interface for VT can be made quite similar to Ålö’s existing interface, with some differences such as fonts, image quality and menu functions. En seriell buss kallad ISOBUS baserat på CAN blir allt vanligare inom jordbruk- och skogsindustrin. Bussen reglerar hur kommunikationen mellan traktorer och redskap fungerar. Tidigare har varje redskap haft en egen monitor för att se över redskapets funktioner, vilket innebär att det kan bli många skärmar i traktorhytten. Med ISOBUS behövs bara en monitor, så kallad VT (Virtuell Terminal), oavsett tillverkare av redskapet. Syftet med detta examensarbete är att implementera ISOBUS på Ålö:s ECU (Electronic Control Unit) för att denna ska kunna presentera sina funktioner på VT. Målet är att integrera ett inköpt tredjeparts kommersiellt ISOBUS bibliotek på ECU. Arbetet för att uppnå ISOBUS kompatibilitet utan tredjepartsbiblioteket skall uppskattas, och om tid finns utföras. En objektpool baserat på Ålös existerande gränssnitt ska skapas, där objektpoolen är det grafiska interface som visas på VT. En demonstrator av ISOBUS VT skall sättas upp. För att implementera tredjepartsbiblioteket krävde biblioteket hårdvarufunktioner mot CANbussen. Hårdvarufunktionerna tar bland annat emot meddelanden från en buffert och skickar ut meddelanden direkt på bussen. För att biblioteket skulle vara igång och köra måste det initieras och ett periodiskt anrop göras till biblioteket. Resultatet är att biblioteket implementerades på ECU och att det flödar trafik mellan ECU och VT. För att uppnå ISOBUS kompatibilitet utan tredjepartsbibliotek måste det existerande protokollet på Ålös ECU bytas ut med ett grundstöd för ISOBUS. Sedan måste en egen del skrivas för att uppnå full kompatibilitet. Här behöver bland annat kommandon som ISOBUS standarden definierar mellan ECU och VT skrivas, samt callbackfunktioner som anropas då VT skickar kommando till ECU. Hantering av svar och felmeddelanden vid kommunikation måste också implementeras. Att uppnå ISOBUS kompatibilitet utan tredjepartsbibliotek hann inte utföras, däremot uppskattades arbetet och en översiktlig beskrivning om vad som behöver utföras gjordes. Slutsatsen är att det kräver väldigt mycket arbete och finläsning av standarden. Fördelen är att man får en inblick i hur systemet fungerar och möjligheten att påverka funktionaliteter själv. Objektpoolen utformades efter hur Ålös existerande gränssnitt ser ut. Menysystem implementerades, samt att streckdiagram och en cirkulär mätare har möjligheten att visa höjd och vinkel på traktorskopan. Olika sätt för att visa ett menysystem har diskuterats. Resultatet är en objektpool med grundläggande funktioner för Ålös gränssnitt, demonstratorn visar dessa funktionaliteter. Resultatet visar på att det går att få gränssnittet för VT ganska likt Ålös existerande, med vissa skillnader som typsnitt, bildkvalité och menyfunktioner...|$|E
