5|$|Grand Theft Auto III {{took the}} {{gameplay}} {{foundation of the}} first two Grand Theft Auto games and expanded it into a 3D world, and offered an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions. The title was a much greater commercial success than its direct precursors, and its influence was profound. As such, Grand Theft Auto III is credited with popularizing this genre, let alone inventing it. Its release is sometimes treated as a revolutionary event in the history of video games, much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier. GamePro called it the most important game of all time, and claimed that every genre was influenced <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> conventional level design. IGN similarly praised it {{as one of the top}} ten most influential games of all time. Subsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting in a free-roaming level have been called Grand Theft Auto clones.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius' raids {{disrupted}} the Allied supply chain, it forced the Allies <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> strategy. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of communication. Despite this defensive {{move by the}} Greeks, {{it was in fact}} the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue the Greeks. Since he did not expect the Greeks to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried {{to take advantage of the}} altered strategic situation he thought he had produced. Conversely, the Greeks had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.|$|E
5|$|The Greenbackers saw {{the impact}} of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general {{at the head of}} the ticket, faced more opposition. The party's courtship of black voters, too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weaver's rallies and threats against his supporters. As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October, Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states. Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors, in state-level races, Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates. In the September gubernatorial race in Maine, one such fusion ticket nominated Harris M. Plaisted, who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be a safe state for that party. The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign, and caused them <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> strategy of waving the bloody shirt.|$|E
40|$|Research on identities has {{not only}} been amongst the most vibrant in the past decade, but also amongst the most ‘naturally interdisciplinary’ in scope and methods, {{which makes it a}} very {{intuitive}} priority for the ESRC. However, it is really the context of the current and unprecedented economic, social, and political crisis (at least since the war) faced by European nations which makes it essential for the social sciences <b>to</b> completely <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> approach <b>to</b> the study of identities in Europe...|$|R

5|$|The {{viability}} of a game's platform can also affect both the localization and the release, {{as in the}} case of the PlayStation Portable-exclusive Final Fantasy Type-0, which would eventually come West as a high definition port for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was not localized due to undefined technical problems. The company has also recently started releasing Japanese voice tracks as downloadable content, {{as in the case}} of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII and one of the titles it has published, the Access Games-developed Drakengard 3. Another aspect of Square Enix's policy concerning the Western release of games was to make games that appealed to both Western and Japanese audiences, but the worldwide success of the Japan-aimed Bravely Default caused them <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> strategy. Although English was originally the main language of Square Enix's foreign releases, including in non-English speaking countries, it seems some titles may debut without an English release in the future, such as the Chinese version of Dragon Quest X before an North American or European release has been confirmed. Final Fantasy XV, on the other hand, was the first Final Fantasy game to feature nine languages in a simultaneous launch.|$|E

40|$|What {{counts as}} a “personal injury”? Such a {{question}} looms large following {{the decision in}} Yearworth & Ors v Bristol NHS Trust 1 in which the Court of Appeal determined that the destruction of stored cryopreserved sperm samples did not constitute a personal injury to male cancer survivors. Rather, the loss in {{the circumstances of the}} case was framed as one under which the men could be seen as having “owned” their sperm. While media attention has focused on this latter aspect of the case, this note considers the questions Yearworth raises as to the meaning of “personal injury” and argues that the courts need <b>to</b> radically <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> approach <b>to</b> reproductive harms arising out of mishaps in family planning...|$|R
5000|$|As {{it turned}} out, the Hot Wheels brand was a {{staggering}} success. The series [...] "re-wrote the book" [...] for small die-cast car models from 1968 onwards, forcing the competition at Matchbox and elsewhere <b>to</b> completely <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> concepts, and <b>to</b> scramble {{to try to}} recover lost ground. Harry Bentley Bradley {{did not think that}} would be the case and had quit Mattel {{to go back to the}} car industry. When the company asked him back, he recommended a good friend, Ira Gilford. Gilford, who had just left Chrysler, quickly accepted the job of designing the next Hot Wheels models. Some of Hot Wheels' greatest cars, such as the Twin Mill and Splittin' Image, came from Ira Gilford's drawing board.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{begins by}} tracing {{the history of}} brands. Klein argues {{that there has been}} a shift in the usage of {{branding}} and gives examples of this shift to [...] "anti-brand" [...] branding. Early examples of brands were often used to put a recognizable face on factory-produced products. These slowly gave way to the idea of selling lifestyles. According to Klein, in response to an economic crash in the 1980s (due to the Latin American debt crisis, Black Monday (1987), the savings and loan crisis, and the Japanese asset price bubble), corporations began <b>to</b> seriously <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> approach <b>to</b> marketing and to target the youth demographic, as opposed to the baby boomers, who had previously been considered a much more valuable segment.|$|R
25|$|Many of Llywelyn's Welsh allies had {{abandoned}} him during England's invasion of Gwynedd, preferring an overlord far away {{rather than one}} nearby. These Welsh lords expected an unobtrusive English crown, however King John had castles built in Ystwyth in Ceredigion, and John's direct interference in Powys and the Perfeddwlad caused many of these Welsh lords <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> position. John's policy in Wales demonstrated his resolve to subject the Welsh, argued Professor John Davies.|$|E
25|$|The {{coming of}} {{independence}} in Angola and Mozambique in 1975 also altered the power balance in another way. It forced South Africa and the United States <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> attitudes to the area, {{to protect their}} economic and political interests. Attempts were made by both countries to pressure Smith into accepting majority rule. With Kenneth Kaunda's Zambian support the nationalist groups were convinced to come together under the united front of Abel Muzorewa's United African National Council. The imprisoned nationalist leaders were released.|$|E
25|$|The 1961 Formula One season saw the {{introduction}} of radically revised engine regulations. Maximum capacity was cut from 1954-1960's 2.5 L to only , greatly reducing the power and torque available, but also bringing fuel economy and weight benefits. This change required Formula One chassis designers <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> approach to a car's whole construction as poor handling and excess weight {{could no longer be}} effectively compensated for by greater engine output. Cooper suffered their first season without a Championship race win since 1958, and finished only fourth in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E

40|$|The {{bottom of}} the pyramid (BOP) in the global {{distribution}} of income has been promoted as a significant opportunity for companies to grow profitably. Under the BOP approach, poor people are identified as potential customers who can be served if companies learn <b>to</b> fundamentally <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> existing strategies and business models. This involves acquiring and building new resources and capabilities and forging a multitude of local partnerships. However, current BOP literature remains relatively silent about how to actually implement such a step into the unknown. We use two BOP cases to illustrate a strategic framework that reduces managerial complexity. In our view, existing capabilities and existing local BOP models can be leveraged to build new markets that include the poor and generate sufficient financial returns for companies to justify investments...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{the first}} two authors {{reflected}} on the lessons learned and implications of teaching from this study. As teachers, we may assume that {{students are able to}} understand answers immediately when solutions and corrective measures are directly proposed to them after marking their worksheets. In fact, when solutions are presented directly to students, there is lack of emphasis on students’ mistake identification, rectification and re-thinking process in the learning cycle. It is important for teachers to take time and invite students <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> upon <b>their</b> own mistakes; and engage in the process of making meaning and self-correcting these mistakes. A reflective learning space encourages students to analyze their mistakes, to enhance their metacognitive skills, and to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} concepts through personal reflection.|$|R
25|$|Militarily, {{the initial}} {{hostilities}} was a sobering lesson for the British, causing them <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> views on colonial military capability. The weak British response gave the Patriots the advantage; the British lost control over every colony. The army {{had been kept}} deliberately small since 1688 to prevent abuses of power by the King. Parliament secured treaties with small German states for additional troops, and, after a year, were able to send an army of 32,000 men to America, the largest it had ever sent outside Europe at the time.|$|E

Dot-com commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV in January 2000 featured advertisements by 16 dot-com companies that each paid over $2 million for a 30-second spot. CBS-backed iWon.com gave away $1 million to a lucky contestant on an April 15, 2000 half-hour primetime special that was broadcast on CBS.

25|$|As European tension {{grew in the}} 1930s, the Swiss began <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> {{political}} and military situation. The Social Democratic party abandoned their revolutionary and anti-military stances, and soon the country began to rearm for war. BGB Federal Councillor Rudolf Minger, predicting war would come in 1939, led the rebuilding of the Swiss Army. Starting in 1936, he secured a larger defence budget and started a war bond system. The army was restructured into smaller, better equipped divisions and boot camp for conscripts was extended to 3 months of instruction. In 1937 a war economy cell was established. Households were encouraged to keep a two-month supply of food and basic necessities. In 1938 Foreign Minister Giuseppe Motta withdrew Switzerland from the League of Nations, returning the country to its traditional form of neutrality.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{disaster}} of the previous battle (Caudine Forks) and the Battle of Lautulae, the Roman military began <b>to</b> reorganize and <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> strategy. The Romans {{had a knack for}} learning from their enemies, such as the Greeks, Etruscans, and Carthaginians. For example, they learned how to fight with round shields from the Etruscans, and they learned how to manipulate siege craft from the Greeks. What they learned from the Samnites was how to fight in maniples armed with pilums (javelins) and scutums (shields), and they later turned this against the Samnites and defeated them.|$|R
25|$|From the 1950s onwards, Australians began <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> {{attitudes towards}} racial issues. An Aboriginal rights {{movement}} was founded {{and supported by}} many liberal white Australians and a campaign against the White Australia policy was also launched. The 1967 referendum was held and overwhelmingly approved to amend the Constitution, removing discriminatory references and giving the national parliament the power to legislate specifically for Indigenous Australians. Contrary to frequently repeated mythology, this referendum did not cover citizenship on Aboriginal people, nor did it give them the vote: they already had both. However, transferring this power away from the State parliaments did {{bring an end to}} the system of Indigenous Australian reserves which existed in each state, which allowed Indigenous people to move more freely, and exercise many of their citizenship rights for the first time. From the late 1960s a movement for Indigenous land rights also developed.|$|E
25|$|UCC faced a major crisis when, in 1958, it was {{discovered}} that the main building was, due to poor construction, in danger of collapse. At the time, despite its benefactors, UCC had no endowment. An emergency building fund was started within the year and, with the assistance of Prince Philip, all of the necessary $3,200,000 was raised from Old Boys and friends of the college; Ted Rogers' contribution paid for the clock tower while Robert Laidlaw donated the funds necessary for construction of Laidlaw Hall. Construction of the present main building began in early 1959 and it was opened by former governor general Vincent Massey near the end of 1960. The crisis forced the school government <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> stance on foresight and planning, leading to a years-long program of new construction, salary improvements, and funding sources. Further, in teamwork with Principal Sowby, whom he had helped select, Massey had further influence on the college, bringing about somewhat of a renaissance for the school: A number of distinguished visitors were brought in and leading minds were hired as masters. At this time, the curriculum began to shift from a classical education into a liberal arts one; language options besides Latin were first offered after 1950.|$|E
25|$|The Armenian {{national}} ideology developed {{long after}} the Greek movement, however the factors contributing {{to the emergence of}} Armenian nationalism made the movement far more {{similar to that of the}} Greeks than those of other ethnic groups. Unresolved social problems in the Empire began to feed Armenian national politics, along the other ethnic groups. As the Millet (Ottoman Empire) structure degraded, Armenians begin <b>to</b> <b>rethink</b> <b>their</b> position in the world. The Armenian subjects of the Empire influenced by the Armenian Diaspora and the network of congregations and schools of the Protestant missionaries throughout the Empire. After intervention in Russia in 1877-1878, Russian-Ottoman border brought new the political and military structure. The numbers of Circassians and Laz from the Russian Empire forcefully deported to Ottoman Empire. These emigrations brought tensions and changed the population distribution and balance of power within the local communities in eastern Anatolia. Russia became protectorate of Christian Armenians and this created a relatively more hostile environment to the Muslims (Kurds) who were left under Russian control. Kurdish-Armenian relations come to another turn. The newly established relations were complex. The change did not only effected the Armenian Millet but also the local non-tribal Kurds as well. The Kurdish tribal leaders that fled during the war began to express their power along the countryside. The region's social structure, coexistence of the communities was broken. The broken social structure required implementation of new reforms.|$|E
