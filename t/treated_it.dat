5|$|Bloc Party {{commissioned}} Silent Alarm Remixed to {{show that}} remixes and dance music were relevant to the band and to the rock landscape at large. The band members gave each of the original tracks {{to a number of}} musicians from different genres; Ladytron, Four Tet, and Nick Zinner were amongst those who reworked the songs. Critics often considered the record as showcasing the potential high quality of remix albums, although some reviewers <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as disjunct and a poor marketing decision.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|First {{identified}} by Gustav Mayr in 1862, Mayr provided the first description of M. nigriceps {{in his journal}} Myrmecologische Studien. The species was described under the binomial name Myrmecia nigriceps, based on syntype workers collected from Gayndah and Sydney. In 1907, Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel treated M. nigriceps as a variant of M. vindex, but he eventually <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as a synonym in 1910. M. nigriceps was revived as a full species in 1933 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler, {{on the basis that}} it is distributed throughout Australia and its average size is greater than M. vindex. Scottish born Australian entomologist John S. Clark published one synonym – Myrmecia fasciata, now considered a junior synonym. M. nigriceps {{is a member of the}} genus Myrmecia, a part of the primitive subfamily Myrmeciinae; most ancestors of the genus are only found in fossils, with the exception of the dinosaur ant (Nothomyrmecia macrops).|$|E

50|$|There are {{controversial}} {{political implications}} {{about the nature}} of Rusyn as a language or dialect.

5|$|It has {{traditionally}} been held in Osney that the church was founded in the reign of Stephen, but this {{is unlikely to be}} true, as Thomas Becket was not martyred until some fifteen years after Stephen's death. It is known that in the 1180s, the site was granted to the canons of the nearby Osney Abbey, and a chapel was erected on the site around 1190. From the mid-13th century the Osney area was referred to as the parish of St Thomas', but it remained nominally a chapel of the abbey until the dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, when it was placed under Christ Church, Oxford. Christ Church <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as a conventional parish church with a curate, and from the mid-19th century the incumbent was styled a vicar.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{was first}} {{described}} as Agaricus muscarius β regalis by Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum, published in 1821. In 1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as {{a variety of}} Amanitamuscaria. Edmund Michael, in 1903, became the first to consider it a distinct species. In 1941, Jean-Edouard Gilbert suggested a complete reorganization of the genus Amanita in his world monograph of the genus, and moved it to Amanitaria as A.muscaria var. regalis. In his original (1949) version of Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Rolf Singer considered it a subspecies of A.muscaria, but noted {{that it may be}} regarded as a separate species; in the fourth edition (1986), he listed it as a distinct species. A.regalis is classified in a section of Amanita within the genus, a grouping of related Amanitas that have a ring on the stem (or remnants thereof), and a bulb at the base of it. More recently, a Japanese group studied the biogeography of A.muscaria and related species, and, using molecular phylogenetic analysis, concluded that the taxon should be considered a grouping of A.muscaria, rather than a distinct species. However, as of 2012, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list the taxon as Amanita regalis.|$|E

25|$|In What is Faith? (1925) he {{set before}} him the {{pastoral}} task of anchoring {{faith in the}} historical fact of Christ's atonement. He found liberal theology anti-intellectual, insofar as it spiritualized Christianity and <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as merely an expression of individual experience, thus emptying the Bible and creeds of all definitive meaning.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{overdose}} causes hypercalcemia, {{which is}} a strong indication of vitamin D toxicity – this can be noted {{with an increase in}} urination and thirst. If hypercalcemia is not <b>treated,</b> <b>it</b> results in excess deposits of calcium in soft tissues and organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart, resulting in pain and organ damage.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} {{differ in their}} view of narcissism, with the former <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> as a disorder, thus as discrete, and the latter <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> as a personality trait, thus as a continuum. These two strands of research tend loosely to stand in a divergent relation to one another, although they converge in places.|$|R

25|$|There {{were certain}} groups who took {{to it with}} great enthusiasm, other groups were {{directly}} lukewarm and other hostile, each profession reacted differently.

25|$|Avant-garde composers {{criticized the}} {{predominant}} use of electronic instruments for conventional purposes. The instruments offered expansions in pitch resources that were exploited by advocates of microtonal music such as Charles Ives, Dimitrios Levidis, Olivier Messiaen and Edgard Varèse. Further, Percy Grainger used the theremin to abandon fixed tonation entirely, while Russian composers such as Gavriil Popov <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> {{as a source}} of noise in otherwise-acoustic noise music.|$|E

The Euler method is named after Leonhard Euler, who <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> in his book Institutionum calculi integralis (published 1768–70).|$|E
25|$|The Florida Maple {{was first}} {{recognised}} as distinct in 1860 by Alvan Wentworth Chapman, who <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as {{a variety of}} A. saccharum. In 1886 Ferdinand Albin Pax decided it was distinct enough {{to be treated as}} a separate species, making the new combination A. floridanum (Chapm.) Pax. In 1952, Yves Desmarais took an intermediate option, treating it as a subspecies Acer saccharum subsp. floridanum (Chapm.) Desmarais, a treatment which has fairly wide recent recognition.|$|E

Individuals with sickle-cell disease and those who abuse certain medications can often develop this disorder.|$|E
25|$|Léonce Perret {{was born}} in 1880 to Eliès Ferdinand Perret and Marie Collinet. His parents owned a {{woodworking}} shop on Yver Street in Niort, France. Léonce showed a taste for the arts from an early age, in particular for acting and poetry. During his adolescence, Léonce fell seriously ill and {{had to go to}} Paris to see medical specialists. He stayed in the capital for several months while being <b>treated.</b> <b>It</b> was during this brief stay that he began to dream of life as an artist.|$|E
25|$|On July 22, 1950, {{the body}} of 41-year-old Robert Robertson was found at a {{business}} at 2138 Davenport Avenue in Cleveland. Police believed he had been dead {{six to eight weeks}} and appeared to have been intentionally decapitated. His death appeared to fit the profile of other victims: He was estranged from his family, had an arrest record and a drinking problem, and was on the fringes of society. Despite widespread newspaper coverage linking the murder to the crimes in the 1930s, detectives investigating Robertson's death <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as an isolated crime.|$|E
