40|$|D. Ed. A skills {{revolution}} {{was launched in}} the South African workplace by the Department of Labour in 1998. Various skills development legislation were introduced to meet international standards, redress skills imbalances, curb skills shortages and improve the general skills in the current workforce. <b>Training</b> <b>providers</b> were the drivers of workplace training, yet are now displaced by skills authorities, such as the SET As, the ETQAs and SAQA. While the custody of skills development {{is placed in the}} hands of employers and employees, <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> must become frontline soldiers in the skills battlefield. Rapid technological advancements, complex skills legislative requirements and ineffective internal management frameworks challenge workplace <b>training</b> <b>providers.</b> <b>Training</b> <b>providers</b> need to upgrade to OBE and NQF principles, provide and assess learnerships and skills programmes, and ensure that skills programmes allow employees to gain national qualifications and credits. Empirical research, undertaken {{in the midst of the}} skills battlefield, voices the opinions of managers, employees, <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and skills authorities on the effectiveness and improvement of <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> to improve skills development. This research employed the multimethod approach using quantitative survey questionnaires and qualitative interviews to gather data on the management factors essential to providing training and improving workplace skills. Action field researchers, the skills legislative framework and current successful workplace management frameworks directed this socio-educational research. Empirical evidence reveals that <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> are challenged by workplace and skills legislation. The skills levy-grant system burdens workplace managers and <b>training</b> <b>providers,</b> yet creates incentives for annual skills grant recoveries. <b>Training</b> <b>providers</b> must provide job relevant training, continuous assessment and SAQA/NQF accreditation to be effective and improve skills development. The empirical research concludes that <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> must 'identify each training programme as a project and manage it well'. Basic management of workplace training entails managing skills development holistically, initiating and sustaining various skills projects and developing workplace skills plans in annual cycles. Implementation of skills projects include seeping, scheduling, cost, HR, quality and risk management. Research conclusions recommend an internal skills management framework for improving <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> to improve workplace skills development. The skills management framework integrates ten basic steps for SETA and SAQA compliance and nine operational elements of project management. The aim of this framework is to arm <b>training</b> <b>providers,</b> the skills soldiers, so that they can effectively revolutionise workplace skills development...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the ways in which the small firm's {{external}} relationships influence its approach to formal <b>training</b> and <b>training</b> <b>providers.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative approach was adopted, involving semi‐structured interviews with senior managers, in 25 small firms in South Wales. These interviews were informed by prior workplace observation and analysis of organisational documentation. Further interviews were conducted with employees in nine of the firms. Findings – The findings indicate that the small firm's informal relationships with trusted, familiar and credible contacts – referred to as insiders, following Gibb – are central to the way in which it perceives both <b>training</b> and <b>training</b> <b>providers.</b> Government agencies, <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and other traditional stakeholders generally sit outside these informal insider networks, and tend to be viewed as culturally remote by the small firm. Research limitations/implications – The findings emphasise the need for <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and government agencies to obtain the support and co‐operation of insider networks if they wish to promote training within the small business sector. The main limitations include the relatively narrow geographical focus and the absence of retail firms from the sample. Originality/value – While the importance of informal networks within the small business community is now well established, the constitution of such networks and their effects on attitudes towards <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> are less well understood. The paper helps to address these gaps by starting the process of mapping insider networks and illuminating their impact on small firms' perceptions of <b>training</b> <b>providers...</b>|$|R
