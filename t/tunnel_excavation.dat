In 1989 construction began in the city centre, where the main Moyúa square was closed to pedestrians until 1997. Construction was especially complicated in the neighbourhoods of Deusto and San Inazio, where the cut and cover <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavation</b> damaged some buildings, was very noisy, and caused severe traffic disruptions. This method of excavation contrasted with the tunnel-boring machines used elsewhere in the city.|$|E

In the preliminary phase, an exploratory gallery was built almost along the main tunnel axis to collect geological, tectonic zone and other relevant data. The exploratory gallery is now being used for geodetic and other monitoring {{of the impact of}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavations</b> on the surrounding rock mass. Before the beginning, methods of point and station point stabilization, and a measurement method were chosen. Thus, the chosen methods are the method of 3 D inner intersection with adjustment of redundant observation for station point determination, and the polar method for calculating 3 D coordinates of detail points. The method of determination of station point was chosen because of the far reaching influence that the <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavations</b> have on rock mass behaviour at the tunnel face...|$|R

25|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began in October 1998 with the {{excavation}} of the Gilman Portal and dewatering work at the two intermediate shafts. <b>Tunnel</b> <b>excavation</b> was carried out from November 1999 through July 2001 using a shielded TBM. Construction {{of the tunnel}} included many challenges. The TBM had to bore its way through diverse ground conditions consisting of weak sedimentary rocks; strong, fractured metamorphic rocks; and alluvium, {{all of which were}} below the groundwater table. Special measures such as probing and grouting ahead of the TBM and, in particular, deep dewatering wells, were demonstrated to be effective for controlling adverse ground conditions. The project also showed the advantage of working from a portal. The Gilman Portal site proved to be ideal, supporting very efficient mining and muck disposal operations and also allowing long pipe sections to be installed in the tunnel, significantly reducing the amount of field welding required.|$|E

In preparation for the Battle of Vimy Ridge, five British tunnelling companies excavated 12subways along the Canadian Corps' front, the longest of which was [...] in length. The tunnellers excavated the subways at a depth of 10metres to ensure protection from large calibre howitzer shellfire. The subways were often dug at a pace of four metres a day and were often two metres tall and one metre wide. This underground network often incorporated or included concealed light rail lines, hospitals, command posts, water reservoirs, ammunition stores, mortar and machine gun posts, and communication centres.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} comparison of excavation damage zones resulting from blasting with nonel detonators and blasting with electronic detonators. The nonel detonator {{is a common}} type of detonator used in drill-and-blast <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavations,</b> while the use of electronic detonators {{in recent years has}} also been gaining popularity in complex tunneling conditions. The tunnel has an overburden of 25 to 40 m. The field study involves an ultrasonic wave measurement in drill holes at two different tunnel sections separately excavated by using electronic detonators and nonel detonators. The results demonstrate that using electronic detonators can help limit the EDZ development in drill-and-blast <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavations.</b> The disturbed zone is dominated by a change of stress and hydraulic head state. The changes in rock mass properties are insignificant or reversible. The presence of the failed zone and damaged zone affects the short-term and long-term stability of the tunnel.

500|$|Excavation of the 3rd Avenue tunnel segment {{began with}} the {{ceremonial}} launch of the [...] "Mighty Mole", a , [...] tunnel boring machine (TBM), on March 6, 1987. The TBM, designed by Robbins Company of Kent, Washington, and built by Nicholson Manufacturing in Seattle, began digging the western tunnel from Union Station the following May. A second, identical [...] "Mighty Mole" [...] TBM began digging the parallel eastern tunnel on June 29. During tunnel boring under 3rd Avenue between Spring Street and Madison Street on October 21, a small earthflow damaged a water main and caused pavement on 3rd Avenue to drop , shutting down water in the nearby Seattle City Light and 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza buildings. While repairing the broken water main, electricians working on damaged high-voltage cables caused a small power outage that affected eight downtown buildings {{on the night of}} October 28, but were able to restore power by the following morning. Work on the western tunnel was briefly interrupted in November, when the TBM hit an unexpectedly large pocket of loose sand under Madison Street that had to be stabilized with grout to prevent damage to the adjacent Seattle City Light building. Boring on both tunnels was stopped in early January 1988, when a pocket of wet sand was encountered [...] before the planned 90-degree turn onto Pine Street. Metro and tunnel contractors Atkinson/Dillingham, who had scheduled <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavation</b> for completion in mid-January, closed 3rd Avenue between Pike and Pine streets and installed 40 drilled wells to remove water from the sand pocket in February. Digging resumed on the western tunnel on March 14, and the TBM reached Westlake station on April 9, completing the first of the two tunnels. The eastern tunnel was completed a month later on May 18, allowing for parts of the TBMs to be salvaged and the steel outer shells to be buried in the tunnel.|$|E

[...] Many of them had prior experience working on Southern Pacific's located tunnels in the Tehachapi Pass. [...] Due to the sandstone composition of the mountain that was saturated with water and oil, frequent cave-ins occurred and the bore had to be constantly shored up by timbers during excavation. [...] The initial location for the north end of the tunnel near Newhall was abandoned due to frequent cave-ins caused by oil-soaked rock. [...] The north end of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavation</b> commenced in June 1875. [...] Water was a constant problem during construction and pumps were utilized to keep the tunnel from flooding. [...] Workers digging from both the north and south ends of the tunnel came face to face on July 14, 1876. [...] The bores from each end were only a half inch out of line with dimensions of [...] high, [...] wide at the bottom and over [...] at the shoulders.

40|$|Large scale {{underground}} bulk mining {{methods such as}} Block Caving {{allow for}} mass extraction of large, low grade ore bodies in a cost effective manner. They involve de-stabilising large volumes of rock to induce significant stress changes in the surrounding rock mass. When caving operations are established in deep, high stress environments in hard competent rock, the potential for brittle damage to <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavations</b> exists. Whilst high stress to strength ratio, large scale caving mines set in hard competent rock are few, the industry is trending towards such operations. Having tools which can assist site based engineers in observing, measuring, and forward predicting the location and depth of brittle damage to <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavations</b> can lead to less disruption to mining activities and risk mitigation in these mines. This thesis presents a methodology to assist site based engineers in observing, measuring, and forward predicting the location and depth of brittle damage to <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavations</b> using linear elastic modelling in caving operations. The thesis demonstrates that existing brittle damage empirical relations derived by Diedrichs (1999), Martin et al. (1999), and Kaiser et al. (2000), that assume the rock mass strength is governed by cohesion, are applicable for modelling the location and depth of damage associated with the on-set of damage to <b>tunnel</b> <b>excavations</b> in brittle rock that exhibit randomly orientated, low persistence, jointing. The thesis also presents a methodology for forming damage criteria that can predict the location and depth of damage associated with more significant brittle damage that results in spalling and notch formation to tunnel excavations; assuming {{that some of the}} cohesive strength of the rock mass has been lost and some frictional strength has been mobilised as the damage increases. A key finding of the thesis is that a lower bound 95 % confidence fit was the best approach to use when forming the damage criteria from the stress state data. Another key finding was that reasonable correspondence was achieved between the inflexion points in the extensometer displacement vs time curves and the transition of the rock mass from its elastic to in-elastic response...|$|R
