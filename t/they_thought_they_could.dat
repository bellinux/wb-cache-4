25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E
500|$|As soon as {{the tour}} was {{announced}} {{and in order to}} assure tickets were not over-priced, five cities were used as a [...] "test". The result was promising as a minimum of 7,000 tickets sold per city. Such results could be due to the [...] "huge success" [...] of [...] "Locked out of Heaven" [...] and the Grammy performance. Despite the fact that these two factors could spike sales, in Mars' case [...] "everything was very consistent". Eventually, most of the dates were sold out in North America. This high demand led to an announcement of more dates in several cities despite having chosen 44 dates to begin with, which according to Marx is [...] "ambitious" [...] since tours that go above 24 dates can result in a drop in sales. There were three main factors involved in scheduling dates: research of the market, optimism on what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> sell and how they opened up the arenas. A second date in Chicago, could have been done, however they booked a date in Minneapolis, which culminated in a sold out show. In Los Angeles (L.A.), some shows had coincident dates with the Jay Z and Justin Timberlake concerts. Furthermore, the tickets for Mars' show were only available one week after the Jay Z/Justin Timberlake went on sale. Nevertheless, after the first sold out date in the city, a second date was scheduled and immediately sold out as well. Marx said that more dates could have been sold out in L.A, since they left at least 20,000 people in a [...] "virtual waiting room" [...] who could have bought tickets. All in all, and according to Marx, the team at WME was pleased with having sold 30,000 tickets, and decided to stop there.|$|E
2500|$|..... the Arabs in Palestine {{were asked}} to stay and live as {{citizens}} in the Jewish state. Instead, they chose to leave, either because they were unwilling {{to live with the}} Jews, or because they expected an Arab military victory which would annihilate the Zionists. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> leave temporarily and return at their leisure. Later, an additional claim was put forth, namely that the Palestinians were ordered to leave, with radio broadcasts instructing them to quit their homes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Go {{straight}} down the path in front of you,' continued the fairy, smiling as she watched her; 'go {{straight down}} the path and you will soon reach a little hut where you will find shelter.' And with these words she vanished, leaving her hearers happier than <b>they</b> ever <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be again.|$|R
60|$|They {{walked for}} some hours until <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{not be far}} from their destination, and had begun to congratulate {{themselves}} upon being near their friends, when {{the sound of a}} strong body of men was heard sweeping along the level plain across which they were now passing.|$|R
5000|$|... "They {{spent a lot}} {{of money}} on us making the records. A lot of people at the label {{genuinely}} seemed to love the band. The president of the label showed up at our gigs and got all psyched up and said this was not a vanity project on the part of the label. <b>They</b> really <b>thought</b> that we <b>could</b> sell some records. <b>They</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> mass market Trip Shakespeare.|$|R
2500|$|Jessop arrived on-site Sunday, April 6, {{in hopes}} of reuniting two of her daughters with their half-siblings. She stated her opinion that the action in Texas was unlike the 1953 Short Creek raid in Arizona. On April 8 she was interviewed by the NBC Today Show {{regarding}} the event, and described life at a FLDS community. Jessop had also been in Texas the prior month at a speaking engagement, where she said, [...] "n Eldorado, the crimes went {{to a whole new}} level. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get away with more" [...] but [...] "Texas {{is not going to be}} a state that's as tolerant of these crimes as Arizona and Utah have been." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{filming the}} moment in which Rebecca pushes Paul, Hall said [...] "The way Stefan Dennis (who plays Paul) and I {{interpreted}} it and acted it was we had to satisfy ourselves {{that it was one}} of those random and instantaneous mistakes people make. When we worked on the scene we had to make it look like she had a moment of fury that caused her to do that." [...] Hall knew that viewers would be surprised at Rebecca being the culprit and she herself was surprised by the fan's reactions. Some women questioned how Rebecca could do such a thing to Paul, even though he cheated on her and lied to her. Hall thought that someone could get [...] "so fed up" [...] that they made a rash decision that is not something <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> ever do. In September 2010, Rebecca's confession and explanation for the night she pushed Paul was broadcast. The episode initially saw Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) admit to Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) that he was responsible to protect his mother. Hall added that [...] "the ramifications of Rebecca pushing Paul over the mezzanine are far-reaching".|$|E

60|$|Before, {{they had}} so much time, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not tell how to spend it, unless it were in hunting, and whoring, in dancing, and playing, and {{spending}} whole hours, yea, days, nay, weeks, in the lusts of the flesh; but when they depart into another place, and begin to lift up their eyes in hell, and consider their miserable and irrecoverable condition, they will cry.|$|R
50|$|The Adullamites, led by Robert Lowe, {{had already}} been {{working closely with the}} Conservative Party. The Adullamites were anti-reform, as were the Conservatives, but the Adullamites {{declined}} the invitation to enter into Government with the Conservatives as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have more influence from an independent position. Despite {{the fact that he had}} blocked the Liberal Reform Bill, in February 1867, Disraeli introduced his own Reform Bill into the House of Commons.|$|R
60|$|It {{was growing}} dark already and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> the best <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{do would be}} {{to go down to the}} lake and row back to camp. During the day they had allowed some small game to pass unmolested, and this now added to their discomfiture.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll wager <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> cross {{here with}} ease, and thus save {{themselves}} {{the trouble of}} going around the south point," [...] said Jack, and in this surmise he was correct.|$|E
60|$|They kept {{steadily}} {{north and}} at last {{came down to the}} coast. As it was still dark they lay down till morning. When the sun rose <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> make out a village some eight miles away.|$|E
60|$|Granny Fox didn't {{wait for}} any more. She started off {{as fast as}} she could go, with Reddy Fox after her, and every few steps they rubbed their ears and shook their heads as if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> shake out the pain.|$|E
2500|$|Nixon became head {{writer for}} Another World in 1965, {{and decided to}} use a few ideas from her All My Children bible. In one {{specific}} case, she used {{the model of the}} Erica Kane character to create a brand new Another World character named Rachel Davis. Nixon said Rachel was Erica's [...] "precursor to the public … [...] Erica and Rachel have in common is <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get their dream, they'd be satisfied... But that dream has been elusive", Nixon said.|$|R
6000|$|With {{that they}} had to go. This was still worse than before, <b>they</b> <b>thought.</b> Where <b>could</b> <b>they</b> get such a marvellous boar? They all went about hanging their heads; but when only one day {{remained}} of the three Esben came along. When he saw his brothers' sorrowful looks he cried, 'Hallo, what's the matter now?' ...|$|R
60|$|They {{had just}} heard the news, and short as the time was, had so few {{preparations}} to make that they were ready for a start. A dawk-garry, or post-carriage, was allotted to them, which, the ayah riding outside, would hold them with some comfort, these vehicles being specially constructed to allow the occupants, when two in number only, to lie down at full length. It would be a close fit for the three ladies, but <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> manage; {{and it was a}} comfort to know that, even if no tents could be erected at night, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> lie down in shelter.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{did make}} a claim on it, so Mr. Franklin says, but he managed {{in some way or}} other {{to get them out of}} it. I guess they left it mostly because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do better on the Spell place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{going to}} have a skirmish," [...] Peter said. [...] "I know these Highlanders. Instead of jest firing a bit and then falling back, they'll be {{sticking}} here and fighting as if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> lick the hull army of the Yankees." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{took the}} boys {{some time to}} skin the dead bear and cut away such meat as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> tote along. The rest of the meat they hung in a tree, {{thinking}} they might possibly come back for it later. Then they started once more for camp.|$|E
50|$|When Pata {{first came}} to River Falls {{he wanted to be}} a {{professional}} football player. But in 1998, while still a student, then football defensive coordinator and strength coach Tom Journell, gave Pata a chance to work in the athletic performance arena. Pata first helped with the Falcon softball and men's basketball teams. In 2001 he had a dual role as an athletic performance coach and assistant football coach. In 2006 he became UWRF's full-time athletic performance coach. Pata has loved coaching ever since, as he is able to help young adults achieve dreams <b>they</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> and it allows him to continue his ancestry of engineers, as he is now a 5th generation engineer.|$|R
500|$|They {{continued}} to perform regularly around Crawley (including The Rocket, St. Edward's, and Queen's Square in particular) throughout 1977 and 1978. On 19 February 1978 {{they were joined}} at The Rocket {{for the first time}} by a support band from Horley called Lockjaw, featuring bassist Simon Gallup. Hansa was dissatisfied with the group's demos and did not wish to release [...] "Killing an Arab". [...] The label suggested that the band attempt [...] cover versions instead. [...] They refused, and by March 1978 Easy Cure's contract with the label had been dissolved. Smith later recalled, [...] "We were very young. <b>They</b> just <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> turn us into a teen group. They actually wanted us to do cover versions and we always refused." ...|$|R
50|$|It may be {{surmised that}} Leigh's {{surviving}} family were less keen {{on the design}} for shortly after Leigh's death they asked another architect, James Wilson of Bath, Somerset, to propose a new design. This he did in his flamboyant Italianate style, {{but the cost of}} completing a new mansion was too great for any of them to afford. (Indeed, it raises the question of how <b>they</b> ever <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> both demolish and build a completely new building, but clearly it underlines that they did not share their father's passion for living in monastic conditions.) Wilson had his own opinion of the site and wanted the family to build, if they were going to, in a new location in the valley.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt it}} is, but the French don't always respect the convents--very much the contrary, indeed. No, I don't {{think that they}} would go out merely to rush into the street; but they might go out if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get over the bridge before the French arrived." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{two girls}} both {{coloured}} {{up at the}} allusion, and Monsieur Pickard laughed. [...] "Now I will go below, Mr. Glover. She is very small {{by the side of}} the brigantine," [...] he said, as he completed his visit of inspection. [...] "I am not surprised that the pirates chased you after your impudence in firing at them, and that <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> eat you at a mouthful. Now, we will pay a visit to the barque." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{maintain}} {{themselves against}} any force {{that might be}} sent against them, and relying upon this they {{became more and more}} insolent and overbearing, and for some time before the outbreak in 1860 every one saw that sooner or later the storm would burst, and the matter have to be fought out until either we were driven from the island or the natives became thoroughly convinced of their inability to oppose us.|$|E

60|$|They {{had been}} {{disappointed}} in the oranges, which they found in no way better than those which they had bought in England. But <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> pick them off the trees, they must somehow have a superior flavor. Accordingly they sallied out by the land gate, passed unquestioned through the line of British sentries, and were soon in the little village inside the Spanish lines.|$|R
50|$|Carmen Pata {{has been}} the head Strength and Conditioning coach at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls since 2006 {{after five years of}} being an {{assistant}} football coach and strength coach. Pata has loved coaching ever since, as he is able to help young adults achieve dreams <b>they</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> and it allows him to continue his ancestry of engineers, as he is now a 5th generation engineer. A lasting symbol of Pata's goal to help his student athletes achieve greatness is an old school bell that is rung whenever an athlete has done something that they have never done before, whether it be a new bench press or a new vertical, no circumstance is too little to ring the bell. Carmen Pata has embodied the spirit of UWRF athletics, and continues to improve the campus and community through health and wellness.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the country}} those men came from, they care {{just as much}} about killing a man, as you care about {{emptying}} the ashes out of your pipe. If a thousand lives stood {{between them and the}} getting back of their Diamond--and if <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> destroy those lives without discovery--they would take them all. The sacrifice of caste is a serious thing in India, if you like. The sacrifice of life is nothing at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{correspondent}} of the Naval and Military Gazette {{was under}} an apprehension that the mutineers would {{be joined by}} the praedial apprentices of the circumjacent estates: not the slightest foundation existed for this apprehension. Some months previous to this Daaga had planned a mutiny, but this was interrupted by sending a part of the Paupau and Yarraba recruits to St. Lucia. The object of all those conspiracies was to get back to Guinea, which <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> accomplish by marching to eastward.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Bill Moxey and Jack Williams, who had {{charge of}} the branch-- which is {{considered}} the post of honour at a fire--had paid no attention whatever to this little episode; but the instant the order was given, had conveyed their branch into the building, {{and up to the}} first floor, where <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> reach the fire more directly; for it is an axiom in fire brigades to get into a burning building without delay, and attack the fire at its heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "These people," [...] said she, [...] "have {{entered into}} a {{conspiracy}} against us. I have questioned them thoroughly, and have made them answer me. The horse was at home yesterday, and the boy did not go after the express-wagon. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> that if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> keep us here, until our company had gone, we would {{stay as long as}} we originally intended, and they would continue to make money out of us. But they are mistaken. We are going home immediately." ...|$|R
60|$|The fedai {{heard these}} sounds also, and read in them their doom. Forgetting caution in their despair and rage, they hurled {{themselves}} upon the brethren, for <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get them down they might still {{break through the}} door and slay Salah-ed-din before they themselves were slain. But for awhile the brethren stopped their rush with point and buckler, wounding two of them sorely; and when at length they closed in upon them, the gates were burst, and Hassan and the outer guard were at hand.|$|R
50|$|Račan's centre-left {{coalition}} {{lost its}} majority in parliament following the November 2003 election. SDP didn't create a big coalition {{like in the}} previous elections which cost them the votes. HSS decided to go alone and join the party who wins the elections. Those tactics proved to be devastating for them. The coalition with HNS was rejected by Račan for reasons unknown which also {{proved to be a}} mistake. Račan conceded the defeat soon after election results were announced. His former coalition partners attacked him for conceding victory so early because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> try to enforce another great coalition but Račan said that it was unlikely to happen and even if it would happen, there would be no stability in such a great gathering. He officially ceased to be Prime Minister on 23 December 2003 when the Croatian Parliament approved his successor, Ivo Sanader of the HDZ, to take up that post.|$|R
