5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{drink to}} our better acquaintance, sir; I {{believe this is}} the first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> have <b>met,</b> though your {{attention}} would seem to say otherwise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Coincidences are {{sometimes}} striking, are they not? You remember, the last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> suggesting that I was fortunate in having no enemies among the mountains?" ...|$|E
6000|$|DORA. That he is, {{from head}} to foot. I do believe I lost my heart to him the very first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> and I love him so much-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... “The last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> was at Dawson, Queen’s Jubilee, or Birthday, or something—don’t you remember?—the canoe {{races in}} the river, and the {{obstacle}} races down the main street?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] said Jasper, rather indignantly. [...] "I {{was walking}} {{with him for}} some <b>time</b> before <b>we</b> <b>met</b> the girls. You are very pale, Marian. Have you also a headache?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} the first <b>time</b> that <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> Miss McIntyre?" [...] he asked, standing on the rug and {{looking down at her}} dark hair, and the beautifully feminine curve of her ivory neck.|$|R

6000|$|... 'What is {{the trouble}} now?' I asked, {{for the last}} <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had <b>met,</b> Penfentenyou was {{floating}} a three-million pound loan for his beloved but unscrupulous Province, and I {{did not wish to}} entertain any more of his financial friends.|$|R

60|$|How well I can {{recollect}} {{the first}} <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> her! Often and often I have recalled the circumstances, {{and tried to}} remember what the exact impression was which she produced on my mind at the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{meet you}} again," [...] he said. [...] "I behaved like a blackguard, last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> and you gave me the {{thrashing}} which I deserved. I hope we shall get on better, in the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know how}} it ought to have been," [...] she said, in a low voice. [...] "I know very well how it ought to have been. I should have kept myself free till that <b>time</b> when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> on the braes of Loughlinter, and then all would have been well with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a long}} <b>time</b> since <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> and {{you have}} changed since then," [...] she said pleasantly. [...] "When you raced past our wagon I hardly {{recognized}} you. That, however, was perhaps only to be expected; but one might wonder whether you have changed otherwise, too. I recollect you were refreshingly sanguine when I last saw you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] I said, [...] "it {{is of no}} use to try {{to avoid}} me.

6000|$|... 'But I {{saw that}} shadow in his house,' said Martin Chuzzlewit, 'the last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> and warned him of its presence. I {{know it when}} I see it, do I not? I, who have lived within it all these years!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you again, Colonel O'Connor," [...] {{the general}} said. [...] "The last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> was when the {{surgeons}} were dressing my wounds, on the heights near Talavera. That was a hot business, for a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Dampierre," [...] he said, [...] "you are {{not going}} to cut me, are you? There has been no quarrel between us, and the last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> was when we were lying next {{to each other in the}} ambulance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me they avoided as {{they would}} a plague, and when at <b>times</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> our salutations were grave as those of, men {{on the point of}} {{crossing}} swords. I despised them for their coarse, ruffling apostasy more than ever my father had despised their father for a bigot, and they guessing or knowing by instinct what was in my mind held me in deeper rancour even than their ancestors had done mine. And more galling still and yet a sharper spur to their hatred did those whelps find in the realization that all the countryside held, as it had held for ages, us to be their betters. A hard blow to their pride was that, but their revenge was not long in coming.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me congratulate you, at all events," [...] {{interposed}} the prince, kindly, [...] "on your having recovered your hearing, grannie. This is not {{the first}} <b>time</b> <b>we</b> have <b>met,</b> Hafrydda, but I grieve to see that my old friend's nerves are not so strong as they used to be. You tremble a good deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{acquaintance}} {{with this man}} is a case in point. He has obtruded his horrible profession upon me every <b>time</b> <b>we</b> have <b>met.</b> I have actually seen him publicly cheered as a pugilist-hero; and yet, being off the track, and ignorant of the very existence of such a calling, I have looked on and seen nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your luck stood you in good stead--as usual," [...] he said. [...] "I {{meant to}} kill you that night. You see I don't mind confessing it! I had sworn to make the attempt the first <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> face to face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{that means}} you are sorry you were rude to me last <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> down in Fourteenth Street," [...] she said, [...] "I guess I may as well accept your apology. You were a trifle {{disappointed}} then, weren't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the chap. South Africa, it was. Evan Graham. Next <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> {{was on the}} Times {{dispatch}} boat on the Yellow Sea. And we crossed trails a dozen times after that, without meeting, until {{that night in the}} Café Venus.|$|E
3000|$|I got to {{know you}} in 1993 when we both {{were members of the}} DIN group [...] "biotests". We planned to amend the general advice how to conduct aquatic biotests and {{established}} a small group consisting of you, Ernst Nusch, Wolfgang Bödeker and me in order to draft a chapter how tests should be designed, carried out and evaluated. We were extremely productive. You taught us statistics and explained the contexts in a fashion that could be readily understood by ecotoxicologists who avoided mathematics since there studies at university. This fascinating cooperation established the basis for a friendship between us lasting for many years. I remember several <b>times</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> after this activity and discussed several topics at the interface between science and regulation and I always appreciated your ability to listen advertently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Thornberry; [...] "it {{is a long}} <b>time</b> since <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> Mr. Ferrars--ten years. I used {{to think}} that in ten years one might do anything; and a year ago, I really thought I had done it; but the accursed laws of this blessed country, as it calls itself, have nearly broken me, as they have broken many a better man before me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know,' said Lady Annabel to her neighbour, 'I {{have been}} fancying all dinner <b>time</b> that <b>we</b> had <b>met</b> before; but I find {{it is that}} you only {{resemble}} one with whom I was once acquainted.' ...|$|R
