The second type, Frontlines, is a large battleground instance in which players form teams of up to 24 characters. Teams are delineated by players' allegiance <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> Grand Companies and the team which reaches the target number of points first wins the match. Four modes are available with differing locations and rulesets, such as King of the Hill, capture the flag, and team deathmatch. Within the fiction, Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military exercises between the three nations with the ulterior goal of jockeying for dominance of regions rich in magical artifacts.|$|E
