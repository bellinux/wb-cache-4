5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards Borneo, {{additional units}} were dispatched from Japan {{during the second}} half of 1944 and the 37th Army was established in September <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>the</b> island's defence.

Accordingly, several Japanese units stationed in north-east Borneo were ordered to march to the western side of Borneo. This movement proceeded slowly, owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks.|$|E

They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>the</b> large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm the plans for the launch of the ARG.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization <b>to</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>the</b> anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not want the anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E
