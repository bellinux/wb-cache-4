Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
