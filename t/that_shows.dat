The objectives of the study are {{to find out the}} language spoken by teenagers and to describe the language attitudes of teenagers towards Toba Batak language in Jorlang Hataran. This research was conducted by using qualitative research. The data were the teenager responses collected by recording the interview. There were 34 responses of teenagers that analyzed.

5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.|$|E

5|$|Before every battle, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice of using 'Political Tactics,' such as {{increasing}} or decreasing time limit of battles or preventing enemy reinforcements from arriving during battles.

However, these alliances only last for a set time decided by the tactic used. There's also an 'Archives Mode' <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> the motions and voices of the officers.

5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi Desert in 1971.

Thomson's engraving was probably based on an oil painting by the London portrait painter Samuel Drummond (1765–1844), who had shown Accum in a similar pose in a painting produced a few years prior to this. In addition, Accum's brother-in-law, the artist Wilhelm Strack, painted an oil portrait <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> Accum as a young man.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} pterosaurs was highly {{modified}} from their reptilian ancestors by the adaption to flight. Pterosaur bones were hollow and air-filled, like {{the bones of}} birds. They had a keeled breastbone that was developed for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged brain <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> specialised features associated with flight. In some later pterosaurs, the backbone over the shoulders fused into a structure known as a notarium, which served to stiffen the torso during flight, and provide a stable support for the scapula (shoulder blade).|$|E
