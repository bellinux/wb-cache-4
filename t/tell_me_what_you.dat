25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{she was a}} {{supporting}} actress in Airport 1975. Loy played Mrs. Devane, a heavy-drinking woman, imbibing Jim Beam and Olympia Beer mixed together. She played a foil to Sid Caesar. The film also starred Gloria Swanson. In 1978, she appeared in the film The End {{as the mother of}} the main character played by Burt Reynolds. Her last motion picture performance was in 1980 in Sidney Lumet's Just <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want. She also returned to the stage, making her Broadway debut in a short-lived 1973 revival of Clare Boothe Luce's The Women. She toured in a 1978 production of Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, directed by David Clayton.|$|E
500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want me to buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E

500|$|... "Bassline" [...] {{was written}} by Andrea Simms, Andrew [...] "Pop" [...] Wansel, Chris Brown, David Johnson, Robert Calloway, Ronald [...] "Flippa" [...] Colson and Warren [...] "Oak" [...] Felder. The song was {{produced}} by Pop Wansel and Dayvi Jae. [...] "Bassline" [...] was recorded by Brian Springer with assistance from Iain Findley. The recordings were later mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance by Trehy Harris. Musically, [...] "Bassline" [...] is a dubstep, electropop and electrohop song, that incorporates elements of reggae. The song lasts for three minutes and 58 seconds. Instrumentation consists of a wobble bass and synthesizers. Album Review|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|date=2012-07-16|accessdate=2012-09-10}} Melinda Newman of HitFix compared [...] "Bassline" [...] to the songs by Kesha and LMFAO. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush noted that the lyrics are about Brown trying to [...] "convince a hot girl he spots in the club {{to come back to}} his crib", in which he sings [...] "Hey girl <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> talk / Pretty as a picture on the wall / Hey girl you can get it all / Cause I know you like the way the beat go". Brown also declares, [...] "You heard about my image / But I could give a flying motherfuck who's offended". Hayley Avron of Contactmusic.com noted that a robot voice joins Brown in the hook [...] "Girls like my bassline". Hazel Robinson of California Literary Review magazine noted that the word [...] "bassline" [...] is a metaphor for penis.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} is [...] "Survival". It is a [...] "sweetly funky number" [...] which tries to [...] "convey a loosely drawn {{narrative}} of the punishment she endured from the media and her feelings {{leading up to the}} release". It has a lyrical allusion to the singer's 1986 single [...] "Live to Tell", with double-tracked strong vocals and harmonies. In the song, Madonna enhanced the rhythmic sounds more and compressed the bass sounds, in order to cater to the then musical trend. Containing multiple hooks, [...] "Survival"'s lyrics are about dualities like heaven/hell, up/down, angels/saints. [...] "Secret", the second song, begins with just the sound of Madonna's voice singing over a rhythmic, folksy guitar in descending chord sequence, before opening up to a sparse, retro rhythm section. A deep percussion starts around the one minute mark, accompanied by wah-wah ascending string line, supporting the descending guitar. Towards the end, an upper harmonic melody is added to display variance. Madonna's voice remains {{at the center of the}} song's production, as she sings lyrics such as [...] "happiness lies in your own hand". Throughout the song, Madonna also sings the lyrics [...] "My baby's got a secret", however she never discloses what the secret may be. During the next song, [...] "I'd Rather Be Your Lover", Madonna lusts after the unattainable through processes of negotiation: [...] "I could be your sister, I could be your mother, We could be friends, I'd even be your brother". Towards the middle of the song, an eight bar rap break is taken by singer and rapper Meshell Ndegeocello, who raps: [...] "Tell me what you want / <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> need...". Madonna interrupts, with her voice foregrounded and juxtaposed over the short interjections of Ndegeocello's rap part. A trip hop track, the song is musically comparable to the tracks on Portishead's 1994 album, Dummy, and also contains influences of new jack swing. It uses a sample from [...] "It's Your Thing" [...] performed by Lou Donaldson.|$|E
