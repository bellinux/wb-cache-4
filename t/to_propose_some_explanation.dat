40|$|International audienceThis article {{addresses}} collaborative {{concept learning}} in a MAS. In a concept learning problem an agent incrementally revises a hypothetical representation of some target concept {{to keep it}} consistent with the whole set of examples that it receives from the environment or from other agents. In the program SMILE, this notion of consistency was extended {{to a group of}} agents. A surprising experimental result of that work was that a group of agents learns better the difficult boolean problems, than a unique agent receiving the same examples. The first purpose of the present paper is <b>to</b> <b>propose</b> <b>some</b> <b>explanation</b> about such unexpected superiority of collaborative learning. Furthermore, when considering large societies of agents, using pure sequential protocols is unrrealistic. The second and main {{purpose of this paper is}} thus to propose and experiment broadcast protocols for collaborative learning...|$|E

We discuss {{the ability of}} the force field to predict quantitatively the interfacial tension of alkanes-water, benzene-water, chloroform-water and alcohol-water systems. The performance of the prediction is evaluated through the dependence on temperature and on alkane length. This study makes contribution to the challenging discussion about the robustness and the transferability of the MARTINI force field on interfacial properties that did not belong to the experimental database during the calibration process. We have also used the distributions of the molecules along the normal to the water liquid interface <b>to</b> <b>propose</b> <b>some</b> <b>explanations</b> when the simulated interfacial tensions have shown significant deviations from experiments...|$|R
40|$|Many {{innovations}} {{have been}} introduced in national accounts {{in order to better}} gauge the information and communication technologies (ICT) diffusion impact: new ICT definitions; recognition of business and government software expenditures as fixed investment; hedonic price index. Nevertheless, there still does not exist any clear consensus about the magnitude of the ICT impact on growth. Our aim is <b>to</b> <b>propose</b> <b>some</b> <b>explanations</b> of this relative failure and also show that the debate should not be exclusively centered on quantitative methods. To this end, we {{take a close look at}} the two main questions concerning the debate surrounding the measure of the ICT impact: 1) Are there any substantial total factor productivity (TFP) gains generated by ICT diffusion or is it only a classic story of capital deepening increase? 2) If there are indeed TFP gains, are they limited to ICT producers, as Robert J. Gordon claims, or is there any diffusion to ICT users? The answer to the first question is really important only if it determines the length and the extent of an eventual growth cycle impulsed by ICT.

Gordon claims, or is there any diffusion to ICT users ? The answer to the first question is really important only if it determines the length and the extent of an eventual growth cycle impulsed by ICT. The possibility that productivity gains mainly due to capital deepening generate strong and durable growth has been theoritically demonstrated by Greenwood and Jovanovic (1998), thanks to a vintage capital model. We precise the conditions under which this result can be obtained and discuss their empirical relevance. According to this approach, the true debate concerns the durability of the present technological shock, instead of its capacity to generate an autonomous technical progress. The answer to the second question is crucial because it could guide industrial policy choices. If TFP gains are limited to ICT producers, should a country always be an ICT producer, or will it anyway grow at a strong pace thanks to the fall of ICT prices ? The relevance of this economic debate is unfortunately poised by the shortcomings of available statistical tools. On one hand, the distinction between ICT users and producers is purely discretionary. On the other hand, TFP measure is completely distorted by the method used to evaluate the value of capital (cost-based prices against adjusted-quality prices). That is why we argue that the international diffusion of growth gains due to ICT essentially depends on the capacity of ICT producers' countries to stay in a rent keeping situation. The text is divided into two parts. The first one first makes a quick assessment of the adaptation of american national accounts to the " new economy ", and then underlines the limits of these changes. The second one shows that the economic debate on the importance of TFP gains acceleration and where they occur, although more complex because of these limits, can quite ignore them thanks to the implications of some endogeneous growth and international trade models.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that surface pretreatmentof {{substrates}} is a key step to ensure the hydrolytic stability of adhesive joints. For many years now, highly efficient aluminum surface pretreatments have been used in numerous fields, ranging from basic industrial to advanced aerospace industry applications. However, for many small and medium enterprises (SMEs), anodizing or conversion coatings are not realistic solutions due to their cost and the technical/scientific resources they require. During recent projects in collaboration with SMEs, simple surface pretreatment approaches were used to meet the requirements of some non-load-bearing and fatigue-free applications involving adhesive bonding. Surprisingly, among the surface pretreatmentsinvestigated, alumina grit-blasting was found to be very efficient in providing durable adhesive joints.

40|$|International audienceInfection with {{encapsulated}} {{bacteria can}} be prevented by vaccination with capsular polysaccharides, either plain or conjugated to a protein carrier. However, results concerning these vaccinations raise several paradoxes. Polysaccharides from encapsulated bacteria are {{generally considered to be}} T cell-independent antigens which are unable to trigger a T cell-dependent germinal center reaction, but, strikingly, anti-polysaccharide antibodies are often mutated in humans. Polysaccharide–protein conjugate vaccines are able to induce a true T cell-dependent memory response with a rise in antibody titers and a switch to high-affinity IgG antibodies in children below two years of age, but neither the plain nor the conjugated vaccine can induce memory in older infants and adults. We <b>propose</b> <b>some</b> <b>explanations</b> for these paradoxes based on our recent observation that humans display a circulating splenic marginal zone B-cell population with a pre-diversified immunoglobulin repertoire in charge of the immune response to T cell-independent antigens...|$|R

First, we will reinterpret some points in the literature and second, we will move forward on developing a description, or genetic decomposition, of how the limit concept can be learned. In discussing the literature, we will suggest a new variation of a dichotomy, considered by various authors, between dynamic or process conceptions of limits and static or formal conceptions. We will also <b>propose</b> <b>some</b> <b>explanations</b> of why these conceptions are so difficult for students to construct. In describing the evolution of a genetic decomposition for the limit concept, we will give examples of how we used our analysis of interviews of 25 students from a calculus course to make appropriate modifications...|$|R

40|$|This {{article has}} two main purposes. The {{first is that}} of {{providing}} a longitudinal analysis of the global politics of untying aid, by looking {{at a number of}} debates that have occurred within the Development Assistance Committee and {{in the context of a}} number of high-level forums on aid effectiveness. The second is that of <b>proposing</b> <b>some</b> <b>explanations</b> for the lack of significant progress in these contexts. The focus is on the European Union (EU), which has been widely perceived as one of the most fervent supporters of promoting the aid untying agenda. In all these debates, the EU's leadership aspirations have remained largely unfulfilled. Thus, the EU has failed to adopt a EU-wide vision on aid untying; persuade non-EU donors to untie their aid, even when it has played the reciprocity card; and promote a pro-poor use of foreign aid, by supporting local ownership and facilitating greater access of developing country firms to aid contracts...|$|R

Following a coding schema based upon the set of scaffolds offered in the Knowledge Forum environment, we have qualitatively analysed 60 forums and 1, 370 students from different subjects. The results show that there are very few elaborated and shared deep discussions: the central axis in those superior contributions focuses on bringing new information to already written contributions.
