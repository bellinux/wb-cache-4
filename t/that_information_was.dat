25|$|Many {{respondents}} who {{never used the}} library cited embarrassment or {{lack of knowledge about}} available information as reasons.

Rather a different way ought to be taken: to find the phenomenon first and then assign a name to it. The view <b>that</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> the same thing as a structure is considered. Then the processes by which <b>information</b> <b>is</b> created are analyzed. The definition <b>that</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> detected difference is closely scrutinized and it <b>is</b> found <b>that</b> <b>information</b> can also <b>be</b> detected sameness. It <b>is</b> argued <b>that</b> <b>information</b> <b>is</b> relative to the observer and for the very reason of the way it is created it is subjective. That extends only to information acquired. The existence of subjective information, however, does not prove information cannot exist objectively...|$|R

25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} <b>that</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{authorized}} the CIA to use waterboarding {{and several other}} [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques" [...] that several critics, including Barack Obama, would label as torture. Between 2002 and 2003 the CIA considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, to be legal based on a secret Justice Department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions' ban on torture and Vice President Cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal.

2500|$|Place names {{based on}} {{traditional}} Chinese knowledge and Islamic knowledge coexist separately. Their boundary {{line can be}} drawn from Besh Baliq to Delhi. Names based on Chinese geography were placed to the north and east of Besh Baliq even if they are actually located to the west. For example, the Talas River, a historic site for the Tang Dynasty, was placed to the northeast of Besh Baliq although its actual direction is northwest. Similarly, India and Tibet are based on traditional Chinese knowledge, mainly gained by Buddhist pilgrimage up to the Tang Dynasty. To the west of the [...] "old" [...] India, contemporary place names of India such as Delhi, Badaun and Duwayjir∼Duwayqir (Persianized form of Devagiri) are shown.

AAA, claimed in a press release that Hopewell employs 11 sheriff's deputies working in 14-hour shifts to patrol less than two miles of the highway that lie within the city limits of Hopewell. [...] However, this statistic has been denied by the sheriff of Hopewell, who was baffled as to where <b>that</b> <b>information</b> <b>was</b> generated as he said the deputies working on I-295 only work eight-hour shifts. This practice, which it has been claimed, annually generated $1.8 million in revenue from speeding tickets, of which 75% were issued to out of state drivers, triggered a court clash between the Commonwealth's Attorney and the city prosecutor, and elicited an official ruling from the Attorney General of Virginia. Sheriff Luther Sodat said that the almost two-mile stretch of highway “is a safety issue for Hopewell.” Virginia's urban interstates have a fatality rate about one-third the Statewide rate for all roads combined.|$|E
