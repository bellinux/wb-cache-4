40|$|<b>The</b> <b>present</b> paper {{reports on}} the first {{two-dimensional}} 2 D self-consistent solution of weak turbulence equations describing the evolution of electron-beam-plasma interaction in which quasilinear as well as nonlinear three-wave decay processes are taken into account. It is found that the 2 D Langmuir wave decay processes lead {{to the formation of}} a quasicircular ring spectrum in wave number space. It is also seen that the 2 D ring-spectrum of Langmuir turbulence leads to a tendency to isotropic heating of the electrons. These findings contain some important ramifications. First, in the literature, isotropization of energetic electrons, detected in the solar wind for instance, is usually attributed to pitch-angle scattering. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>finding</b> constitutes an alternative mechanism, whose efficiency for other parametric regimes has to be investigated. Second, when projected onto the one-dimensional 1 D space, the 2 D ring spectrum may give a false impression of Langmuir waves inverse cascading to longer wavelength regime, when in reality, the wavelength of the turbulence does not change at all but only the wave propagation angle changes. Although <b>the</b> <b>present</b> analysis excludes <b>the</b> induced scattering, which is another process potentially responsible for the inverse cascade, <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>finding</b> at least calls for an investigation into the relative efficacy of the inverse-cascading process in 1 D vs 2 D...|$|R
