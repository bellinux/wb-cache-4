5|$|In 2005, Lance Mackey {{became the}} first Yukon Quest rookie to win the race, a feat that was {{repeated}} by 2011's champion, Dallas Seavey. In 2007, Mackey {{became the first}} to win both <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> Quest and the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when Ty Halvorson took 20days, 8hours, and 29minutes to finish. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle {{became the first woman}} to win the race, in 10days, 22hours, and 57minutes.

5|$|The {{report was}} duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers {{confirmed}} the project {{no longer was}} justified.

5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the force}} became {{the topic of}} many radio {{broadcasts}} and films.

The popularity of these films finally waned in the 1970s, although this image of the force continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police, such as the series Due South which centred on a mounted police constable from <b>the</b> <b>Yukon.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of Yukon Quest International informed <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> board that they were considering dropping <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed {{it would be easier to}} manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.|$|E

5|$|From its {{headwaters}} in the Coast Mountains, <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> River flows northwest, {{across the}} Yukon–Alaska border, until it intersects the Porcupine River at {{the settlement of}} Fort Yukon.

As the river flows southwest, it intersects the Tanana and Koyukuk rivers before looping south, then north into Norton Sound in the Bering Sea.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove {{was denied}} entry by Canadian customs {{officials}} in the pre-race verification process, the only time a musher has been denied entry into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove started the race, but quit before the border. Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska Yukon Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> Quest and run a cheaper Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Members of <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> Quest organization revolted against this and voted to evict the board members who had proposed it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area.

5|$|The Klondike {{could be}} reached only by <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> River, either {{upstream}} from its delta, downstream from its head, or {{from somewhere in the}} middle through its tributaries. River boats could navigate <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could be hot, while from October to June, during the long winters, temperatures could drop below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E
5|$|The North-West Mounted Police set up control posts at {{the borders}} of <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> Territory or, where that was disputed, at easily {{controlled}} points such as the Chilkoot and White Passes.

Their tasks included enforcing the rules requiring that travellers bring a year's supply of food with them to be allowed into <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> Territory, checking for illegal weapons, preventing the entry of criminals and enforcing customs duties.|$|E
5|$|The final trigger, however, was the {{discovery}} of gold elsewhere in Canada and Alaska, prompting a new stampede, this {{time away from the}} Klondike. In August 1898, gold had been found at Atlin Lake at the head of <b>the</b> <b>Yukon</b> River, generating a flurry of interest, but during the winter of 1898–99 much larger quantities were found at Nome at the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>Yukon.</b> In 1899, a flood of prospectors from across the region left for Nome, 8,000 from Dawson alone during a single week in August.
