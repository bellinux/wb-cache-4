50|$|The Hurstbridge line is both notable and {{notorious for}} having several <b>single-track</b> <b>sections,</b> due to {{constraints}} imposed by geography {{and lack of}} government investment. These <b>single-track</b> <b>sections</b> create bottlenecks at which trains must often wait for up to 10 minutes for an oncoming train before proceeding.|$|R
50|$|The <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> is {{equipped}} with passing loops with three lines.|$|R

50|$|The line is {{double track}} throughout. The last <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> between Mikolajki Pomorskie and Malbork was doubled to two tracks in 1967.|$|R

50|$|The line remains double-tracked {{most of the}} way to Weymouth, {{but there}} is a <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> between Moreton and Dorchester South which {{constrains}} capacity.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} year, the two-track expansion of lines B and C, {{with the exception}} of the short <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> between Bleicheweg and Waldsee, was completed.|$|R
5000|$|Some A-class and B-class {{roads in}} the Highlands are still <b>single-track,</b> {{although}} many <b>sections</b> have been widened {{for the sake of}} faster travel. In 2009, the A830 [...] "Road to the Isles" [...] and A851 on Skye have had their <b>single-track</b> <b>sections</b> replaced with higher-quality single-carriageway road.|$|R
5000|$|The Canoe River train {{crash in}} Canada in 1950 also {{involved}} two trains, controlled by telegraphed orders, authorized {{to enter the}} same <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> in opposite directions.|$|R
50|$|In September 1926 {{the then}} <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> between Clifton Hill and Westgarth was {{converted}} to Lever Locking and Track Control signalling, followed by Alphington to Heidelberg in June 1927.|$|R
50|$|Explanation: - <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> = {{double track}} sectionThe names in {{brackets}} are municipalities {{that are not}} officially included {{in the name of}} the station (which is usual practice in Germany).|$|R
50|$|The tunnel section has {{an inner}} {{diameter}} of 6.70 m on <b>single-track</b> <b>sections</b> and 9.80 m on two-track sections. The {{radius of the}} loop is 190 m and its length is 1,500 m.|$|R
50|$|This {{station is}} at the end of one of only two <b>single-track</b> <b>sections</b> on the MAX system. The other is also on the Red Line, just west and north of Gateway Transit Center.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> is {{equipped}} with passing loops with three lines. Often, the passing loops are present {{at the location of}} train stations. The total length of passing loops is designed to be 1100 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two side {{platforms}} serving two tracks on the otherwise <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> {{of the line}} east of Ainosato-Kyōikudai Station. The station has automated ticket machines and Kitaca card readers. The station is unattended.|$|R

50|$|It {{may become}} {{necessary}} {{to duplicate the}} western section of the Bruhrain Railway, but no public commitments have been made, although this section is the only <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn network and has substantial traffic.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{double-track}} throughout, {{except for a}} <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> at Cité du Havre, where people exited {{on one side of}} the train and boarded on the other. Maintenance facilities were located northwest of La Ronde station.|$|R
50|$|An {{instrument}} was placed {{at each end}} of the <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> that they were to control. They were connected together electrically in such a way that operation of one would depend on operations carried out using the other.|$|R
50|$|The tram stop {{consists}} of two platforms {{on either side of}} double track, linked by pedestrian level crossings. Immediately to the east of the station is a <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> which reaches as far as Phipps Bridge tram stop.|$|R
5000|$|The line is 31.90 km long, {{standard}} gauge and electrified at [...] supplied by overhead line. It is predominantly double-track, but with <b>single-track</b> <b>sections</b> from Stadelhofen to Tiefenbrunnen, Herrliberg-Feldmeilen to Meilen, Uetikon to Stäfa, and Uerikon to Rapperswil.|$|R
5000|$|Jay Duff won {{the first}} of the re-established event in 2001. His {{finishing}} time of 7:07 cannot be compared to the times of the 2002 and later events as a significantly larger amount of new challenging <b>single-track</b> <b>sections</b> were added.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{staggered}} side platforms serving two tracks on the otherwise <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> {{of the line}} east of Ainosato-Kyōikudai Station. The station has automated ticket machines and Kitaca card readers (not equipped with regular ticket gates). The station is unattended.|$|R
25|$|Another key {{improvement}} was the fitting of tablet exchangers to No. 552 and 570 for non-stop running on <b>single-track</b> <b>sections</b> of the North-eastern line, a portent of improvements on this line {{that would eventually}} lead to the non-stop Melbourne-Albury Spirit of Progress service of 1937.|$|R
50|$|According to the Watton-at-Stone Parish Council, a {{proposal}} for a rail route between London and Stevenage was approved by Parliament in 1898, though construction did not begin until 1906. A <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> through Watton-at-Stone opened on 4 March 1918, with the track later being dualled.|$|R
50|$|Prompted by the accident, {{engineer}} Edward Tyer {{developed the}} tablet {{system in which}} a token {{is given to the}} train driver; this must be slotted into an electric interlocking device {{at the other end of}} the <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> before another train is allowed to pass.|$|R
50|$|As part {{of grant}} {{money from the}} federal {{government}} to high-speed rail projects throughout America, the state of Connecticut was awarded $440 million to add a second track to 10.5 mi of the route between Berlin and Newington, Connecticut, eliminating one of the four <b>single-track</b> <b>sections</b> of the route.|$|R
50|$|Amtrak's Downeaster {{service to}} Maine, {{along with some}} Haverhill Line express trains, run on the Lowell Line from North Station to Wilmington, then follow the Wildcat Branch to the Haverhill Line. This routing is used to avoid the inner Haverhill Line, which {{has a number of}} <b>single-track</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The line {{accounts}} for a total length of [...] and is entirely electrified at 1,500 volts direct current (DC) using overhead lines. It is grade-separated in its whole length, running completely underground in central Barcelona, Terrassa and Sabadell. Excepting for the <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> between Sabadell Estació and Sabadell Rambla stations, {{the rest of the}} line has double track. Besides, an additional [...] line section belonging to the extension of the Sabadell branch is currently under construction. Once completed, it will allow for the dismantling of the line's only remaining <b>single-track</b> <b>section.</b> The signaling and security systems used on the line are centralized traffic control (CTC) and automatic train protection (ATP). The line features standard gauge (...) , unlike Spain's conventional mainline railway system, which features the broader Iberian gauge (...) , and to which it is unconnected.|$|R
5000|$|Both trains {{required}} {{the use of}} a <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> approximately 10 mi long in the western portion of Nashville. According to contemporary practices, the inbound train (No. 1) retained the right-of-way. Thus, the railroad dispatch informed the crew of the opposing (No. 4) train of the locomotive number of the No. 1, with the orders to stop in the double-track section if the crew did not visually identify the passing No. 1 before they reached the interlocking tower known as [...] "Shops Junction", where the <b>single-track</b> <b>section</b> began. The term [...] "Shops" [...] referred to the railroad's massive repair and refueling shops including its largest roundhouse. This was not a passenger stop but rather the junction where the railroad's mainline track to Memphis narrowed down to just one track.|$|R
