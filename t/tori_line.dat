40|$|Industrial {{longline}} fisheries {{cause the}} death {{of large numbers of}} seabirds annually. Various mitigation measures have been proposed, including the use of tori lines. In this study the efficiency of a single <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> to reduce seabird bycatch was tested on pelagic longline vessels (25 - 37 m length). Thirteen fishing trips were carried out in the area and season of the highest bycatch rates recorded in the southwest Atlantic (2009 - 2011). We deployed two treatments in random order: sets with a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> and without a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> (control treatment). The use of a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> significantly reduced seabird bycatch rates. Forty three and seven birds were captured in the control (0. 85 birds/ 1, 000 hooks, n = 49 sets) and in the <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> treatment (0. 13 birds/ 1, 000 hooks, n = 51 sets), respectively. In 47 % of the latter sets the <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> broke either because of entanglement with the longline gear or by tension. This diminished the <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> effectiveness; five of the seven captures during sets where a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> was deployed were following ruptures. Nine additional trips were conducted with a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> that was modified to reduce entanglements (2012 - 2016). Seven entanglements were recorded in 73 longline sets. The chance of a rupture on these trips was 4 % (95 % c. l. = 1 - 18 %) of that during 2009 - 2011. This work shows that the use of a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> reduces seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries and is a practice suitable for medium size vessels (~ 25 - 40 m length). Because the study area has historically very high bycatch rates at global level, this <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> design is potentially useful to reduce seabird bycatch in many medium size pelagic longline vessel fishing in the southern hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent trends}} in the Japanese tuna and billfish fishing activities by longline, pole-and-line, purse seine and other fisheries mostly in the WCPFC Convention Area (WCP-CA), including fleet size, catch and fishing effort statistics. The total number of longline vessels was 1, 208 in 2006, which was 25 vessels (2 %) {{less than that of}} 2005. For the pole-and-line vessel, total number of the vessels was 335 in 2006, which was 52 vessels (13 %) less than that in 2005. For the purse seine vessels, the number of vessels over 200 GRT, which operated in the equatorial waters, was 35 in 2006, which was equivalent to that in 2005. The number of the purse seine vessels of 50 - 200 GRT, which operate to catch tunas in north of 20 °N, was 84 in 2006, which are 3 vessels less than that in 2005. The total WCP-CA catch of tunas (Pacific bluefin, albacore, bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack) by the Japanese fishery in 2006 was 460, 000 mt, corresponding to 92 % of 501, 000 mt in 2005. In 2006, the catch of tunas by the purse seine fishery was 257, 000 mt (56 % of the total catch of tunas), with 124, 000 mt (27 %) by the pole-and-line, 67, 000 mt (15 %) by the longline, and the remaining (2 %) by the other gears. Japan conducted several research activities in relation to tuna in the WCP-CA in 2007 and 2008, such as tagging study for tropical tunas and sharks, research cruise for collecting tuna larvae.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Seabird bycatch in {{commercial}} fisheries {{is one of}} the major factors causing decreases in many seabird populations.

40|$|In {{the context}} of equivariant {{dynamical}} systems with a compact Lie group, Gamma, of symmetries, Field and Krupa have given sharp upper bounds on the drifts associated with relative equilibria and relative periodic orbits. For relative equilibria consisting of points of trivial isotropy, the drifts correspond to tori in Gamma. Generically, these are maximal tori. Analogous results hold {{when there is a}} nontrivial isotropy subgroup Sigma, with Gamma replaced by N (Sigma) /Sigma. In this paper, we generalize the results of Field and Krupa to noncompact Lie groups. The drifts now correspond to <b>tori</b> or <b>lines</b> (unbounded copies of R) in Gamma and generically these are maximal <b>tori</b> or <b>lines.</b> Which of these drifts is preferred, compact or unbounded, depends on Gamma: there are examples where compact drift is preferred (Euclidean group in the plane), where unbounded drift is preferred (Euclidean group in three-dimensional space) and where neither is preferred (Lorentz group). Our results partially explain the quasiperiodic (Winfree) and linear (Barkley) meandering of spirals in the plane, as well as the drifting behaviour of spiral bound pairs (Ermakova et al).

40|$|We {{construct}} a general relativistic radiative transfer (RT) formulation, applicable to particles {{with or without}} mass in astrophysical settings. Derived from first principles, the formulation is manifestly covariant. Absorption and emission, as well as relativistic, geometrical and optical depth effects are treated self-consistently. The RT formulation can handle 3 D geometrical settings and structured objects with variations and gradients in the optical depths across the objects and along the line-of-sight. The presence of mass causes the intensity variation along the particle bundle ray to be reduced by an aberration factor. We apply the formulation and demonstrate RT calculations for emission from accretion tori around rotating black holes, considering two cases: idealised optically thick tori that have a sharply defined emission boundary surface, and structured tori that allow variations in the absorption coefficient and emissivity within the tori. Intensity images and emission spectra of these tori are calculated. Geometrical effects, such as lensing-induced self-occulation and multiple-image contribution are far more significant in accretion tori than geometrically thin accretion disks. Optically thin accretion <b>tori</b> emission <b>line</b> profiles are distinguishable from the profiles of lines from optically thick accretion tori and optically thick geometrically thin accretion disks. Line profiles of optically thin accretion tori have a weaker dependence on viewing inclination angle {{than those of the}} optically thick accretion tori or accretion disks, especially at high viewing inclination angles. Limb effects are present in accretion tori with finite optical depths. Finally, in accretion flows onto relativistic compact objects, gravitationally induced line resonance can occur. This resonance occurs easily in 3 D flows, but not in 2 D flows, such as a thin accretion disk around a black hole.

40|$|Data {{collected}} by Australian observers, combined with logbook data supplied by all Japanese vessels {{fishing in the}} Australian Fishing Zone were used to estimate the total seabird catch and catch rates (and associated variances) within the Australian Fishing Zone by season and area. The species composition of subsamples of captured seabirds was {{used in conjunction with}} the estimates of total by-catch to provide estimates of by-catch by species. The total by-catch of all seabird species by Japanese longline within Australian waters was estimated to be 2, 981 (cv 17 %) for the 1992 fishing year, 3, 590 (cv 15 %) in 1993 and 2, 817 (cv 19 %) in 1994. However, the observed seabird bycatch may underestimate the total number of seabirds killed by 27 %. The increase in total seabird by-catch between 1992 and 1993 is partly due to the use of monofilament nylon longline gear by two vessels in 1993, and the decrease from 1993 to 1994 was mainly due to a corresponding reduction in fishing effort. For the three years examined, 78 % of the total seabird by-catch was albatrosses, with black-browed albatross (Diomedea melanophrys) and shy albatross (D. cauta) caught in the greatest numbers. Catches of yellow-nosed albatross (D. chlororhynchos), wandering albatross (D. exulans}, and grey-headed albatross (D. chrysostoma) were also substantial. The proportions of individual species caught showed considerable inter-annual variability. Most seabirds caught and killed by longline fishing are captured during line setting. Data {{collected by}} the observers were also used to determine the influence of various environmental factors and mitigation measures on seabird catch rates. Generalised linear models were used to determine the statistical significance of the effect of each factor on the seabird catch rate. Results show that the environmental factor that has the most influence is whether line setting was carried out at night or during the day. For the data examined, the chance of catching seabirds during day sets was five times greater than for night sets. For night sets, the chance of catching seabirds during the full half-phase of the moon was five times greater than during the new half-phase. Other environmental factors with significant effects were the area and season fished. Wind, cloud and sea conditions were not found to have a significant influence. Considerable variation in the seabird by-catch rate among vessels was found, which is probably due to differences in their implementation of mitigation measures, as well as the clumped distribution of seabirds by area and time. Interannual variation in the by-catch rate was found to be statistically significant but the differences among years was small in comparison to other factors. An examination of the influence of mitigation measures for sets made during the day in summer in the Tasmanian area showed that the level of bait thawing and unidentified factors related to individual vessels were most significant in determining the seabird by-catch rate, followed by the use of a bait throwing device.
