However, Miller became frustrated with the poor play of his team's goaltender, so he begged his coach {{as well as his}} father, Dean Miller, to let him <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> His father told him that if he could get two goals and three assists the next game he would buy Ryan a catching glove.

500|$|In junior high, Lautner—who was {{involved}} in karate, baseball and hip-hop dance—won the award for [...] "Best Smile" [...] and played in the school's Turkey Bowl American Football game. He went to public school in Valencia, California at Valencia High School until his sophomore year.

Lautner balanced karate and acting with being on the football and baseball teams at his school, and taking up jazz and hip-hop dance.

Interviewed by Brett Berk of Vanity Fair in May 2010, Morris stated that Brittany and Santana were simply best friends, and the show would not be taking them in a [...] "friends with benefits" [...] direction. However, at the Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour in August 2010, Murphy stated that the characters would in fact kiss on screen in an upcoming episode. Falchuk later explained that the Brittany/Santana storyline had begun [...] "almost as a goof at first", however [...] "then we realised this show is so inclusive, and then there were people we weren't representative of. This whole lesbian-bisexual female community. We're fortunate the network wasn't resistant of it and let us <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> then it became something much deeper." [...] In [...] "Duets", Brittany also had a brief relationship with Artie. Morris told Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post that she is a fan of McHale's, and had been pressing Murphy to give their characters a storyline together since the beginning of the season.|$|E

60|$|Now {{when the}} captains saw the answer {{of the great}} ones, {{and that they could}} not get a hearing from the old natives of the town, and that Mansoul was {{resolved}} to give the King's army battle, they prepared themselves to receive them, and to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> by the power of the arm. And, first, they made their force more formidable against Ear-gate; for they knew that, unless they could penetrate that, no good could be done upon the town. This done, they put the rest of their men in their places; after which, they gave out the word, which was, 'YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN.' Then they sounded the trumpet; then they in the town made them answer, with shout against shout, charge against charge, and so the battle began. Now they in the town had planted upon the tower over Ear-gate two great guns, the one called High-mind, and the other Heady. Unto these two guns they trusted much; they were cast in the castle by Diabolus' founder, whose name was Mr. Puff-up, and mischievous pieces they were. But so vigilant and watchful, when the captains saw them, were they, that though sometimes their shot would go by their ears with a whiz, yet they did them no harm. By these two guns the townsfolk made no question but greatly to annoy the camp of Shaddai, and well enough to secure the gate; but they had not much cause to boast of what execution they did, as by what follows will be gathered.|$|E
