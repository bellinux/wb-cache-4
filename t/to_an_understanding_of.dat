5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December. He {{is seen as}} {{a pioneer}} of the Authentic school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology in place of carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the enigmatic history of the York lodges in the eighteenth century. His lasting legacy may be seen in the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history.|$|E
5|$|Maiden Castle has {{provided}} inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations {{were carried out}} under Niall Sharples, which added <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the site and repaired damage caused {{in part by the}} large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Co(II) {{complexes}}, Co(III) complexes {{are very}} slow to exchange ligands, {{so they are}} said to be kinetically inert.

At the same time, he also associated with like-minded scholar officials, with whom he regularly exchanged ideas on philosophy and literary modes. He preferred guwen (Ancient Prose) from an early age.

25|$|Most of {{the debate}} is mathematical, but some major {{elements}} can be explained in simple terms {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'. That is, the critique of neoclassical capital theory might be summed up as saying that it suffers from the fallacy of composition, i.e., that we cannot simply jump from microeconomic conceptions <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> production by society as a whole. The resolution {{of the debate}}, particularly how broad its implications are, has not been agreed upon by economists.|$|E
25|$|Passion: An Essay on Personality is a {{philosophical}} inquiry into human nature by philosopher and politician Roberto Mangabeira Unger. The book explores {{the individual and}} his relation to society, asking how one comes <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> self and others. Unger here sees the root human predicament as the need to establish oneself as a unique individual {{in the world but}} at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context.|$|E

25|$|Czartoryski was {{disappointed}} when his hopes held {{as late as}} the Congress of Vienna, that Alexander's might undertake reforms, failed to materialize. His subsequent thoughts were distilled in a book, completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, Essai sur la diplomatie (Essay on Diplomacy). This book, according to the historian Marian Kamil Dziewanowski, is indispensable <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the Prince's many activities conducted in Paris following the ill-fated Polish November 1830 Uprising. Czartoryski wanted to find a place for Poland in the Europe of the time. He sought to interest western Europeans in the adversities facing his stateless nation which he still considered to be an indispensable part of the European political structure.|$|E
25|$|He {{underwent}} a full rehabilitation in Bologna, {{and returned to}} the Villa side in August 2006. Villa hired Martin O'Neill as manager in August 2006, and he and Laursen came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> giving Laursen the freedom to train as he wanted, which helped prevent further injuries. Laursen became an integral part of O'Neill's plans, and the physical English playing style proved to suit Laursen perfectly. Laursen became an effective goalscorer for Villa during the 2007–08 season, scoring six goals from his position of centre back. This included three goals against Tottenham Hotspur, two of which came in a thrilling 4–4 draw at White Hart Lane, the other coming in a 2–1 home victory. Laursen agreed terms on a new two-and-a-half-year deal with Aston Villa in January 2008. He played all Villa's matches, except for League Cup games, during the 2007–08 season and he was voted the Supporters' Player of the Year in 2008.|$|E
