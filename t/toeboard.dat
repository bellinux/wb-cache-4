50|$|Several vehicle safety {{changes are}} {{mandatory}} on all races, including revised steering column mounting, and garage-only fuel couplers. Anti-intrusion plating, escape hatches and <b>toeboard</b> foam are also required on all restrictor plate races, but are optional on all other races.|$|E
50|$|Audio Darts is a {{variation}} of soft tipped darts in which players wear blindfolds. Also, the <b>toeboard</b> is raised, so {{you can feel it}} with your toes, and the dart board has a voice that announces all the things that are typically displayed in lites. Sighted spotters are used to announce the position of darts that miss the board and help find dart that fall on the floor.|$|E
5000|$|Stone put: This {{event is}} similar to the modern-day shot put as seen in the Olympic Games. Instead of a steel shot, a large stone of {{variable}} weight is often used. There are also some differences from the Olympic shot put in allowable techniques. There are two versions of the stone toss events, differing in allowable technique. The [...] "Braemar Stone" [...] uses a 20-26 lb stone for men (13-18 lb for women) and does not allow any run up to the <b>toeboard</b> or [...] "trig" [...] to deliver the stone, i.e., it is a standing put. In the [...] "Open Stone" [...] using a 16-22 lb stone for men (or 8-12 lb for women), the thrower is allowed to use any throwing style so long as the stone is put with one hand with the stone resting cradled in the neck until the moment of release. Most athletes in the open stone event use either the [...] "glide" [...] or the [...] "spin" [...] techniques.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for {{the classification of}} photogrammetric point clouds of scaffolding components in a construction site, aiming at making a preparation for the automatic monitoring of construction site by reconstructing an as-built Building Information Model (as-built BIM). The points belonging to tubes and <b>toeboards</b> of scaffolds will be distinguished via subspace clustering process and principal components analysis (PCA) algorithm. The overall workflow includes four essential processing steps. Initially, the spherical support region of each point is selected. In the second step, the normalized cut algorithm based on spectral clustering theory is introduced for the subspace clustering, so as to select suitable subspace clusters of points and avoid outliers. Then, in the third step, the feature of each point is calculated by measuring distances between points and the plane of local reference frame defined by PCA in cluster. Finally, the types of points are distinguished and labelled through a supervised classification method, with random forest algorithm used. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed steps are investigated in both simulated test data and real scenario. The results obtained by the two experiments reveal that the proposed approaches are qualified to the classification of points belonging to linear shape objects having different shapes of sections. For the tests using synthetic point cloud, the classification accuracy can reach 80 %, with the condition contaminated by noise and outliers. For the application in real scenario, our method can also achieve a classification accuracy of better than 63 %, without using any information about the normal vector of local surface...|$|R
40|$|Accident {{statistics}} show that injuries to the lower extremities are quite frequent in accidents. In most cases these injuries are not life-threatening, but the related treatment & convalescence costs are quite high. In this study different factors influencing lower extremity injuries were investigated. To define the relevant parameters, a baseline crash test under Euro NCAP conditions with instrumented hybrid III legs was performed. Using these test results, a simulation model and a sled test model were set up in parallel and validated {{with respect to the}} baseline crash test. The main areas for improvement to the lower extremities were defined and from these, six different protection concepts were investigated: 1.) Foot airbag 2.) Foam padding (<b>toeboard)</b> 3.) Active unlocking of brake pedal 4.) Reduction of translational <b>toeboard</b> intrusion 5.) Reduction of rotational <b>toeboard</b> intrusion 6.) Pop-up kneebolster In order to investigate different combinations of these six protection concepts, a Design of Experiments (DoE) matrix was created and 108 simulation runs were performed. Based on the simulation results, six different combinations of these protection concepts were tested on the sled. Finally, the performance of the best protection system combination was verified in a full scale crash test...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a data-driven workflow {{for the detection}} of scaffolding components from point clouds. The points belonging to the scaffolding components are identified and separated from the main building structures and two basic elements, namely the <b>toeboard</b> and the tube, are reconstructed. The workflow has four main processing steps. Firstly, the raw point clouds are preprocessed by statistical filtering and voxel girding. In the second step, the planar surfaces of the building surface and scaffoldings are extracted via RANSAC and then grouped by their parallelity and distance to separate the building façade. In the third step, the 3 D shape descriptor FPFH and random forest classification algorithm are applied to classify the point data of building façades into classes belonging to different elements. Finally, by the use of linear fitting algorithm and matching using SHOT shape descriptor, the tubes and toeboards are reconstructed with their geometric parameters. It is shown that the points belonging to these objects are identified and then reconstructed with cylinder and cuboid models. The final results show that over 60 % of the tubes and nearly 90 % of the toeboards are reconstructed in the investigated façade, and more than 40 % of the reconstructed objects are well rebuilt...|$|E
