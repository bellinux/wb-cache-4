5|$|After the 2014 Finals, LeBron James {{became a}} free agent and {{returned}} to the Cleveland Cavaliers where he teamed up with Kyrie Irving. <b>The</b> <b>Cavs</b> also traded for Kevin Love to form a new Big Three in Cleveland as they led <b>the</b> <b>Cavs</b> to the 2015 NBA Finals. In the 2015 postseason, 2014 finalist Miami Heat did not qualify in the playoffs after losing James to free agency and due to mediocrity stemming from brutal injuries all season, and the former defending champions, the San Antonio Spurs, were eliminated in a Game 7 battle against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. This allowed Cleveland to conquer the East. Golden State, spearheaded by reigning MVP, Stephen Curry, achieved a 67–15 record and were able to take the West. Entering the 2015 Finals, James and current Cavalier and former Heat teammate James Jones made their fifth straight finals appearance – the first two players to do this since the 1960s Celtics. The Warriors managed to defy conventional wisdom and traditionalist ideas by winning the championship with a small-ball, three-point shooting, fast-paced team. The Warriors won Game 1 in overtime, with the Cavaliers losing Irving to injury in the process. The Cavaliers would win Games 2 and 3, however, the Warriors won the next three games after coach Steve Kerr made the adjustment of inserting sixth man Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in place of center Andrew Bogut, thus achieving the desired small-ball offense. The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 4–2, with Iguodala becoming the first player to not start in any regular season game to win the Finals MVP award.|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectrophysiological {{characterization}} of T-type Ca 2 + channel isoforms (Cav 3. 1, Cav 3. 2, and Cav 3. 3) {{has shown that}} all of the isoforms are low voltage-activated around resting membrane potential, but their current kinetics are distinctly different, with the activation and inactivation kinetics of <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 3. 1 and Cav 3. 2 channels being much faster than those of <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 3. 3 channel. We previously reported that multiple structural regions of <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 3. 3 T-type channel participate in determining its current kinetics. Here we have evaluated the relative contributions of individual cytoplasmic and trans-membrane regions to the current kinetics of the channel, by systematically replacing individual regions of Cav 3. 3 with the corresponding regions of Cav 3. 1. Introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 3. 1 III–IV loop into <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 3. 3 backbone accelerated both the activation and inactivation kinetics more prominently than any other intracellular loop or tail. Among the trans-membrane domains, introduction of the domain I of Cav 3. 1 into Cav 3. 3 accelerated both the activation and inactivation kinetics most effectively. These findings suggest that the current kinetics of <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 3. 3 channel are differentially controlled by several structural regions, among which the III–IV loop and domain I are the most prominent in governing both activation and inactivation kinetics...|$|R
25|$|Their first-round match-up with Cleveland {{was widely}} seen as the most evenly matched series in the 2006 NBA Playoffs.

40|$|The Central Asian vortex (CAV) is an {{important}} synoptic-scale system that causes rainstorms, short-term heavy precipitation, hail, and sustained low temperatures in Xinjiang. This paper summarizes the current research conducted on <b>the</b> <b>CAV</b> since <b>the</b> 1960 s. The objective definition of <b>the</b> <b>CAV</b> has been revised and a deep and shallow CAV classification proposed. Two high-frequency areas of deep <b>CAV</b> activity are <b>the</b> Kazakhstan hills (Sayan mountains) and the eastern area of the Aral Sea (Tashkent); events mostly occur in summer and 40 % cause strong rainfall. In addition, two high-frequency activity areas of <b>the</b> shallow <b>CAV</b> {{are located in the}} west and south of the Pamirs Plateau and mostly occur in spring; 23. 2 % of occurrences cause strong rainfall. The western and eastern water vapor transport relates to westerlies and a strong low-level easterly jet stream (LLEJ) extending from Gansu to Xinjiang, respectively, and water vapor over the Tibetan Plateau transports even more northwards and enters Xinjiang. <b>The</b> deep <b>CAV</b> has an obvious cold core structure down to 300  hPa. The conversion terms from eddy available potential energy (AE) to eddy kinetic energy (KE) and eddy kinetic energy inflow (BKE) from the open atmospheric region boundaries are the main sources of KE which cause rapid development of <b>the</b> <b>CAV.</b> <b>The</b> anomalous anti-cyclone center over the northeast Atlantic is the fountain of Rossby wave energy dispersion; Rossby waves propagate from the northeast Atlantic to eastern Europe (Urals (EEU)), and then continuously propagate to Central Asia causing development of <b>the</b> <b>CAV.</b> <b>The</b> <b>CAV</b> requires further study to characterize the meso-scale system structure and evolution characteristics.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown the {{importance}} of calcium channels in the development and/or maturation of synapses. <b>The</b> <b>Ca(V)</b> 1. 4 (α(1 F)) knockout mouse is a unique model to study the role of calcium channels in photoreceptor synapse formation. It features abnormal ribbon synapses and aberrant cone morphology. We investigated the expression and targeting of several key elements of ribbon synapses and analyzed the cone morphology in <b>the</b> <b>Ca(V)</b> 1. 4 (α(1 F)) knockout retina. Our data demonstrate that most abnormalities occur after eye opening. Indeed, scaffolding proteins such as Bassoon and RIM 2 are properly targeted at first, but their expression and localization are not maintained in adulthood. This indicates that either calcium or <b>the</b> <b>Ca(V)</b> 1. 4 channel, or both are necessary {{for the maintenance of}} their normal expression and distribution in photoreceptors. Other proteins, such as Veli 3 and PSD- 95, also display abnormal expression in rods prior to eye opening. Conversely, vesicle related proteins appear normal. Our data demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>Ca(V)</b> 1. 4 channel is important for maintaining scaffolding proteins in the ribbon synapse but less vital for proteins related to vesicular release. This study also confirms that in adult retinae, cones show developmental features such as sprouting and synaptogenesis.

40|$|Atherosclerosis is an {{inflammatory}} process characterized by proliferation and dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Cav 1. 2 calcium channels {{may have a}} role in atherosclerosis because they are essential for Ca 2 +-signal transduction in VSMC. <b>The</b> pore-forming <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 α 1 subunit of the channel is subject to alternative splicing. Here, we investigated whether <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 α 1 splice variants are affected by atherosclerosis. VSMC were isolated by laser-capture microdissection from frozen sections of adjacent regions of arteries affected and not affected by atherosclerosis. In VSMC from nonatherosclerotic regions, RT-PCR analysis revealed an extended repertoire of Cav 1. 2 α 1 transcripts characterized by the presence of exons 21 and 41 A. In VSMC affected by atherosclerosis, expression of <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 α 1 transcript was reduced and <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 α 1 splice variants were replaced with the unique exon- 22 isoform lacking exon 41 A. Molecular remodeling of <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 α 1 subunits associated with atherosclerosis caused changes in electrophysiological properties of the channels, including the kinetics and voltage-dependence of inactivation, recovery from inactivation, and rundown of the Ca 2 + current. Consistent with the pathophysiological state of VSMC in atherosclerosis, cell culture data pointed to a potentially important association of the exon- 22 isoform of Cav 1. 2 α 1 with proliferation of VSMC. Our findings are consistent with a hypothesis that localized changes in cytokine expression generated by inflammation in atherosclerosis affect alternative splicing of <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 α 1 gene in the human artery that causes molecular and electrophysiological remodeling of Cav 1. 2 calcium channels and possibly affects VSMC proliferation...|$|R

40|$|L-type Ca 2 + {{channels}} play a {{key role}} in the integration of physiological signals regulating insulin secretion that probably requires their localization to specific subdomains of the plasma membrane. We investigated the role of the intracellular II-III loop domains of <b>the</b> L-type channels <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 and 1. 3 in coupling of Ca 2 + influx with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) potentiated by the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide (GLP) - 1. In INS- 1 cell lines expressing <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 /II-III or Cav 1. 3 /II-III peptides, GLP- 1 potentiation of GSIS was inhibited markedly, coincident with a decrease in GLP- 1 -stimulated cAMP accumulation and <b>the</b> redistribution of <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 and Cav 1. 3 out of lipid rafts. Neither <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 /II-III nor <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 3 /II-III peptide decreased L-type current density compared with untransfected INS- 1 cells. GLP- 1 potentiation of GSIS was restored by the L-type channel agonist 2, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -[2 -(phenylmethyl) benzoyl]- 1 H-pyrrole- 3 -carboxylic acid methyl ester (FPL- 64176). In contrast, potentiation of GSIS by 8 -bromo-cAMP (8 -Br-cAMP) was inhibited in Cav 1. 2 /II-III but not Cav 1. 3 /II-III cells. These differences may involve unique protein-protein interactions because <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 2 /II-III peptide, but not <b>the</b> <b>Cav</b> 1. 3 /II-III peptide, immunoprecipitates Rab 3 -interacting molecule (RIM) 2 from INS- 1 cell lysates. RIM 2, and its binding partner Piccolo, localize to lipid rafts, and they may serve as anchors for Cav 1. 2 localization to lipid rafts in INS- 1 cells. These findings suggest that the II-III interdomain loops of Cav 1. 2, and possibly Cav 1. 3, direct these channels to membrane microdomains in which the proteins that mediate potentiation of GSIS by GLP- 1 and 8 -Br-cAMP assemble...|$|R

London became one of only 10 black head coaches at the Division I-A level. In his first season with <b>the</b> <b>Cavs,</b> the team went 4–8 overall and 1–7 in conference play. He followed that up with an 8-4 (5-3 ACC) turnaround season, following which he won the ACC Coach of the Year award, after preseason projections had Virginia finishing fifth in the ACC Coastal Division. The 2011 team registered a win at Florida State {{for the first time in}} school history and became the first team in FBS history to win games at Miami and Florida State in the same season. The team earned a bid to the 2011 Chick-fil-A Bowl, where they lost to Auburn 43–24. In 2012, the team suffered a disappointing 4–8 season that resulted in the dismissal of four assistant coaches. Prior to the start of the 2013 season, both starting quarterbacks from the year before, Michael Rocco and Phillip Sims, transferred from Virginia, going to Richmond and Winston-Salem State, respectively. The Cavaliers' downward spiral continued in 2013 as the team, now led at quarterback by redshirt sophomore David Watford, finished last in the ACC with a record of 2–10, losing their last nine games of the season. The following year saw marginal improvement under quarterbacks Greyson Lambert and Matt Johns, but went 5–7, including an eleventh-straight loss to Virginia Tech. Athletic director Craig Littlepage chose prior to the end of the season to retain London for 2015, but fans continued to express dissatisfaction with the play-calling of London and his staff, and some calling for London's ouster.

40|$|Circular {{double-stranded}} replication intermediates {{were identified}} in low-molecular-weight DNA of cells of the avian leukemia virus-induced lymphoblastoid cell line 1104 -X- 5 infected with chicken anemia virus (<b>CAV).</b> To characterize <b>the</b> genome of <b>CAV,</b> we cloned linearized <b>CAV</b> DNA into <b>the</b> vector pIC 20 H. Transfection of the circularized cloned insert into chicken cell lines caused a cytopathogenic effect, which was arrested when a chicken serum with neutralizing antibodies directed against CAV was added. Chickens inoculated at 1 day of age with CAV collected from cell lines transfected with cloned CAV DNA developed clinical signs of <b>CAV.</b> <b>The</b> 2, 319 -bp cloned CAV DNA contained all the genetic information needed for the complete replication cycle of <b>CAV.</b> <b>The</b> <b>CAV</b> DNA sequence has three partially overlapping major reading frames coding for putative peptides of 51. 6, 24. 0, and 13. 6 kDa. <b>The</b> <b>CAV</b> genome probably contains only one promoter region and only one poly(A) addition signal. Southern blot analysis using oligomers derived from <b>the</b> <b>CAV</b> DNA sequence showed that infected cells contained double- and single-stranded CAV DNAs, whereas purified virus contained only the minus strand. It {{is the first time}} that the genome of one of the three known single-stranded circular DNA viruses has been completely analyzed...|$|R
