[...] Lorde explained the song's lyrical meaning to New York magazine, [...] "'The Love Club' {{is about an}} experience I had {{about a year ago}} where I met all these new friends and I fell in with them. It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> maybe realise that group wasn't so good for me, and that my old friends and my family are the people I should be with.

She had brought holy water as a test that the apparition was not of evil origin/provenance: [...] "The second time was the following Sunday. ... <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> throw holy water in her direction, {{and at the same}} time I said that if she came from God she was to stay, but if not, she must go.

2500|$|In 2013, Binau's nine-year-old son Andy (Anders) {{handed her}} a book called Max the Super Dog's Pet Shop Adventures. Andy said {{that he wanted to}} give his mother a helping hand: [...] "My mother had created a book about cancer for the adults in the hospitals. So I thought that {{there was a lack of}} a book for children, who must lose one they care about, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> do it." [...] This booklet, about a 'superpup', was created as an {{activity}} book to be given as a gift for hospitalized children. It later became an important part of a donation program, the AngelKID Heart Package (HJERTEPAKKE package), for children who have a terminally ill relative.|$|E
30|$|I {{went out}} and started the marketing.

It's a most {{extraordinary}} thing, and I can't understand even now where the deuce they came from, but just about <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> get {{a whole bunch of}} anonymous letters from some chappie unknown who didn't sign his name." ...|$|E

"Yes, sir," [...] Ned {{said after}} a pause; [...] "I seem to know that some one said that Mr. Mulready was dead, and some one thought that I had killed him, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> come over to give myself up.

50|$|Myatt {{has said}} of his forgeries, When I paint {{in the style of}} one of the greats… Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh… I am not simply {{creating}} a copy or pale imitation of the original. Just as an actor immerses himself into a character, I climb into the minds and lives of each artist. I adopt their techniques and search for the inspiration behind each great artist’s view of the world. Then, and only <b>then,</b> do <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> paint a ‘Legitimate Fake’.|$|R
5000|$|Billy Elliot lasted 22 months. After that, {{she started}} looking into acting more, {{although}} she was so shy it was difficult at first. [...] "But <b>then,</b> the more <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> do it, the more I {{came out of my}} shell and the more I enjoyed it", she said.|$|R
60|$|I {{made some}} reciprocative speech, which, {{if it was}} {{somewhat}} awkwardly expressed, had at least the merit of earnestness, and my eyes followed her admiringly as {{she walked to the}} door and disappeared with a backward glance and a smile. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> and coloured, <b>to</b> find that Mr. Ravenor was watching me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Like a stone. I couldn't {{believe it}} at first.

6000|$|... "Here {{were a few}} camels, {{standing}} untended. Everyone {{had joined}} in the rush for booty--a rush to be met with bitter disappointment, for, {{with the exception of}} the arms of the fallen, and what few valuables they might have about their person, there was nothing to be gained. I diverged from the line I had been following, kept on until there was a dip in the ground, that would hide me from the sight of those behind; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> run, and at last threw myself down in the scrub, four or five miles away from the point from which I had started.|$|E

5000|$|Luc Lemay joined Negativa with Steeve Hurdle after Gorguts disbanded in 2005, {{but felt}} {{uncomfortable with the}} improvisational {{elements}} in that band's music. At Hurdle's recommendation, Lemay reformed Gorguts in summer 2008 in order {{to prepare for the}} twentieth anniversary of Gorguts' 1989 formation. [...] As Lemay recollected, [...] "When Steeve brought the idea to me to make a new record to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the band, I'd never thought about it before. I was very happy with everything the band had accomplished in the past and I had no intention of making a new record. <b>Then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> write, <b>I</b> had no apprehensions either...I just went with the flow and wrote the music I wanted to hear".|$|R
6000|$|I ruminated {{for hours}} on Mr. Clement's praise. I read and re-read my [...] "able article" [...] till I knew it by heart and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> in, seriously, <b>to</b> {{understand}} and estimate the school of fiction to which Mr. Howells belonged. I read {{every one of his}} books as soon as I could obtain them. I read James, too, and many of the European realists, but it must have been two years before I called upon Mr. Clement to redeem his promise.|$|R
60|$|Now {{in front}} of the gateway of the cattle-kraal, shading it, grew a single big tree of the wild fig order. Passing under this tree I looked and saw that the gateway was quite {{securely}} closed, as now I remembered I had noted at sunset. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> go back but had not stepped {{more than two or three}} paces when, in the bright moonlight, I saw the head of my smallest ox, a beast of the Zulu breed, suddenly appear over the top of the wall. About this there would have been nothing particularly astonishing, had it not been for the fact that this head belonged to a dead animal, as I could tell from the closed eyes and the hanging tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. You wouldn't {{have had}} me be abrupt, would you? I {{went into his}} private office and found him alone. I think at first {{he would have been}} just as well pleased if I had retired. In fact, he said as much. But I soon {{adjusted}} that outlook. I took a seat and a cigarette, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> sketch out for him the history of my connection with the firm. He began to wilt {{before the end of the}} first ten minutes. At the quarter of an hour mark he was looking at me like a lost dog that's just found its owner. By the half-hour he was making little bleating noises and massaging my coat-sleeve. And when, after perhaps an hour and a half, I came to my peroration and suggested a rise, he choked back a sob, gave me double what I had asked, and invited me to dine at his club next Tuesday. I'm a little sorry now I cut the thing so short. A few minutes more, and I fancy he would have given me his sock-suspenders and made over his life-insurance in my favour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{for they}} were in the forest, while we were in a little clearing. The attack came without warning. We were just {{building}} a camp-fire when two rifle shots rang out, and Lampton and Cass fell. Then came a yell from the whites and the war cry from the Indians, and shots and arrows flew in all directions. Sam and I picked up our guns, and I know Sam hit one of the whites, for I saw him throw up his hands and fall in some brushwood. Then one of the redskins went down, and after that I was hit and went into a twist, so I can't exactly tell what followed. I heard Sam yell to me to run, or we'd be killed, and I picked up my gun and ran for the trees. I hadn't gone very far when I tripped and fell, and the gun got lost in a dark hollow. I tried to find the gun, but I couldn't, and then I heard some Indians coming after me and I ran on again until I found a small place between the rocks, where I hid until about three hours ago. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> look for the trail, but I got dizzy and had to sit down where you found me." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{receiving}} an MFA {{degree from the}} Art Institute of Chicago, Donald Sultan moved to New York in 1975 to begin his career as an artist. At first he was supporting himself by helping other artists construct lofts {{during the day and}} painting at night. He soon got a full-time position as a handyman in an art gallery, a job that lasted until the gallery closed in 1978. In 1979, Sultan won a $2,500 Creative Artists Public Service Grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, and that money enabled him to work full-time on his art. [...] "By <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had <b>started</b> <b>to</b> show at a couple of places and to sell enough work to keep going," [...] he said.|$|R
5000|$|.....It's one of {{the things}} when I first saw when I saw the Norwegian scene {{beginning}} in the early nineties. I thought: ok, I know they said Venom are an influence, etcetera, etcetera; let's see where these guys are coming from. And <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> read the lyrics, read the interviews and see they were kind of saying the same thing, but about their country, they had their religion, with all the Norse gods like Wodan and Thor. And then all of the sudden the Christians came in and they tried to destroy their religion. It's great that they stayed within in their country's beliefs for their lyrics as well. So, they're not the exactly the same things as Venom, they invented something of their own, which I think is fucking great...|$|R
6000|$|I cannot express to {{you what}} entire {{enjoyment}} I find in this first visit to this prodigious metropolis of yours. Its wonders {{seem to me to}} be limitless. I go about as in a dream--as in a realm of enchantment--where many things are rare and beautiful, and all things are strange and marvellous. Hour after hour I stand--I stand spellbound, as it were--and gaze upon the statuary in Leicester Square. [Leicester Square being a horrible chaos, with the relic of an equestrian statue in the centre, the king being headless and limbless, and the horse in little better condition.] I visit the mortuary effigies of noble old Henry VIII., and Judge Jeffreys, and the preserved gorilla, and try to make up my mind which of my ancestors I admire the most. I go to that matchless Hyde Park and drive all around it, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> enter it at the Marble Arch---and--am induced to [...] "change my mind." [...] [Cabs are not permitted in Hyde Park--nothing less aristocratic than a private carriage.] It is a great benefaction--is Hyde Park. There, in his hansom cab, the invalid can go--the poor, sad child of misfortune--and insert his nose between the railings, and breathe the pure, health--giving air of the country and of heaven. And if he is a swell invalid, who isn't obliged to depend upon parks for his country air, he can drive inside--if he owns his vehicle. I drive round and round Hyde Park, and the more I see of the edges of it the more grateful I am that the margin is extensive.|$|R

After this I put on the best coat and hat I had, feeling that as an Englishman it was my duty to look decent on such an occasion, washed, brushed my hair--with me a {{ceremony}} without meaning, for it always sticks up--and slipped a loaded Smith & Wesson revolver into my inner poacher pocket. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> out <b>to</b> see the fun, and avoiding the groups of surly-looking Boers, mingled with the crowd that I saw was gathering {{in front of a}} long, low building with a broad stoep, which I supposed, rightly, {{to be one of the}} Government offices.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} generally moderate {{reviews from}} critics and fans {{at the time}} of its release. In a February issue of Spin magazine, Dr. Dre stated his feelings on the album and said [...] "But to be perfectly honest, I don't like Snoop's new album. And it has nothing to do with me not working him, because I'm just like everybody else: I like it, or I don't. The first time I heard the single, I was grooving to it, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> really <b>started</b> <b>to</b> get into the production and how it was sounding, you know?
