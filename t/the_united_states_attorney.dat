5|$|Parker {{arrived in}} Fort Smith on May 4, 1875, {{initially}} without his family. His appointment at age 36 {{made him the}} youngest federal judge in the West.

5|$|It was {{becoming}} clear that federal intervention {{was required to}} settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration {{to stay out of}} the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E

5|$|Although the Belloni {{decision}} {{established the}} rights of the Indians to exercise their treaty fishing rights, the states of Oregon and Washington continued to arrest Indians for violations of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the state of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1973, Agnew was {{investigated}} by <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> for the District of Maryland {{on suspicion of}} conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax fraud. Agnew had accepted payments from contractors during his time as a Maryland official, and the payments had continued into his time as vice president. After denying his guilt for months, Agnew negotiated a plea agreement that would involve his resignation from office. On October 10, 1973, Agnew pled no contest to a single felony charge of tax evasion, resigned his office, {{and was replaced by}} House Minority Leader Gerald Ford. Agnew spent the remainder of his life quietly, rarely making public appearances. He wrote a novel, and also a memoir defending his actions. He died in 1996.|$|E
5|$|On August 4 limited {{transportation}} service resumed but largely dwindled {{as the day}} progressed. Hayes and his staff warned the strikers about the severe penalties provided by the SmithConnally Act for disruption of the war production: the instigators could {{be subject to a}} fine of $5,000, one year in prison, or both. This prospect was made more real when <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of federal laws by the strike organizers. On August 4 the strike committee again voted to continue the strike, but, in view of the possible SmithConnally Act penalties, told the workers to make up their own minds and follow the committee if they chose. The maneuver worked and the strike continued.|$|E

5|$|The FALN {{was led by}} Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, {{who was one of}} the FBI's {{most wanted}} criminals. The group served as the {{predecessor}} of the Boricua Popular Army. Several of the organization's members were arrested and convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery and for firearms and explosives violations. On August 11, 1999 then United States President Bill Clinton offered clemency to sixteen of the convicted militants under the condition that they renounce any kind of violent manifestation. This decision drew criticism towards the Clinton administration from figures that include the Office of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Attorney,</b> the FBI, and the United States Congress.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the treaty rights of the tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>Attorney</b> Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E
