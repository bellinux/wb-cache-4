[...] "The first thing we wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>make</b> a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do {{with all the other}} narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things."

500|$|On {{the return}} of Overwatchs closed beta in February 2016, victory poses, among other {{elements}} {{were added to the}} characters. In March 2016, a controversy arose over Tracer's [...] "Over the Shoulder" [...] victory pose, after a user opined in the game's forums that it was out of character and that its supposed oversexualization [...] "reduces Tracer to just another bland female sex symbol". The post generated a discussion in the forums, which gaming outlets noted was civil; several users added their dissenting opinions of the pose, while others disagreed with the original poster's thoughts. Kaplan posted an apologetic response in which he announced Blizzard's plans to replace the pose, writing [...] "the last thing we want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>make</b> someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented". The decision was met with mixed reactions from the gaming community, with some gamers arguing that Blizzard yielded its creative control over the game, censoring its content to appease an offended user, while others praised Blizzard's willingness to listen to the community and adhere to standards for portraying a character according to their personality. Kaplan later expressed that the game's development team was not [...] "entirely happy with the original pose", and had internal creative struggles about its inclusion. The following week, a replacement pose was released, although it was described by one commentator to be [...] "different, butt not by much" [...] referring to the posterior cleavage of the original pose.

500|$|Grand Theft Auto IV sees a {{shift in}} the series to a more {{realistic}} and detailed style and tone, partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high-definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser said [...] "what we're taking as our watchword on [...] is the idea of what high definition actually means. Not just in terms of graphics, which obviously we are achieving, but in terms of all aspects of the design. [...] You know, trying to make something more realistic, more held together, but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had." [...] Art director Aaron Garbut said {{one of the reasons they}} decided to set the game in New York because [...] "we all knew what an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city it is," [...] and since they were hoping the push the [...] "detail, variety and life" [...] to a high level, it seemed that [...] "basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit." [...] Dan Houser added [...] "because we were working in high definition and we knew we'd need a shitload of research, we wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold." [...] The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City; Dan Houser said [...] "what we've always tried <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>make</b> a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment, but is also fun from a game design perspective." [...] The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series. Although smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for Grand Theft Auto IVs predecessor , Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when [...] "the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings" [...] are taken into account. The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. To achieve a realistic environment, the Rockstar North team, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, made two trips to New York for research, one at the start of the project (which was done with every previous Grand Theft Auto game) and another smaller one further into development. A full-time research team, based in New York, handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns.|$|E
