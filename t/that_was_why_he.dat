25|$|Xun Xu {{served in}} the privy council and {{was in charge of}} state secrets for a long time. He was not only a talented writer, but also a deep thinker who {{understood}} very well his place as a subject of his lord. He knew what his lord expected of him and adapted his behaviour accordingly to please his lord. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> managed to remain in Emperor Wu's favour and live a comfortable life until his death.|$|E
25|$|After being {{visited by}} the three men, Abraham and Sarah settled between Kadesh and Shur {{in the land of}} the Philistines. While he was living in Gerar, Abraham again claimed that Sarah was his sister. King Abimelech {{subsequently}} had her brought to him. Later, God came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a married woman. Abimelech, who had not laid hands on her, inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> continued to exist. However, if he did not return Sarah to Abraham, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.|$|E
500|$|On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party {{executive}} council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. [...] "The {{general sense of}} the council was that he wasn't a serious candidate and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wasn't selected {{to be on the}} ballot", stated John Werner, the party's director. In addition, he was declared [...] "not viable", as he was running in only one state. Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle. CNN has reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot. One anonymous member of the council told CNN that former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum had placed pressure on them to refuse Colbert's application despite his steady rise in polls.|$|E
50|$|Now {{an orphan}} without {{his father and}} mother, he stayed {{for a moment in}} the circus. But in this environment, {{everything}} reminded him his parent and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> made the decision to go away to be able to forget. However, he did not wish to change climate and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> chooses to come to Montreal in Canada, a city as cold as Moscow.|$|R

2500|$|Lam Ching-ying was {{recommend}} {{to the director}} by Sammo Hung to play the main role. The director had seen Lam before on The Prodigal Son which the director had worked on. The director noted {{in an interview that}} [...] "He seems cold but actually he is with a good heart" [...] <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was suitable for the role.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party {{executive council}} voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. “The {{general sense of}} the council was that he wasn’t a serious candidate and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wasn’t selected {{to be on the}} ballot," [...] stated John Werner, the party's director.

2500|$|Bunin {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in international myths and folklore, {{as well as}} the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to Georgy Adamovich) [...] "he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the [...] "style Russe" [...] manufacturers. His cruel– and rightly so– review of Sergey Gorodetsky's poetry was one example. Even Blok's Kulikovo Field (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... "That's Vasnetsov," [...] he commented, meaning 'masquerade and opera'. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the Slovo o Polku Igoreve... he said something to the effect that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn't have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin's words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of Balmont. He despised Shmelyov for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I remember, he spoke of Tolstoy as the one 'who's never said a single word that would be an exaggeration'." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> the man {{who holds}} up trains picks his company with a {{thousand}} times the care with which a careful girl chooses a sweetheart. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> raises himself from his blanket of nights and listens to the tread of every horse's hoofs on the distant road. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> broods suspiciously for days upon a jesting remark or an unusual movement of a tried comrade, or the broken mutterings of his closest friend, sleeping by his side.|$|R
2500|$|On an {{occasion}} in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang {{and who was}} taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "The Prince of Lujiang was despicable. [...] He killed her husband and seized her. [...] How could he survive long after this barbarous act!" [...] Wang instead responded, [...] "Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?" [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo , he asked the seniors of Guo, [...] "Why was Guo destroyed?" [...] The seniors stated, [...] "The lord of Guo knew right from wrong." [...] Duke Huan responded, [...] "If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. [...] Why was he destroyed?" [...] The seniors responded, [...] "The lord of Guo knew what was right but could not do it. [...] He also knew what was wrong but could not stop doing it. [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was destroyed."' [...] Now, this woman is still by your side. [...] I believe it is that Your Imperial Majesty in fact believes that this is right. [...] If you {{believe that this is}} wrong, you are the one who knows what is wrong and could not stop doing it." [...] Although Emperor Taizong could not send away the woman, he was nevertheless humbled by Wang's words and respected him for his words. [...] On another occasion, there was an incident where Emperor Taizong had the official Zu Xiaosun (祖孝孫) teach his ladies in waiting music, and when the ladies in waiting could not learn it well, rebuked Zu. [...] Wang and Wen Yanbo spoke against the rebuke, stating that it was not appropriate for Emperor Taizong to have had an important official become a music teacher for ladies in waiting in the first place. [...] Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. [...] Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true. [...] Emperor Taizong was surprised, but the next day indicated to the high-level officials that he was rash and improper in rebuking Wang and Wen.|$|E
