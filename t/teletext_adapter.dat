The {{hardware and software}} design was created by Graham Toal. [...] The initial software to use the adapter was quite basic but the BBC decided to rewrite it and produced the Advanced Teletext System. This new ROM added several new features including support for the new Fastext system, which introduced the four coloured buttons subsequently found almost ubiquitously on European remote controls, including the [...] "red button" [...] which remains a feature of digital television broadcasting.|$|E

Telesoftware and tutorials were available on Ceefax (BBC teletext service) for the BBC Microcomputer via its <b>teletext</b> <b>adapter</b> from 1983-89 and was generally transmitted for a period of one week. The BBC Telesoftware service was managed by Jeremy Brayshaw. Most of the Telesoftware programming tutorials were written by Gordon Horsington and they, as well as most of the software, are still available from the online Telesoftware archives (see the external links below). Downloading could take place from Friday evening to the following Thursday evening. As the updating took place on a Friday, it was advised not to attempt to download software between 9am and 7pm on Fridays.Other channels provided for several other computers via a range of adapters and set-top boxes.|$|E
