When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable.

25|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some soft drinks (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, 2001 calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that {{the net effect of}} carbonated soft drinks, (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulant) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that carbonated soft drinks, which do not contain the nutrients needed for bone health, may displace other foods which do, and that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> that people who drink a lot of soft drinks also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. They say <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Tasmanian Archbishop Julius Porteous {{distributed}} {{a booklet}} outlining the Catholic Church's position on marriage, titled [...] "Don't mess with Marriage". It encouraged parents to lobby parliamentarians against same-sex marriage. An application {{was made by}} Martine Delaney, a Hobart transgender activist and Greens candidate, to Tasmania’s Anti-Discrimination Commission over the booklet. John Roskam, writing in the Australian Financial Review has said, [...] "A vote in a plebiscite or referendum, in which one side {{is not allowed to}} present its case, is not a legitimate vote. That's why both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage should be concerned by the complaint against Archbishop Porteous and the Catholic Church. Freedom of speech is fundamental to liberal democracy. Freedom of speech confers legitimacy on political outcomes". [...] The Anti-Discrimination Commission subsequently upheld the complaint. Senator Eric Abetz said that the church’s right to [...] "teach its flock" [...] its beliefs on marriage were being [...] "shut down". Janet Albrechtsen, writing in The Australian says, [...] "This is not one of those thorny cases of conflicting rights where you have to come down on one side or another. It’s not a case of either supporting same-sex marriage or supporting free speech. Here you have the luxury of both. [...] This is not about defending the Catholic bishops. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the emergence of yet another orthodoxy that is strangling free speech".|$|E

6000|$|In {{those first}} months of the war there was, we were told, in England and France a revival of [...] "religion," [...] and indeed many of the books then written gave {{evidence}} of having been composed in exalted, mystic moods. I remember one in particular, called [...] "En Campagne," [...] by a young French officer. And then, somehow, the note of mystic exaltation died away, to be succeeded by a period of realism. Read [...] "Le Feu," [...] which is most typical, which has sold in numberless editions. Here {{is a picture of}} that other aspect--the grimness, the monotony, and the frequent bestiality of trench life, the horror of slaughtering millions of men by highly specialized machinery. And yet, as an American, I strike inevitably the note of optimism once more. Even now the truer spiritual goal is glimpsed through the battle clouds, and has been hailed in world-reverberating phrases by our American President. Day by day <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> clearer, while the [...] "religion" [...] it implies embraces not one nation, wills not one patriotism, but humanity itself. I heard a Frenchwoman who had been deeply [...] "religious" [...] in the old sense exclaim: [...] "I no longer have any faith in God; he {{is on the side of}} the Germans." [...] When the war began there were many evidences of a survival of that faith that God fights for nations, interferes in behalf of the [...] "righteous" [...] cause. When General Joffre was in America he was asked by one of our countrywomen how the battle of the Marne was won. [...] "Madame," [...] he is reported to have said, [...] "it was won by me, by my generals and soldiers." [...] The tendency to regard this victory, which we hope saved France and the Western humanitarian civilization we cherish, as a special interposition of Providence, as a miracle, has given place to the realization that the battle was won by the resourcefulness, science, and coolness of the French commander-in-chief. Science preserves armies, since killing, if it has to be done, is now wholly within that realm; science heals the wounded, transports them rapidly to the hospitals, gives the shattered something still to live for; and, if we are able to abandon the sentimental view and look facts in the face--as many anointed chaplains in Europe are doing--science not only eliminates typhoid but is able to prevent those terrible diseases that devastate armies and nations. And science is no longer confined to the physical but has invaded the social kingdom, is able to weave a juster fabric into the government of peoples. On all sides we are beginning to embrace the religion of self-reliance, a faith that God is on the side of intelligence--intelligence with a broader meaning than the Germans have given it, for it includes charity.|$|E
