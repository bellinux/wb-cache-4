Nansouty's six-regiment division soon acquired <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the best administered and most exact in its manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly {{as much attention as}} Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E
5|$|During World War II, several {{properties}} on Park Lane {{were hit}} by bombs. Dudley House, at No.100, suffered major structural damage, including {{the destruction of the}} ballroom and gallery, though the building was partially restored. However, the strength of construction of the Dorchester Hotel gave it <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> one of London's safest buildings, and it was a safe haven for numerous luminaries. General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor in 1942, and later made it his headquarters.|$|E

50|$|From the {{beginning}} of recorded chess, {{to the establishment of}} the first chess organizations, the term master was applied informally, being simply a matter of popular acclaim.

5|$|When Marseille {{was still}} a young child his parents {{divorced}} and his mother subsequently married a police official named Reuter. Marseille initially assumed {{the name of his}} stepfather at school (a matter he had a difficult time accepting) but he reverted to his father's name of Marseille in adulthood. He acquired <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a rebel from a lack of discipline, a characteristic that plagued him early on in his Luftwaffe career. Marseille also had a difficult relationship with his natural father whom he refused to visit in Hamburg for some time after the divorce. Eventually he attempted a reconciliation with his father, who subsequently introduced him to the nightlife that was to initially hamper his military career during his early years in the Luftwaffe. However, the rapproachment with his father did not last and he did not see him again thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{mountain}} tourists, ease of access {{into the high}} mountain environment, plus promotion and encouragement by tour companies offering ascents of Mont Blanc to people {{with little or no}} previous alpine experience, have led to an increase in mountain accidents and even inappropriate demands to be rescued. With up to 30,000 climbing parties now attempting to ascend Mont Blanc each year, it has gained <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> one of the world's deadliest mountains. Deaths from mountaineering-related accidents across the Mont Blanc massif average almost 100 a year, with the majority occurring on Mont Blanc itself. There have also been various stunts, some of which the local authorities have decried as reckless or stupid. In recent years, guards have been placed on the most popular route of ascent to Mont Blanc's summit at peak periods {{in order to ensure that}} those entering the mountain environment are adequately equipped and skilled. This has led to calls to limit access to the most popular summits and for the mountains to be treated with greater respect.|$|E

50|$|Many rest {{areas have}} <b>the</b> <b>reputations</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> unsafe {{with regard to}} crime, {{especially}} at night, since they are situated in remote areas. California's policy is to maintain existing public rest areas, but no longer build new ones due to the cost and difficulty of keeping them safe, although many California rest stops now feature highway patrol quarters.Some <b>of</b> this <b>reputation</b> may be exaggerated, {{since the advent of}} lighting and security cameras in rest stops. Nonetheless, many rest stops continue to warn of theft, and advise those who park to keep doors locked (despite the fact that camping is now disallowed in some rest stops).|$|R
