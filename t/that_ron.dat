5|$|Harry {{wakes up}} in the school's {{hospital}} wing with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> and Hermione are both fine. The headmaster reveals that Harry was able to defeat Quirrell because when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, giving Gryffindor enough points to win the House Cup.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 2009, John Green, one of {{the fans}} who helped begin the brawl, {{appeared}} on ESPN First Take, where {{he talked about the}} incident and the changes he had made since then. Green recounted that he had an alcohol problem at the time and had since made an effort to deal with that. He also said <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> Artest had apologized to him several months earlier, and wished to work together in some type of community service in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to public relations director, appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish fourth floor with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of}} a circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people. Ron believes everything will eventually go back to normal as it has with past city managers that implemented drastic changes. However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> talk to him. On the fourth floor, Tom's attempts to charm some of the elderly women into doing his work fails miserably, as they ignore him and all adore Andy.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} {{having sex with}} Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. Andy {{is said to have}} auditioned for the reality {{television}} show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said she would rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E

25|$|Penske {{picked up}} the team cars and {{equipment}} from the El Segundo offices and shipped everything back to his shop in Pennsylvania. Through the fall of 1969 and into the winter, Penske used the no. 3 Jerry Grant car for developmental purposes. When he acquired the 1969 cars, Penske found <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> Kaplan had already done considerable work with suspension, but {{he felt that the}} front suspension could still be further developed. With Mark Donohue doing the testing, Penske’s team lowered {{the front of the car}} and replaced the rubber bushings in the radius rods with heim joints. New roll bars were also developed. After several months of development, Donohue felt that the team now had car that drove like it was on rails.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Bears' {{defensive}} efforts {{failed to}} match {{the success of their}} 2005 season. Nevertheless, the team was still a notable presence in league, finishing with the league's third ranked and conference's top-ranked points allowed category. The defense's success earned Rivera recognition among franchises looking for new head coaches. The Arizona Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers interviewed him in January 2007. He was a candidate for the vacant Dallas Cowboys head coaching position, a job that ultimately went to San Diego Chargers defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Rivera was named as a potential candidate to replace the fired Marty Schottenheimer in San Diego, but the job was filled by Norv Turner, the brother of fellow offensive coordinator, Ron Turner, Rivera's offensive counterpart in Chicago. After the announcement, ESPN reported that the Bears were considering letting Rivera go. This came after several other teams interviewed him, and the negotiations between his representatives and the Bears were making little progress. On February 19, 2007, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> Rivera's contract with the Bears would not be renewed.|$|E
25|$|Ron Meyer was an up {{and coming}} coach that had {{previous}} coaching success at UNLV. During the 70s SMU drew decent crowds, {{and had a}} large fan base, but {{was in need of}} a spark. Ron Meyer was flashy, aggressive, and popular; he would be that spark. He was hired in the winter of 1976 (Pony Excess). Meyer’s first years on campus were not as successful as fans had hoped. From 1976 to 1979, the Mustangs had accumulated a record of 16-27; SMU football lacked talent and size. So, Ron Meyer began to assemble the best recruiting class ever. Before the famous 1979 class Ron Meyer’s first big recruit was Emmanuel Tolbert (1976) from Little Rock Central High School. The University of Arkansas, a much bigger University and a program that usually snatched recruits from their state had lost the speedy running back Tolbert to Meyer’s SMU. Meyer was gaining solid recruit after recruit under the radar. Former SMU quarterback Lance Mcilhenny says <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> Meyer was the greatest salesman he’s ever met.|$|E
25|$|Ann {{breaks up}} with Andy and begins dating Mark, with Leslie's approval. It is {{revealed}} that Tom's marriage to pediatric surgeon Wendy (Jama Williamson) {{is actually a}} green card marriage (she is a Canadian illegally in the United States), which, to his disappointment, eventually ends in divorce. The pit is eventually filled in, after which Ron is visited by his horrible ex-wife Tammy Two (Megan Mullally), a librarian who unsuccessfully tries seducing him into allowing a branch library to be built on the filled-in lot. April becomes attracted to Andy, but he remains fixated on Ann. Just as Mark plans to propose to Ann, she reveals she no longer has feelings for him. They break up, and Mark leaves his city hall career for a private sector job (he never appears again on the show). Meanwhile, a crippling budget deficit leads state auditors Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) {{to shut down the}} Pawnee government temporarily, much to Leslie's horror and Ron's delight. Meanwhile, Andy develops feelings for April, but she fears he is still hung up on Ann. Ann later kisses Andy due to conflicting emotions from her break-up with Mark, prompting April to reject Andy angrily. The season ends with Tom's shocked discovery <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> is now dating his ex-wife, Wendy.|$|E

500|$|... "Woman of the Year" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] one of {{the best}} episodes of the second season, particularly complimenting the one-liner jokes and ensemble cast performances. Gonzalez said she particularly liked the [...] "big brother-little sister vibe" [...] between Leslie and Ron. The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall said [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] was well-executed because revealing to the viewers <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> was going to tease Leslie made his pranks more humorous and less mean-spirited. Sepinwall also said the episode had several good moments for the supporting characters, including Andy's selfless act toward Tom and Donna's purchase of shares with the nightclub. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said he liked <b>that</b> <b>Ron</b> genuinely cares for Leslie. Heisler said: [...] "If he resented Leslie as much as he hinted at during season one, it'd become an ongoing thorn in the show's foot that during every single episode. [...] Getting along is underrated in comedy." ...|$|E
