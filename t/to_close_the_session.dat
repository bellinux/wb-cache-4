50|$|Lame duck {{sessions}} since 1935 {{have typically}} lasted about a month. The average length from commencement to closing has been 28 calendar days; the median, 33 (that is, half the lame duck sessions were longer than 33 days and half shorter). Eight of the 15 lame duck sessions have lasted between 25 and 37 calendar days; only three have exceeded this range. The longest {{was the first}} (76th Congress), which lasted 58 days, meeting (usually every third day) between November 7, 1940 (the day after election day), and January 3, 1941. The 77th Congress (1942) followed a similar pattern, but adjourned sine die after 48 calendar days. The lame duck session of the 91st Congress reached 45 calendar days by remaining in session until January 2, 1971. The shortest lame duck session occurred in the 80th Congress, when both houses returned solely <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> on December 31, 1948.

When a customer terminates the game or is disconnected, a message with the request for disconnection {{is sent to the}} GM (the first case, a request to disconnect) or status reports are no longer received (in the second case, inadvertent disconnection).The GM maintains another list of active sessions and updates its state whenever it receives the report from the client. Upon receiving a request <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>session</b> or when stipulated time limit has been exceeded, the GM updates its session table accordingly, so that resources are released and the same can then be used and made available for subsequent requests. In this manner, games are processed on servers controlled by the service provider and client devices need only basic computer capacity and a network access to play. With the introduction of WiFi communication being an integral component of most mobile devices, network performance and, therefore, users’ game play experience also undergo changes. Telecommunication companies are now able to focus their efforts towards pushing more application and game services that would have otherwise been a challenge.|$|E

40|$|The Thesis {{deals with}} the problem of Stalin's cult of personality. This {{question}} was presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Closed</b> <b>Session</b> of <b>the</b> Twentieth Congress of Soviet Communist Party on 25 th February 1956. This statement known as "The Secret Speech" was delivered by the First Party Secretary N. S. Khrushchev. In his speech he denounced Stalin's crimes mainly during the Great Terror in late 1930 s. Khrushchev and other Stalin's successors had tried hard to deny their own responsibility for the bloody purges during Stalin's era. The Thesis concentrates on effects forming content of the Secret Speech paying attention to instant power struggles in Kremlin. Rehabilitation process and investigation of Stalin's crimes is also an important part of The Thesis. In the conclusion I tried to answer the question whether the Secret Speech was a real turning point and if the changes and reforms made by Khrushchev were fundamental, permanent and stable. Another thing is how far the Secret Speech influenced the Soviet Union, its communist legacy and the world in general. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
25|$|In the 105 House {{seats and}} 26 Senate seats, {{altogether}} 267 men {{served in the}} Confederate Congress. About a third {{had served in the}} U.S. Congress, and others had prior experience in their state legislatures. Only twenty-seven served continuously, including House Speaker Thomas S.

There was a rapid turnover in membership, in part to some securing an officer's commission for military service. The mercurial Vice President, Alexander H. Stephens soon withdrew to his home state of Georgia, and Senator Hunter served as an acting Vice President and then later briefly as Secretary of State for the Davis Administration. Throughout the existence of the Confederate Congress, its sessions were held in secrecy.

This project is included into the i 2 cat framework {{as a member of}} the VEP project. It is an initiative from three different regions (Sweden, Belgium and Spain) to involve the European citizens in the European Parliament activities using new technologies. The MegaConference system aims to reproduce European Parliament debate <b>sessions</b> between <b>the</b> three VEP regions. Every participant region (End Point) brings students and politicians together in a big room that consists on 3 screens where all the participants at the same time can be seen. The video from the person talking at one turn, Active Speaker, will be shown in the Central Screen. The MegaConference system is based on Digital Video quality. It is a quality improvement from the actual video-conference that allows to appreciate the non-verbal communication as gestures and facial expressions very important in a face to face conversation and in political environments. Employing Digital Video quality is able to project the video on big screens at the End Point. End Points are connected to an MCU that manages the video-streaming (received and sent) to every End Point plus an extra destination stream used for the video publication of <b>the</b> debate <b>session</b> for <b>the</b> users at home. To complement the MegaConference System regarding the objectives of to bringing any user <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> debate <b>sessions</b> having a computer connected to internet as unique requirement, a MegaConference Chat Room has been developed.

60|$|The {{address was}} well {{received}} by both houses, and a disposition expressed to concur with the President's views and wishes. The {{discussion of the}} subjects {{to which he had}} called their attention, soon produced vehement conflicts of opinion in the House, marking the growing virulence of parties. The Secretary of the Treasury, in reporting, {{at the request of the}} House, a plan for the annual reduction of so much of the national debt as the United States had a right to redeem, spoke of the expenses of the Indian war, and the necessity of additional internal taxes. The consideration of the report was parried or evaded, and a motion made to reduce the military establishment. This gave an opportunity for sternly criticising the mode in which the Indian war had been conducted; for discussing the comparative merits and cost of regular and militia forces, and for inveighing against standing armies, as dangerous to liberty. These discussions, while they elicited much heat, led to no present result, and gave way to an inquiry into the conduct of the Secretary of the Treasury in regard to certain loans, which the President in conformity to acts of Congress, had authorized him to make; but concerning the management of which he had not furnished detailed reports to the legislature. The subject was opened by Mr. Giles, of Virginia, who moved in the House of Representatives a series of resolutions seeking information in the matter, and who followed his resolutions by a speech, charging the Secretary of the Treasury with official misconduct, and intimating that a large balance of public money had not been accounted for. A report of the Secretary gave all the information desired; but the charges against him continued to be urged with great acrimony <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> of <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> when they were signally rejected, not more than sixteen members voting for any one of them.|$|R
