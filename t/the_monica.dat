Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E

25|$|Technological {{developments}} of the Luftwaffe had a considerable impact on operations {{in the first half}} of 1944. Harris' new offensive, which culminated in the Battle of Berlin suffered heavy losses and failed to win the war outright, as Harris had expected. The plan was to break German morale at a projected cost of 500 bombers. The mission failed, moreover costing Bomber Command 1,128 bombers compared to German losses of just 256 fighters. Harris sought to reduce losses by introducing the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter to protect the bombers. However, the Bristol Beaufighter was selected instead, which proved inadequate until eventually it was replaced by the Mosquito. In the air during this period, technology and tactics favored the fighter. Unfortunately for the Luftwaffe, by early July 1944 RAF intelligence discovered the facts of <b>the</b> <b>Monica</b> tail warning sets being detected by the Flensburg gear when a Ju 88G-1 equipped with it and the latest model of the VHF-band SN-2 Lichtenstein radar landed by mistake in England, and similarly their H2S bomb-aiming radar by the Naxos device, and curtailed their use of H2S, rendering these three German AI radar and radar detection methods far less effective. The higher-frequency American H2X bombing radar, operating in the 10GHz frequency range, however is not known to have been detected by any Luftwaffe radio technology that existed before the end of the war.|$|E
