The results obtained using this procedure were in agreement with those obtained with a standard neutralization <b>test</b> <b>in</b> typing stock cultures and 32 clinical isolates of herpes simplex virus.

40|$|Graves 2 ̆ 7 disease (GD) is {{a complex}} {{autoimmune}} thyroid disorder with a strong genetic component. Genome-wide screens resolved several susceptibility loci {{that contribute to the}} development of GD. One of the susceptibility loci (GD- 1 locus) was mapped on chromosome 14 q 31. However, a susceptibility gene located within the GD- 1 locus remains undefined. Here we screen eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each is situated at a corresponding positional candidate gene, located within the GD- 1 susceptibility locus on chromosome 14 q 23 -q 32, for predisposition to GD using the transmission disequilibrium <b>test</b> <b>in</b> 126 <b>simplex</b> Russian families affected with GD. Among SNPs tested, a significant preferential transmission of the Ala allele (41 transmissions vs. 17 nontransmissions, corrected P = 0. 031) of the Thr 92 Ala SNP within the DIO 2 gene, encoding type II iodothyronine deiodinase, from parents to affected children was found in a Russian family data set. The Thr 92 Ala SNP of the DIO 2 gene and the D 727 E substitution of the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene have been found to be in pair-wise linkage disequilibrium. The A 92 /E 727 haplotype showed significant preferential transmission from parents to affected sibling (17 transmissions vs. 8 nontransmissions, P = 0. 039) <b>in</b> <b>simplex</b> families. This suggests that the Thr 92 Ala variant of the DIO 2 gene is associated or may be in linkage disequilibrium with a functional DIO 2 polymorphism which involves in the development of GD in a Russian population...|$|R

25|$|Small {{peptides}} can specifically {{inhibit the}} RNR2 subunits from binding with RNR1 when {{they share a}} significant similarity with the normal RNR2 C-terminus. This inhibition RNR2 binding to RNR1 has been <b>tested</b> successfully <b>in</b> herpes <b>simplex</b> virus (HSV) RNR. When a 7 amino acid oligomer (GAVVNDL) truncated from the C-terminus of the RNR2 subunit was used in competition assays, it prevented the normal RNR2 from forming an enzymatically active complex with RNR1. Other small peptide inhibitors similar to the RNR2 C-terminus have also been used successfully to inhibit HSV RNR enzymatic activity and thus HSV replication. In mice models of stromal keratitis and corneal neovascularization (HSV ocular disease), a small RNR2 C-terminal analog BILD 1263 {{has been reported to}} inhibit RNR and is effective in preventing these diseases. In some cases, although treatment with small C-terminal analogs may not stop disease spreading, they can still help in healing. In the acyclovir-resistant HSV (PAAr5), a small peptide inhibitor BILD 1633 has been reported to be 5 to 10 times more potent than BILD 1263 against cutaneous PAAr5 infection. A combination therapy approach (BILD 1633 and acyclovir) is more effective to heal topical lesions in mice. These data suggest that small peptide inhibitors that compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1 are useful in preventing the spread of HSV.|$|R
