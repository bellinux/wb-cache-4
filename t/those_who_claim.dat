5|$|Carmelo Camet {{was born}} on October 29, 1904, the son of Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and Clara Isa. The elder Camet, though officially an athlete from France, is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Argentina's first Olympic participant. This is disputed, however, by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> that Horatio Torromé should hold this title as the first official Argentine representative. Carmelo had one brother, Carlos Ernesto Camet, who pursued a political career. Carlos, who served as a deputy to the national congress, was, like the rest of his family, supportive of the Radical Civil Union, an Argentine political reform party formed in the 1890s.|$|E

25|$|While {{the story}} is often {{assumed to be a}} {{religious}} allegory, there has been considerable discussion as to whether the legends are based on actual events. Over the years there have been many interpretations of the possible geographical position of Saint Brendan's Island. Various pre-Columbian sea-charts indicated it everywhere from the southern part of Ireland, to the Canary Islands, Faroes or Azores, to the island of Madeira, to a point 60 degrees west of the first meridian and very near the equator.

With a population of 28,884 in 1891, just under half (49.9%) of the inhabitants of Košice declared the then official Hungarian language as their main means of communication, 33.6% Slovak, and 13.5% German; 72.2% were Roman Catholics, 11.4% Jews, 7.3% Lutherans, 6.7% Greek Catholics, and 4.3% Calvinists. The results of this census are questioned by some historians by claiming that they were manipulated, {{in order to increase}} the percentage of the Magyar population in the period of Magyarization.|$|R
25|$|It {{is known}} that Li Luoneng was {{proficient}} in other martial arts before studying Dai clan's Xin Yi. Some claim his original art was Qimen Quan (奇门拳), perhaps his family's style, while others believe he actually studied Tongbei Quan and Gongli Quan. Li came to study under the Dai family either because he heard of their fame in the martial arts and business, or maybe as suggested by others, after having fought and lost to a practitioner of their art. It is generally agreed he then settled {{in the area of}} their village, and grew and sold vegetables, which earned him the nickname 'Li Lao Nong' 李老农 (Old Farmer Li, but also 'Respectable Farmer Li'). Initially, members of the Dai clan refused to teach him, but he eventually won over their trust, and he was taught by Dai Wenxiong, Guo Weihan, or both. After learning Dai Xin Yi for a number of years, perhaps over a decade, Li left the Dai territories and traveled across Shanxi and Hebei provinces, teaching for many years his own elaboration on the art, now called 'Xing Yi Quan'. No reasons were ever recorded for the many changes Li made to the art, but there are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> that Li wished to compete with the Dai clan's fame, perhaps because of some grudge. Li and many of his students and grand-students were famous for offering bodyguard and caravan escort services.|$|E

Mentorn Media, producers of programmes such as BBC One's Question Time, was commissioned to produce the show. Originally scheduled for 10 February, the programme, titled Benefits Britain: The Debate, was subsequently moved back a week to 17 February after rival broadcaster Channel 5 announced plans for a two-hour debate about immigration for the same evening. Channel 4 said Benefits Britain: The Debate would be immediately preceded by a follow-up documentary, Benefits Street: The Last Word. The change was announced after many listings magazines had gone to press, a practice generally discouraged in the media industry.|$|E

Bianco said, [...] "Let's hope the changes work, because Homicide is too good to lose, and its vision of civilization is too troubling to shunt aside." [...] The Washington Post television reviewer Tom Shales called Homicide [...] "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." [...] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called it the best police drama ever made for television besides Hill Street Blues. Baltimore Sun reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: [...] "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." [...] Tom Jicha of South Florida Sun-Sentinel called it [...] "an hour about as fine as there is on the tube" [...] with great writing and camera-work. Jicha said, [...] "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning the dial." [...] Hal Boedeker, television critic with The Miami Herald, strongly praised the series, particularly [...] "Bop Gun", which he called [...] "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting [...] "first-rate" [...] and declared Homicide the better choice over NYPD Blue {{because it did not}} resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.|$|E

50|$|Decree 1926 {{was brought}} to the Supreme Court by several plaintiffs. The decree's advocates argued that it pertained to the {{organization}} of an electoral event and claimed that the Nation, the source of sovereignty under article 2 of the 1886 constitution, could exercise its constituent power notwithstanding articles 218 and 13. Critics of the decree, the court's record stated, hit it from several angles - <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> the anticipated reforms were elitist and limited in scope; and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> that the decree was unconstitutional as it violated articles 218 and 13 (they also rejected preeminence could be established between articles 2 and 218).

500|$|When The New York Times began {{publishing}} its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His {{words to}} National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included [...] "People have gotta {{be put to}} the torch for this sort of thing..." [...] and [...] "Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail." [...] After failing to get The New York Times to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that The New York Times cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, The Washington Post began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a Post editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the Post received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, William Rehnquist, asking them to stop publishing. When the Post refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into New York Times Co. v. United States 403 US 713. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>claim</b> the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the relationship of social identity (Hongkonger or Chinese) and rite attitudes toward bilingual code switching in a conversation between a Hong Kong person and a Chinese Mainlander. Students from a local university in Hong Kong (N = 159) listened to a four-turn conversation between a Hong Kong person and a Mainlander in a wedding party. As expected, when the speaker converged to rite Putonghua (the Mainland official language), <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> a Hongkonger identity judged the Hong Kong speaker less favourably; than did <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> a Chinese identity. In addition, participants <b>who</b> <b>claimed</b> a Chinese identity judged the Hong Kong speaker more favourably when he converged to Putonghua than when he maintained Cantonese (a Chinese dialect most commonly used in Hong Kong). Finally, social identity was unrelated to language attitudes when the Mainland speaker converged to Cantonese first. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
