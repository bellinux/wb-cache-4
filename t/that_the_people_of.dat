5|$|Early Muslim {{writings}} confirm <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> West Africa {{operated a}} sophisticated network of trade, usually {{under the authority}} of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom. Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; the mainstay of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E
5|$|In 1255 Saka, Permana Dikoesoemah is the King of Galuh, {{beloved by}} {{his people and}} his wife Naganingroem. The {{minister}} Aria Kebonan wants power for himself, and persuades the king to surrender the crown to him. Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always and not to bother his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence. Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Galuh are unaware {{that they have a}} new king.|$|E
5|$|When Rome had {{received}} word of Germanicus' death, the people began observing a iustitium before the Senate had officially declared it. Tacitus says this shows the true grief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Rome felt, and this {{also shows that}} {{by this time the}} people already knew the proper way to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Abinadi again {{begins to}} prophesy, saying <b>that</b> because <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Noah have not repented, {{they will be}} brought into bondage.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{opposing}} theories regarding {{the origins of}} ancient Filipinos. F. Landa Jocano theorizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancestors of the Filipinos evolved locally. Wilhelm Solheim's Island Origin Theory postulates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peopling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the Sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000BC rather than by wide-scale migration. The Austronesian Expansion Theory explains that Malayo-Polynesians coming from Taiwan began migrating to the Philippines around 4000BC, displacing earlier arrivals.|$|R
2500|$|Pioneering {{archaeologist}} Alex D. Kreiger {{summed up}} the evidence: [...] “To attempt to classify Antelope Creek Focus as either a Plains or Puebloan culture is infeasible, for it was clearly a combination of both. … One can hardly escape <b>the</b> impression <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> this focus were Plains agriculturalists who pushed southward from one valley to another as far as eastern New Mexico. Here contact was established with Puebloans who were expanding their territories at the same time.” ...|$|R
5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest {{the next election}} as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within {{a few days of}} the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Fort Nieulay, {{located along}} the Avenue Roger Salengro {{originally}} dated to the 12th or 13th century. During the English invasion in 1346, sluices gates were added as water defences and a fort was built up around it in 1525 {{on the principle}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the fort could defend the town by flooding it. In April and May 1677, Louis XIV and Vauban visited Calais and ordered a complete rebuilding of Fort Nieulay. It was completed in 1679, with the purpose to protect the bridge of Nieulay crossing the Hames River. By 1815 the fort had fallen into a ruined state and it wasn't until 1903 that it was sold and improved by its farmer tenants. The fort was briefly {{the site of a}} low-key scuffle with Germans in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|That evening Napoleon and {{the four}} merchants {{discussed}} the revolution, subsequent rebellions, and their consequences. Speaking as a pro-Republican, Napoleon supported the Jacobin cause, and explained {{the benefits of the}} revolution, whilst defending Carteaux's actions in Avignon. One of the merchants from Marseille expressed his moderate views regarding the revolution, and reasons for supporting civil war against a central government. The merchant stressed that Marseille did not fight for the Royalist cause, but opposed the nature of the Convention itself, condemning its decrees and deeming the execution of citizens as unlawful. Napoleon concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Marseille should reject counter-revolutionary ideals and adopt the constitution of the French Republic in order to end the civil war and allow the regular army to restore France.|$|E

40|$|In 1795 Immanuel Kant proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth {{have entered}} into a 'universal community'. Since Kant wrote this the {{processes}} <b>of</b> inter-connection between <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth has grown even more pronounced {{and the notion of}} 'cosmopolitics' has thus come to seem a defining one for the contemporary age. As such this volume makes a timely contribution to contemporary debates about international law, global ecology and economy and transnational synergies. The volume is inter-disciplinary and is intended to be a contribution to a debate that crosses borders and disciplines. ...|$|R
50|$|Druidism {{does not}} appear to have been practiced by the Cantabri, though there is enough {{evidence}} for the existence of an organized priestly class who performed elaborated rites, which included ritual steam baths, festive dances, oracles, divination, human and animal sacrifices. In this respect, Strabo mentions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north-west sacrificed horses to an unnamed God of War, and both Horace and Silius Italicus added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Concani had the custom of drinking the horse’s blood at the ceremony.|$|R
5|$|The Dresden Codex is {{described}} by historian J. Eric S. Thompson as writings of the indigenous people of the Yucatán Peninsula in southeastern Mexico. Maya historians Peter J. Schmidt, Mercedes de la Garza, and Enrique Nalda confirm this. Thompson further narrows the probable origin of the Dresden Codex {{to the area of}} Chichen Itza, because certain picture symbols in the codex are only found on monuments in that location. He also argues that the astronomical tables would support this as the place of origin. Thompson claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the Yucatán Peninsula were known to have done such studies around 1200 A.D. Thompson also notes the similar ceramic designs in the Chichen Itza area which are known to have ceased in the early thirteenth century. British historian Clive Ruggles suggests, based on the analyses of several scholars, that the Dresden Codex is a copy and was originally written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. Thompson narrows the date closer to 1200 to 1250. Maya archaeologist Linton Satterthwaite puts the date when it was made as no later than 1345. It is the oldest surviving book from the Americas.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Espejo's {{first three}} works was the {{intellectual}} improvement of Quito. El Nuevo Luciano de Quito ridiculed the outdated educational system {{maintained by the}} clergy. Espejo argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Quito were accustomed to adulation and that they admired any preacher who could quote the Bible in a pompous and insubstantial way. Marco Porcio Catón exposed the ignorance of the pseudointellectuals of Quito. La ciencia blancardina, in which Espejo {{claimed to be the}} author of the previous two works, condemned the results of the clergy's educational system: ignorance and affectation. All three works caused polemic.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} {{to promote the}} Sino-Roman connection for tourism, but Dubs' synthesis of Roman and Chinese sources has not found acceptance among historians, {{on the grounds that}} it is highly speculative and reaches too many conclusions without sufficient hard evidence. DNA testing in 2005 confirmed the Indo-European ancestry of a few inhabitants of modern Liqian; this could be explained by transethnic marriages with Indo-European people known to have lived in Gansu in ancient times, such as the Yuezhi and Wusun. A much more comprehensive DNA analysis of more than two hundred male residents of the village in 2007 showed close genetic relation to the Han Chinese populace and great deviation from the Western Eurasian gene pool. The researchers conclude <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Liqian are probably of Han Chinese origin. The area lacks archaeological evidence of Roman presence.|$|E

25|$|Continuity in {{cultural}} history suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> those areas were also {{descended from the}} inhabitants of the Archaic period. In the panhandle and the northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula, <b>people</b> adopted cultivation <b>of</b> maize. Its cultivation was restricted or absent among the tribes who lived south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Timucuan-speaking <b>people</b> (i.e., south <b>of</b> a line approximately from present-day Daytona Beach, Florida to a point on or north <b>of</b> Tampa Bay.) <b>Peoples</b> in southern Florida depended on the rich estuarine environment and developed a highly complex society without agriculture.|$|R
25|$|The {{description}} of the ongoing war between the Casqui and Pacaha matches interpretations of the archaeological record, as do distances and topography mentioned in the narratives. Words recorded by the narratives at Pacaha, such as mochila, macanoche, and caloosa, match Tunica linguistic characteristics evaluated by Mary Haas in the 1940s. It is now theorized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Mississippi Valley, from Pacaha in the north to the Provinces of Anilco and Utiangüe in the south on the Arkansas River, were all Tunican.|$|R
5|$|They were an {{essential}} part of traditional Tahitian society. Dog teeth were fashioned into fishhooks and dog bones were made into weapons and implements. They also used dog hair, especially the long tail hairs of the Tuamotuan varieties of dogs, to decorate the fringes of the taumi – a traditional breast ornament often called a gorget – which were worn by priests and high chiefs. The Tuamotuan breed were described as similar to their Tahitian counterparts distinguishable by their longer hair. Historian Margaret Titcomb noted that Tuamotuan varieties may not have been a separate breed that developed in isolation, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the Tuamotus could have eaten their short hair varieties and kept their longer haired dogs for exports to the Society Islands.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by a period of building further education infrastructure. To help elementary school teachers further their studies, Soeman took part in establishing a private junior high school in 1953. The following year he helped establish the Setia Dharma Senior High School, the first senior high school in Riau. Minister of Education Mohammad Yamin attended the opening ceremony, where Soeman compared the situation in Riau to that of Aceh and North Sumatra and declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Riau had been treated like stepchildren. He called for Yamin to send government teachers to support Setia Dharma. Though Yamin objected to Soeman's rhetoric and did not send any teachers to Setia Dharma, he did arrange for a state senior high school to be opened in Riau.|$|E
5|$|The League {{resolved}} {{a dispute}} between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey {{over control of the}} former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Mosul {{did not want to be}} part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations' arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admittance.|$|E

50|$|Anti-revisionists (which {{includes}} radical Marxist Leninist factions, Hoxhaists and Maoists) {{criticize the}} rule of the communist states by claiming that they were state capitalist states ruled by revisionists. Though the periods and countries defined as state capitalist or revisionist varies among different ideologies and parties, all of them accept <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union was socialist during Stalin's time. Maoists believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>People's</b> Republic <b>of</b> China became state capitalist after Mao Zedong's death. Hoxhaists believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peoples</b> Republic <b>of</b> China was always state capitalist and uphold Socialist Albania as the only socialist state after the Soviet Union under Stalin.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, Taiwan {{reacted to}} reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>People's</b> Republic <b>of</b> China was {{attempting}} to draw Tuvalu away from the Republic of China. Taiwan consequently strengthened its weakening diplomatic relations with Tuvalu.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} team {{planned to}} distinguish The Last Remnant from the Final Fantasy series and other role-playing games through {{its focus on}} the battle system. The art direction of the game was focused on making all of the characters stand out on the battlefield, and in making the Remnants stand {{out in the world}} screens. The cities were designed to not look very fantastical, so as to make the Remnants more prominent, and were designed early on in the development process to give the impression <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> the city were living both literally and figuratively under the power of the gigantic Remnants. The game marked several firsts for Square Enix, as it was their first game to be released on the same day in both Japan and internationally, as well as the first to use motion captures of Western actors. This resulted in the characters' lips speaking English synced to the spoken dialogue, rather than Japanese. The game had always been intended to be released simultaneously worldwide and was to be targeted to players worldwide, which impacted the character design and art direction. The design and dialogue were created to appeal to international players as well as Japanese players, rather than being focused on the norms of the Japanese video game market alone.|$|E
5|$|The game's opening sees Ringford {{holding the}} Cauldron and its {{controlling}} ring Titrel, having been given Titrel by Ingway {{as part of}} his vengeance against Odin. Elfaria is ultimately killed by Odin, who takes Titrel from her. Velvet steals it in turn and gives it to the dragon Wagner, hoping that this would prevent the Cauldron being used. Her lover Cornelius is meanwhile changed into a Pooka by Ingway and thrown into the Netherworld, escaping with the aid of his grandfather Gallon. He learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Valentine share his curse, and is embroiled in both the Pookas' efforts to collect wish-granting coins to reverse their condition and his attempts to save Velvet from danger. The Three Wise Men are attempting to fulfill the prophecies of the Armageddon — all but one Wise Man are killed {{during the course of the}} story, while the third Beldor is afflicted with the Pooka's curse and gains subsequent immortality. Cornelius rescues Velvet from their clutches, and despite his fears she reaffirms her love for him in his new form. Several characters also encounter King Valentine, who continues to be tormented by memories of murdering Velvet's mother in a rage — {{as part of his}} scheme to trigger the Armageddon, he hatches the dragon Leventhan.|$|E

25|$|In general, most {{research}} agrees <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{who have had}} multiple same-gender sexual experiences is fewer than <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{who have had a}} single such experience, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who identify themselves as exclusively homosexual is fewer than <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who have had multiple homosexual experiences.|$|R
25|$|It appears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Amato {{originated}} {{from the ancient}} city of Lametia, on the promontory of the Gulf of Sant'Eufemia, {{near the mouth of}} the Amato River.

25|$|The feminist {{historian}} Deborah Willis {{asserts that}} the witch-hunts resulted from a societal fear of maternal power. Willis argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> early modern Europe all had similar fears about malevolent motherly nurturing, and that the witches' teat is a manifestation of that fear. Willis {{asserts that the}} witches' teat is a perversion of the female power to nourish and strengthen young.|$|E
25|$|The spatial {{patterning}} {{of grave}} good types also differs {{from those of}} the Early Anglo-Saxon period, as smaller regional distributions were replaced by larger ones. This might reflect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Anglo-Saxon England were beginning to increasingly recognise themselves as members of a larger cultural group, the English, as opposed to their earlier more geographically restricted cultural groupings.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} extinct populations are {{believed}} to have spoken Afro-Asiatic languages of the Berber branch. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C-Group culture in present-day southern Egypt and northern Sudan spoke Berber languages. The Nilo-Saharan Nobiin language today contains a number of key pastoralism related loanwords that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/Nile. This in turn suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> C-Group population — which, along with the Kerma culture, inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.|$|R
