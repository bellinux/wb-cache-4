The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse.

5|$|Many of the {{artefacts}} excavated {{from the}} acropolis {{date from the}} transition from the Terminal Classic Period to the Early Postclassic, when the surrounding population appears to have occupied the abandoned palace. Excavations of the south range of the acropolis uncovered a great many potsherds (roughly 11,000) dating to the Terminal Classic, and about 150 pieces dating to the Early Postclassic. In the same building 150 stone artefacts were excavated together with hundreds of fragments of waste chippings. Fifteen incomplete ceramic figurines were also found, including zoomorphic figures and elite human figures with elaborate headdresses. One of these figurines was a whistle in the shape of an owl, identical to another found in an excavated rubbish heap in the acropolis courtyard. Both of these owl-shaped whistles are very similar to a larger whistle found at Yaxha. A number of artefacts were recovered from <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> Room 3 of the south range, including a complete terminal classic ceramic vessel, a flint knife, some broken figurine fragments and some lithic fragments. In the area of <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> Room 4 in the south range a complete Early Postclassic tripod plate was recovered. Within Room 4 itself were found a further 70 broken pieces of Terminal Classic ceramics and 232 pieces dated to the Early Postclassic, and a greenstone axe among other finds. Many of the Postclassic fragments were from a tripod pitcher with zoomorph supports that archaeologists were largely able to reconstruct. Additionally, 798 Terminal Classic ceramic fragments were found during the exploration of the terraces immediately south of the acropolis, together with stone chippings and pieces of animal bones.|$|E

From that ridge, the Militia gunners could shoot directly downhill at those locations with artillery. United States Navy warships shelled Druze positions and helped the Lebanese Army hold the town of Suk El Gharb until a cease-fire was declared on 25 September, on which day the battleship New Jersey arrived on the scene.

5|$|Since 1988, the American {{black duck}} has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} causes a Doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, {{this results in a}} broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates of rotation. However, only the rotational motion {{in the direction of the}} observer can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star's rotation. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359's equator is less than 3 km/s, which is below <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the spin down of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective stars like this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a strengthening ridge to the south, Linfa began tracking eastward. Despite its proximity to land, the tropical storm's slow forward motion allowed for additional strengthening, {{and according to the}} JMA, Linfa reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90km/h (50mph) at 0000UTC on May27, just within <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> severe tropical storm status. Concurrently the cyclone made landfall near Dagupan, Luzon. Upon landfall, Linfa began to weaken as it crossed Luzon before emerging into the Pacific as a minimal tropical storm late that day. However, as a result of land interaction the initial surface circulation center of Linfa greatly weakened and was overtaken by a newly formed low-level circulation center on May28, resulting in the storm's position to shift well northeastward. This was the primary basis on which the JTWC downgraded Linfa to tropical depression status early on May28, though the JMA continued to analyze the system as a weak tropical storm. Afterwards, as the cyclone began to track northeastward, the new circulation center became more organized, resulting in the JTWC reclassifying Linfa as a tropical storm at 0600UTC the following day. Gradual strengthening followed, and at 1800UTC that day Linfa reached peak intensity with winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg) south of Okinawa. Subsequently the system began to take a more northward course and undergo extratropical transition, which was completed at 0000UTC on May30. Though by this time most tropical cyclone monitoring agencies ceased the monitoring of these extratropical remnants by this time, the JMA continued to track them as they made landfall near Uwajima, Ehime at 0800UTC the following day. Linfa's remnants then paralleled the western coast of Japan before dissipating on June4 well into the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn objective, fast, and {{reasonably}} accurate assessment test {{that allows for}} easy interpretation of the responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hearing <b>thresholds</b> at all frequencies of a conventional audiogram is needed to resolve the medicolegal aspects of an occupational hearing injury.

The results showed that, on average, Mf-ASSR curves corresponded well with <b>the</b> <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PTA contours averaged across subjects.
