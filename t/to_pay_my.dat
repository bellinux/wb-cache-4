25|$|Mother Jones {{was joined}} by President Keeney and other UMWA {{officials}} who were also pressuring the miners to go home. Although Mother Jones organized for decades {{on behalf of the}} UMWA in West Virginia and even denounced the state as ‘medieval’, the chapter of the same name in her autobiography, she mostly praises Governor Morgan for defending the 1st amendment freedom of the labor weekly The Federationist to publish. His refusal to consent to the mine owners request he ban the paper demonstrated to Mother Jones that he ‘refused to comply with the requests of the dominant money interests. To a man of that type I wish <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> respects’. Apparently Jones didn’t know or overlooked that Morgan had received about $1 million in campaign donations from industrialists in the 1920 election.|$|E

Returning to Star Trek, but appearing {{for the first time in}} Enterprise, was Leland Orser, who played Loomis. The actor had previously appeared in the [...] episode [...] "", as well as the [...] episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street". He later explained to Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> bills. I knew I'd play some guy saying some stuff. Then I got a call saying I needed to go in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop on my face, and I had straws sticking out of my nose. I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting." ...|$|E

6000|$|No doubt. But {{how then}} (Mr Dorrit not unnaturally hinted) could the subject be approached. 'I cannot object,' said Mrs General--'though {{even that is}} disagreeable to me--to Mr Dorrit's inquiring, in {{confidence}} of my friends here, what amount they have been accustomed, at quarterly intervals, <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> credit at my bankers'.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Head of the State Border Guard of Ukraine Mykola Lytvyn {{said that}} {{officials}} reports indicated {{the presence of}} Abkhaz militants as well. Militants from North and South Ossetia were open about their presence in Donbass in June. One militant named Oleg, part of the Vostok Battalion, told reporters [...] "In 2008 they were killing us and the Russians saved us. I came here <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> dues to them".|$|E

2500|$|Robinson {{spent most}} of his playing career under the tough {{captaincy}} of Brian Sellers, who won six championships in eight seasons. [...] "I got a rollicking in my first match for putting my foot on the ball. In my first season, my spinning finger was so worn it was bleeding but Mr Sellers said I had to keep going and bowled me into the wind all day." [...] In that match, [...] at Bristol, Robinson took 2–168 as Hammond stroked 143. [...] "You were only paid if you played and I was never sure of my place. As an uncapped player I got pounds 7 or pounds 8 a match but had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> own travel and hotel expenses." ...|$|E
2500|$|With accompaniment by {{experimental}} rock guitarist Gary Lucas, Buckley performed [...] "I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain", a song Tim Buckley {{wrote about}} an infant Jeff Buckley and his mother. Buckley {{returned to the}} stage to play [...] "Sefronia– The King's Chain", [...] "Phantasmagoria in Two", and concluded the concert with [...] "Once I Was" [...] performed acoustically with an impromptu a cappella ending, due to a snapped guitar string. Willner, the show's organizer, later recalled that Buckley's set closer made a strong impression. Buckley's performance at the concert was counter-intuitive to his desire to distance himself musically from his father. Buckley later explained his reasoning to Rolling Stone: [...] "It wasn't my work, it wasn't my life. But it bothered me that I hadn't been to his funeral, that I'd {{never been able to}} tell him anything. I used that show <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> last respects." [...] The concert proved to be his first step into the music industry that had eluded him for years.|$|E
2500|$|Wealthy and {{socially}} ambitious women {{were drawn to}} Worth's showpiece creations. Over time this included American clients; Worth loved working with them because his French language skills never reached fluency and, as he put it, American women: [...] "have faith, figures, and francs – faith to believe in me, figures that I can put into shape, francs <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> bills". Wealthy Americans travelled to Paris to have their entire wardrobe made by Worth – and that meant morning, afternoon and evening dresses {{as well as what}} were termed 'undress' items such as nightgowns and tea gowns. He would also design special occasion garments, such as wedding dresses. Alongside high society, the House of Worth also produced garments for popular stars such as Sarah Bernhardt, Lillie Langtry and Jenny Lind – who shopped there for both performance and private wear. Prices at Worth were dizzying for the time; the last bill it issued to Princess de Metternich – who had commented {{on the end of the}} 300 franc dress once Worth acquired royal patronage – was for the sum of 2,247 francs. Her purchase had been one lilac velvet dress.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{disclosed}} that Arnault planned {{to apply for}} Belgian citizenship and was considering moving to Belgium in 2013. In April 2013, Arnault {{said that he had}} been misquoted and that he never intended to leave France: [...] "I repeatedly said that I would stay as a resident in France and that I would continue <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> taxes.... Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request of Belgian nationality. Requesting Belgian nationality was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to disappear." [...] On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced that he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated that several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes, that he declined their requests, and that [...] "the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive now that it was set to be levied on firms rather than people and only due to stay in place for two years." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "From Fife, my liege," [...] {{answered}} the young soldier, and continued, {{when he had}} politely saluted {{the rest of the}} company, and particularly Sir Arthur and his daughter--"I learned from one of the servants, as I rode towards Monkbarns <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> respects to you, that I should find the present company in this place, and I willingly embrace the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>my</b> respects to so many of my friends at once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} didn't {{expect to see}} me," [...] he said; [...] "I've but just arrived. Literally, I only got here this evening. You see I've lost no time in coming <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you <b>my</b> respects. I knew you were at home on Thursdays." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gerald pondered for a {{few moments}} and then looked up. [...] "You owe me nothing, Grace. In fact, you and mother have often had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>my</b> folly; but I want you to be honest now. I imagine you {{understand}} what Alan expects if he helps me out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, you may. And {{if you can}} get {{the ladies}} to excuse me, I will follow in a few minutes. I wish <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him <b>my</b> respects.
