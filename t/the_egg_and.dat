5|$|In Digital Devil Saga 2, the Embryon {{appear in}} the real world, which is slowly being {{destroyed}} by the Black Sun: the only ones able to survive the sun's rays are those infected with the demon virus. Serph, Cielo, Argilla and Gale learn that Sera is the captive of Angel and Madame Cuvier at the Karma Society headquarters. With the help of Roland and a young boy named Fred, the group infiltrate the Karma Society's building. While they attempt to rescue Serah, Angel plans to subvert Cuvier and use the demon virus to create a society ruled by the strong. The Embryon are also faced by Heat, who is working with Cuvier {{on the promise of}} Sera's safety. Reaching the EGG, a man-made replica of God, the party rescue Sera, but Heat appears and seems to kill Serph. Both fall into <b>the</b> <b>EGG,</b> <b>and</b> God begins absorbing the Earth's data: in the chaos, Angel kills Cuvier, while the remaining Embryon and Sera, now able to assume a demon form herself, shut down the Power Plant in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the EGG. In the process, both Roland and Argilla are killed by a powerful demon. Returning to the EGG so Sera can speak with God, they are confronted by Heat, who has fused with <b>the</b> <b>EGG</b> <b>and</b> gone berserk. Inside the EGG, Serph is met by a higher being calling itself Schrödinger, who reveals the truth about what happened.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether pterosaurs practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly {{as soon as they}} emerged from <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> the {{numerous}} flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were dependent on their parents for {{a relatively short period of}} time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, and then left the nest to fend for themselves, possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their first few days of life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on parents for food.|$|E
40|$|During April 1959 a {{bunch of}} eggs {{attached}} to seaweeds were collected from the beach at Mandapam (Gulf of Mannar). <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> were hatched in the laboratory and the larval development was followed for a few days.

5|$|Frog larvae {{are known}} as tadpoles and {{typically}} have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. The free-living larvae are normally fully aquatic, but the tadpoles of some species (such as Nannophrys ceylonensis) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks. Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming. Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills. The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air. Some species complete their development inside <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> hatch directly into small frogs. These larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place. While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak. Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the agricultural, hunting/fishing, forestry, {{and mining}} {{industries}} made up 5.46% {{of the industry}} in Juniata County.

In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> poultry industry in the county generated $32 million in sales (the 7th highest of the Pennsylvania counties) and the dairy industry generated $17 million in sales (the 23rd highest of the Pennsylvania counties). The hog and pig industry generated $7 million and the cattle industry generated $4 million in sales (the 10th and 27th highest of Pennsylvania counties, respectively). The county's grain industry generated $1 million (the 35th highest of Pennsylvania counties). The county is the fourth most prolific poultry-producing county in Pennsylvania. In addition to the aforementioned industries, there are also small-scale clothing manufacturing businesses in the county.|$|E
5|$|Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in {{the water}} column feed on diatoms or other phytoplankton. In {{temperate}} regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients stored in the yolk of the egg where the main energy source is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first feeds, the larger <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these energy-rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (Macoma balthica) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days, they become D-stage larvae, when they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common mussel (Mytilus edulis) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.|$|E

5|$|The {{frilled shark}} is aplacental viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are mainly nourished by yolk, though {{the difference in}} weight between <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus, on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which {{there is little to}} no seasonal influence. A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six. Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start {{to develop and}} are used as an {{accessory}} breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, {{but the number of}} rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification. In the Pipidae, with the exception of Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish. Their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 2013, Rovio teased on its Facebook {{page that}} Red, the main protagonist of the game, would receive an ability {{in a new}} episode. On June 26, Rovio {{released}} a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design. On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal {{is to keep the}} pigs from stealing <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs in the level. The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.|$|E
50|$|Oreochromis and Sarotherodon are mouthbrooders, {{carrying}} <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> fry {{in their}} mouths instead of placing them in a nest.

5|$|Many {{woodland}} salamanders lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land.

When fully developed, they break {{their way out of}} <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> capsules <b>and</b> disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> hatch, using body undulations to fan <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> increase their supply of oxygen.|$|R

5|$|When {{a player}} {{moves to a}} tile {{occupied}} by a Cutie, that creature is slain along with any other Cuties of the same color directly connected to that tile. Chains of Cuties can be slain in this fashion, producing several souls. Each tile the player moves to is drained of life, causing the grass to wither and preventing the player from moving back to it, any Cuties destroyed in a chain outside of the initial tile become eggs. After a set period of turns the eggs hatch into random Cuties, which can again be harvested for souls. Any tiles drained by the player's presence return to life and are furnished with an egg when existing eggs hatch. The result {{of this is that}} every tile the reaper travels on takes twice as long to spawn a new Cutie compared to tiles that housed a Cutie destroyed by a chain attack. Players move to the next game level after a certain amount of moves, every new level increases the time taken for eggs to hatch by a turn. Moving onto a tile containing an egg destroys <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> incurs a small point deduction, but destroying a golden egg increases the player's score. A golden egg is produced whenever 10 or more Cuties are killed in a chain.|$|E
