40|$|Bibliography: pages 207 - 225. In {{this thesis}} I offer a {{detailed}} examination of <b>the</b> ten prose <b>prefaces</b> which head <b>the</b> Epigrams of Martial (AD c 45 -c 96) and the Siluae of Statius (c 45 -c 96). The most remarkable feature of these ten short pieces of prose {{lies in the}} field of literary history: these are the first extant instances of collections of verse which are headed with pieces of prose, and it is chiefly from this angle that <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> are studied. <b>The</b> body of the thesis (Section B) is devoted to a close thematic examination of <b>the</b> <b>prefaces.</b> Their content is discussed under three main headings, namely justification, information and request (chapters 5, 6 and 7 respectively). Within this framework <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> are examined in the terms suggested by the four chapters of Section A - the literary history of prefacing (both prose prefaces per se and proems to collections of verse), the production and dissemination of ancient literature, the patronage of letters, and the biographies of the two poets (chapters 1 to 4 respectively). All these topics are treated broadly in Section A and then with specific reference to <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> in Section B...|$|R

5|$|The {{illustrations}} are, {{according to}} <b>the</b> <b>Preface,</b> made from Wallace's own sketches, photographs, or specimens. Wallace thanks Walter and Henry Woodbury for some photographs of scenery and native people.

5|$|Within a {{few years}} after Stearn {{returned}} from the war, his Art of Botanical Illustration (1950) was published, remaining the standard work on the subject to this day. There was, however, some bibliographic confusionCollins, the publisher, had planned a book on botanical art for its New Naturalist series, but mistakenly commissioned both Stearn and the art historian Wilfred Blunt independently to produce the work. After the error was discovered the two decided to collaborate; Blunt wrote the work while Stearn edited and revised it. When it was published, Blunt's name was on the title page, while Stearn was only acknowledged in <b>the</b> <b>preface.</b> The omission was not rectified till he prepared the second edition in 1994, although <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> reveals Stearn's extensive contribution.|$|E

This collection has a dedication to Prince Ferdinando de' Medici to whom Mercator attributes ancestry from King Atlas.|$|E
5|$|François Callebout {{wrote an}} organ version that was {{published}} in 2004 by Dr. J. Butz. Gabriel Dessauer explains in <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> that the work was conceived for oratorio choirs {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, of up to 500 singers. The organ version enables smaller choirs to perform the music. It was premiered in 2003 by the Reger-Chor in St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, the parish to which the composer belonged during his studies in Wiesbaden. The organ was played by Ignace Michiels, organist at the St. Salvator Cathedral in Bruges.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we have {{explored}} <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> of monolingual English, monolingual French, and bilingual French-English dictionaries of the 17 th century. The monolingual works studied constitute {{the first of}} this kind to have been published. Over {{the course of this}} research, we have demonstrated that despite different lexicographic traditions, dictionary <b>prefaces</b> convey basically <b>the</b> same type of information, and address the same general issues. This study is divided into two main sections. In the first, we have provided historical information on the dictionaries, so as to illustrate the historical context in which they were published. In the second section, we have examined <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> themselves, first giving an overview of each text studied, and then providing a thematic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> within each group as a whole, observing topics that are commonly treated among them, within the broader categories of dictionary content, lexicographic context, and linguistic context. Over the course of the research, we have established that though each text is unique, certain features are shared not only among <b>the</b> <b>prefaces</b> within one same category, but in fact across all three types of dictionary...|$|R

5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E

He contributed extensively to Parker's A Testimonie of Antiquitie Shewing the Auncient Fayth in the Church of England, the earliest printed book containing portions in Old English. Joscelyn also contributed {{a large part of}} Parker's De Antiquitate Britannicae, published in 1572.|$|E

It is possible that she worked at Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire. She is critical of cookery books written by men who conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.|$|E

The prologue, dedication, and preface were probably composed during January or February 1728, with the dedication and preface most likely composed between the last nights of the show, 20 and 21 February, and its publication, 23 February.|$|E
5|$|A carving {{at the top}} of the stele portrays Hammurabi {{receiving}} the laws from Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice, and <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> states that Hammurabi was chosen by Shamash to bring the laws to them. Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two. Fragments of previous law codes have been found. However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is 'directly, primarily, and throughout' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{also had}} correspondents who {{supplied}} him with material. Albinus, the abbot {{of the monastery}} in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and {{with the assistance of}} Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great's correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission. Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> to the Historia Ecclesiastica; he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, for information {{about the history of the}} church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad.
