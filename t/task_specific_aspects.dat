40|$|Human eye {{fixations}} often {{correlate with}} locations of salient {{objects in the}} scene. However, {{only a handful of}} approaches have attempted to simultaneously address the related aspects of eye fixations and object saliency. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of predicting eye fixations and segmenting salient objects in a unified framework. We design the initial network layers, shared between both the tasks, such that they capture the object level semantics and the global contextual aspects of saliency, while the deeper layers of the network address <b>task</b> <b>specific</b> <b>aspects.</b> In addition, our network captures saliency at multiple scales via inception-style convolution blocks. Our network shows a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art for both eye fixation prediction and salient object segmentation across a number of challenging datasets...|$|E

In this paper, {{it is argued}} that by adopting a nature-inspired chemical computing model, a mobile cloud resource management model can be evolved to {{serve as the basis for}} novel service modelling and social computing in mobile clouds. To support the argument, a chemistry inspired computation model, Chemistry for Context Awareness (C 2 A), is extended with Higher Order Chemical Language (HOCL) and High Level Petri-net Graph (HLPNG) formalisms. A scenario and simulation-based evaluation of the proposed model, focusing on two applications dynamic service composition and social communities identification, is also presented in this paper. The formal encoding of C 2 A validates its assumptions, enabling formal execution and analysis of context-based interactions that are derived using C 2 A principles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, {{biological}} event extraction {{has emerged}} as a key natural language processing task, aiming to address the information overload problem in accessing the molecular biology literature. The BioNLP shared task competitions have contributed to this recent interest considerably. The first competition (BioNLP' 09) focused on extracting biological events from Medline abstracts from a narrow domain, while the theme of the latest competition (BioNLP-ST' 11) was generalization and a wider range of text types, event types, and subject domains were considered. We view event extraction as a building block in larger discourse interpretation and propose a two-phase, linguistically-grounded, rule-based methodology. In the first phase, a general, underspecified semantic interpretation is composed from syntactic dependency relations in a bottom-up manner. The notion of embedding underpins this phase and it is informed by a trigger dictionary and argument identification rules. Coreference resolution is also performed at this step, allowing extraction of inter-sentential relations. The second phase is concerned with constraining the resulting semantic interpretation by shared task specifications. We evaluated our general methodology on core biological event extraction and speculation/negation tasks in three main tracks of BioNLP-ST' 11 (GENIA, EPI, and ID). Results We achieved competitive results in GENIA and ID tracks, while our results in the EPI track leave room for improvement. One notable feature of our system is that its performance across abstracts and articles bodies is stable. Coreference resolution results in minor improvement in system performance. Due to our interest in discourse-level elements, such as speculation/negation and coreference, we provide a more detailed analysis of our system performance in these subtasks. Conclusions The results demonstrate the viability of a robust, linguistically-oriented methodology, which clearly distinguishes general semantic interpretation from shared <b>task</b> <b>specific</b> <b>aspects,</b> for biological event extraction. Our error analysis pinpoints some shortcomings, which we plan to address in future work within our incremental system development methodology. </p...|$|E

40|$|Children’s early {{mathematics}} {{learning and}} development {{have become a}} topic of increasing interest {{over the past decade}} since early mathematical knowledge and skills {{have been shown to be}} a strong predictor of later mathematics performance. Understanding how children develop mathematical knowledge and skills and how they can be supported in their early learning could thus prove to be a vital component in promoting learning of more formal mathematics. In light of the above, with this thesis I sought to contribute to an increased understanding of children’s early mathematics learning and development by examining effects of playing different number games on children’s number knowledge and skills, and by investigating children’s representations of numbers on number line tasks. Two number game intervention studies were performed, and effects of three different number game conditions (linear number, circular number and nonlinear number) were investigated by examining 5 - and 6 -year-old children’s pre- and posttest performance on different numerical tasks. The findings indicate that playing number games in general support children’s development of number knowledge and skills, where the specific learning outcomes are affected differently depending on the type of number game utilized. To elucidate children’s representations of numbers, their performance on two different  umber line tasks have been analyzed using a latent class modeling approach. The results reveal that there is a heterogeneity in 5 - and 6 -year-old children’s number line estimations and subgroups of children showing different estimation patterns were distinguished. In addition, it is shown that children’s number line estimations can be associated to their number knowledge as well as to <b>task</b> <b>specific</b> <b>aspects.</b> The findings presented in this thesis contribute to the discussion of the value of selecting game activities in a conscious way to support children’s early mathematics learning and development. They also add to the discussion regarding the number line task and how children’s number line estimations can be analyzed and interpreted...|$|E
40|$|Psychopathy is {{a complex}} {{developmental}} personality disorder, which is associated with higher risks of offending, recidivism, and poor treatment responsivity. Recent neurocognitive explanations have linked psychopathy to dysfunction in the frontostriatal circuit linking the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), {{which is responsible for}} the reciprocal modulation of emotion and cognition. Disruptions in this circuit could therefore alter the ability to learn from punishment and reward, impacting on decision making. The overall goal of the studies presented in my thesis was to assess the relationships between decision making and psychopathy. Due to the multidimensional nature of psychopathy, in addition to examining overall psychopathy, we also assessed underlying psychopathy characteristics. We assessed relationships between decision making and psychopathy in a sample of prisoners (n= 60) and community members (n= 20). Psychopathic traits were characterised using the Psychopathic Personality Inventory – Revised (PPI-R) and the Psychopathic Check List: Screening Version (PCL:SV). Decision making was assessed using the Moral Judgement Task (MJT), The Regret Task, and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Participant’s choices on the IGT were additionally analysed using the Prospect Valence Learning (PVL) model to extract the specific cognitive processes relating to their decisions. We found that higher scores on psychopathy measures were associated with endorsement of more harmful social actions on the MJT, but not with general deficits in experience of regret or deficits in decision making on the IGT. In each decision making <b>task,</b> <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> of psychopathy related differentially to performances, suggesting that psychopathic traits could differentially relate to decision making processes. Thus, the key finding of our studies was that there is specificity between psychopathy traits and the various elements and types of decision making we studied. Such relationships were found across three different decision making tasks, supporting the validity of trait-specific and decision task specific relationships. A key outcome of our findings is the need for further development of robust tools that can accurately capture and quantify psychopathy traits in both prison and community samples. Further investigation into the relationship between decision making and psychopathic traits with more robust measures will lead to further uncovering the cognitive underpinnings of this complex disorder. In turn, this information will provide essential evidence for developing treatments that are more specifically targeted at the underlying cognitive and motivational processes at play in psychopathy...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, we have {{millions}} of cameras {{in public places}} such as traffic junctions, railway stations etc., and capturing video data round the clock. This humongous data has resulted in an increased need for automation of visual surveillance. Analysis of crowd and traffic flows {{is an important step}} towards achieving this goal. In this work, we present our algorithms for identifying and segmenting dominant ows in surveillance scenarios. In the second part, we present our work aiming at predicting the visual saliency. The ability of humans to discriminate and selectively pay attention to few regions in the scene over the others is a key attentional mechanism. Here, we present our algorithms for predicting human eye fixations and segmenting salient objects in the scene. (i) Flow Analysis in Surveillance Videos: We propose algorithms for segmenting flows of static and dynamic nature in surveillance videos in an unsupervised manner. In static flows scenarios, we assume the motion patterns to be consistent over the entire duration of video and analyze them in the compressed domain using H. 264 motion vectors. Our approach is based on modeling the motion vector field as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) and obtaining oriented motion segments which are merged to obtain the final flow segments. This approach in compressed domain is shown to be both accurate and computationally efficient. In the case of dynamic flow videos (e. g. flows at a traffic junction), we propose a method for segmenting the individual object flows over long durations. This long-term flow segmentation is achieved in the framework of CRF using local color and motion features. We propose a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based distance measure between flow segments for clustering them and generate representative dominant ow models. Using these dominant flow models, we perform path prediction for the vehicles entering the camera's field-of-view and detect anomalous motions. (ii) Visual Saliency Prediction using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: We propose a deep fully convolutional neural network (CNN) - DeepFix, for accurately predicting eye fixations in the form of saliency maps. Unlike classical works which characterize the saliency map using various hand-crafted features, our model automatically learns features in a hierarchical fashion and predicts saliency map in an end-to-end manner. DeepFix is designed to capture visual semantics at multiple scales while taking global context into account. Generally, fully convolutional nets are spatially invariant which prevents them from modeling location dependent patterns (e. g. centre-bias). Our network overcomes this limitation by incorporating a novel Location Biased Convolutional layer. We experimentally show that our network outperforms other recent approaches by a significant margin. In general, human eye fixations correlate with locations of salient objects in the scene. However, only a handful of approaches have attempted to simultaneously address these related aspects of eye fixations and object saliency. In our work, we also propose a deep convolutional network capable of simultaneously predicting eye fixations and segmenting salient objects in a unified framework.

40|$|Assessment of the {{overarching}} self-regulatory mechanisms, or executive functions, in any age group is challenging, {{in part due}} to the complexity of this domain, {{in part due to}} their dynamic essence, and in part due to the inextricable links between these central processes and the associated domain-specific processes, such as language, motor function, and attention, over which they preside. While much {{progress has been made in}} clinical assessment approaches for measuring executive functions in adults and to some extent in adolescents and school-aged children, the toolkit for the preschool evaluator remains sparse. The past decade, however, has seen a substantial increase in attention to executive functions in very young children from a developmental neuropsychological perspective. With this has come a necessity for better, more specific, and more internally valid performance measures, many of which are now described in the experimental literature. Few such tasks, however, have adequately demonstrated psychometric properties for clinical application. We present two performance tasks designed to tap selective aspects of executive function in preschoolers that are emerging from the experimental laboratory and hold promise of appropriate reliability and validity for the clinical laboratory. Performance tests alone, however, are insufficient to develop a comprehensive picture of a child 2 ̆ 7 s executive functioning. Thus, we present a rating scale of preschoolers 2 ̆ 7 executive function in the everyday context, and advocate a model of executive function assessment that incorporates both controlled performance <b>tasks</b> that target <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> of executive function and parent/teacher ratings that target more global aspects of self-regulation in the everyday context...|$|R

The present study (N = 76) investigated the relationship between measures of performance in five different tasks that have been shown to reflect 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 attentional malfunctioning 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 in such subject samples. In addition, the study attempted to replicate previous findings of impaired performance in subjects who scored high on measures of psychosis proneness. All subjects participated in five different experimental tasks (reaction time cross-over, negative priming, latent inhibition of rule learning, latent inhibition of Pavlovian conditioning, blink reflex modulation) and completed a set of questionnaires that provided 10 different measures of psychosis proneness. The expected experimental effects were obtained in four of the five experiments. There was no evidence of negative priming. Differences in task performance between high and low scorers were evident in latent inhibition of Pavlovian conditioning, but not in the other four tasks. The measures of task performance derived from the experiments seemed to be independent of one another. A multiple regression analysis that investigated the extent to which task performance can predict psychosis proneness yielded only marginal effects. The present data seem to indicate that the different experimental <b>tasks</b> reflect different, <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> of information processing that should not be subsumed under a broad label such as 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 attentional functioning/malfunctioning 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7...|$|R
