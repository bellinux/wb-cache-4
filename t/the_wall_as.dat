5|$|In 1994, Shlomo Goren {{wrote that}} the {{tradition}} of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>as</b> a Jewish prayer site was only 300 years old, the Jews being compelled to pray there after being forbidden to assemble on the mount itself.|$|E
5|$|Some Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against {{inserting}} {{fingers into}} the cracks of <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>as</b> {{they believe that the}} breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the episode was mostly positive, with critics citing the Night's Watch scenes at <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>as</b> highlights, as well as Michelle Fairley's performance as Catelyn Stark in the final scene of the episode with Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 2.5 million in its initial broadcast.|$|E

Mike Hardin had previously said that everything in the Ocean Beach location is provided by customers. Other decor at Hodad's Too includes skateboards and surfboards on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>as</b> well as a surfboard table. Its style has been described as beach-like and biker-chic.|$|E
5|$|Jon and Tyrion see the Wall for {{the first}} time as they arrive with Benjen and the other recruits. En route to the Wall, Tyrion and Jon discuss the Night's Watch. Tyrion is quick to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> (<b>as</b> it was in history), {{pointing}} out that now it is more a dumping ground for the unwanted of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>As</b> such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
50|$|The Timoleague Harvest Festival is {{held every}} year in August. See www.timoleague.ie/festival for details. This attracts well known acts (in 2006 {{included}} Mundy, <b>The</b> <b>Walls)</b> <b>as</b> well as events in the village.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{fragments}} of carved knotwork masonry on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> {{well as a}} Sheela na Gig carving of a male figure high on <b>the</b> East <b>wall.</b> [...] This figure is believed to date from Saxon or early Norman times.|$|R
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>as</b> a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

25|$|Lord Darnley had an {{interview}} in 1921 with Montague Grover, a well-known Australian journalist, {{at his home in}} Cobham Hall. Grover says that the urn was kept in Darnley’s den where all his other treasured cricket memorabilia were placed. He had numerous photos of the other team players on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>as</b> well as a leather-bound copy of the original account of the 1882-83 cricket tour of Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Local {{officials}} {{decided to}} raze <b>the</b> remaining <b>walls</b> to <b>the</b> incomplete arena in October 2009. Local residents called <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> an eyesore and mockingly referred to <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> [...] "Stonehenge". Instead of exploding <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and creating more rubble and cleanup, <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were eventually lowered {{to the ground}} by C&M Road Builders and Southeast Site Development.|$|R
30|$|In medium {{seismic hazard}} zones, {{designing}} <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> ductile <b>walls</b> required <b>the</b> least material quantities for low-rise buildings. Designing <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> ductile ones {{resulted in a}} saving of 33 % in the material cost compared to the conventional construction, and 17 % compared to the moderately ductile design. However, for medium- and high-rise buildings, the moderately ductile design led to the least material quantities due to the higher wind loads that governed the design in these cases. It {{should be noted that}} conventional construction is not permitted by NBCC (2010) for RC shear wall buildings higher than 40  m located in medium seismic hazard zones.|$|R

25|$|Transport of ions in the {{electrolyte}} can {{be adjusted}} by tuning the pH value in a dilute ionic solution, or by introducing an external electrical potential to change the surface charge density of <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>As</b> an analogy to semiconductor devices, the mechanism to control charge carrier transport in electronic devices {{was established in the}} area of nanofluidics. In nanofluidics, the active control of ion transport is realized using nano-scale channels or pores.|$|E
25|$|These {{troubles}} {{may have}} influenced Hadrian's plan to construct <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>as</b> well as his construction of limites {{in other areas of}} the Empire, but to what extent is unknown. Scholars disagree over how much of a threat the inhabitants of northern Britain really presented and whether there was any economic advantage in defending and garrisoning a fixed line of defences like the Wall, rather than conquering and annexing what has become the Scottish Lowlands and defending the territory with a loose arrangement of forts.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, 16 August {{after an}} {{inflammatory}} sermon, a demonstration {{organized by the}} Supreme Muslim Council marched to the Wall. The Acting High Commissioner summoned Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and informed {{him that he had}} never heard of such a demonstration being held at the Wailing Wall, {{and that it would be}} a terrible shock to the Jews who regarded <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>as</b> a place of special sanctity to them. At the Wall, the crowd burnt prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication left in the Wall's cracks, and the beadle was injured. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town.|$|E

25|$|The three {{houses in}} the The Louis G. Redstone Residential District are {{situated}} in a contiguous row on Appoline Street. All three are two-story, structures of reclaimed red brick, built in the International Style. The houses feature curved walls, low hip roofs, and steel casement and glass block windows. Each house has an attached single-car garage. The houses are tightly spaced, with a uniform setback, and the common backyard is enclosed with a red brick perimeter wall with no intermediate dividing walls. Benches and cantilevered stone shelves are incorporated Into <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>as</b> is a large outdoor grille and cooking stove. In {{the center of the}} backyard is a small concrete wading pool featuring two stylized snail sculptures, one {{at each end of the}} pool.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{after some}} years of lobbying, the National Park Service and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund won {{permission}} from Congress to build The Education Center at The Wall. This , two-story museum, located belowground {{just west of}} the Maya Lin-designed memorial, highlights the history of the Vietnam War and the multiple design competitions and artworks which make up the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Vietnam Women's Memorial, and the Memorial Plaque. The center will also provide biographical details on and photographs of many of the 58,000 names listed on <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>as</b> well as the more than 6,600 servicemembers killed since 2001 fighting the War on Terror. The $115-million museum will be jointly operated by the Park Service and the Fund. Groundbreaking for the project occurred in November 2012, with the center expected to open in 2020.|$|E
25|$|The front crawl swimmer uses a {{tumble turn}} (also {{known as a}} flip turn) to reverse {{directions}} in minimal time. The swimmer swims close to <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>as</b> quickly as possible. In the swimming position with one arm forward and one arm to the back, the swimmer does not recover one arm, but rather uses the pull/push of the other arm to initialize a somersault with the knees straight to the body. At {{the end of the}} somersault the feet are at the wall, and the swimmer is on his or her back with the hands over the head. The swimmer then pushes off the wall while turning sideways to lie on the breast. After a brief gliding phase, the swimmer starts with either a flutter kick or a butterfly kick before surfacing no more than 15 m from the wall.|$|E
50|$|A further {{complication}} is mixing. In general, more NO {{will form}} {{in the center and}} less near <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> are cooler than the center. Thus, more ammonia must find its way to the center and less near <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> otherwise NO in the center meets insufficient ammonia for reduction and excess ammonia near <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> slips through.|$|R

25|$|Throughout history, {{access to}} the Western Wall has been limited by the {{controlling}} political power of the time. Under the British Mandate, Jews {{were not allowed to}} bring chairs to the Kotel, nor could they put up a mechitza in order to separate between men and women and conduct traditional services. After the Kotel's capture from the Kingdom of Jordan in the Six Day War of 1967, part of the southern area next to the Kotel was cleared of abandoned Arab homes that had all but hid the place, and traditional worship was restored. Women of the Wall have been criticized as unwitting allies in ignoring the destruction of these homes and in supporting <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>as</b> a symbol of Israeli nationalism. Most of the Western wall runs the length of East Jerusalem, with the Temple Mount to the east and dwellings to the west.|$|E
25|$|Al-Husseini's {{vigorous}} {{efforts to}} transform the Haram into a symbol of pan-Arabic and Palestinian nationalism were intended to rally Arab support against the postwar influx of Jewish immigrants. In his campaigning, al-Husseini often accused Jews of planning to take possession of the Western Wall of Jerusalem, which belonged to the waqf of Abu Madyan as an inalienable property, and rebuild the Temple over the Al-Aqsa Mosque. He took certain statements, for example, by the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Palestine, Abraham Isaac Kook regarding the eventual return in time of the Temple Mount back to Jewish hands, and turned them to a concrete political plot to seize control of the area. Al-Husseini's intensive work to refurbish the shrine as a cynosure for the Muslim world, and Jewish endeavours to improve their access to, and establish a ritually appropriate ambiance on the plaza by the Western Wall, led to increased conflict between the two communities, each seeing the site only from their own traditional perspective and interests. Zionist narratives pinpointed al-Husseini's works on, and publicity about, the site and threats to it, as attempts to restore his own family's waning prestige. Arab narratives read the heightened agitation of certain Jewish groups over <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>as</b> an attempt to revive diaspora interest in Zionism after some years of relative decline, depression and emigration. Each attempt to make minor alterations to the status quo, still governed by Ottoman law, was bitterly protested before the British authorities by the Muslim authorities. If Muslims could cite an Ottoman regulation of 1912 specifically forbidding objects like seating to be introduced, the Jews could cite testimonies {{to the fact that}} before 1914 certain exceptions had been made to improve their access and use of the Wall. The decade witnessed several such episodes of strong friction, and the simmering tensions came to a head in late 1928, only to erupt, after a brief respite, into an explosion of violence a year later.|$|E
