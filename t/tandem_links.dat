40|$|Protein kinase PKR is an interferon-induced {{enzyme that}} {{plays a key}} role in the control of viral infections and {{cellular}} homeostasis. Compared with other known kinases, PKR is activated by a distinct mechanism that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding in its N-terminal region in an RNA sequence-independent fashion. We report here the solution structure of the 20 kDa dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of human PKR, which provides the first three-dimensional insight into the mechanism of its dsRNA-mediated activation. The structure of dsRBD exhibits a dumb-bell shape comprising two <b>tandem</b> <b>linked</b> dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) both with an alpha-beta-beta-beta-alpha fold. The structure, combined with previous mutational and biochemical data, reveals a highly conserved RNA-binding site on each dsRBM and suggests a novel mode of protein-RNA recognition. The central linker is highly flexible, which may enable the two dsRBMs to wrap around the RNA duplex for cooperative and high-affinity binding, leading to the overall change of PKR conformation and its activation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany efforts aim at {{solving the}} serious {{problems}} encountered with immunotherapy against scorpion envenoming. The most attractive approach consists in generating single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) as their pharmaco-kinetic properties should match closely {{those of the}} scorpion toxins. Although high affinity scFv reagents have been generated in the past, their production level, stability, and toxin neutralizing capacity remain disappointingly poor. In the current study, we identified one Nanobody (Nb), a single-domain antigen-binding fragment of a dromedary Heavy-chain antibody (HCAb) that recognizes specifically the Androctonus australis hector AahI' toxin. This Nb has excellent production, stability and solubility characteristics. With this Nb we further manufactured a <b>tandem</b> <b>linked</b> bivalent construct and assembled a HCAb with improved antigen binding due to avidity effects. All these constructs were shown in mouse models to possess a scorpion toxin neutralization capacity that exceeds by far all previous attempts with scFv-based materials, even when used at lower doses. It is therefore clear that {{in the near future}} Nanobodies will be at the core of novel serotherapeutics as they combine multiple benefits over other reagents to treat scorpion envenomed patients.

40|$|Several {{groups of}} fishes, {{including}} salmonids and catastomids, {{appear to have}} originated through genome duplication events. However, these two groups retain approximately 50 % of the loci examined as functioning duplicates, despite the passage of 50 million years or more of mutation and selection. Although other effects are not excluded, this apparently slow rate of duplicate silencing can be {{explained in terms of}} the effects of selection against defective double homozygotes to unlinked duplicates. We have derived a computer simulation of genetic drift that affords direct evaluation of the effects of population size (N), mutation rate (micron), initial allele frequencies, back mutation, fitness, and time on the probability of fixation for null alleles at unlinked duplicate loci. The results show that this probability is approximately linearly related to population size for N {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (3). Specifically, for naive populations, the time for 50 % probability of gene silencing is approximately equal to 15 N + micron- 3 / 4 generations. The retention of 50 % of the loci as functional duplicates may therefore result from the large effective size of salmonid and catastomid populations. The results also show that, under most conditions for populations of 2000 [...] 3000 or larger, unlinked duplicate loci will be sustained in the functional state longer than <b>tandem</b> (<b>linked)</b> duplicates and hence are available for evolution of new functions for a longer time...|$|R

40|$|Shaker-related Kv 1 {{channels}} contain four channel-forming α subunits. Subfamily member Kv 1. 1 often occurs oligomerized with Kv 1. 2 α subunits in synaptic membranes, and so {{information was}} sought on {{the influence of}} their positions within tetramers on the channels’ properties. Kv 1. 1 and 1. 2 α genes were <b>tandem</b> <b>linked</b> in various arrangements, followed by expression as single-chain proteins in mammalian cells. As some concatenations reported previously seemed not to reliably position Kv 1 subunits in their assemblies, the identity of expressed channels was methodically evaluated. Surface protein, isolated by biotinylation of intact transiently transfected HEK- 293 cells, gave Kv 1. 1 / 1. 2 reactivity on immunoblots with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to full-length concatenated tetramers. There was no evidence of protein degradation, indicating that concatemers were delivered intact to the plasmalemma. Constructs with like genes adjacent (Kv 1. 1 - 1. 1 - 1. 2 - 1. 2 or Kv 1. 2 - 1. 2 - 1. 1 - 1. 1) yielded delayed-rectifying, voltage-dependent K+ currents with activation parameters and inactivation kinetics slightly different from the diagonally positioned genes (Kv 1. 1 - 1. 2 - 1. 1 - 1. 2 or 1. 2 – 1. 1 - 1. 2 - 1. 1). Pore-blocking petidergic toxins, α dendrotoxin, agitoxin- 1, tityustoxin-Kα, and kaliotoxin, were unable to distinguish between the adjacent and diagonal concatamers. Unprecedentedly, external application of the pore-blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) differentially inhibited the adjacent versus diagonal subunit arrangements, with diagonal constructs having enhanced susceptibility. Concatenation did not directly alter the sensitivities of homomeric Kv 1. 1 or 1. 2 channels to TEA or the toxins. TEA inhibition of currents generated by channels made up from dimers (Kv 1. 1 - 1. 2 and/or Kv 1. 2 - 1. 1) was similar to the adjacently arranged constructs. These collective findings indicate that assembly of α subunits can be directed by this optimized concatenation, and that subunit arrangement in heteromeric Kv channels affects TEA affinity...|$|R

The {{present study was to}} evaluate the effect of silencing of RhoA and RhoC expression by RNAi on growth of human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in tumor-bearing nude mice in vivo. Methods To establish HCT 116 cell transplantable model, the nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 1. 0 × 10 7 HCT 116 cells and kept growing till the tumor xenografts reached 5 - 7 mm in diameter. Then the mice were randomly assigned to three groups(seven mice in each group) : (1) normal saline(NS) group, (2) replication-defective recombinant adenovirus carrying the negative control shRNA (Ad-HK) group and (3) replication-defective recombinant adenovirus carrying the 4 -tandem linked RhoA and RhoC shRNAs (Ad-RhoA-RhoC) group. Ad-HK (4 × 10 8 pfu, 30 ul/mouse), Ad-RhoA-RhoC (4 × 10 8 pfu, 30 ul/mouse) or PBS (30 ul/mouse) was injected intratumorally four times once every other day. The weight and volumes of tumor xenografts were recorded. The levels of RhoA and RhoC mRNA transcripts and proteins in tumor xenografts were detected by reverse quantitative transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining respectively. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect the death of cells. Results The xenografts in mice could be seen at 5 th day from the implantation of HCT 116 cells and all had reached 5 - 7 mm in size at 9 th day. After injection intratumorally, the growth speed of tumor xenografts in Ad-RhoA-RhoC group was significantly delayed compared with those in NS and Ad-HK group(P RhoA and RhoC reduced more in Ad-RhoA-RhoC group than those in NS and Ad-HK group. The relative RhoA and RhoC mRNA transcripts were decreased to 48 % and 43 % respectively (P RhoA and RhoC expression in Ad-RhoA-RhoC group.

A multi-domain GH family 3 β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Rhizomucor miehei (RmNag), exhibiting a potential N-acetyltransferase region, has been recently reported to show great potential in industrial applications. In this study, the crystal structure of RmNag was determined at 2. 80 [*]Å resolution. The three-dimensional structure of RmNag showed four distinctive domains, which belong to two distinguishable functional regions — a GH family 3 β-N-acetylglucosaminidase region (N-terminal) and a N-acetyltransferase region (C-terminal). From structural and functional analysis, the C-terminal region of RmNag was identified as a unique <b>tandem</b> array <b>linking</b> general control non-derepressible 5 (GCN 5) -related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT), which displayed glucosamine N-acetyltransferase activity. Structural analysis of this glucosamine N-acetyltransferase region revealed that a unique glucosamine binding pocket is located in the pantetheine arm binding terminal region of the conserved CoA binding pocket, which is different from all known GNAT members. This is the first structural report of a glucosamine N-acetyltransferase, which provides novel structural information about substrate specificity of GNATs.

Efficient recombination required also relaxosome accessory protein TrwA even after deletion of TrwA binding sites at oriT, {{suggesting that the}} effect of TrwA is mediated by protein-protein interactions. TrwC relaxase domain was necessary but not sufficient to catalyse recombination efficiently. Full recombinase activity was obtained with the N-terminal 600 residues of TrwC. The minimal target sequences required for recombination were different at each of the two involved oriTs: oriT 1 could be reduced to the nic site and TrwC binding site, while oriT 2 required an extended sequence including a set of iterons that are not required for conjugation. TrwC-mediated integration of a transferred DNA into a resident oriT copy required a complete oriT in the recipient. We observed dramatic changes in the efficiency of recombination between <b>tandem</b> oriTs <b>linked</b> to the direction of plasmid replication and transcription through oriT 1. We propose that recombination is triggered by the generation of a single-stranded DNA at oriT 1 that causes TrwC nicking.

First, <b>tandem</b> dimers of <b>linked</b> subunits were used to constrain the order of CNGB 3 and CNGA 3 subunits; the properties of channels formed by B 3 /B 3 +A 3 /A 3 dimers, or A 3 /B 3 +B 3 /A 3 dimers, closely resembled those of channels arising from B 3 +A 3 monomers. Functional markers in B 3 /B 3 (or A 3 /A 3) dimers confirmed that both B 3 subunits (and both A 3 subunits) gained membership into the pore-forming tetramer and that like subunits were positioned adjacent to each other. Second, chemical crosslinking and co-immunoprecipitation studies using epitope-tagged monomer subunits both demonstrated the presence of two CNGB 3 subunits in cone channels.

Pressing the lever associated with the sample-lever tandem schedule produced a food pellet. Pressing the other produced a blackout. The difference between terminal-link reinforced interresponse times varied across 10 -trial blocks within a session. Conditional-discrimination accuracy increased with the size of the temporal difference between terminal-link reinforced interresponse times. In Experiment 2, one tandem schedule was replaced by a random ratio, while the comparison schedule was either a tandem schedule that only reinforced long interresponse times or a random-interval schedule.

Methods: In the present study, genetic linkage analysis via 4 short <b>tandem</b> repeat markers <b>linked</b> to SLC 26 A 4 was performed for two consanguineous families originating from Hormozgan and Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari provinces of Iran, co-segregating autosomal recessive hearing loss and showed no GJB 2 mutations in our preliminary investigation. For identification of mutations, DNA sequencing of SLC 26 A 4 including all the 21 exons, exon-intron boundaries and the promoter was carried out. Results: The results showed linkage to this gene in both families. After sequencing, two novel SLC 26 A 4 mutations (c. 65 - 66 insT in exon 2 and c. 2106 delG in exon 19) were revealed in the two studied families.

In search of the control mechanism(s) whereby AP- 2 can mediate cell cycle regulation of the histone H 3. 2 promoter, we found that AP- 2 can physically interact with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein in vitro, and when over-expressed, can also associate with Rb in vivo. Importantly, in contrast to the majority of Rb binding proteins, the C-terminal domain of Rb alone is sufficient for its interaction with AP- 2. Using a reporter gene system <b>linking</b> <b>tandem</b> copies of the H 3 core to a heterologous minimal promoter, we demonstrated that over-expression of AP- 2 proteins results in transactivation of the reporter gene through the H 3 core in a sequence-specific but orientation-independent manner. Additionally, this stimulative effect was suppressed by co-expression of Rb. Thus, AP- 2, through its physical and functional interaction with Rb, may contribute to the cell cycle regulation of its target genes...|$|R
40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} whose etiology {{is poorly}} understood. Recent {{studies have shown}} that autistic children may be experiencing increased inflammation and oxidative stress. Altered immune regulation may be one contributing factor to inflammation and oxidative stress in autistic children. Sulfur amino acid (SAA) metabolism plays a critical role in regulating blood leukocyte functions and oxidative stress. However, it is not known whether autism impacts SAA metabolism in peripheral immune cells. To address this question, a novel liquid chromatography <b>linked</b> <b>tandem</b> mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) method was used to determine the levels of SAA metabolites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 11 healthy controls and 31 autistic children. Improved detection sensitivity and selectivity of the LC/MS/MS method allowed accurate quantification using small samples. Results show that leukocytes from autistic children contained significantly lower concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine (- 35 %; p = 0. 01), and elevated levels of intracellular homocysteine content (+ 80 %; p= 0. 003). Additionally, the levels of intracellular total cysteine and glutathione (GSH) were reduced by 39 % (p= 0. 004) and 25 % (p= 0. 01), respectively. These autism-associated changes were leukocyte specific in that no significant alterations in SAA metabolite concentrations were detected in the plasma samples. Our results provide novel evidence for altered metabolism in immune cells; furthermore, this data suggest the involvement of inflammation in autism. Dietary differences between controls and patients, however, remain a potential confounder...|$|R
40|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor (ER) is a ligand-activated {{transcription factor}} that regulates gene expression. The classical mechanisms of nuclear ER action include ligand-induced dimerization of ER which binds estrogen responsive elements (EREs) in promoters of target genes. In addition, non-genomic pathways of ER action {{have also been}} identified in breast cancer cells. Cdc 25 A is a tyrosine phosphatase that catalyzes dephosphorylation of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes to regulate G 1 - to S-phase cell cycle progression. Cdc 25 A mRNA levels are induced by 17 ?-estradiol (E 2) in ZR- 75 breast cancer cells, and deletion analysis of the Cdc 25 A promoter identified the - 151 to - 12 region as the minimal E 2 -responsive sequence. Subsequent mutation/deletion analysis showed that at least three different cis-elements were involved in activation of Cdc 25 A by E 2, namely, GC-rich Sp 1 binding sites, CCAAT motifs, and E 2 F sites. Studies with inhibitors and dominant negative expression plasmids show that E 2 activates Cdc 25 A expression through activation of genomic ER?/Sp 1 and E 2 F 1 and cAMP-dependent activation of NF-YA. Thus, both genomic and non-genomic pathways of estrogen action are involved in induction of Cdc 25 A in breast cancer cells. The PIAS family was initially identified as cytokine-induced inhibitors of STATs which contain several conserved domains involved in binding to other nuclear coactivators. In this study we have investigated coactivation of ER? by PIAS 3 in breast cancer cell lines transiently cotransfected with the pERE 3 constructs which contain three <b>tandem</b> EREs <b>linked</b> to a luciferase reporter gene. PIAS 3 coactivated ER?-mediated transactivation in cells cotransfected with pERE 3 and wild-type ER?. In contrast to many other coactivators, PIAS 3 also enhanced transactivation of ER? when cells were cotransfected with the TAF 1 ER? mutant. In addition, PIAS 3 does not interact with activation function 2 (AF 2) domain of ER? in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. These data indicate that coactivation of ER? by PIAS 3 was AF 2 -domain independent. Analysis of several PIAS 3 deletion mutants showed that the region containing amino acids 274 to 416 of PIAS 3 are required for coactivation suggesting that the RING finger domain and acidic region of PIAS 3 are important for interactions with wild-type ER?. These results demonstrate that PIAS 3 coactivated ER? and this represents a non-classical LXXLL-independent coactivation pathway...|$|R
40|$|Typing {{of human}} {{leukocyte}} antigens (HLA) on preimplantation embryos is legally allowed and ethically accepted in Belgium. The 'Vrije Universiteit Brussel' (VUB) has {{five years of}} experience with technical and clinical aspects of HLA typing on single cells. Setting up and running a programme for HLA typing is labour intensive, in particular when {{it has to be}} combined with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for distinct inherited genetic diseases, and time is always pressing because of the need for transplantation of the affected sibling. A general technique for HLA typing using short <b>tandem</b> repeats (STRs) <b>linked</b> to the HLA locus in multiplex PCR has been developed at our centre. At present, the overall clinical success rate is low: the ongoing pregnancy rate per oocyte retrieval cycle is 9. 8 %. This is not due to the technique because a conclusive HLA diagnosis can be assured in 91. 9 % of the embryos. The low success rate is correlated with a low transfer rate per cycle (35. 5 %). This is due to the genetic constitution of the embryos (in theory 1 / 4 for HLA, 1 / 8 for HLA in combination with sexing for X-linked recessive diseases and 3 / 16 for HLA in combination with autosomal recessive disorders) and clinical restrictions (in particular the reproductive age of the mother). The current ongoing pregnancy rate and implantation rate per transfer are acceptable (27. 2 % and 20. 8 % respectively). The results may be improved by selecting younger patients and by optimizing hormonal stimulation protocols and/or embryo culture systems. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the genomes {{of many of}} {{the most}} {{important}} human and animal pathogens have now been sequenced, our understanding of the actual proteins expressed by these genomes and how well they predict protein sequence and expression is still deficient. We have used three complementary approaches (two-dimensional electrophoresis, gel-liquid chromatography <b>linked</b> <b>tandem</b> mass spectrometry and MudPIT) to analyze the proteome of Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite of medical and veterinary significance, and have developed a public repository for these data within ToxoDB, making for the first time proteomics data an integral part of this key genome resource. RESULTS: The draft genome for Toxoplasma predicts around 8, 000 genes with varying degrees of confidence. Our data demonstrate how proteomics can inform these predictions and help discover new genes. We have identified nearly one-third (2, 252) of all the predicted proteins, with 2, 477 intron-spanning peptides providing supporting evidence for correct splice site annotation. Functional predictions for each protein and key pathways were determined from the proteome. Importantly, we show evidence for many proteins that match alternative gene models, or previously unpredicted genes. For example, approximately 15 % of peptides matched more convincingly to alternative gene models. We also compared our data with existing transcriptional data in which we highlight apparent discrepancies between gene transcription and protein expression. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the importance of protein data in expression profiling experiments and highlight the necessity of integrating proteomic with genomic data so that iterative refinements of both annotation and expression models are possible...|$|R
40|$|Hearing loss (HL) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} neurosensory impairment. HL is highly heterogeneous defect. This disorder affects 1 out of 500 newborns. This study aimed to determine the role of DFNB 2 locus and frequency of MYO 7 A gene mutations in a population from west of Iran. Methods: Thirty families investigated in Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences in 2014, genetic linkage analysis via four short <b>tandem</b> repeat markers <b>linked</b> to MYO 7 A was performed for two consanguineous families originating from Hamedan (family- 13) and Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari (family- 32) provinces of Iran, co-segregating autosomal recessive HL and showed no mutation in GJB 2 gene in our preliminary investigation. All 49 coding exons and exon- intron boundaries of the MYO 7 A gene were amplified by PCR and analyzed using direct DNA sequencing. Results: Two of families displayed linkage to DFNB 2. Family- 13 segregated a homozygous missense mutation (c. 6487 G>A) in exon 48 that results in a p. G 2163 S amino acid substitution in C-terminal domain of the myosin VIIA protein. While family- 32 segregated a homozygous nonsense mutation (c. 448 C>T) in exon five, resulting in a premature truncation at amino acid position 150 (p. Arg 150 X) in the motor domain of this protein. Conclusion: Mutation frequency of MYO 7 A gene in different populations of Iran as well as cause of HL in most cases are still unknown and more extensive studies have to be done. © 2017, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

40|$|Recessive {{mutations}} of SLC 26 A 4 (PDS) are {{a common}} cause of Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic deafness in western populations. Although south and east Asia contain nearly {{one half of the}} global population, the origins and frequencies of SLC 26 A 4 mutations in these regions are unknown. We PCR amplified and sequenced seven exons of SLC 26 A 4 to detect selected mutations in 274 deaf probands from Korea, China, and Mongolia. A total of nine different mutations of SLC 26 A 4 were detected among 15 (5. 5 %) of the 274 probands. Five mutations were novel and the other four had seldom, if ever, been identified outside east Asia. To identify mutations in south Asians, 212 Pakistani and 106 Indian families with three or more affected offspring of consanguineous matings were analysed for cosegregation of recessive deafness with short <b>tandem</b> repeat markers <b>linked</b> to SLC 26 A 4. All 21 SLC 26 A 4 exons were PCR amplified and sequenced in families segregating SLC 26 A 4 linked deafness. Eleven mutant alleles of SLC 26 A 4 were identified among 17 (5. 4 %) of the 318 families, and all 11 alleles were novel. SLC 26 A 4 linked haplotypes on chromosomes with recurrent mutations were consistent with founder effects. Our observation of a diverse allelic series unique to each ethnic group indicates that mutational events at SLC 26 A 4 are common and account for approximately 5 % of recessive deafness in south Asians and other populations...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-gated K {{channels}} assemble {{from four}} identical subunits symmetrically arranged around a central permeation pathway. Each subunit harbors a voltage-sensing domain. The sigmoidal {{nature of the}} activation kinetics suggests that multiple sensors need to undergo a conformational change before the channel can open. Following activation, individual K channels alternate stochastically between two main permeation states, open and closed. This binary character of single channel behavior suggests {{the presence of a}} structure in the permeation pathway that can exist in only two conformations. However, single channel analysis of drk 1 (K v 2. 1) K channels demonstrated the existence of four additional, intermediate conductance levels. These short-lived subconductance levels are visited when the channel gate moves between the closed and fully open state. We have proposed that these sublevels arise from transient heteromeric pore conformations, in which some, but not all, subunits are in the “open ” state. A minimal model based on this hypothesis relates specific subconductance states with the number of activated subunits (Chapman et al., 1997). To stringently test this hypothesis, we constructed a <b>tandem</b> dimer that <b>links</b> two K channel subunits with different activation thresholds. Activation of this dimer by strong depolarizations resulted in the characteristic binary open–close behavior. However, depolarizations to membrane potentials in between the activation thresholds of the two parents elicited highly unusual single channel gating, displaying frequent visits to two subconductance levels. The voltage dependence and kinetics of the small and large sublevels associate them with the activation of one and two subunits, respectively. The data therefore support the hypothesis that subconductance levels result from heteromeric pore conformations. In this model, both sensor movement and channel opening have a subunit basis and these processes are allosterically coupled...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects on ionic {{selectivity}} and gating of Kir 2. 1 of replacing Tyr (Y) in the GYG signature sequence with Phe (Y 145 F), Leu (Y 145 L), Met (Y 145 M), Ala (Y 145 A) or Val (Y 145 V). The mutant Y 145 F showed no changes in ionic selectivity (as indicated by the permeability coefficient ratios PNa/PK or PRb/PK), indicating that a hydrogen bond between Tyr and other residues is not essential for K+ selectivity. Y 145 L, Y 145 M, Y 145 A and Y 145 V did not express as monomers. None of the channels made from covalently <b>linked</b> <b>tandem</b> dimers with wild-type and mutant subunits (WT-mutant) had altered ionic selectivity (PNa/PK or PRb/PK), indicating that 4 -fold symmetry is not required. Macroscopic currents activated under hyperpolarization and the time constants for activation were reduced e-fold per 23 mV hyperpolarization in wild-type. This gating, believed {{to be due to}} the release of polyamines from the pore, was little affected by mutation of Y 145. There was similarly little effect on the relationship between chord conductance (gK) and membrane potential. Unitary conductance (140 mm[K+]o) was also little affected by mutation and was reduced only in channels formed from WT-Y 145 M, from 22. 7 ± 0. 4 pS (n= 5) in wild-type to 17. 1 ± 0. 5 pS (n= 4) in WT-Y 145 M. Steady-state recording of unitary currents showed that channel open times were affected by the residue that replaced Tyr in GYG. Channel openings were particularly brief in WT-Y 145 V, where the mean open time was reduced from 102 ms at − 120 mV in wild-type to 6 ms in WT-Y 145 V. Thus in Kir 2. 1, GFG can act as a K+ selectivity filter, as can G(L/M/A/V) G, at least in dimers also containing GYG. Channel open time duration depended on the residue at position 145, consistent with the H 5 region helping to determine the dwell time of the channel in the open state...|$|R
