25|$|In 1825 John Limbird was {{interested}} in founding a Mechanics' Newspaper with Robertson. The project was diverted by the intervention of John Gast's committee, becoming the Trades Newspaper of 1825 to 1827. Robertson was squared by being made editor, a decision unacceptable to Francis Place, who thought Robertson {{was not to be}} trusted, and wanted Edward Baines. In radical politics, Robertson and Hodgskin actually differed in their analysis. When Labour Defended, Hodgskin's landmark pamphlet, was reviewed in the Newspaper in 1825, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of dissent from Robertson on fixed capital. This attitude diminished the ground on which Hodgskin was innovative. On the other hand, his ideas were quickly spread through the paper. Place attacked Robertson in consequence, in the Artizan.|$|E
500|$|One offbeat {{feature of}} the {{magazine}} was the habit of including very short (less than a page) vignettes of fiction, usually but not always relating to the cover, without credit. These were most probably {{the work of the}} editor in many cases, though Frank Belknap Long wrote several of these for the inside front cover of the magazine. There was never a letter column, though in the very last issue <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> that one was planned for future issues. The book review column, always titled [...] "Universe in Books", appeared fairly regularly but was liable to be dropped if {{there was no room for}} it. It was originally signed [...] "The Editor", and was presumably written by Sam Merwin; Robert Frazier took the column on when Merwin left at the end of 1953. Santesson took over in October 1955 and wrote every column that appeared from that point on. After the first few issues, which contained editorial essays from both editor and publisher, the editorials disappeared, though Santesson did sometimes fill a blank space with a few editorial comments.|$|E
2500|$|Loos {{returned}} to California just as Griffith, {{who wanted to}} make longer films, was leaving Triangle, and she joined director and future husband John Emerson for a string of successful Douglas Fairbanks films. Loos and company realized that Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatics were an extension of his effervescent personality and parlayed his natural athletic ability into swashbuckling adventure roles. His Picture in the Papers (1916) was noted for its wry style of discursive and witty subtitles: [...] "My most popular subtitle introduced {{the name of a}} new character. The name was something like this: 'Count Xxerkzsxxv.' Then <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note,</b> 'To those of you who read titles aloud, you can't pronounce the Count's name. You can only think it.'" ...|$|E
