40|$|Summary. [...] The {{kinematics}} of an arresting-hook unit are {{studied in}} order to determine, {{within the limits of}} the assumption of a perfectly rigid hook unit, the damper force necessary to control hook bounce. The necessity for a smooth deck and the desirability of small <b>trail</b> <b>angle</b> for the hook unit are demonstrated from several aspects. The design requirements for a hook damper unit are discussed in all their functional aspects and methods are given for determining the up-swing motion of an arresting hook unit immediately following engagement of an arresting wire. The behaviour of arresting wires after being depressed by the passage of aircraft wheels is also outlined. 1. Introduction. Th...|$|E

40|$|Publisher's PDFBACKGROUND: Propulsive force {{generation}} {{is critical to}} walking speed. Trialing limb angle and ankle moment are major contributors to increases in propulsive force during gait. For able-bodied individuals, <b>trailing</b> limb <b>angle</b> contributes {{twice as much as}} ankle moment to increases in propulsive force during speed modulation. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the relative contribution of ankle moment and <b>trailing</b> limb <b>angle</b> to increases in propulsive force for individuals poststroke. METHODS: A biomechanical-based model previously developed for able-bodied individuals was evaluated and enhanced for individuals poststroke. Gait analysis was performed as subjects (N = 24) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and fast walking speeds on a treadmill. RESULTS: Both <b>trailing</b> limb <b>angle</b> and ankle moment increased during speed modulation. In the paretic limb, the contribution from <b>trailing</b> limb <b>angle</b> versus ankle moment to increases in propulsive force is 74 % and 17 %. In the non-paretic limb, the contribution from <b>trailing</b> limb <b>angle</b> versus ankle moment to increases in propulsive force is 67 % and 22 %. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals poststroke increase propulsive force mainly by changing <b>trailing</b> limb <b>angle</b> in both the paretic and non-paretic limbs. This strategy may contribute to the inefficiency in poststroke walking patterns. Future work is needed to examine whether these characteristics can be modified via intervention.

But how does a forager that has become {{displaced}} from a trail know {{which way to go}} on rejoining the trail? A laden forager, for example, should walk towards the nest.
