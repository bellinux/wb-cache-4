5|$|In 1882, Stainer {{was offered}} the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a {{position}} he took with great seriousness and which he occupied for six years. He worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. He advocated the use of musical notation and <b>tonic</b> <b>sol-fa</b> rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now treated with the greatest respect in musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition. The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio Mary Magdalen. This was followed in 1887 by The Crucifixion, the work {{for which he is}} most remembered.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{classical}} Western music, Carnatic {{music is}} notated {{almost exclusively in}} <b>tonic</b> <b>sol-fa</b> notation using either a Roman or Indic script to represent the solfa names. Past attempts to use the staff notation have mostly failed. Indian music makes use of hundreds of ragas, many more than the church modes in Western music. It becomes difficult to write Carnatic music using the staff notation {{without the use of}} too many accidentals. Furthermore, the staff notation requires that the song be played in a certain key. The notions of key and absolute pitch are deeply rooted in Western music, whereas the Carnatic notation does not specify the key and prefers to use scale degrees (relative pitch) to denote notes. The singer is free to choose the actual pitch of the tonic note. In the more precise forms of Carnatic notation, there are symbols placed above the notes indicating how the notes should be played or sung; however, informally this practice is not followed.|$|E
500|$|Parry {{was also}} {{involved}} in music-related publishing. [...] Beginning in 1861, he was a regular contributor of <b>Tonic</b> <b>sol-fa</b> material to the Welsh music journal, Y cerddor Cymreig. Parry's work with making <b>Tonic</b> <b>sol-fa</b> accessible allowed everyone {{with an interest in}} choral work to participate. He edited Cambrian Minstrelsie (A National Collection of Welsh Songs) in 1893. He also complied Dr Parry's Book of Songs, which was a collection of his own works, and wrote Elfenau Cerddoriaeth ("Elements of Music"), a Welsh handbook on theory, in 1888. In 1895, Parry entered into an agreement with an American music publishing firm, the John Church Company. The company published some of Parry's songs along with English translations of poems by Heinrich Heine. [...] The translations were done by poets of note, including James Thomson. Since it is doubtful that Parry was familiar with Heine's work, there is the possibility that Parry was commissioned by the company to write the songs during an extensive US trip he had made the year before.|$|E
2500|$|Welsh {{traditional}} music declined {{with the rise}} of Nonconformist religion in the 18th century, which emphasized choral singing over instruments, and religious over secular uses of music; {{traditional music}}al styles became associated with drunkenness and immorality. The development of hymn singing in Wales is closely tied with the Welsh Methodist revival of the late 18th century. The hymns were popularised by writers such as William Williams, while others were set to popular secular tunes or adopted Welsh ballad tunes. The appointment of Henry Mills as a musical overseer to the Welsh Methodist congregations in the 1780s saw a drive to improve singing throughout Wales. This saw the formation of local musical societies and {{in the first half of}} the 19th century Musical primers and collections of tunes were printed and distributed. Congregational singing was given further impetus with the arrival of the temperance movement, which saw the Temperance Choral Union (formed in 1854) organising annual singing festivals, these included hymn singing by combined choirs. The publication of Llyfr Tonau Cynulleidfaol by John Roberts in 1859 provided congregations with a body of standard tunes that were less complex with unadorned harmonies. This collection began the practice of combining together to sing tunes from the book laid the foundation for the Cymanfa Ganu (the hymn singing festival). Around the same period, the growing availability of music in the <b>tonic</b> <b>sol-fa</b> notation, promoted by the likes of Eleazar Roberts, allowed congregations to read music more fluently. One particularly popular hymn of this period was [...] "Llef".|$|E
60|$|So he went as often, but he {{was usually}} with Edgar. Only all the family, {{including}} the father, joined in charades and games at evening. And later, Miriam drew them together, and they read Macbeth out of penny books, taking parts. It was great excitement. Miriam was glad, and Mrs. Leivers was glad, and Mr. Leivers enjoyed it. Then they all learned songs together from <b>tonic</b> <b>sol-fa,</b> singing in a circle round the fire. But now Paul was very rarely alone with Miriam. She waited. When she and Edgar and he walked home together from chapel or from the literary society in Bestwood, she knew his talk, so passionate and so unorthodox nowadays, was for her. She did envy Edgar, however, his cycling with Paul, his Friday nights, his days working in the fields. For her Friday nights and her French lessons were gone. She was nearly always alone, walking, pondering in the wood, reading, studying, dreaming, waiting. And he wrote to her frequently.|$|E
6000|$|The chief {{element of}} the project {{consists}} in the substitution of a relative series of notes or symbols in place of an absolute series. In the common notation any given note, say the A of the treble clef, is uniformly represented by the same symbol, namely, the position of second space in the clef, whatever key it may belong to. Rousseau, insisting on the varying quality impressed on any tone of a given pitch by the key-note of the scale to which it belongs, protested against the same name being given to the tone, however the quality of it might vary. Thus Re or D, which is the second tone in the key of C, ought, according to him, {{to have a different}} name when found as the fifth in the key of G, and in every case the name should at once indicate the interval of a tone from its key-note. His mode of effecting this change is as follows. The names ut, re, and the rest, are kept for the fixed order of the tones, C, D, E, and the rest. The key of a piece is shown by prefixing one of these symbols, and this determines the absolute quality of the melody as to pitch. That settled, every tone is expressed by a number bearing a relation to the key-note. This tonic note is represented by one, the other six tones of the scale are expressed by the numbers from two to seven. In the popular <b>Tonic</b> <b>Sol-Fa</b> notation, which corresponds so closely to Rousseau's in principle, the key-note is always styled Do, and the other symbols, mi, la, and the rest, indicate at once the relative position of these tones in their particular key or scale. Here the old names were preserved as being easily sung; Rousseau selected numbers because he supposed that they best expressed the generation of the sounds.[328] ...|$|E

With his son, John Spencer Curwen (1847-1916) who later became principal of the <b>Tonic</b> <b>Sol-Fa</b> College, Curwen incorporated the J. Curwen & Sons publishing firm in 1863. This firm continued as the Curwen Press into the 1970s, when it was closed. The Sol-fa system was widely adopted for use in education, as an easily teachable method in the reading of music at sight, but its more ambitious aims for providing a superior method of musical notation have not been generally adopted. In 1872, Curwen changed his former course of using the Sol-fa system {{as an aid to}} sight reading, when that edition of his Standard Course of Lessons excluded the staff and relied solely on Curwen's <b>Tonic</b> <b>Sol-fa</b> system.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Florida, Orange County, New York. (William H. Seward was his second cousin.)

[...] He first became interested in the <b>tonic</b> <b>sol-fa</b> system during a visit to England in 1869, and on his return worked to introduce the method without adopting the notation. He then took charge of the performances of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, wrote down more than one hundred of their plantation melodies, and, while making the tour of Europe with them, in 1875-1876. became more impressed with the advantages of the new system of musical instruction. After a course of study at the <b>Tonic</b> <b>sol-fa</b> college in London, he returned to the United States in 1877, to establish the system. Besides writing on the subject for many religious and educational journals, and lecturing before gatherings of teachers, he has edited the [...] "Tonic Sol-Fa Advocate" [...] and the [...] "Musical Reform," [...] taught the system in classes and public schools, and prepared a series of textbooks. He was the founder of the American <b>tonic</b> <b>sol-fa</b> Association, and of the American vocal music association. He died in East Orange, New Jersey.|$|E
