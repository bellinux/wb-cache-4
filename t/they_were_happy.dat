5|$|Bournemouth is {{a tourist}} and {{regional}} centre for leisure, entertainment, culture and recreation. Local author and former mayor, Keith Rawlings, suggests that Bournemouth has a thriving youth culture {{due to its}} large university population and many language school students. In recent years, Bournemouth has become a popular nightlife destination with UK visitors and many clubs, bars and restaurants are located within the town centre. In a 2007 survey by First Direct, Bournemouth {{was found to be}} the happiest place in the UK, with 82% of people questioned saying <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> with their lives.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{possibility}} arose of his father's record of 257hits {{in a season}} being surpassed by Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. Living in Dallas, Texas at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season. Both had mixed feelings about the record chase; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> that George Sisler's name was being talked about and that people were re-discovering him as a player, but both were hoping that, if the record was not broken in 154games, {{there would be an}} asterisk noting that it took Ichiro more games to achieve it. Ichiro finished the season with 262hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at Safeco Field. The younger Sisler was prevented by an emergency heart procedure from travelling to Seattle. Both remarked that the Mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation.|$|E
5|$|The Company {{suggested}} to the UK government {{that it might}} despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe {{to act as an}} all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the Western Front (in Belgium and France), but the War Office in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> to take the Southern Rhodesians, but only if they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company found itself in the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted. Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the British Army directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 were on their way.|$|E

TVS' aims were for a different line of programming in the early evening slots, to win back the 50,000 viewers they claimed were switching over to rivals, due to the poor service provided by Southern.|$|E

25|$|Nolan is {{also noted}} for his command and {{problems}} during the Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877. This was {{also known as}} the Staked Plains Horror and was a tragic series of events in the hot dry Llano Estacado region of north-west Texas and eastern New Mexico. This was during the 100 degree heat in July of a barren desert. Four soldiers and one buffalo hunter would die from the hot horror of the desert. The character and loyalty of the men involved would be severely tested as would their honor and duty. Some would be called heroes and others deserters, but most would state <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> just to have survived.|$|E
25|$|Twentieth-Century Fox brought Allen {{in for a}} rewrite {{when they}} were unhappy with the script that David Mamet had {{produced}} from Barry Reed's novel The Verdict, thinking he had deviated too much from the original material. She produced a script <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> with, but then handed it to Robert Redford, who began to tinker it to fit his persona. Eventually the producers took it away from Redford and offered it to Lumet, who had just seen a production of Mamet's, American Buffalo with Al Pacino, and preferred to use Mamet's original script. In the end the studio had paid both Allen and Redford and ended up with Mamet's original script anyway.|$|E

Costing NOK800,000, The upgrades included upgrades to the tower and establishment of a terminal building. Widerøe was in August 1986 awarded a concession to operate flights from Hamar to Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen Airport, Flesland, using de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The ministry simultaneously rejected a joint route application from Norsk Flytjeneste and Trønderfly. The route to Oslo and Bergen commenced on 12 November; after two months Widerøe stated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> with the patronage to Bergen, but no to Oslo. Due to low patronage, the last flights to Oslo and Trondheim were carried out on 27 November 1987. At the same time the airline increased their services to Bergen. However, Widerøe terminated the Bergen route on 17 June 1988, citing that they were not able to make money on the route.|$|E

25|$|On July 1, 2008, {{four more}} protesters left the grove, leaving three protesters {{still in the}} trees. At 11:00 pm three of the tree-sitters were seen on the ground, {{at which point the}} UCPD arrested one of them for {{trespassing}} and violating a court order, causing the other two to take refuge in a nearby tree. Assistant Police Chief Mitch Celaya talked to the two tree-sitters for a couple of hours, at which point they agreed to come down. One of the protesters who was talked down did so with the condition that they would be allowed to make a video statement. Another protester came down later in the day after indicating that she might have an undetermined medical condition that would require treatment. RunningWolf said that she collapsed three times once she was on the ground. RunningWolf blamed the conditions on the long exposure to the elements, lack of food and water, and lack of sleep due to the lights the police set up surrounding the grove and the noise from the generators needed to power them. The university said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> that their strategy to get the tree-sitters to leave the grove was working. RunningWolf said that the remaining protesters would remain in the trees until at least 2008-07-17, when Judge Miller was expected to make a final ruling.|$|E

About the move, Lester said, [...] "I spent too long treating college players nice and making sure <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy...</b> I don't have to do that now. I can coach here. If they want to quit, fine."In 1975, he led Paint Branch to the Class B state championship.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} April 2000 at Monnow Valley Studios in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales with co-producer Chris Shaw and engineer Eric Tew. The band moved to Bearsville Studios, New York {{before returning to}} Monnow Valley some months later where recording was completed in September 2000. Bearsville was chosen because of its drum and live rooms, which the band felt were desirable as they were using more microphones to capture audio for the surround sound mix included on the DVD version of the album than they would normally when simply recording in stereo. The group were mindful of the capabilities of surround sound and recorded sub-bass on tracks such as [...] " [...] Touch Sensitive" [...] and [...] "Juxtapozed with U", which could only be heard through a low-frequency subwoofer channel in the surround mix. The band recorded onto two-inch analogue tape until they had a take <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> with, then transferred the results to Pro Tools where individual songs were edited and overdubs were added. According to Keyboardist Cian Ciaran this meant the band could [...] "edit some beats very precisely ... like the gated kicks {{at the end of}} the track [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl"". Once <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> with a song the group then transferred it back to tape before mixing took place as they liked the [...] "tape sound".|$|E

The difficulties Bayliss experienced with the case, {{as well as the}} extremely personal approach he took in attempting to solve it, were inspired by the real-life Baltimore detective Tom Pellegrini, who was the primary detective in the Wallace case. Most of the detectives featured in the Homicide book said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> with their on-screen counterparts, although Detective Harry Edgerton, the inspiration for Frank Pembleton, objected to a scene in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] in which the character drinks milk in a bar, something Edgerton said he never does.|$|E
