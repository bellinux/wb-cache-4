25|$|A player may {{run with}} the ball, {{but it must be}} bounced or touched on the ground at least once every 15metres. Opposition players may bump or <b>tackle</b> <b>the</b> player to obtain the ball and, when <b>tackled,</b> <b>the</b> player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for holding the ball. The ball carrier may only be <b>tackled</b> between <b>the</b> {{shoulders}} and knees. If the opposition player forcefully contacts a player in the back while performing a <b>tackle,</b> <b>the</b> opposition player will be penalised for a push in the back. If <b>the</b> opposition <b>tackles</b> <b>the</b> player with possession below the knees (a low tackle or a trip) or above the shoulders (a high <b>tackle),</b> <b>the</b> team with possession of the football gets a free kick.|$|R

5|$|Saville {{was made}} {{lieutenant}} colonel on January 5, 1942. In <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> problem of air {{defense of the}} Panama Canal Zone, he brought together civilian mathematicians and military defense experts to organize the first operations research group in the Air Corps, following two such groups formed by the Navy. Saville was promoted to brigadier general on November 2.|$|E
5|$|Bo also {{oversaw the}} {{restructuring}} of the Ministry, formed from the amalgamation of the National Economics and Commerce Bureau and the Department of International Trade. Bo sought to balance {{the amount of attention}} given to foreign investors and domestic commercial institutions. He began <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> imbalance from the retail sector, whose success up to that point was largely dependent on foreign companies. He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries' competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by foreign competition.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try {{to regain control of}} the ball by intercepting a pass or through <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E

5|$|From Aquileia, Alboin {{took the}} Via Postumia and swept through Venetia, taking in rapid {{succession}} Tarvisium (Treviso), Vicentia (Vicenza), Verona, Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking Opitergium (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> main Venetian towns closer to the coast on the Via Annia, such as Altinum, Patavium (Padova), Mons Silicis (Monselice), Mantua and Cremona. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as Torcello and Heraclia.|$|E
5|$|Gates has {{credited}} {{the generosity}} and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller {{as a major}} influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby {{they are interested in}} <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.|$|E

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} line (OL) consists of several players whose primary {{function is to}} block members of the defensive line from <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> ball carrier on running plays or sacking the quarterback on passing plays. The leader of the {{offensive line}} is the center (C), {{who is responsible for}} snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking, and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play. On either side of the center are the guards (G), while tackles (T) line up outside the guards.|$|E
5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> {{perception of}} the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, {{as he was concerned}} the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Tottenham's Pat van den Hauwe was cautioned by Holbrook for getting tangled with Arsenal's David Rocastle, in spite Rocastle {{indicating}} that the player used an elbow– a bookable offence. Moments after, Rocastle was shown a yellow card for attempting to get his own back on Van Den Hauwe, by <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> player without intent. Van Den Hauwe was later booked for a wild challenge on Lee Dixon. Arsenal dominated possession during the second half, with Tottenham infrequently troubling their opponent's defence and relying on counterattacks to fashion goal-scoring chances. Smith had a chance saved in the 75th minute by goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, when the ball was back-passed across the penalty area by Steve Sedgley. In the final seconds of the match substitute Andrew Cole, who had replaced Campbell, shot from 20 yards and into the side-netting.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 England {{first used}} a skin-tight strip. This was {{intended}} {{to make it more}} difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when <b>tackling.</b> <b>The</b> home and away strips for 2007 were unveiled on 15 May that year. The materials used are superior, offering improved performance to the 2003 kit. However, a sweeping red mark on the base-white front which forms St George's Cross on the top left, and a changed away-strip (dark blue to red), have received criticism because it is felt that emphasis has been placed on St George's Cross at the expense of the traditional red rose. The new strip was introduced in England's home game against Wales on 4 August, while the alternative strip was first used against France on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{explored}} what {{he could}} of the western workings, before he {{and some of the}} survivors began <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> fire. The water pipes from the surface in the Lancaster shaft were all fractured, and hand-extinguishers were used. Shaw returned to the surface at 9:30am to arrange for rescue and fire-fighting teams from neighbouring collieries. From 11:00am the specialist mines rescue teams began arriving at the colliery from the Rhymney and Rhondda Valleys, as did Red Cross workers and local ambulance services; a police detachment was sent from Cardiff in a special train. Members of the Inspectorate of Mines were quickly on the scene, and an inspector descended to view the mine the same morning.|$|E

5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty of {{challenges}} and little expansive football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. It took a while before Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was {{on the receiving end of}} a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted to shield the ball and hold on to possession. Television replays showed Van Nistelrooy ran his studs down Cole's shins, but the striker was not punished by Riley despite the action being in full view of his assistant at the touchline.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and <b>tackling</b> <b>the</b> largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E
