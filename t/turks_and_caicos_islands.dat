5|$|The British Crown {{possesses}} {{a number of}} overseas territories in the Americas, for whom Queen Elizabeth II is monarch. In North America are Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands,</b> while the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are located in South America. The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction {{of a number of}} European monarchs, mostly English, Dutch, or Spanish, throughout {{the first half of the}} 17th century. By 1681, however, when the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands</b> were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: the Governor of Anguilla, Andrew George; the Governor of Bermuda, Richard Gozney; the Governor of the British Virgin Islands, David Pearey; the Governor of the Cayman Islands, Stuart Jack; the Governor of Montserrat, Elizabeth Carriere; and the Governor of the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands,</b> Peter Beckingham.|$|E

At 2100UTC on August20, a hurricane watch was issued for Sint Maarten, Saba, and Sint Eustatius, {{while there was}} a tropical storm watch for Antigua, Barbuda, and Anguilla. Early on August21, the hurricane watch was expanded to include the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Additionally, the tropical storm watch was extended out to the British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Martin. A hurricane warning was issued for Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands late on August21. In Dominica, both a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch were reported, while a tropical storm watch was put into effect in Dominican Republic. At 0300UTC on August22, a hurricane watch was issued for Haiti north of Port-au-Prince as was a tropical storm warning in Dominican Republic from Palenque to Cabrera. An hour later, a tropical storm watch was put into effect for the southeastern Bahamas and <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands.</b> By 0900UTC on August22, Dominican Republic's entire north coast was under a hurricane warning.

50|$|Blair Maynard, a {{divorced}} journalist in New York City, decides {{to write a}} story about the unexplained disappearance of yachts and other small boats in the Caribbean, hoping to debunk theories about the Bermuda Triangle. He has weekend custody of his preteen son Justin, and decides to mix a vacation with work, taking his son along. They fly from Miami to the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>island</b> chain but, while on fishing trip, are captured by a band of pirates. The pirates have, amazingly, remained undetected since the establishment of their pirate enclave by Jean-David Nau, the notorious buccaneer L'Olonnais, in 1671 (in reality, however, L'Olonnais is known to have died four years earlier). The pirates have a constitution of sorts, called the Covenant, and have a cruel but workable society. They raise any children they capture to ensure the survival of the colony, but kill anyone over the age of thirteen. In short order, Justin is virtually brainwashed and groomed to lead the pirate band, much to Maynard's horror. Maynard tries repeatedly to escape, and finally attracts the attention of the passing United States Coast Guard cutter New Hope. The pirates attack and capture it, but Maynard is able to use a machine gun aboard to kill most of the pirates and to win Justin's and his own freedom.|$|R
5|$|As Tropical Storm Emily quickly {{approached}} the Windward Islands on September21, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Grenada, Barbados, St. Vincent and St. Lucia. A tropical storm watch was also declared for Martinique. As the storm tracked through the islands, all watches and warnings were discontinued later that day. Early on September22, a hurricane warning was issued for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic and southern Haiti, including the southwestern peninsula. Upon attaining major hurricane status, a hurricane warning was declared for northern Haiti as the storm was anticipated to maintain hurricane intensity through landfall. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the southeastern Bahamas and the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands.</b> This watch was later upgraded to a warning as the storm was expected to regain intensity over the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, a {{tropical}} storm watch was posted for the islands of Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba and St. Eustatius, though it was discontinued the next day. Shortly thereafter, {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. Tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches were put into effect for the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands</b> and the southeastern Bahamas. By August 24, those tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued, {{and at the same}} time they were issued for parts of the Southeast United States.

On August 27, tropical cyclone watches and warnings extended as far north as Plymouth, Massachusetts; all were discontinued early on August 29.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, {{while it}} was over Hispaniola, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{forecast}} that predicted Jeanne to make landfall near Savannah, Georgia in about five days. However, the forecast noted uncertainty {{in regards to the}} steering currents, which depended on the movement of the remnants of Hurricane Ivan and a ridge building behind it. After it left the nation as a tropical depression, the original center of circulation tracked westward away from the convection and dissipated. However, a new circulation developed closer to the convection, and Jeanne regained tropical storm status on September 18. By then, the mid-level circulation associated with Hurricane Ivan had combined with a trough to weaken the ridge located across the western Atlantic Ocean; this caused Jeanne to track northward through the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E

5|$|On September 22, a {{tropical}} storm was located about 200mi (330km) east of Guadeloupe. With a steady west-northwest path, the storm moved across the northern Lesser Antilles on September 23, during which it intensified into a hurricane. It passed a short distance north of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic as it reached its peak intensity of 90mph (150km). Late on September 26 the hurricane turned northwestward, bringing it through the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands</b> and eastern Bahamas. Recurving north-northeastward, the cyclone moved into open waters, and was last classified as {{a tropical}} cyclone on September 30 about 390mi (630km) east of Cape Hatteras.

5|$|The 1945 Homestead {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} intense tropical cyclone to strike the U.S. state of Florida since 1935. The ninth tropical storm, third hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season, it developed east-northeast of the Leeward Islands on September12. Moving briskly west-northwestward, the storm became a major hurricane on September13. The system moved over the <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands</b> the following day and then Andros on September15. Later that day, the storm peaked as a Category4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 130mph (215km/h). Late on September15, the hurricane made landfall on Key Largo and then in southern Miami-Dade County, and across Homestead, FL where much damage was done and winds were clocked at Homestead Army Air Corps Base at 145mph.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved through}} the West Indies between November3 and November4. The wave reached the vicinity of <b>Turks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands</b> on November 5, where it developed into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC. The storm moved north-northwestward and then westward across the southern Bahamas. A ridge aloft blocked the storm's westward progress and caused it to re-curve west-southwestward on November 6. The system strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Around 1800 UTC on November 6, the storm made landfall on Cayo Romano in Camagüey Province with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The system quickly weakened while crossing the mountainous terrain of Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early on November 7, shortly before emerging into the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the storm re-intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and continued on a southwestward path.|$|E

40|$|In {{the year}} 1900, Galveston, Texas, was a bustling {{community}} of approximately 40, 000 people. The former {{capital of the}} Republic of Texas remained a trade center for the state {{and was one of}} the largest cotton ports in the United States. On September 8 of that year, however, a powerful hurricane struck Galveston island, tearing the Weather Bureau wind gauge away as the winds exceeded 100 mph and bringing a storm surge that flooded the entire city. The worst natural disaster in United States history even today the hurricane caused the deaths of between 6000 and 8000 people. Critical in the events that led to such a terrible loss of life was the lack of precise knowledge of the strength of the storm before it hit. In 2008, Hurricane Ike, the third costliest hurricane ever to hit the United States coast, traveled through the Gulf of Mexico. Ike was gigantic, and the devastation in its path included the <b>Turk</b> <b>and</b> <b>Caicos</b> <b>Islands,</b> Haiti, <b>and</b> huge swaths of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Once again, Galveston, now a city of nearly 60, 000, took the direct hit as Ike came ashore. Almost 200 people in the Caribbean and the United States lost their lives; a tragedy to be sure, but far less deadly than the 1900 storm. This time, people were prepared, having received excellent warning from the GOES satellite network. The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites have been a continuous monitor of the world's weather since 1975, and they have since been joined by other Earth-observing satellites. This weather surveillance to which so many now owe their lives is possible in part because of the ability to point accurately and steadily at the Earth below. The importance of accurately pointing spacecraft to our daily lives is pervasive, yet somehow escapes the notice of most people. But the example of the lives saved from Hurricane Ike as compared to the 1900 storm is something no one should ignore. In this section, we will summarize the processes and technologies used in designing and operating spacecraft pointing (i. e. attitude) systems...|$|R
