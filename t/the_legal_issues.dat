The book is written with a first-person perspective: the reader learns of the author's morning ritual, {{the fact that}} his cat is named Francie and that he married a woman he met through a Bulletin Board System. Godwin's motivation was to keep the Internet safe from government actions that restrict freedom of speech. He asserts that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution should apply equally to the Internet as it does to other media.|$|E

Other questions concern overlap between geothermal and mineral or petroleum tenements. Broader issues concern the extent to which the legal framework for encouragement of renewable energy assists in encouraging geothermal industry innovation and development.|$|E

50|$|Although {{similar in}} tone to <b>the</b> {{articles}} in <b>legal</b> encyclopedias, ALR annotations {{are different in}} that they are not organized alphabetically, and they tend to delve more deeply into a specific legal principle or doctrine, while, in contrast, encyclopedia articles aim for a broader view of <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issue.</b> In addition, ALR articles are careful to provide cases on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issue</b> and provide listings of cases according to their jurisdiction.|$|R
5|$|When {{producer}} Kevin McClory {{had first}} planned {{the film in}} 1964 he held initial talks with Richard Burton for the part of Bond, although the project came to nothing because of <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues</b> involved. When the Warhead project was launched in the late 1970s, a number of actors were mentioned in the trade press, including Orson Welles for the part of Blofeld, Trevor Howard to play M and Richard Attenborough as director.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} McClory again {{started working on}} a project to bring a Thunderball {{adaptation}} to production and, with the working title Warhead (a.k.a. James Bond of the Secret Service) he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery {{to work on a}} script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred. Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but then producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues</b> that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues</b> of Burger King {{include several}} legal {{disputes}} and lawsuits involving the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) as both plaintiff and defendant {{in the years}} since its founding in 1954. These have involved almost every aspect of the company's operations. Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents, the company's responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences. The company's response to these various issues has drawn praise, scorn, and accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years.|$|E

Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten Diamonds Are Forever, to work on the script; however, Mankiewicz declined as he felt he was under a moral obligation to Cubby Broccoli. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997 E/R Partners {{settled with}} Aetna, {{receiving}} around $300 million. After <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues</b> were settled E/R Partners announced the building would be dismantled. With {{the announcement of}} the demolition the city dropped its lawsuit against the owners. Unable to implode the building because of the building density of the area, E/R Partners began an eighteen-month, $23 million process to dismantle the building. Early in the process, which began in 1998, the owners hoped someone would buy the property as is or with the damaged portion of the structure removed, but that hope was soon abandoned. The process was finished in 1999. At the time of the demolition it was the third tallest habitable building ever razed and is currently the seventh, ranking after the World Trade Center's twin towers, the Singer Building, and the original Seven World Trade Center in New York, the Morrison Hotel in Chicago, and 130 Liberty Street in New York.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} so easy. It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as by the time the bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues</b> meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

40|$|When {{they feel}} the need to {{distinguish}} genuine science, the real thing, from pretenders, or to understand what is distinctive about the scientific method, U. S. courts have sometimes called on Karl Popper’s conception of falsifiability as the hallmark of the genuinely scientific, and his account of the method of science as conjecture and refutation. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issue</b> before <b>the</b> courts is the interpretation of the Establishment Clause in application to biology teaching in public high schools, and the question is whether “creation science” is really science, or only religion in disguise. Much more often, though, <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issue</b> is one of evidence law, and the question is whether this or that scientific expert testimony is reliable enough to be admissible.
