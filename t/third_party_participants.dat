We examined whether cooperation differs when decisions are made for a third party compared with ourselves and specified which motives are important for third-party cooperation. Participants played multiple rounds of a public goods game (PGG). In Study 1, we varied personal involvement from high to low; participants played for themselves (Self), for themselves and a third party (Shared), and solely for a third party (<b>Third</b> <b>Party).</b> <b>Participants</b> contributed most when personal involvement was lowest (i. e., Third Party) and least when personal involvement was high (i. e., Self). Study 2 explored if social motives underlie third-party cooperation by comparing cooperation with social (human) and non-social (computer) group members.

40|$|Human altruistic {{behaviors}} are heterogeneous across both contexts and people, whereas the neural signatures underlying the heterogeneity {{remain to be}} elucidated. To address this issue, we examined the neural signatures underlying the context- and person-dependent altruistic punishment, conjoining event-related fMRI with both task-based and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Acting as an impartial <b>third</b> <b>party,</b> <b>participants</b> decided how to punish norm violators either alone or {{in the presence of}} putative others. We found that the presence of others decreased altruistic punishment due to diffusion of responsibility. Those behavioral effects paralleled altered neural responses in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and putamen. Further, we identified modulation of responsibility diffusion on task-based functional connectivity of dACC with the brain regions implicated in reward processing (i. e., posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala/orbital frontal cortex). Finally, the RSFC results revealed that (i) increased intrinsic connectivity strengths of the putamen with temporoparietal junction and dorsolateral PFC were associated with attenuated responsibility diffusion in altruistic punishment and (ii) increased putamen-dorsomedial PFC connectivity strengths were associated with reduced responsibility diffusion in self-reported responsibility. Taken together, our findings elucidate the context- and person-dependent altruistic behaviors as well as associated neural substrates and thus provide a potential neurocognitive mechanism of heterogeneous human altruistic behaviors.

40|$|A {{critically}} {{important component of}} most signal processing procedures is that of computing the distance between signals. In multi-party processing applications where these signals belong to different parties, this introduces privacy challenges. The signals may themselves be private, and {{the parties to the}} computation may not be willing to expose them. Solutions proposed to the problem in the literature generally invoke homomorphic encryption schemes, secure multi-party computation, or other cryptographic methods which introduce significant computational complexity into the proceedings, often to the point of making more complex computations requiring repeated computations unfeasible. Other solutions invoke <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> making unrealistic assumptions about their trustworthiness. In this paper we propose an alternate approach, also based on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> computation, but without assuming as much trust in the <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> Individual <b>participants</b> to the computation "secure" their data through a proposed secure hashing scheme with shared keys, prior to sharing it with the <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> The hashing ensures that the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> cannot recover any information about the individual signals or their statistics, either from analysis of individual computations or their long-term aggregate patterns.

40|$|The Smart Grid {{incorporates}} advanced {{information and}} communication technologies (ICTs) in power systems, and is characterized by high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs). Whether it is the nation-wide power grid or a single residential building, the energy management involves different types of resources that often depend on and influence each other. The concept of virtual power plant (VPP) has been proposed to represent the aggregation of energy resources in the electricity market, and distributed decision-making (DDM) plays a vital role in VPP due to its complex nature. This paper proposes a framework for managing different resource types of relevance to energy management for decentralized VPP. The framework views VPP as a hierarchical structure and abstracts energy consumption/generation as contractual resources, i. e., contractual offerings to curtail load/supply energy, from <b>third</b> <b>party</b> VPP <b>participants</b> for DDM.

Such a deliberative approach is an integral part of most planning procedures in developed countries.

Previous features are also specific to Serbia, as a transitional state, which, nevertheless, experienced a somewhat different social context in comparison to other Eastern Bloc countries during the second half of the previous century.

40|$|In urban sensing applications, {{participants}} carry mobile {{devices that}} collect sensor readings annotated with spatiotemporal information. However, such annotations put the participants' privacy at stake, {{as they can}} reveal their whereabouts and habits to the urban sensing campaign administrators. A solution to protect the participants' privacy is to apply the concept of k-anonymity. In this approach, the reported participants' locations are modified such that at least k- 1 other participants appear to share the same location, and hence become indistinguishable from each other. In existing implementations of k-anonymity, the participants need to reveal their precise locations to either a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> or other <b>participants</b> {{in order to find}} k- 1 other participants. As a result, the participants' location privacy may still be endangered in case of ill-intentioned third-party administrators and/or participants.

40|$|This article {{systematically}} {{examines the}} varying effectiveness of African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> in mediating civil wars in Africa. Drawing {{on data from}} the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, supplemented with unique data on mediation efforts, which together cover all mediation efforts in civil wars in Africa between 1960 and 2012, this article presents quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of African <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Compared to non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{are far more likely}} to conclude peace agreements and these peace agreements are more likely to be durable.

40|$|How is two-party electoral {{competition}} {{influenced by}} <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> even under normal political conditions? I {{argue that the}} mere threat of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry into the election induces anticipatory electoral strategies by the major parties. This effect, which is a normal aspect of the two-party system, is how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. elections. The ability for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to influence the major parties is moderated by electoral institutions. The ballot access requirement, {{in the form of}} a signature requirement, varies widely across House elections and is a significant predictor of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> electoral success. Consistent with conventional wisdom, I find that it has a negative effect on the likelihood of entry. Notably, the requirement also has a positive effect on <b>third</b> <b>party</b> vote shares, conditional on successful petitioning, due to a screening and quality effect. I explore the effects of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat in unidimensional and multidimensional settings. A formal model of elections predicts that the threat of entry induces major party divergence in a unidimensional ideological space. The major parties diverge in anticipation of potential <b>third</b> <b>party</b> entry. An empirical analysis of candidate positioning in the 1996 U. S. House elections finds support of this hypothesis. Data on major party campaign advertising in the 2000 to 2004 U. S. House elections are used to assess <b>third</b> <b>party</b> effects in a multidimensional framework. I show that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat influences the scope and content of campaign advertising. Major party candidates, particularly incumbents, discuss a broader range of issues when <b>third</b> <b>party</b> threat is higher. I use the case of environmental issues and the Green party to assess the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on issue-specific content. I find that Green party threat leads to predictable differences between Democratic and Republican advertising on environmental issues. In sum, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> play a consistent role in U. S. House elections by inducing anticipatory strategies by the major parties. This strategic framework for understanding <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> stresses two things. First, one should focus on the major parties in order to gauge the influence of <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Second, one should not conclude that <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> are irrelevant because of their minimal electoral success. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> effects are in fact present even in elections where a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> does not enter.
