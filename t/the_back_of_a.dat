5|$|After {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album Give 'Em Enough Rope (1978), the band {{separated from their}} manager Bernard Rhodes. This separation meant that the group had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location to compose their music. Tour manager Johnny Green and drum roadie Baker had found the group a new place to rehearse called Vanilla Studios, which was located in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> garage in Pimlico.|$|E
5|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, {{multiple}} photographs of We Are Our Mountains were displayed during {{the presentation of}} voting results from Armenia; one was displayed on a video screen at Yerevan's Republic Square in the background, and another was displayed on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clipboard that the presenter Sirusho was reading results from. Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, enough to give the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed D-21 was an American {{reconnaissance}} drone with {{maximum speed}} {{in excess of}} Mach3.3 (2,215mph; 3,564km/h). The D-21 was initially designed to be launched from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> M-21 carrier aircraft, {{a variant of the}} Lockheed A-12 aircraft. Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, the drone was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace.|$|E

5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Italy, and directed by Tom Munro. It shows Madonna escaping the paparazzi on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convertible. She travels throughout {{the city and the}} Italian countryside, while picking up men from the roadside and having a party on the car. The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended the simplicity of the video and labeled it as Madonna's most fun video in years. The song was included on the setlist of The MDNA Tour where she performed it while playing a guitar.|$|E

5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, there are twelve ribs. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. Anapophyses, processes at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vertebra, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone).|$|E
5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tow truck.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set of rules that didn't prohibit them.|$|E

5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were {{well away from the}} building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E
5|$|Captivated by Hedren's Nordic looks, Hitchcock becomes {{infatuated}} with her. While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances {{to her in}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes through the back door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks the apparently shatterproof glass of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's face with splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. This takes a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E

5|$|Coming off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> victorious UEFA Euro 2000 {{campaign}} {{with the national}} team, Henry was ready {{to make an impact}} in the 2000–01 season. Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, {{by the fact that he}} had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.|$|E
5|$|Early {{discoveries of}} indricotheres were made through various colonial links to Asia. The first known indricothere fossils were {{collected}} from Balochistan (in modern-day Pakistan) in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary, but these fragments were unidentifiable at the time. The first fossils now recognised as Paraceratherium were discovered by the British geologist Guy Ellcock Pilgrim in Balochistan in 1907–1908. His material consisted of an upper jaw, lower teeth, and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jaw. The fossils were collected in the Chitarwata Formation of Dera Bugti, where Pilgrim had previously been exploring. In 1908, he used the fossils as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus Aceratherium; A. bugtiense. Aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon; it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros, {{many of which have}} since been moved to other genera. Fossil incisors that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the unrelated genus Bugtitherium were later shown to belong to the new species.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{good friend}} William Hart {{produced}} {{and wrote the}} seven-reel epic Wild Bill Hickok released by Paramount in 1923. It was the first movie to depict Wyatt Earp and the only movie that included his character before he died in 1929. Hart played Wild Bill Hickok and Bert Lindley played Earp. The role of Earp's character in the movie was very small. He appears at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crowd scene when Hickok meets some gentlemen on the city street. Bert Lindley is not listed on some descriptions of the movie and this portrayal of Earp is often overlooked. Alan Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends, overlooked this movie in his biography. Earp served as a technical adviser on the film.|$|E

Crash then enters the hut of tribe leader Papu Papu and is forced to defeat him in self-defense after inadvertently waking him from his nap. Riding on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wild hog, Crash escapes the pursuing villagers and climbs over the opposite fortress wall.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first {{appearance}} {{on the world stage}} at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s. Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> van when {{he was supposed to be}} preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.|$|E
5|$|He {{picked up}} an ankle injury seven minutes into a 2–1 home defeat to Salisbury City on 9 March 2010, and made his return in a 1–1 home draw with Tamworth on 27 March.

Following the match, {{he was hit by}} a coin with the York squad being forced to leave the ground through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stand after having missiles thrown at them by a section of Luton fans. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May, being substituted on 74 minutes, as York lost 3–1 to Oxford. He finished the season with 39 appearances and 3 goals for York.|$|E
