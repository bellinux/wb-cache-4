In May 2010, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) temporarily limited the Army's funding obligation towards the program while this assessment was completed. The CNA report, which contained the results of interviews with 19 out of 71 commanders supported by HTS, was completed in October 2010.

These studies {{had an impact on the}} handling of proprietary <b>technical</b> <b>information.</b> DuPont then developed, built, and implemented an integrated system for the storage, retrieval, and distribution of its in-house scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>information.</b> In addition to changes in the mechanical handling of information, changes were made in the way the content was described, for example, from classification systems to concept coordination. Many of the fundamental principles for storage and retrieval of <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> developed in the 1960 s, including representations of atom-bond-atom structure and a thesaurus, were adopted and are still in use. These innovations resulted in the Scientific Corporate Information Online (SCION) database created in the early 1990 s, which provides online access for DuPont’s scientific community to proprietary <b>technical</b> <b>information.</b> The next generation of the SCION database is under development and will take advantage of new computer and information science technologies.
