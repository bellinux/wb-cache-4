This mural inspired Tai to seek new techniques, at which time he was introduced <b>to</b> <b>stencil</b> art. Tai spent the following years focused on his stencil work. In 2005 he painted a tryptic painting of Miles Davis, Erykah Badu and Billie Holiday, listed the piece on eBay, and in a short time the painting sold. Although still considered lowbrow, Pop art had become very popular in the early 2000s, especially with the younger generation, and from 2005-2008 Tai used eBay to sell his paintings to collectors across the world.|$|E

Consider a two dimensional domain, sampled on a grid of N points.

We thus introduce a hierarchy of sub-cones of discrete convex functions, associated <b>to</b> <b>stencils</b> which can be adaptively, locally, and anisotropically refined.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{show how}} {{challenges}} in parallel and distributed {{systems can be}} overcome for specific applications, chosen from different application domains and with different characteristics. The first domain is high-performance computing, where we applied a dataflow-based programming model <b>to</b> <b>stencil</b> computations. The second domain is real-time embedded computing where we improved middleware support for dataflow models, focusing on optimizing schedules of applications on MPSoCs. The third domain is ubiquitous computing, where we apply dataflow-based modeling and optimization techniques, in order to deploy applications in ubiquitous environments. Our results show that programming stencil operations with dynamic task graphs reduces their synchronization overhead, resulting in an implementation that scales better than the state-of-the-art. For mapping and scheduling applications on MPSoCs, we observe that modeling the inter-dependencies that enable tighter coupling between {{different aspects of the}} system i. e. computation, communication and memory, improves the energy efficiency and/or performance of the system. The execution semantics of dataflow models {{play a key role in}} enabling this tightly-coupled scheduling. Use cases in the domain of ubiquitous computing demonstrate the usage of dataflow-based modeling and optimization techniques for the deployment and configuration of dynamic applications in highly heterogeneous and distributed systems. status: publishe...|$|E
