As a member of the then-unseen Syndicate, he was in a position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> great deal of information. Deep Throat felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep Throat provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was just not ready to know some truths.|$|E

25|$|However, {{many times}} there are methodological {{problems}} in these tests. Unconditional risk questions in cross-sectional studies are used consistently, leading to problems, as they {{ask about the}} likelihood of an action occurring, but does not determine {{if there is an}} outcome, or compare events that haven't happened to events that have. Concerning vaccines, perceptions of those who have not been vaccinated are compared to the perceptions of people who have been.

5000|$|Part of Kant's {{argument}} in the Introduction to the Critique of Pure Reason involves arguing {{that there is no}} problem figuring out how knowledge of analytic propositions is possible. <b>To</b> <b>know</b> <b>an</b> analytic proposition, Kant argued, one need not consult experience. Instead, one need merely to take the subject and [...] "extract from it, in accordance with the principle of contradiction, the required predicate" [...] (A7/B12). In analytic propositions, the predicate concept is contained in the subject concept. Thus, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>an</b> analytic proposition is true, one need merely examine the concept of the subject. If one finds the predicate contained in the subject, the judgment is true.|$|R

25|$|In 1986, Marlena {{takes in}} John Black as her patient; he has amnesia {{and she is}} {{determined}} to help him recover his past. John and Marlena {{spend a lot of}} time together, and the pair fall in love. However, John seems <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> lot about Stefano, leading Marlena to suspect he is Stefano. Later, Marlena finds a plastic surgeon's file containing before and after shots of both Roman and John. Marlena becomes convinced that John is Roman, and, over time, John took on the role of Roman. Marlena is later trying to talk down a suicidal jumper when she falls from a window ledge. Marlena lays in a coma, near death for a month. When she finally recovers, she and Roman renewed their vows on August 22, 1986. In his years with the ISA, Roman worked with a man named Orpheus. Roman accidentally killed Orpheus' wife while on assignment. To get back at Roman, Orpheus kidnaps Marlena and fakes her death. Roman shoots and kills Orpheus, but before he could rescue Marlena, she is presumed to have been killed in a plane crash.|$|E
25|$|Paifu and José {{decide to}} go to the house of a human rumored to be a murderer. Paifu notices what appears to be an orange spirit out in the sea and {{mistakes}} it for their friend. They arrive at the light source only to find that it was a torch on a raft belonging to the world-renowned sumo wrestler Maruyama, whom they feared. In spite of becoming acquainted, Maruyama teases Paifu and picks up two sticks producing a cross gesture to scare him off believing he, like some vampires in stories, fear a cross. On the contrary, this action forces Paifu to transform into a rampaging were-koala. His rage is halted by José, who shape-shifts into a round object to revert him back to normal. José tells Maruyama that Paifu can not look at a cross figure for more than three seconds before transforming. When asked by Maruyama about Paifu's father, Paifu replies that he was shot to death in a human city when he shape-shifted into a were-koala. After getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> little about Maruyama's past, it turns out that he is not as frightening as rumored to be.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E
