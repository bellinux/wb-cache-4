25|$|Mpemba {{paradox is}} that under certain conditions, hot water will freeze faster than cold water {{even though it}} must pass through the same {{temperature}} as the cold water during the freezing process. This is a seeming violation of Newton's law of cooling but in reality it is due to non-linear effects that influence the freezing process.

25|$|Releasing wild trout helps {{preserve}} {{the quality of}} a fishery. Trout are more delicate than most fish and require careful handling. When a trout has been caught but the hook is still embedded, wet your hands before handling the fish. Dry hands stick to the adhesive slime coating the fish and can pull off its scales. It is preferred for the fish to remain in the water when removing the hook, but holding the trout out of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>will</b> not be lethal, provided the hook is removed quickly and the trout is returned immediately.|$|E

25|$|A {{half mask}} is not {{directly}} connected to the scuba air supply. the only available source of air to displace {{the water in the}} case of a leak or flood is through the diver's nose. The procedure involves exhaling through the nose into the mask until the water has all been displaced by air. During this process, the air must be prevented from escaping at a high point, or <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>will</b> not be expelled. If the mask does not fit in such a way that this happens automatically, it must be sealed at the high point by the diver pressing it against the face.|$|E
25|$|The second {{technique}} for cryoconservation is vitrification or flash freezing. Vitrification is the transformation from a liquid to solid state without {{the formation of}} crystals. The process and mechanics of vitrification are similar to slow freezing, the difference lying in the concentration of the medium. The vitrification method applies a selected medium which has a higher concentration of solute so <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>will</b> leave the cells via osmosis. The medium is concentrated enough so all of the intracellular water will leave without the medium needing to be reconcentrated. The higher concentration of the medium in vitrification allows the germplasms to be frozen more rapidly than with slow freezing. Vitrification {{is considered to be}} the more effective technique of freezing germplasms.|$|E
25|$|Pectin is a {{polysaccharide}} within tomatoes {{that has}} the ability to bind to itself and to other molecules, especially water, around it. This enables it to create a gel-like matrix, dependent on the amount within the solution. Water is a large part of ketchup, due to it being 80% of the composition of distilled vinegar. In order for the water within the ketchup to be at the lowest possible energy state, all of the hydrogen bonds that are able to be made within the matrix must be made. The water bound to the polysaccharide moves more slowly within the matrix, which is unfavorable with respect to entropy. The increased order within the polysaccharide-water complex gives rise to a high-energy state, in which <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>will</b> want to be relieved. This concept implies that water will more favorably bind with itself because of the increased disorder between water molecules. This is partially the cause for water leaching out of solution when left undisturbed {{for a short period of}} time.|$|E

A second test involves adding one piece of food to deep fry and watching it sink somewhat and rise back up. Sinking without resurfacing indicates that the oil is too cold; not sinking at all indicates that the oil is too hot.|$|E
