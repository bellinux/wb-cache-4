50|$|Dedicated lines {{connected}} the <b>toll</b> <b>switchboard</b> to the Masterton police station, fire brigade, and the hospital, {{where they were}} connected to a special red telephone. The line connected to the fire station, when it rang, also sounded the station alarm bells. A similar arrangement was employed at the police station, while at the hospital the call went to the local switchboard where it was identified by a red light and a distinctive bell.|$|E
50|$|The 111 service {{began on}} 29 September 1958 {{in the two}} towns. When a {{subscriber}} dialled 111 at either exchange, the call was routed by the automatic exchange onto one of three dedicated lines to the <b>toll</b> <b>switchboard</b> at the Masterton exchange (although the exchange connected calls automatically, long-distance (toll) calls still had to be connected manually through an operator). A red light glowed on the switchboard panel, and another red light would glow {{on top of the}} switchboard. Two hooters also sounded, one in the exchange and the other in the building passage. The first operator to plug into the line took the call, and a supervisor would plug into the line to help if the situation became difficult.|$|E
