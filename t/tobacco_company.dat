5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company</b> had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company.</b> In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company.</b>|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} North Korean tobacco companies, making some 30 {{different}} types of cigarettes, with the biggest <b>tobacco</b> <b>company</b> being the North Korea General Tobacco Corporation. Some companies export tobacco to the Middle East and elsewhere, sometimes in partnership with foreign firms. For example, the Taedong River <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company</b> and the Rason Shinhung <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company,</b> both operating in the Rason Special Economic Zone, are partnered with the Chinese Jilin Tobacco. British American Tobacco also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons. During the Cold War, North Korea paid for goods it imported from the Soviet Union with poor quality tobacco. Later, {{during the years of}} the Sunshine Policy, high-end Pyongyang brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro-reunification stance. There are some privately owned tobacco factories, some of which are known to produce counterfeit brand cigarettes for export as part of North Korea's illicit activities to earn hard currency.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Little {{is known}} about how {{consumers}} perceive <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> in the United Kingdom. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey with those aged 16 years and over (N = 2253) explored perceptions of, and attitudes towards, <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies.</b> This included awareness of <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies,</b> views on <b>tobacco</b> companies’ practices (targeting the most vulnerable, encouraging smoking to replace those who quit or die, making cigarettes more addictive) and values (honesty, ethics, interest in harm reduction), perceptions of regulation of <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> (whether <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> have the same marketing rights as other companies, {{should be allowed to}} promote cigarettes, be required to sell cigarettes in plain packs, and pay for associated health costs), and locus of responsibility for health problems caused by tobacco use.

40|$|South Korea’s {{state health}} insurer, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), {{is in the}} process of a {{compensation}} suit against tobacco industry. The <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> have habitually endeavored to ensure favorable outcomes in litigation by misusing scientific evidence or recruiting scientists to support its interests. This study analyzed strategies that <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> have used during the NHIS litigation, which has been receiving world-wide attention. To understand the litigation strategies of <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies,</b> the present study reviewed the existing literature and carried out content analysis of petitions, preparatory documents, and supporting evidence submitted to the court by the NHIS and the <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> during the suit. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> misrepresented the World Health Organization (WHO) report’s argument and misused scientific evidence, and removed the word “deadly” from the title of the citation. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> submitted the research results of scientists who had worked as a consultant for the tobacco industry as evidence. Such litigation strategies employed by the <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> internationally were applied similarly in Korean lawsuits. Results of tobacco litigation have a huge influence on tobacco control policies. For desirable outcomes of the suits, healthcare professionals need to pay a great deal of attention to the enormous volume of written opinions and supporting evidence that <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> submit. They also need to face the fact that the companies engage in recruitment of scientists. Healthcare professionals should refuse to partner with tobacco industry, as recommended by Article 5. 3 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control...|$|R
5|$|Augustus Owsley Stanley I (May 21, 1867 – August 12, 1958) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Kentucky. A Democrat, {{he served as}} the 38th Governor of Kentucky and also represented the state in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented Kentucky's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} progressive reformer. Beginning in 1904, he called for an antitrust investigation of the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company,</b> claiming they were a monopsony that drove down prices for the tobacco farmers of his district. As a result of his investigation, the Supreme Court of the United States broke up the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company</b> in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an antitrust investigation of U.S. Steel, which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E

50|$|The {{positions}} of major <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> {{on the issue}} of second-hand smoke is somewhat varied. In general, <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> have continued to focus on questioning the methodology of studies showing that second-hand smoke is harmful. Some (such as British American Tobacco and Philip Morris) acknowledge the medical consensus that second-hand smoke carries health risks, while others continue to assert that the evidence is inconclusive. Several <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> advocate the creation of smoke-free areas within public buildings as an alternative to comprehensive smoke-free laws.|$|R

5|$|While {{proud to}} be the first French World Champion, Prost, annoyed that French journalists were proclaiming it as a win for France, pointed out in {{interviews}} that other than himself, nothing about the car (the MP4/2B) {{had anything to do with}} France. The team was British (having been founded by a New Zealander), the tyres were American Goodyears, the TAG-Porsche engine was German, the chassis itself was built by Hercules Aerospace in the USA, and was sponsored by an American <b>tobacco</b> <b>company</b> (Marlboro) and the Saudi Arabian owned company Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG).|$|E
5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do with the end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company</b> to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> use “alternative press” {{and brand}} {{recognition}} as {{another way to}} advertise toward college-aged students. Companies put their logo on everyday items like towels, clothing, and accessories, and this memorabilia is then given for free during events. These logos {{can also be seen}} in restaurants and bars, which are places young people frequent. During the 1980s and 1990s, <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> aggressively advertised their products in bars and nightclubs, mostly targeting younger audiences. According to insider documents from <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris, <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> had several strategies for targeting youth. They handed out free samples, sponsored parties at bars and fraternities on campuses, and hosted many events in popular spring break towns.This aggressive advertising led to a general increase in smoking among young adults aged 18 to 24.|$|R

5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company</b> bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company,</b> whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{continued}} and expanded Roosevelt's efforts {{to break up}} business combinations through lawsuits brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act, bringing 70 cases in four years (Roosevelt had brought 40 in seven years). Suits brought against the Standard Oil Company and the American <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Company,</b> initiated under Roosevelt, were decided {{in favor of the}} government by the Supreme Court in 1911. In June 1911, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives began hearings into United States Steel (U.S. Steel). That company had been expanded under Roosevelt, who had supported its acquisition of the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company as a means of preventing the deepening of the Panic of 1907, a decision the former president defended when testifying at the hearings. Taft, as Secretary of War, had praised the acquisitions. Historian Louis L. Gould suggested that Roosevelt was likely deceived into believing that U.S. Steel did not want to purchase the Tennessee company, but it was in fact a bargain. For Roosevelt, questioning the matter went to his personal honesty.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In the 1990 s, states sued major <b>tobacco</b> <b>companies</b> to obtain reimbursement for health impairments caused by the public's use of tobacco.

5|$|During his {{slump in}} form, D'Oliveira was {{contacted}} by Tienie Oosthuizen, a {{director at the}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>company</b> Carreras, which was, alongside Rothmans, part of the South African Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation. Rembrandt {{had set up a}} group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately {{at the end of the}} 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place. D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team, then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira told him he had been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.|$|E

During this time, Duke was repeatedly sued by business partners and shareholders.
