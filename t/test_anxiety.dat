25|$|Some {{students}} {{suffer from}} <b>test</b> <b>anxiety.</b> <b>Test</b> <b>anxiety</b> applies to standardized tests as well, where students {{who may not}} have <b>test</b> <b>anxiety</b> regularly feel immense pressure to perform when the stakes are so high. High stakes standardized testing includes exams like the SAT, the PARCC, and the ACT, where doing well is required for grade passing or college admission.|$|E
25|$|<b>Test</b> <b>anxiety</b> is the uneasiness, apprehension, or {{nervousness}} felt {{by students}} who have a fear of failing an exam. Students who have <b>test</b> <b>anxiety</b> may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of alienation from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because <b>test</b> <b>anxiety</b> hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether <b>test</b> <b>anxiety</b> is itself a unique anxiety disorder {{or whether it is}} a specific type of social phobia. The DSM-IV classifies <b>test</b> <b>anxiety</b> as a type of social phobia.|$|E
25|$|People facing anxiety may {{withdraw}} from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past. There are {{various types of}} anxiety. Existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst, an existential crisis, or nihilistic feelings. People can also face mathematical anxiety, somatic anxiety, stage fright, or <b>test</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Social anxiety and stranger anxiety are caused when people are apprehensive around strangers or other people in general. Furthermore, anxiety has been linked with physical symptoms such as IBS and can heighten other mental health illnesses such as OCD and panic disorder. The {{first step in the}} management of a person with anxiety symptoms is to evaluate the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, whose recognition is essential in order to decide its correct treatment. Anxiety symptoms may be masking an organic disease, or appear associated or {{as a result of a}} medical disorder.|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{reports from}} urologists and medical oncologists have {{suggested}} that patients with prostate cancer (PCa) often present with anxiety related to ongoing monitoring of their PSA levels {{as part of their}} disease management. The purpose of the current study, therefore, was to determine the prevalence and severity of prostate specific antigen (PSA) <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety</b> in a population of patients with either localised or metastatic PCa living in Australia. Other aspects of psychological morbidity associated with monitoring PSA levels and the impact of PSA utility (i. e., attitudes and beliefs towards PSA testing from the patient's perspective) on PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety</b> was also investigated. The sample comprised 70 participants, 47 with localised PCa (M age == 68. 43 years, SD == 8. 54) and 23 with metastatic PCa (M age == 74. 35 years, SD == 7. 41). Participants with either localised or metastatic PCa were recruited during an 11 month period from May 2009 to March 2010 through either their treating urologist or medical oncologist at Cabrini Health Melbourne, Australia, or through Cancer Voices Victoria or the Prostate Cancer Foundation Australia. Participants were required to complete a questionnaire booklet that comprised sociodemographic and medical questions, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; the State¬Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Scale~ the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer; the Functional Assessm~nt of Cancer Therapy Scale¬Prostate, and the PSA Utility (PSAU) Scale, a measure developed specifically for the current study. Level of PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety</b> was low with 75 % of participants with localised and 78 % of participants with metastatic disease reporting no PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Four per cent of participants with localised PCa reported borderline elevated PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Significant differences in PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety</b> were not found by disease status or for changes in PSA level. Low state anxiety and depression and high QoL were generally observed in the sample. Participants with metastatic disease reported significantly higher levels of depression than participants with localised disease. PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety</b> was moderately related to state and trait anxiety, depression and emotional QoL. Trait anxiety was related to all of the subscales of the MAX-PC. PSA utility was high {{for the majority of the}} sample and was not associated with PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety,</b> but was related to PCa anxiety and depression. The relationship between PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety</b> and trait anxiety suggests that measuring trait anxiety could be a method for identifying patients inclined to experience anxiety associated with the monitoring of their PSA levels. Further, the study specific PSAU Scale provided evidence of the high level of importance participants place on the PSA test, regardless of the stage of their disease. With further psychometric testing, the PSAU Scale could become a useful tool in identifying the attitudes and beliefs about PSA testing that may perpetuate anxiety in patients with PCa, and in detecting patients who would benefit from further education about PSA testing. The results of the current study highlighted the necessity for the development of more sensitive and comprehensive measures of PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety</b> to address the discrepancy between anecdotal reports by treating specialists and patient self-report of the prevalence and severity of PSA <b>testing</b> <b>anxiety.</b> The limitations of the study, implications of the results for theory and practice, and directions for future research were discussed...|$|R

25|$|Motivational {{theories}} {{also explain}} how learners' goals {{affect the way}} they engage with academic tasks. Those who have mastery goals strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have performance approach goals strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have performance avoidance goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence {{in the face of}} failure, preference for challenging tasks, creativity and intrinsic motivation. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor concentration while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and <b>test</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). Each scale is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear of aging and dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am worried about my job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to <b>test</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Questions relating to the items on this scale include, “I worry too much about tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a group or individual setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a couple minutes to score.|$|E

50|$|<b>Test</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{can also}} be labeled as anticipatory anxiety, {{situational}} anxiety or evaluation anxiety. Some anxiety is normal and often helpful to stay mentally and physically alert. When one experiences too much anxiety, however, it can result in emotional or physical distress, difficulty concentrating, and emotional worry. Inferior performance arises not because of intellectual problems or poor academic preparation, but because testing situations {{create a sense of}} threat for those experiencing test anxiety; anxiety resulting from the sense of threat then disrupts attention and memory function. Researchers suggest that between 25 and 40 percent of students experience <b>test</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Students with disabilities and students in gifted educations classes tend to experience high rates of <b>test</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Students who experience <b>test</b> <b>anxiety</b> tend to be easily distracted during a test, experience difficulty with comprehending relatively simple instructions, and have trouble organizing or recalling relevant information.|$|E
