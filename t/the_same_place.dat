A row of cottages near to the hall served as a meeting place for local Methodists from 1814, before a purpose-built chapel was established. A Sunday school was also established in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place.</b> The King's Hall was built in 1937, and was originally a dance hall before its conversion into a restaurant and public house.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than Hamilton, and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren {{on the inside of}} turn four. His first attempt was on lap three, but Hamilton braked late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner. Massa tried again at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> on the next two laps. He passed Hamilton briefly into the turn on lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass. He dropped to fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E
5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As {{long as they could}} prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} {{well-known}} Tertön Pema Lingpa of Bumthang, who founded many monasteries {{in various parts}} of Bhutan, was also instrumental in creating religious and secular dance forms from his conception of the 'Zandog Pelri' (the Copper Colored mountain), which was the abode of the Guru Padmasambahva (which is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> as the Paro Taktsang or Tiger's nest). This dance is performed in Paro as the Tsche festival. But it was during the time of Ngawang Namgyal of the Drukpa subsect, who fled Tibet to escape persecution by the opposing sect of the Gelugpa order (which dominated Tibet under the Dalai Lamas), that an administrative mechanism was established in Bhutan.|$|E
5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of the}} camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>place</b> will always be shown under the same set of views. An early example of {{this kind of}} camera system can be seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E
