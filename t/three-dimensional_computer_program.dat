40|$|Many {{problems}} {{in electrical engineering}} {{are associated with the}} way in which electric and magnetic fields propagate and distribute themselves in various media. Maxwell's equations provide a concise description for the interaction of fields with themselves and with the various boundaries of a problem. Therefore, a numerical procedure for the solution of these equations is an important consideration. This thesis shows how a general three-dimensional medium may be represented by an interconnection of continuous ideal two-wire transmission-lines made up of generalised two-dimensional nodes which are introduced in the earlier chapters. It is then shown how this model may be used for the numerical solution of the electric and magnetic vector fields within the medium. This is the TLM method of numerical analysis. A universal <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> based on the method is also introduced. This program has been written in only 110 lines of FORTRAN including the subroutines.

40|$|Wear of the {{polyethylene}} acetabular {{component is}} the most serious threat to the longterm success of total hip replacements (THRs). Greatly reduced wear rates have been reported for unidirectional, compared to multidirectional, articulation in vitro. This study considers the multidirectional motions experienced at the hip joint as described by movement loci of points on the femoral head for individual THR patients. A <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> determined the movement loci of selected points on the femoral head for THR patients and normal subjects using kinematic data obtained from gait analysis. The sizes and shapes of these loci were quantified by their sliding distances and aspect ratios with substantial differences exhibited between individual THR patients. The average sliding distances ranged from 10. 0 to 18. 1 mm and the average aspect ratios of the loci ranged from 2. 5 to 9. 2 for the THR patients. Positive correlations were found between wear rate and average sliding distance, the inverse of the average aspect ratio of the loci and the product of the average sliding distance and the inverse of the average aspect ratio of the loci. Patients with a normal hip joint range of motion produce multidirectional motion loci and tend to experience more wear than patients with more unidirectional motion loci. Differing patterns of multidirectional motion at the hip joint for individual THR patients may explain widely differing wear rates in vivo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProjection welding of nuts to sheets is {{a widely}} {{utilized}} manufacturing process in the automotive industry. The process entails challenges due the necessity of joining different sheet thicknesses and nut sizes made from dissimilar materials, and {{due to the fact}} of experiencing large local deformations ranging from room temperature to above the melting point. Heating is facilitated by resistance heating and is highly influenced by the contact area resulting from the amount of deformation, which is also temperature dependent due to material softening and frictional conditions. Resort to new materials and applications require a new level of understanding of the process by combining finite element modelling and experimentation. This paper draws from the challenge of developing a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> for electro-thermo-mechanical modeling of resistance welding and presents, as far as the authors are aware, the first ever three-dimensional simulation of the projection welding of square nuts to sheets by means of finite element analysis. Results are compared with experimental observations and measurements produced by the authors with the aim and objective of assessing the accuracy, reliability and validity of the theoretical and numerical developments.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical investigation {{has been conducted}} to examine steady, internal, nozzle-generated, gas/liquid mist cooling in vertical channels with ultra-thin, evaporating subcooled liquid films. Interest in this research has been motivated by {{the need for a}} highly efficient cooling mechanism in high-power lasers for inertial fusion reactor applications. The aim is to quantify the effects of various operating and design parameters, viz. liquid atomization nozzle design (i. e. spray geometry, droplet size distribution, etc.), heat flux, liquid mass fraction, film thickness, carrier gas velocity, temperature, and humidity, injected liquid temperature, gas/liquid combinations, channel geometry, length, and wettability, and flow direction, on mist cooling effectiveness. A fully-instrumented experimental test facility has been designed and constructed. The facility includes three cylindrical and two rectangular electrically-heated test sections with different unheated entry lengths. Water is used as the mist liquid with air, or helium, as the carrier gas. Three types of mist generating nozzles with significantly different spray characteristics are used. Numerous experiments have been conducted; local heat transfer coefficients along the channels are obtained {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions. The data indicate that mist cooling can increase the heat transfer coefficient by more than an order of magnitude compared to forced convection using only the carrier gas. The data obtained in this investigation will allow designers of mist-cooled high heat flux engineering systems to predict their performance over a wide range of design and operating parameters. Comparison has been made between the data and predictions of a modified version of the KIVA- 3 V code, a mechanistic, <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> for internal, transient, dispersed two-phase flow applications. Good agreement has been obtained for downward mist flow at moderate heat fluxes; at high heat fluxes, the code underpredicts the local heat transfer coefficients and does not predict the onset of film rupture. For upward mist flow, the code underpredicts the local heat transfer coefficients and, contrary to experimental observations, predicts early dryout at the test section exit. Ph. D.

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{compilation}} {{of the work that}} has been done on the grant DE-EE 0002805 entitled ?Finite Volume Based Computer Program for Ground Source Heat Pump Systems. ? The goal of this project was to develop a detailed computer simulation tool for GSHP (ground source heat pump) heating and cooling systems. Two such tools were developed as part of this DOE (Department of Energy) grant; the first is a two-dimensional computer program called GEO 2 D and the second is a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> called GEO 3 D. Both of these simulation tools provide an extensive array of results to the user. A unique aspect of both these simulation tools is the complete temperature profile information calculated and presented. Complete temperature profiles throughout the ground, casing, tube wall, and fluid are provided as a function of time. The fluid temperatures from and to the heat pump, as a function of time, are also provided. In addition to temperature information, detailed heat rate information at several locations as a function of time is determined. Heat rates between the heat pump and the building indoor environment, between the working fluid and the heat pump, and between the working fluid and the ground are computed. The heat rates between the ground and the working fluid are calculated as a function time and position along the ground loop. The heating and cooling loads of the building being fitted with a GSHP are determined with the computer program developed by DOE called ENERGYPLUS. Lastly COP (coefficient of performance) results as a function of time are provided. Both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer programs developed as part of this work are based upon a detailed finite volume solution of the energy equation for the ground and ground loop. Real heat pump characteristics are entered into the program and used to model the heat pump performance. Thus these computer tools simulate the coupled performance of the ground loop and the heat pump. The price paid for the three-dimensional detail is the large computational times required with GEO 3 D. The computational times required for GEO 2 D are reasonable, a few minutes for a 20 year simulation. For a similar simulation, GEO 3 D takes days of computational time. Because of the small simulation times with GEO 2 D, a number of attractive features have been added to it. GEO 2 D has a user friendly interface where inputs and outputs are all handled with GUI (graphical user interface) screens. These GUI screens make the program exceptionally easy to use. To make the program even easier to use a number of standard input options for the most common GSHP situations are provided to the user. For the expert user, the option still exists to enter their own detailed information. To further help designers and GSHP customers make decisions about a GSHP heating and cooling system, cost estimates are made by the program. These cost estimates include a payback period graph to show the user where their GSHP system pays for itself. These GSHP simulation tools should be a benefit to the advancement of GSHP systems...|$|E

Models with polytropic index n = 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 3, 1. 5, and 1. 8 are studied. The initially axisymmetric equilibria are constructed by the Ostriker-Mark self-consistent-field method. The nonaxisymmetric pattern that develops out of low-amplitude random noise is a two-armed spiral with a well-defined pattern speed and growth rate which closely match properties of the toroidal mode predicted from the linear, second-order tensor-virial equation. A Fourier analysis of each polytrope's azimuthal density distribution shows that, even in the linear amplitude regime, higher-order angular patterns also develop exponentially in time. The higher-order patterns ultimately move in synchronization with the broad two-armed spiral, creating a narrow two-armed spiral.

Evaluations were made for problems involving thermal radiation only, radiation and conduction, and finally, radiation, conduction, and convection. In general, the P-l method yielded acceptable results for radiation problems with large optical thicknesses (τ₀ > 1. 0) or combined radiation and conduction problems with participating media.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the results of the simulation of the forging of a connecting rod. The calculation has been carried out by the code FORGE 3 developed at the CEMEF laboratory. FORGE 3 is a <b>three‐dimensional</b> finite element <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> that can simulate hot forging of industrial parts. The flow problem is solved using a thermomechanical analysis. The mechanical resolution and the thermal one are coupled by the way of the consistency K which is thermodependent, the plastic deformation in the volume of the material and the friction heat flux on the surface. The material behaviour is assumed to be incompressible and viscoplastic (Norton—Hoff law) with the associated friction law. The thermal resolution includes the case of non‐linear physical properties and boundary conditions. An explicit Euler scheme is used for the mechanical resolution and two‐step schemes for the thermal one. For the computation of other parameters, it is necessary to have a good approximation for the strain rate tensor. The Orkisz method has been used to determine the deviatoric stress tensor and p is calculated by an original smoothing method.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of applications of fiber-reinforced composites in industry demands a detailed understanding of their material properties and behavior. A <b>three-dimensional</b> finite-element <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> called PAFAC (Plastic and Failure Analysis of Composites) has been developed for the elastic-plastic analysis of fiber-reinforced composite materials and structures. The evaluation of stresses and deformations at edges, cut-outs, and joints is essential in understanding the strength and failure for metal-matrix composites since the onset of plastic yielding starts {{very early in the}} loading process as compared to the composite's ultimate strength. Such comprehensive analysis can only be achieved by a finite-element program like PAFAC. PAFAC is particularly suited for the analysis of laminated metal-matrix composites. It can model the elastic-plastic behavior of the matrix phase while the fibers remain elastic. Since the PAFAC program uses a three-dimensional element, the program can also model the individual layers of the laminate to account for thickness effects. In PAFAC, the composite is modeled as a continuum reinforced by cylindrical fibers of vanishingly small diameter which occupy a finite volume fraction of the composite. In this way, the essential axial constraint of the phases is retained. Furthermore, the local stress and strain fields are uniform. The PAFAC finite-element solution is obtained using the displacement method. Solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations is obtained with a Newton-Raphson iteration technique. The elastic-plastic behavior of composites consisting of aligned, continuous elastic filaments and an elastic-plastic matrix is described in terms of the constituent properties, their volume fractions, and mutual constraints between phases indicated by the geometry of the microstructure. The program uses an iterative procedure to determine the overall response of the laminate, then from the overall response determines the stress state in each phase of the composite material. Failure of the fibers or matrix within an element can also be modeled by PAFAC. PAFAC is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a segmented memory requirement of approximately 66 K (octal) of 60 bit words.
