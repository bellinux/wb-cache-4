5|$|A third safety car {{period was}} caused by the Creation Autosportif entry, which ran into the tire {{barriers}} at the Porsche Curves and needed to be extracted. The Creation returned to the pits but eventually retired. The Kruse Motorsport entry also suffered problems when it briefly stopped at the pit entrance during the caution period, blocking other cars attempting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> pit stops. The Kruse entry eventually succeeded in getting to its garage.|$|E
5|$|Named {{after the}} nearby city of Winona, {{she was given}} her middle name, Laura, because of her parents' {{friendship}} with Laura Huxley, writer Aldous Huxley's wife. Her stage name derives from Mitch Ryder, a soul and rock singer of whom {{her father was a}} fan. Ryder's father is an atheist and her mother is a Buddhist; they encouraged their children to take the best part of other religions and use them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> belief systems.|$|E
5|$|Fixed {{gender roles}} began to become less {{prominent}} in the Western world starting in the late 20th century, allowing men <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> choice of career without regard to traditional gender-based roles. Some men who choose this role may {{do so because they}} enjoy being an active part of their children's lives, while in other families, the mother wants to pursue her career. For example, of the 187 participants at Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.|$|E

5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5|$|Eight months later, as {{the city}} is besieged by the Union Army in the Atlanta Campaign, Scarlett and her young house servant Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical {{assistance}} after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett {{to take her home}} to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of typhoid fever and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E

30|$|The {{practice}} of a learning community {{remains at the}} heart of the learning experience at [Z College]. This commitment to community has a number of manifestations. These include, but are not limited to, the acknowledgement that everyone at the College be they students on any programme or course, volunteers, staff (either faculty or non-faculty), visiting teachers or facilitators, all have a significant contribution <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> and one anotherâ€™s learning experience (document 6).|$|R
60|$|Such {{being the}} {{disposition}} {{and character of}} Henry, every thing during his reign went wrong, and this state of things, growing worse and worse as he advanced in life, greatly encouraged and strengthened the house of York in the effort which they were inclined <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> bring <b>their</b> <b>own</b> branch of the family to the throne.|$|R
5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of {{free markets and}} believed {{that they could be}} detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> decisions and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next two days, the {{battalion}} withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they went. In the confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.|$|E
5|$|They added American touches to the course. They {{used the}} names of American birds for patrol names; {{challenged}} patrols <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> flags instead of using store-bought flags; introduced patrol totems and signatures; and added singing Back to Gilwell when each patrol's name was mentioned. Each member took turns as the patrol leader, and they met daily as the Patrol Leaders Council to conduct daily inspections. The staff taught course attendees basic Scout requirements and {{how to handle the}} U.S. flag. The patrols took an unsupervised patrol hike and overnight camp. Other American features included a program and a service patrol, a cracker barrel after each evening's event, a feast, and other ceremonies. The first course, begun on July 31, 1948, was attended by 29 men from 12 states. Although it rained on four of the nine days, the Scouters were excited by the experience and enthusiastic about sharing it with others.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the LNC relied on taking over all, {{or at least a}} {{significant}} portion, of the burials of London's dead. However, while the Metropolitan Interment Amendment Act 1852 had repealed Chadwick's scheme for two very large cemeteries near London, it had also permitted London's parishes <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> arrangements for the burial of their dead. Each parish could make arrangements with the cemetery of its choosing, or use money from the rates to create their own cemeteries. The financial mismanagement and internal disputes within the LNC had delayed the opening of Brookwood Cemetery by 18 months, and during this period new cemeteries nearer London had opened or were nearing completion. While some parishes did choose Brookwood as their burial site, many preferred either to make arrangements with less distant cemeteries, or to buy land on the outskirts of London and open their own suburban cemeteries. Concerns over the financial irregularities and the viability of the scheme had led to only 15,000 of the 25,000 LNC shares being sold, severely limiting the company's working capital and forcing it to take out large loans. Buying the land from Lord Onslow, compensating local residents for the loss of rights over Woking Common, draining and landscaping the portion to be used for the initial cemetery, and building the railway lines and stations were all expensive undertakings. With far fewer burial contracts with London parishes than had been anticipated, by the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in November 1854 the LNC {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy.|$|E
