5|$|<b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> Mockingbird was Lee's only {{published}} book until Go Set a Watchman, {{an earlier}} draft of <b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued {{to respond to}} her work's impact until her death in February 2016, although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.|$|E

5|$|But as Hohoff saw it, the {{manuscript}} {{was by no}} means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, “more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled <b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> Mockingbird.|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{compare their}} {{perceptions}} of <b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> Mockingbird as adults with when they first read it as children. Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Rosanne Cash, Tom Brokaw, and Harper's sister Alice Lee, who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled Scout, Atticus, and Boo.|$|E

5|$|Though not {{the first}} of its kind, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six started a popular trend of {{tactical}} first-person shooters in 1998. It featured a team-based, realistic design and themes based around counter-terrorism, requiring missions to be planned before execution and in it, a single hit was sometimes enough <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> character. Medal of Honor, released in 1999, started a long running proliferation of first-person shooters set during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|At {{the charity}} signing before the Grammy Awards, {{the band was}} photographed {{together}} with former drummer Chris Slade. It was later confirmed that he had rejoined the band for the Grammys and upcoming tour. In April 2015, Rudd pleaded guilty to drug charges and threatening <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> former assistant. Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with Slade. On 9 July 2015 Rudd was denied a discharge without conviction and sentenced to eight months' home detention.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time mercury was found in local fish at such high levels that {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A Florida panther was found dead with levels of mercury high enough <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> human. Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into methylmercury, and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though {{they continue to be}} a concern.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in <b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins was ticketed on November 24, 2007, for {{suspicion}} of {{contributing to the}} delinquency of a minor and two alcohol charges, {{one of which was}} underage possession of alcohol.

According to local news sources, he threatened <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> local teenager, because he thought she had stolen his CD player. He was also convicted as a juvenile of a felony drug conviction while in foster care in Omaha.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} {{this stage of the}} {{fighting}} that James Llewellyn Davies earned the Victoria Cross (VC). Davies, alone, attacked a German machine gun position after previously failed efforts had resulted in numerous British deaths. He killed one German and captured another as well as the gun. Although he was wounded, he then led an attack <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> sniper who had been harassing his unit. Davies subsequently died of his wounds.|$|E

5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) that are found in some legumes, {{as shown in the}} figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> cell.|$|E
5|$|The episode opens {{showing a}} horde of walkers as they follow a {{helicopter}} overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days.

As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde emerges from the forest, and Rick and Carl take shelter in the barn.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>a</b> Mockingbird is a {{novel by}} Harper Lee {{published}} in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, {{and has become a}} classic of modern American literature. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10years old. The story is told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch.|$|E
