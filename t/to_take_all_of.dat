5|$|The River Don, which {{flows through}} Sheffield and Doncaster, had {{originally}} {{split into two}} channels below Stainforth, one of which emptied into the River Trent near Adlingfleet, close to its junction with the River Ouse, while the other headed north to join the River Aire near Rawcliffe. Following {{the work of the}} Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden to drain Hatfield Chase, the Adlingfleet outlet was closed off, and the channel to the River Aire, passing through Newbridge, was improved <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the flow. The scheme was not entirely successful, and after severe flooding near Sykehouse, Fishlake and Snaith, accompanied by riots, a new channel was cut between Newbridge and the River Ouse near what became Goole. The old course of the Don gradually silted up. Navigation on the Don was improved by the construction of cuts and locks, with the lowest lock situated at Stainforth. From there to the Ouse, boats used the Dutch River, Vermuyden's artificial drain, which was hazardous due to its fast flows, its tides and its shallowness at times.|$|E

En route, the Romans seized and burned the Carthaginian hold-out cities of Selinous and Heraclea Minoa. This expedition to Lilybaeum was not successful, but attacking the Carthaginian headquarters demonstrated Roman resolve <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Sicily. The Roman fleet was defeated by the Carthaginians at Drepana, forcing the Romans to continue their attacks from land. Roman forces at Lilybaeum were relieved, and Eryx, near Drepana, was seized thus menacing that important city as well.|$|E

This meeting may have been Young's attempt to win Indian support against the United States and refrain from raids against Mormon settlements. In sermons on 16 August, and again one month later, Young publicly urged the emigrant wagon trains to keep away from the Territory. Despite Young's efforts, Indians attacked Mormon settlements {{during the course of the}} Utah War, including a raid on Fort Limhi on the Salmon River in Oregon Territory in February 1858 and attacks in Tooele County just west of Great Salt Lake City.|$|E

500|$|Further, {{in attacking}} the {{distortion}} principle's application, Gozdor also argued against the principle {{as a legal}} concept in the first place. He wrote, [...] "Regardless of the Court's rationale for its distortion principle, determining a First Amendment violation by measuring whether the government used a subsidy 'in ways which distorted the medium's usual functioning' suggests that forum functions become unchangeable once created." [...] He claimed the unworkability of the distortion principle in a hypothetical example, which would moot {{the very existence of}} the Legal Services Corporation. [...] "Taking the Velazquez rationale to its logical ends", he wrote, [...] "the LSC subsidy itself could become an unconstitutional speech restriction. If Congress substantially increased LSC appropriations in order to allow LSC <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its cases ... the functioning of the legal system would be distorted because such a subsidy likely would result in a dramatic increase in the federal courts' caseloads." [...] With this in mind, he concluded with a process by which the Court should have decided the case: a process leading to the upholding of the restriction by finding that LSC's purpose was in promoting the government's message, in contrast to a diversity of private views.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Buczynski and Muto went on {{a package}} holiday to Greece, further inspiring the former's {{interests}} in the region's ancient cultures. Deciding to explore this topic further, he enrolled to study for an undergraduate degree in Classics and Ancient History at Hunter College, {{a part of the}} City University of New York (CUNY) located in Manhattan's Upper East Side, beginning there in September 1980. At the university, he became friends with one of his mentors, the classical archaeologist Clairève Grandjouan, and was saddened by her death before he had completed the course. He devoted himself to his studies, which he greatly enjoyed, and was sufficiently successful to be placed on the Thomas Hunter Honors Program. In June 1982, he returned to Greece in order to take part in his first archaeological excavations, which were run by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA). Returning to New York City, he began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the modules that he could which were devoted to field archaeology, considering a potential career in the profession. In the winter break between 1982 and 1983, he once more returned to the Mediterranean, [...] touring Greece and Italy with Muto. He would subsequently be laid off from his job, but gained work in the Hunter College Classics Office. His increased interest in academic archaeology came at the expense of his involvement in the occult, and in the Spring of 1981 he stepped down from his leadership of the Knossos Grove coven, handing control over to Tony Fiara. As his studies at Hunter College came to an end, he decided to continue his education to a postgraduate level, and successfully obtained a scholarship from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1640 the war {{reached a}} climax and the tide turned clearly toward the French and against Spain, {{starting}} with the siege and capture of the fort at Arras. The French conquered Arras from the Spanish following a siege that lasted from 16 June to 9 August 1640. When Arras fell, the way was opened to the French <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Flanders. The ensuing French campaign against the Spanish forces in Flanders culminated with a decisive French victory {{at the battle of}} Rocroi in May 1643. News of these French victories provided strong encouragement to separatist movements in the Spanish province of Catalonia and in Portugal. The Catalan revolt had sprung up spontaneously in May 1640. Since that time, it had been the conscious goal of Cardinal Richelieu to promote a [...] "war by diversion" [...] against the Spanish. Richelieu wanted to create difficulties for the Spanish at home that might encourage them to withdraw from the war. To fight this war by diversion, Cardinal Richelieu had been supplying aid to the Catalans.|$|E
2500|$|On October 20, Blunt's {{retreating}} troops {{arrived on}} the Little Blue River, [...] east of Independence. The Union force turned to engage the Confederates again, using a strong defensive position on the west bank. Curtis, however, ordered Blunt to return to Independence while leaving a small force under Col. Thomas Moonlight on the Little Blue. The next day, Curtis ordered Blunt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his volunteers {{and return to the}} river. As Blunt neared the stream, he discovered that Moonlight's brigade had engaged Price's advance guard just after sunup, burning the bridge as previously ordered. Price's main force had arrived by this time and was fiercely engaging Moonlight's unit, which was stubbornly guarding every available ford in the area. Blunt quickly entered the fray, attempting to drive Price back beyond the defensive positions he wished to re-occupy. A five-hour battle ensued, as Union troops forced the Confederates to fall back at first, entrenching themselves behind several rock walls as they awaited an inevitable Southern counterattack. Although witnesses reported that the outnumbered Federals compelled their enemy to fight for every inch of ground, Confederate numerical superiority slowly took its toll. Gradually, the Northerners were forced to retreat, and the focus of the battle shifted to Independence itself.|$|E
2500|$|Itagaki {{suggested}} to Puyi {{that in a}} few years time Manchukuo might become a monarchy and stated that Manchuria was just the beginning, as Japan had ambitions <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> China; the obvious implication was that Puyi would become the Great Qing Emperor again. When Puyi objected to Itagaki's plans, he was told that he was in no position to negotiate as Itagaki had no interest in his opinions on these issues. Unlike Doihara, who was always very polite and constantly stroked Puyi's ego, Itagaki was brutally rude and brusque, addressing Puyi like he was barking out orders to a particularly dim-witted common soldier. Puyi's chief adviser Zheng Xiaoxu had been promised by Itagaki that he would be the Manchukuo prime minister, an offer that appealed to his vanity sufficiently enough that he persuaded Puyi to accept the Japanese terms, telling him that Manchukuo would soon become a monarchy and history would repeat itself, as Puyi would conquer the rest of China from his Manchurian base just as the Qing did in 1644. In Japanese propaganda, Puyi was always celebrated both in traditionalist terms as a Confucian [...] "Sage King" [...] out to restore virtue and as a revolutionary who was going to end the oppression of the common people by a program of wholesale modernization.|$|E

2500|$|McCarver's {{regiment}} {{had barely}} received its designation {{when it was}} placed {{in danger of losing}} it. In January 1862 Brigadier General William J. Hardee made a decision to detach four of the regiment's best armed and equipped companies (Companies A, B, E & H) and designate them as the 9th Arkansas Infantry Battalion, and place them under the command of Major John H. Kelly. It was Brigadier General Hardee's intention was <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the organized Arkansas troops with him when transferred his command to Kentucky in September 1862 except for Colonel Borland's own regiment. [...] However Hardee did not wish to accept poorly armed and untrained troops. [...] It appears that there were sufficient arms to equip four of McCarver's companies, so these companies were detached from the regiment as a separate battalion and departed with General Hardee, with the balance of the regiment to follow when they were properly armed and equipped. Clearly, McCarver considered the detachment of those companies to be temporary, because when the official notice of organization was sent to the Confederate War Department, he assigned the detached companies designations (Cos. A-B-E-H) and noted that they were detached with General Hardee. This arrangement caused some confusion at Richmond, which wrote back to Borland, [...] "Does Col. J. S. McCarver's command consist of only five companies, or a full regiment? If less than a regiment, it will be known as the Eighth Battalion; if ten companies, the Fourteenth Regiment Arkansas Volunteers. Please inform the Department at your earliest convenience the exact state and condition of his command. Maj. F. W. Desha's command will be known as the Seventh Battalion Arkansas Volunteers." [...] McCarver certainly considered that he had a full regiment (the tenth company had arrived on December 18), because as late as February 1862 he was signing correspondence as [...] "colonel commanding 14th Arkansas Regiment." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 1944, Slim held the {{official}} rank of colonel with a war-time rank of major-general and the temporary rank of lieutenant-general. In January 1944, when the Second Arakan Offensive was met by a Japanese counter-offensive, the Indian 7th Infantry Division was quickly surrounded along with parts of the Indian 5th Infantry Division and the 81st (West Africa) Division. The 7th Indian Division's defence was based largely on the [...] "Admin Box" [...] formed initially from drivers, cooks and suppliers. [...] They were supplied by air, thus negating {{the importance of their}} lost supply lines. The Japanese forces were able to halt the offensive into Arakan but were unable to decisively defeat the allied forces or advance beyond the surrounded formations. In early 1944, the Japanese Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo approved of plans for victory in Asia, calling for two operations, Operation U-Go as the invasion of India was code-named and Operation Ichi-Go which was intended to defeat China once and for all. The two operations in India and China were closely linked given that American supplies for China were flown over [...] "the Hump" [...] of the Himalayas and the Japanese wanted to take the Assam province of India in part to close the American air bases in India that sustained China {{at the same time that}} they were launching Operation Ichi-Go, the biggest Japanese offensive of all time that involved 2 million men. The Japanese knew that they lacked the logistics to invade India, and the plans for U-Go were based on the assumption that the 14th Army would just collapse, allowing the 15th Army to capture enough food to prevent its men from starving to death. Following the 15th Army into India was the Indian National Army commanded by the fiery anti-British revolutionary Subhas Chandra Bose who had impressed Tojo with his love of violence and carnage.. The Japanese believed that the mere presence of Bose in India would inspire the men of the Indian Army to mutiny and murder their British officers, and set off an anti-British revolution that would allow the 15th Army <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> India.|$|E
