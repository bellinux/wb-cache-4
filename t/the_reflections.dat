5|$|Deformed matrices, {{consisting}} of randomly oriented nanochannels in a spongelike keratin matrix, create the diffuse non-iridescent blue colour of Ara ararauna, the blue-and-yellow macaw. Since <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> {{are not all}} arranged in the same direction, the colours, while still magnificent, do not vary much with angle, so they are not iridescent.|$|E
5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of <b>the</b> <b>reflections,</b> however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E

5|$|The intensities of <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> {{observed}} in X-ray diffraction {{give us the}} magnitudes |F(q)| but not the phases φ(q). To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury. Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform F(q), which may be inverted to obtain the electron density f(r).|$|E
5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. <b>The</b> <b>reflections</b> of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E

40|$|Many spectrophotometers utilize {{polarizing}} prisms {{and determine}} <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> factor of <b>the</b> sample by plane polarized light. In general, <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> factor of <b>the</b> sample {{is independent of}} the azimuth of the plane of po-larization {{but there are some}} materials, notably textiles, for which <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> factor depends upon the azimuth. It can be shown mathematically that, if <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> factor is determined for two azimuths at right angles to one another, the arithmetic average of the two values is <b>the</b> <b>reflection</b> factor for ordinary, or unpolarized light.

5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing <b>the</b> <b>reflections.</b> This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. Some space groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarization effects can also {{occur at the}} (reflective) interface between two materials of different refractive index. These effects are treated by the Fresnel equations. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected, with the ratio depending on angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. In this way, physical optics recovers Brewster's angle. When light reflects from a thin film on a surface, interference between <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> from the film's surfaces can produce polarization in the reflected and transmitted light.|$|E
25|$|In some {{locations}} it {{is necessary}} to span a wide gap at a relatively high elevation, such as when a canal or water supply must span a valley. Rather than building extremely large arches, or very tall supporting columns (difficult using stone), a series of arched structures are built one atop another, with wider structures at the base. Roman civil engineers developed the design and constructed highly refined structures using only simple materials, equipment, and mathematics. This type is still used in canal viaducts and roadways as it has a pleasing shape, particularly when spanning water, as <b>the</b> <b>reflections</b> of the arches form a visual impression of circles or ellipses.|$|E

25|$|The subgroups {{discussed}} {{so far are}} {{not only}} infinite, they are also continuous (Lie groups). Any subgroup containing at least one non-zero translation must be infinite, but subgroups of the orthogonal group can be finite. For example, the symmetries of a regular pentagon consist of rotations by integer multiples of 72° (360° / 5), along with reflections in the five mirrors which perpendicularly bisect the edges. This is a group, D5, with 10 elements. It has a subgroup, C5, of half the size, omitting <b>the</b> <b>reflections.</b> These two groups are members of two families, Dn and Cn, for any n > 1. Together, these families constitute the rosette groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmitter}} {{system on the}} Mk. I produced 3microsecond (µs) long pulses with up to 50kW of power 1,500 times a second. These were broadcast semi-directionally, floodlighting the entire area {{in front of the}} transmitter antenna's current bearing. Since the signal was even less directional vertically than horizontally, a significant amount of the signal hit the ground. Due to the long wavelengths used, this signal was strongly reflected forward, and due to geometrical considerations, any signal hitting the ground near the station would reflect with enough of a vertical angle to mix with the main signal in the area of interest (about 30km around the station). This was the purpose of the GL mat, which did not eliminate <b>the</b> <b>reflections,</b> but made them much more predictable.|$|E
25|$|Reflections can {{be divided}} into two types: {{specular}} reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space. Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. <b>The</b> <b>reflections</b> from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection.|$|E
