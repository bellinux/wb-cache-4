5|$|The Erie County, New York Republicans had drafted Kemp after {{incumbent}} congressman Richard D. McCarthy {{decided to}} run for the United States Senate. During his inaugural campaign, his district was in economic malaise, and The New York Times described him as a John F. Kennedy throwback who campaigned on family values, patriotism, sports, and defense. Upon his election to the Congress in a class of sixty-two freshmen, he was one of six newcomers—along with Ronald Dellums, Bella Abzug, Louise Day Hicks, Robert Drinan, and Pete du Pont—discussed in Time. The article described him as a football fan like United States President Richard Nixon and as the recipient of advice from White House adviser Robert Finch and former Kemp boss Herb Klein, Nixon's director of communications. The Nixon aides encouraged Kemp to endorse the Cambodian invasion and to oppose criticism of Nixon's war policies in order <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> <b>up</b> Kemp's support from military hawks.|$|E

25|$|Human {{rights in}} Somalia {{throughout}} the late 20th-century and early 21st-century were considered dire, but have gradually improved {{over the following}} years. Human rights are guaranteed in the Federal Constitution, which was adopted in August 2012. They fall under the Ministry of Human Rights established in August 2013. The central authorities concurrently inaugurated a National Human Rights Day, endorsed an official Human Rights Roadmap, and completed Somalia's first National Gender Policy. A Human Rights Task Force was also established in February 2013 <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> <b>up</b> on the protection of individual rights. Additionally, {{the federal government in}} December 2014 organized a public awareness campaign, passed a new 54-point national Child Protection Act, and finished legislation on a Human Rights Commission bill. According to the UN's Independent Human Rights Expert on Somalia, local human rights protection has gradually improved as government institutionalization and legislative reform have taken root.|$|E

The 13-member committee of volunteers was formed after extensive consultations with civil society groups and the Speaker of Parliament, Mohamed Osman Jawari. Chaired by prominent human rights attorney Maryam Yusuf Sheikh Ali, one of four women on the panel, the Task Force includes an educator, a peace activist, leaders of Somali women's organizations, senior police officers, a humanitarian campaigner, a religious leader, and a media representative. It is tasked with investigating allegations {{of human rights abuses}} and journalist intimidation. At the end of its three-month mandate, the committee is scheduled to publish a report on its findings and recommended courses of action. The Task Force will eventually give way to a permanent parliamentary Human Rights Commission, which will have the capacity to investigate allegations over a longer period.|$|E

The {{territory}} claimed by Georgia, which it called the [...] "Yazoo lands," [...] ran west from the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River, and included most of the present-day states of Alabama and Mississippi (between 31° N and 35° N). The southern portion of this region was also claimed by Spain as part of Spanish Florida. One of Georgia's efforts to accomplish its goals for the region, a 1794 plan developed by governor George Mathews and the Georgia General Assembly, became a major political scandal, known as the Yazoo land scandal.|$|E

In 1907 at the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists {{had a major}} showdown, he led with extremists along with Bal Gangadhar Tilak. The Congress split after this session. In 1907–1908 Aurobindo traveled extensively to Pune, Bombay and Baroda <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> <b>up</b> support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting with groups. He was arrested again in May 1908 {{in connection with the}} Alipore Bomb Case. He was acquitted in the ensuing trial, following the murder of chief prosecution witness Naren Gosain within jail premises which subsequently led to the case against him collapsing. Aurobindo was subsequently released after a year of isolated incarceration.|$|E

2500|$|As Condell's {{first term}} ended, {{he promised to}} push for [...] "substantial" [...] pay raises in the union's {{upcoming}} contract negotiations even as his opponents attacked him for concentrating authority in staff hands and for poor leadership. Nonetheless, he was challenged for the SCDU endorsement by Michael Keenan, president of PEF's largest division. Condell defeated Keenan, 388 to 275. Nonetheless, a new political party, the Committee for Independent Officers, arose and successfully contended for {{four of the six}} seats for state vice president, regional coordinator, and trustee (including among its winning candidates future PEF presidents Howard Shafer and Roger Benson). <b>To</b> <b>firm</b> <b>up</b> his political position, Condell called for a two- rather than three-year contract, with a 7 percent pay rise in each year. Even when CSEA settled for a three-year agreement with salary increases of 5 percent, 5.5 percent, and 5.5 percent in each of its three years, Condell continued to push for 7 percent. But health insurance, not pay, ended up being the biggest stumbling block. The state declared an impasse in mid June (10 weeks after PEF's contract had expired), and mediators were called in. Without the mediators' help, however, Condell reached a three-year agreement on July 11 with the same pay structure achieved by CSEA and no improvements in health benefits.|$|E
2500|$|It was in 1896 that D. Ward King first {{dragged the}} road with an old frostbitten pump stock and an oak post. The {{improvement}} in the dirt roads it worked was dramatic. Until then, the only way <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> <b>up</b> dirt roads had been to dump layers of stone on them and then press it in with a heavy roller to make a road surface resistant to turning into muck after every rain. This method was fairly effective, {{but it was also}} labor-intensive and expensive. These stone-permeated roads were called [...] "macadamized roads". These roads took their name from their Scotch inventor, John Loudon McAdam. Using his method, roads were covered with several layers of stone, starting with large ones and then reducing their size in each successive layer. The stones in the first level would be {{about the size of a}} human head. The stones in the next layer would be about the size of a fist. The final layer would be of stones of about the size of golf balls. It was grueling work to haul this heavy stone to the places needed, to unload it in the right places and then to spread it evenly over the road surface with only horse-drawn wagons and hand-held shovels and rakes. Further, in the days before powered stone crushers, there was the additional and very arduous task of smashing much bigger rocks down to the right size for use in the respective layers. This work came to be known as [...] "making the big ones into the small ones." [...] Men did it by hand by smashing large rocks with sledgehammers. In many states, convicts did this work and sometimes even built these macadamized roads by working on the roads themselves. When these convict crews worked directly on these roads, necessarily outside the walls of the prison, each man was typically chained to the next to prevent runaways. These convict road crews became the infamous [...] "chain gangs" [...] of that day. In the days of horse power, this method was just too time-consuming and expensive to be practical for widespread use.|$|E
