25|$|According <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>records</b> {{from the}} city of Mainz, Johannes Fust was for some time Gutenberg's {{financial}} backer. By the 16th century jobs in printing were becoming increasingly specialized. Structures supporting publishers were more and more complex, leading to division of labour. In Europe between 1500 and 1700 the role of the Master Printer was dying out and giving way to the booksellerâ€”publisher. During this period, printing had a stronger commercial imperative than previously. Risks associated with the industry however were substantial, although dependent {{on the nature of the}} publication.|$|E

25|$|The town {{contained}} several coaching inns, public {{houses and}} ale houses, leading <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>records</b> of some alcohol-induced violence {{and a certain}} reputation for excess. Several coaching inns were constructed to accommodate travellers by stagecoach and mail coach. The Angel on Broad Street was one such notable coaching inn, where several passenger and mail coaches departed and arrived {{on a regular basis}} every week, including the Aurora coach which departed for London (taking 27 hours in 1822). The Angel was the last coaching inn in Ludlow to have such coach traffic, following the arrival of the railways in 1852. The Angel ceased trading in the early 1990s. A surviving medieval coaching inn today is the 15th century Bull Hotel on the Bull Ring. Several other pubs and hotels in the town have historic pedigree, including the Rose and Crown where allegedly a pub has existed since 1102.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} in question, Bellamy made several harassing {{telephone}} calls, including one to the Natchez Trace Restaurant where Sadler and Sharpe were having dinner and drinks with two friends. That resulted in Sadler asking a bartender to telephone the police, who never responded. Bellamy later went to Sharpe's apartment complex {{and knocked on the}} door. Sadler exited through a side door. On seeing Sadler, Bellamy fled to his van. It was at this time, Sadler testified, that he saw a flash of metal. Believing it to be a gun, he fired one shot. The bullet struck Bellamy right between the eyes, and he died several hours later in a Nashville hospital. It turned out that Bellamy was unarmed. According <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>records,</b> Sadler had then placed a handgun in Bellamy's van, presumably to strengthen his claim of self-defense. After a plea bargain, on June 1, 1979, Sadler was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the death of Lee Emerson Bellamy, and sentenced to from 4 to 5 years in prison. His legal team worked to lower the sentence, which a judge reduced to just 30 days in the county workhouse. He served 28 days. Sadler was sued for wrongful death by Bellamy's stepson, and was ordered to pay compensation of about $10,000.|$|E

500|$|Cowart's lawyer {{argued in}} a November 13 {{petition}} that {{the grand jury}} was racially stacked against him because it included only two white members, while [...] "21 were African-American or of another race or races." [...] Cowart's attorney argued his indictment should be dismissed because jury could not [...] "under the most modest constitutional scrutiny...be considered fair, impartial and unprejudiced." [...] In February 2009, a federal judge granted Schlesselman and Cowart limited access <b>to</b> <b>court</b> <b>records</b> on the grand jury selection and gave them permission to question procedures for selecting jurors. However, their defense attorneys {{were not allowed to}} challenge the resulting racial makeup of the actual jury. Also in February 2009, Schlesselman's lawyer asked the court to dismiss statements he previously gave police and evidence that he contended was wrongfully seized during searches of his home and another residence. Judge J. Daniel Breen of the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee refused this request in April. Schlesselman's counsel argued his assassination threat charges should be dropped because he said the alleged comments were made while in custody, so he could not have carried them out and they were not a [...] "true threat."
