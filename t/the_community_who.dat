5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>who</b> were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E
5|$|Mukund Raj {{was another}} poet from <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>who</b> {{lived in the}} 13th century and {{is said to be}} the first poet who {{composed}} in Marathi. He is known for the Viveka-Siddhi and Parammrita which are metaphysical, pantheistic works connected with orthodox Vedantism. Other well known Deshastha literary scholars of the 17th century were Mukteshwar and Shridhar. Mukteshwar was the grandson of Eknath and is the most distinguished poet in the ovi meter. He is most known for translating the Mahabharata and the Ramayana in Marathi but only a part of the Mahabharata translation is available and the entire Ramayana translation is lost. Shridhar Kulkarni came from near Pandharpur and his works are said to have superseded the Sanskrit epics to a certain extent. Other major literary contributors of the 17th and the 18th century were Vaman Pandit, Mahipati, Amritaraya, Anant Phandi and Ramjoshi.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the school}} {{there was an}} infant school for {{children}} under six, a primary school for children under ten, {{and there was a}} preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years. When entering the school, each pupil under high school age was assigned a woman of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>who</b> was in charge of his/her wardrobe, personal habits, and exercise. The teachers included three graduates of Harvard Divinity School (George Ripley, George Bradford, John Sullivan Dwight) as well as several women (Ripley's wife Sophia, his sister Marianne, and his cousin Hannah, as well as Georgianna Bruce and Abby Morton). Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class. Dana taught languages, being able to speak ten himself. Dwight taught music as well as Latin. Students studied European languages and literature and, at no extra cost, pupils could also indulge in the fine arts. The primary school was overseen by Sophia Ripley and Marianne Ripley, using a progressive child-centered pedagogy that has been compared to the later reforms of John Dewey. Sophia Ripley's dedication to the school was remarked upon by many; she only missed two classes in six years.|$|E

40|$|Gordon W. Allport (1937) {{considered}} the coherence of personality to {{be a matter}} of degree and, as such, an individual difference. Although considered by some to be the “central, unique charge” of personality psychology (Cervone 2 ̆ 6 Shoda, 1999, p. 3), the study of personality coherence has been dispersed across different theoretical communities. We review how personality coherence has been defined and measured within the following five contemporary theoretical communities: <b>the</b> multivariate <b>community</b> (<b>who</b> focus upon <b>the</b> individual’s profile of global trait dispositions), <b>the</b> social-cognitive <b>community</b> (<b>who</b> focus upon <b>the</b> individual’s contextualized self-structures), <b>the</b> personological <b>community</b> (<b>who</b> focus upon <b>the</b> individual’s unique and ongoing life story), <b>the</b> cybernetic <b>community</b> (<b>who</b> focus upon <b>the</b> individual’s goal hierarchy), and <b>the</b> organismic <b>community</b> (<b>who</b> focus upon <b>the</b> individual’s sense of self). We conclude by reflecting upon the extent to which the five perspectives converge upon an underlying self-epistemic function...|$|R
