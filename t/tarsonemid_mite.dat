40|$|Insects, {{nematodes}} and mites {{that damage}} postharvest plant products can cause severe quality losses or trade restrictions {{in case of}} quarantine organisms. With the ban of the ozone depleting methyl bromide (MeBr), {{the most widely used}} chemical for phytosanitary treatments, effective and sustainable alternatives are required. A physical method, Controlled Atmosphere Temperature Treatment (CATT) can be a sustainable alternative for the control of pests on living plant products. Optimising CA-conditions besides temperature and exposure time can help in developing successful applications. In The Netherlands, a successful application to disinfest strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) planting material from strawberry <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mite</b> (Phytonemus pallidus) or plant parasitic nematodes Meloidogyne hapla was developed and implemented in practice. Initial tests with a number of other potential quarantine plant-pest combinations showed promising results of CATT. </p...|$|E
40|$|Amphibiobeania epiphylia is a new, {{monotypic}} taxon of Beaniidae (Cheilostomata) from Darwin, Northern Territory. It {{is unique}} among the 6, 000 living species of Bryozoa {{in that it}} encrusts mainly living tree leaves (chiefly the mangrove Rhizophora stylosa). The consequence of living in such a specialized habitat is that colonies are emergent (subaerial) for {{a significant part of}} the tidal cycle-around 12 of every 24 hours during spring tides and for several days during neap tides. Desiccation is prevented or minimized by the high humidity of the habitat and a cohesive coating of silt covering the colony. Zooids are weakly calcified and lie alternately on their left and right sides in a lineal series, with opercula displaced to the outer corner of the distal zooidal rim. Organisms associated with A. epiphylia include a colony-damaging ceratopogonid (Diptera) larva and a <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mite</b> that may use dead zooidal interiors, beneath the silt crust, for shelter...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Considering {{the great}} {{abundance}} of mites {{in almost all}} habitats and their minute dimensions, acarophagy must be common and even humans eat lots of mites. The presence of mites was investigated in 90 food samples, representing 24 sorts of fruits, vegetables and mushrooms. Acarological analyses of the products detected the presence of 53 mite species of the orders Oribatida, Actinedida, Tarsonemida, Acaridida and Gamasida. Mainly the saprophagous soil-inhabiting oribatid mites, but also actinedid and <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mites,</b> were frequently found in the analysed material. The highest number of mites was collected from fruits with uneven surface, covered with numerous hairs, e. g. raspberries, strawberries and red currants. About 50 % of mites still remained on vegetables and fruits after cleaning them in running water...|$|R
5000|$|Only {{a limited}} number of tarsonemid genera (Steneotarsonemus, Polyphagotarsonemus, Phytonemus, Floridotarsonemus and Tarsonemus) are known to feed on higher plants while most species in this family feed on the {{thin-walled}} mycelia of fungi or possibly algal bodies. Even among the plant-feeding <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mites,</b> most are confined to areas of new growth where cell walls are thin and therefore easily pierced. However two species (the [...] "broad mite" [...] Polyphagotarsonemus latus and the [...] "cyclamen mite" [...] Steneotarsonemus pallidus) are able to feed on older leaves because of their ability to inject toxins during feeding (presumably of salivary gland origin) causing an increase of thin walled cells surrounding feeding sites. This proliferation of new growth often results in leaves that appear stunted, puckered and twisted.|$|R
40|$|Strawberry <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mite</b> (Phytonemus pallidus) is {{a severe}} pest in the {{production}} of strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa). The presence of tarsonemid mites in plant material results in a considerable loss of production. Until 2007 the Netherlands mother planting stock for runner production was treated with methyl bromide (MeBr) to eliminate tarsonemids. This chemical disinfestation method is banned from 2008. During recent years research is carried out to replace MeBr preferably by a non-chemical method. After screening a wide range of non chemical disinfestation methods, in 2007 the choice was made to optimize the controlled atmosphere (CA) treatment. Mortality of the tarsonemid mites was over 99. 5 % when CA-treatment during 48 hours was combined with a temperature of 35 °C. CA-treatment can have a slightly negative effect on plant vigour. Compared to the standard MeBr gas fumigation the CA-treatment is at the same level. In 2008 promising results are obtained with up scaling CA-treatment. From 2009 CAtreatment is applied on a large scale by Dutch growers and is replacing MeBr for eliminating tarsonemids in planting stock...|$|E
40|$|The embryo of a <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mite</b> {{was found}} to be {{suitable}} for in vivo observations of muscle development by polarization microscopy. The four dorsal muscles of the metapodosoma each contain three sarcomeres, the anterior two of which can be seen clearly. These sarcomeres can be identified and followed during much of their development. Sarcomeres are about 2. 5 micra long when first detected and increase in length until they are about 10 micra long. The change in length is associated with a slow, approximately constant rate of increase in the length of the A region, and an initially slow then much more rapid increase in the length of the I band. Preceding the period when the I band elongates rapidly there is an increase in the diameter of the muscle fibers and an increase in the retardation of the A band. A, I, Z, and H bands are visible during most of these changes. The change in A band length has been interpreted in terms of the growth of the A filaments which have been observed by electron microscopy in muscles of other animals. It is suggested that the exceptionally long sarcomeres in this mite result from the early fixing of the number of sarcomeres in a given muscle fiber...|$|E
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to MeBr fumigation a 48 h Controlled Atmosphere Temperature Treatment (CATT) was developed and scaled up by Wageningen UR {{in cooperation with the}} Dutch plant propagating association Plantum. This results in an excellent de-infestation and 99. 8 % mortality of the strawberry <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mite</b> (Phytonemus pallidus). This non-chemical and sustainable method provides a healthy production of highly qualified strawberry runners in the field. From 2009 CATT is up scaled to a commercial level and widely applied by Dutch nurseries. In 2011 this CATT method was successfully modified to eradicate also the root knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla (> 99. 7 % mortality), which was not effectively controlled by MeBr fumigation. For an effective killing of the root knot nematodes, temperature must be raised to 40 ºC. In several experiments the optimum conditions for a high mortality of both tarsonemids and nematodes was studied. This leads into an adapted CATT of 20 hours at a temperature of 35 ºC and 50 % CO 2 followed by 20 hours at a temperature of 40 ºC. In 2012 this adapted CATT was successfully upgraded and tested under field conditions. Additional research in 2013 leads to the conclusion that cross infection of plants by the bacterial Q-disease Xanthomonas fragariae during CATT treatment is unlikel...|$|E
40|$|Acaricides {{are one of}} the {{cornerstones}} of {{an efficient}} control program for phytophagous mites. An analysis of the global acaricide market reveals that spider mites such as Tetranychus urticae, Panonychus citri and Panonychus ulmi are by far the most economically important species, representing more than 80 % of the market. Other relevant mite groups are false spider mites (mainly Brevipalpus), rust and gall <b>mites</b> and <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mites.</b> Acaricides are most frequently used in vegetables and fruits (74 % of the market), including grape vines and citrus. However, their use is increasing in major crops where spider mites are becoming more important, such as soybean, cotton and corn. As revealed by a detailed case study of the Japanese market, major shifts in acaricide use are partially driven by resistance development and the commercial availability of compounds with novel mode of action. The importance of the latter cannot be underestimated, although some compounds are successfully used for more than 30 years. A review of recent developments in mode of action research is presented, as such knowledge is important for devising resistance management programs. This includes spirocyclic keto-enols as inhibitors of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the carbazate bifenazate as a mitochondrial complex III inhibitor, a novel class of complex II inhibitors, and the mite growth inhibitors hexythiazox, clofentezine and etoxazole that interact with chitin synthase I...|$|R
40|$|Mites are {{microscopic}} arthropods {{that are}} {{classified in the}} order Acarina. They are not insects but are related to ticks and spiders. There are over 40, 000 described species of mites in the world. Some of them live freely in soil or water; some are found on plants and some are associated with other animals. Due to their small size {{most of them are}} difficult to see with the naked eye. Mites that are plant pests include spider mites (family Tetranychidae), false spider <b>mites</b> (family Tenuipalpidae), <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mites</b> (family Tarsonemidae) and the rust or gall mites (family Eriophyidae). These mites cause damage by piercing plant cells and sucking out their contents. In heavy infestations mites may even kill the host plant. Spider mites are given their name as they often spin characteristic protective silk webs. This family has more than 1000 species, which include some species of quarantine importance, and many species that may cause heavy losses to major food crops and ornamental plants. These include the infamous two-spotted mites Tetranychus urticae, and other major economic spider mite pests, which have been recorded in the Northern Territory e. g. oriental red mite, Eutetranychus orientalis- primarily a pest of citrus; vegetable spider mite, Tetranychus neocaledonicus; and avocado brown mite, Oligonychus punicae. These species attack a wide range of horticultural crops. Mites may cause serious damage to plants but since they are microscopic the...|$|R

40|$|In Benin, the <b>tarsonemid</b> <b>mite</b> Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) (Prostigmata: Tarsonemidae) {{is a key}} pest of gboma {{eggplant}} Solanum macrocarpon (L.) (Solanales: Solanaceae), a {{leafy vegetable}} on which it causes considerable damage to the plants and substantial reduction in yield. Predatory mites in the family Phytoseiidae have been successfully used in the biological control of numerous agricultural pests worldwide. In that respect, a population of the phytoseiid mite Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) {{has been identified as}} a potential predator of P. latus, and is now a candidate for release against this pest in Benin. The objective of the present study is to determine, through laboratory experiments, the predation rate and life table parameters of A. swirskii when feeding on P. latus or alternative food such as maize pollen. Under laboratory conditions the mean number of P. latus consumed by A. swirskii, and daily oviposition, significantly increased as the number of prey increased. Total development time of A. swirskii was significantly shorter when it fed on P. latus than on maize pollen. Net reproduction rate, intrinsic rate of increase, mean generation time and the finite rate of increase of A. swirskii were were all significantly lower on P. latus than on maize pollen. However, doubling time was significantly higher on maize pollen. This study shows that A. swirskii is a good predator of P. latus, and that maize pollen can efficiently sustain A. swirskii populations when P. latus densities on plants become low. Consequently, A. swirskii can be used for the biological control of the broad mite P. latus on gboma eggplant, and on other solanaceous crops in Benin and elsewhere. Peer Revie...|$|E
