5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The stories {{told in the}} Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>story</b> because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects {{the role of the}} ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.|$|E

500|$|Ahalya's tale {{lives on}} in modern-day poetry, {{including}} works by Rabindranath Tagore in Bengali and English; [...] P. T. Narasimhachar's 1940 Kannada poetic drama, Ahalya, which weighs kama against dharma (pleasure against duty); and {{the works of the}} Sanskrit scholar and poet Chandra Rajan.

500|$|As with Angelou's {{previous}} works, {{reviews of}} Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now were generally positive. Mary Jane Lupton compared the essays in Journey to traditional Asian poetry {{and to the}} writings of Confucius. Many reviewers saw similarities between the essays {{in the book and}} Angelou's autobiographical writing. [...] Anne Patterson-Rabon, who was emotionally impacted by Angelou's essays, praised Angelou for her effective use of essays to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>story</b> and to illustrate her points. Lupton compared many of the events and character sketches in this book to descriptions in Angelou's autobiographies. [...] She compared two essays about Angelou's grandmother to the descriptions in Angelou's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and the essay [...] "Extending the Boundaries" [...] to her quarrel with her husband's mistress in The Heart of a Woman. [...] Marigold A. Clark of the Bowling Green, Kentucky Daily News called Journey [...] "an autobiography like none other". [...] She praised Angelou for using [...] "her experiences as examples".|$|E
500|$|... "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{features}} the first appearance of Cynthia Watros as Libby in Lost since the character {{was murdered in}} the second season. Despite a promise by writer's assistant Matt Ragghianti {{that there would be}} an episode in the second season in which flashbacks would focus on Libby, Watros became the first main cast member to never play the central role in a Lost episode. Following Libby's death, Co-creator/executive producer/writer Damon Lindelof revealed plans to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>story</b> in the third season. Libby's story was later postponed again—Lindelof stated that her back story would be told through flashbacks of a new character introduced in the fourth season. Executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse further explained that these flashbacks would unfold over multiple episodes. This failed to materialize; however, Watros made a couple of appearances via hallucinations in Michael's flashbacks in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". The writers asserted that while they had yet to shed light on the character's past, they would finally in their fifth year. The writers later made further revisions, with Cuse concluding that Libby's part in the show is [...] "pretty much finished." [...] When Watros returned to Lost for [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", she did not receive the [...] "special guest star" [...] credit, as was customary for former main cast members of Lost. She was instead billed simply as a guest star, although her name appeared with that of frequent guest star M.C. Gainey ahead of the remainder of the episode's guest cast, who were listed alphabetically on-screen. Gainey explained that [...] "just because they kill you on this show, don't mean they don't need you anymore 'cause everybody's got a past." [...] Damon Lindelof said that [...] "it was sort of like a walk down memory lane for the dead", as it not only included Tom and Libby, but also Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) and George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens), two characters from the freighter who had met their demises earlier in the season.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{developing}} world, hip hop {{has made a}} considerable impact in the social context. Despite the lack of resources, hip hop has made considerable inroads. Due to limited funds, hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools, and even graffiti, {{an important aspect of}} the hip hop culture, is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person. Hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists. There are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age. One example is rapper Awkwafina, an Asian-American, who raps about being Asian as well as being female. She, like many others, use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to [...] "unite" [...] minorities together but to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. But such public rhetoric is not branded hateful and denounced. Charles Small, director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Antisemitism, stated, [...] "Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It's a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for." [...] Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet, has sharply criticized politicians who he claims offer [...] "weak excuses" [...] for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. [...] "Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying the behavior of these kids is in some way our fault."

2500|$|In early 2010, the Swedish {{publication}} The Local published {{series of}} articles about the growing antisemitism in Malmö, Sweden. In 2009, the Malmö police received reports of 79 antisemitic incidents, which was {{twice the number of}} the previous year (2008). Fredrik Sieradzki, spokesman for the Malmö Jewish community, estimated that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year. [...] "Malmö is a place to move away from," [...] he said, citing antisemitism as the primary reason. In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told Die Presse, an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being [...] "harassed and physically attacked" [...] by [...] "people from the Middle East," [...] although he added that {{only a small number of}} Malmö's 40,000 Muslims [...] "exhibit hatred of Jews."

In December 2010, the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express [...] "extreme caution" [...] when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an alleged increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens in the city of Malmö. Ilmar Reepalu, the mayor of Malmö for over 15 years, has been accused of failing to protect the Jewish community in Malmö, causing 30 Jewish families to leave the city in 2010, and more preparing to leave, which has left the possibility that Malmö's Jewish community will disappear soon. Critics of Reepalu say that his statements, such as antisemitism in Malmö actually being an [...] "understandable" [...] consequence of Israeli policy in the Middle East, have encouraged young Muslims to abuse and harass the Jewish community. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph in February 2010, Reepalu said, [...] "There haven't been any attacks on Jewish people, and if Jews from the city want to move to Israel that is not a matter for Malmö," [...] which renewed concerns about Reepalu.|$|E
