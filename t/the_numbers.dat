The letter component of the name corresponds to a zone of the state; zones A–F are in the Lower Peninsula while G and H are in the Upper Peninsula. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> correspond to a numbered grid within each lettered zone. Other county systems are designated and maintained in each of the 83counties, and signage and numbering practices vary.

The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
