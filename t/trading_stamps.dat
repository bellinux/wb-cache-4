25|$|In 1927, William Golub and his brother, Bernard, {{took over}} the {{wholesale}} grocery that their father, Lewis Golub, had opened in 1908 after emigrating from Russia. In 1932, Joseph E. Grosberg, together with Russian Jewish immigrants Bernard and William Golub, partners in the Grosberg-Golub Corporation, opened their first supermarket (initially called Public Service Market) in Green Island, New York, followed by stores in Watervliet and Schenectady. They gave all three stores the name Central Market. The concept was a success and they continued to open many more stores in the region. In 1943, the Golub brothers bought out Joseph Grosberg's share {{of the company and}} formed the present parent company, the Golub Corporation. In 1951, they were one of the first grocery chains in the country to issue the well-known S Green <b>Trading</b> <b>Stamps.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ralph Burger {{attempted}} to reverse downward tonnage figures by reintroducing <b>trading</b> <b>stamps,</b> creating A's Plaid Stamps. However, by late 1962, the initial sales gains evaporated {{and the six}} outside directors threatened to resign unless Burger retired. When Burger left in May 1963, the stock was trading in the $30s. Burger was replaced with a succession of presidents who were unable to stem the downward spiral. In 1971, the board turned to William J. Kane, who joined A in 1934 as a full-time store clerk. Kane believed that A could be turned around by focusing on basic store operations, including cleanliness, product availability, customer service, and courtesy. When his program stalled, Kane implemented a strategy to substantially cut prices by converting A to a warehouse store concept that became known as W.E.O. Warehouse Economy Outlet (or Where Economy Originates). The problem was that most A were not large enough to properly implement the program; losses quickly mounted. In early 1973, the stock dropped to $17, and Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf+Western made a tender offer at $20 per share. Kane rejected the offer, although some stockholders thought that the offer was attractive considering A's continuing difficulties. A exited California and Washington State in 1971 and 1974, respectively, making Missouri its westernmost reach. In 1974, the corporation also left its long-time headquarters in the Graybar Building, moving to Montvale, New Jersey.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his {{two terms}} in Parliament, Proudfoot was {{particularly}} vocal on matters {{relating to the}} retail sector. During his first term (1959 to 1964) he was an early advocate of decimal coinage and opposed the use of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps.</b> He supported capital punishment whenever that was debated. Proudfoot never held ministerial office although he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Keith Joseph (minister of housing and local government) between 1961 and 1963. During his second term (1970 to 1974) he was very vocal {{on the subject of}} commercial radio while legislation to allow it was being enacted.

In 1970 he engaged as his secretary one Christine Holman, who was later to marry the politician Neil Hamilton and become famous under her married name.|$|E
6000|$|Her way lay along Faber Street, {{the main}} artery of Hampton, a wide strip of asphalt {{threaded}} with car tracks, lined {{on both sides}} with incongruous edifices indicative of a rapid, undiscriminating, and artless prosperity. There were long stretches of [...] "ten foot" [...] buildings, so called on account of the single story, their height deceptively enhanced by the superimposition of huge and gaudy signs, one on top of another, announcing the merits of [...] "Stewart's Amberine Ale," [...] of [...] "Cooley's Oats, the Digestible Breakfast Food," [...] of graphophones and [...] "spring heeled" [...] shoes, tobacco, and naphtha soaps. [...] "No, We don't give <b>Trading</b> <b>Stamps,</b> Our Products are Worth all You Pay." [...] These [...] "ten foot" [...] stores were the repositories of pianos, automobiles, hardware, and millinery, and interspersed amongst them were buildings of various heights; The Bagatelle, where Lise worked, the Wilmot Hotel, office buildings, and an occasional relic of old Hampton, like that housing the Banner. Here, during those months when the sun made the asphalt soft, on a scaffolding spanning the window of the store, might be seen a perspiring young man in his shirt sleeves chalking up baseball scores for the benefit of a crowd below. Then came the funereal, liver-coloured, long-windowed Hinckley Block (1872), and on the corner a modern, glorified drugstore thrusting forth plate glass bays--two on Faber Street and three on Stanley--filled with cameras and candy, hot water bags, throat sprays, catarrh and kidney cures, calendars, fountain pens, stationery, and handy alcohol lamps. Flanking the sidewalks, symbolizing and completing the heterogeneous and bewildering effect of the street were long rows of heavy hemlock trunks, unpainted and stripped of bark, with crosstrees bearing webs of wires. Trolley cars rattled along, banging their gongs, trucks rumbled across the tracks, automobiles uttered frenzied screeches behind startled pedestrians. Janet was always galvanized into alertness here, Faber Street being no place to dream. By night an endless procession moved up one sidewalk and down another, staring hypnotically at the flash-in and flash-out electric, signs that kept the breakfast foods and ales, the safety razors, soaps, and soups incessantly in the minds of a fickle public.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> grew {{with the}} spread of chain {{gasoline}} stations in the early 1910s and the then new industry of chain supermarkets in the 1920s. Merchants found it more profitable to award them to all customers rather than cash only customers. Legal challenges {{regarding the use of}} <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> were raised in various jurisdictions around the United States but were often struck down. Some merchant groups disliked <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> and actively worked to have them banned in their areas. Following World War II the use of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> expanded when supermarkets began issuing them as a customer incentive. By 1957 it was estimated that nearly 250,000 retail outlets were issuing <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> with nearly two thirds of American households saving various <b>trading</b> <b>stamps.</b> During this time trading stamp companies had between 1,400 - 1,600 retail centers where consumers could redeem their <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> for consumer goods. In the early 1960s, the S&H Green Stamps company boasted that it printed more stamps annually than the number of postage stamps printed by the US government. In 1968 it was reported that more than $900 million in stamps were sold in the United States.|$|E
