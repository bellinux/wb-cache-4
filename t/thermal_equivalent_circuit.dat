40|$|Axial flux {{permanent}} magnet generators are of particular interest for power generation in harsh and confined conditions. Due to their compactness and high power density, the ventilation and cooling inside axial flux {{permanent magnet}} generators have becoming increasingly important for further performance improvement. This thesis describes the developments of a lumped parameter, thermal modelling technique for axial flux {{permanent magnet generators}}. The main aim {{of this research is}} to develop a fast and accurate thermal modelling tool which can be used for rapid machine design and ultimately, to replace complex and time consuming CFD analyses in the machine design process. The thesis illustrates the construction of a generic <b>thermal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuit,</b> which comprises of conductive and convective sub-circuits, to model the conduction and convection heat transfers and temperature distributions in the radial and axial directions, within these machines. The conduction heat transfer between the solid components of these electrical machines is modelled by an annulus conductive thermal circuit derived from previous researchers; whereas, for convection heat transfer between the working fluid (air) and solids, the author has developed two convective thermal circuits, which are demonstrated as the Temperature Passing Method (TPM) and Heat Pick-up method in (HPM) in the thesis. Several case studies were designed to investigate the validity and accuracy of these thermal sub-circuits with both steady and transient boundary conditions. Since all the thermal impedances and capacitances used in the thermal circuits are in dimensionless form, the developed generic <b>thermal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuit</b> is capable of performing thermal simulations for axial flux generators of different sizes and topologies. Furthermore, special correction factors were introduced into the developed generic <b>thermal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{to take into account the}} heat transfer in the circumferential direction in axial flux machines. The thesis also demonstrates how the heat transfer in the stator windings is modelled in the generic <b>thermal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuit.</b> Two analytical models, which are the Simple Concentric Model (SCM) and Concentric-annulus Layer Model (CLM) were developed, for the evaluation of the thermal resistances of the stator windings. The results evaluated from these analytical models were validated by several numerical models and experimental results of two-phase materials published by previous researchers. Lastly, experimental validation of the lumped parameter <b>thermal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuit</b> model and CFD simulations was conducted. Heat transfer coefficient measurements were carried out on two separate test rigs, which were a simplified single-sided axial flux machine test rig and a large-scale low speed axial flux machine. The experimental results were compared with the numerical results obtained from both the lumped parameter and CFD models. Good agreement between the experimental, lumped parameter model and CFD results were found. These indicate that the developed generic thermal circuit is potentially capable of replacing CFD analyses in the axial flux machines design process. ...|$|E

In addition, a <b>thermal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuit</b> (TEC) model is established to predict the temperature throughout the transformer and to account for temperature impact on winding resistances.

Thus, {{there is a need for}} HVDC circuit breakers, in which development is challenging: The circuit breaker must interrupt the current typically within 5 ms. The circuit breaker itself must provide the zero current crossing, as no natural zero crossing is exciting in DC grids. The circuit breaker must dissipate the magnetic energy provided by the line inductance The circuit breaker must withstand residual overvoltages after current interruption This master thesis describes the development of a solid state dc circuit breaker for the DC grid in the NTNU/SINTEF Smart Grid and Renewable Energy Systems Laboratory.

Thermomechanical stresses produced by temperature variations during operational and environmental loads are the major causes of IGBT degradation. As the devices are often operated under complex working conditions, temperature variations and the associated damage are difficult to predict during the converter design stage. A promising approach—online health monitoring and prognosis for power semiconductor devices—that can avoid device failure and effectively schedule maintenance has attracted much interest. ^ This dissertation research focused on real-time accurate internal temperature estimation and health condition monitoring for IGBT modules, where real-time means negligible latency. The objectives of this dissertation research were to: 1) develop low-computational-cost thermal models to accurately estimate important internal temperatures, e. g., junction temperature, in real time for better device overtemperature protection and lifetime prediction; and 2) invent a practical technique to monitor the major aging processes of IGBT modules for effective maintenance scheduling. ^ To achieve the first objective, this research developed a cost-effective, physics-based <b>thermal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuit</b> model and a low-order digital filter-based thermal model for IGBT modules. Further, a thermal model adaptive to the solder crack of an IGBT module was developed. This model allows accurate junction temperature monitoring over a device’s lifespan. Additionally, an accurate, frequency domain, transient temperature estimation method for weak points of IGBT modules was developed. The method can be used to determine the bottleneck weak point(s) of IGBT modules. The accurately estimated internal temperatures can be used for more effective operation management of power electronic converters and a more accurate estimation of a device’s remaining useful lifetime (RUL). ^ To achieve the second objective, a new method of using two-dimensional (2 D) case temperatures for real-time monitoring of typical weak points, i. e., bond wire and solder interface, of IGBT modules was invented. This method is based on the physics of failure of IGBT modules and can easily be implemented without complex circuitry. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method is simple to use and does not interrupt the operation of power electronic converters. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a lithium ion cell is strongly related to the temperature. Therefore {{it is important to}} understand the process of heat generation and dissipation inside a single cell but also in battery packs since this is also closely coupled to safety issues. In this study, commercial 18650 lithium ion cells (1. 6 Ah) with LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) cathodes, were tested under isoperibolic and adiabatic conditions in an accelerating rate calorimeter (THT Company) to investigate the heat effects during cycling. Isoperibolic investigations in the range from 25 to 60 °C show that the applied environmental temperature does not largely influence the battery thermal behavior. Additionally, the heat capacity and heat transfer coefficient were measured after calibration. By integrating over the heat dissipation rate and the enthalpy accumulation rate the total generated heat was determined in dependence of discharge C‐rate. Under adiabatic conditions at a C/ 2 discharge rate the temperature on the surface of the cells was increasing over three cycles by 20 °C and a 1 C rate by more than 40 °C before reaching the safety limit temperature of 75 °C. As part of the IKEBA project, the measured cell and temperature data have then been compared to the data coming from simulations that are based on the combination of electric and <b>thermal</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>circuit</b> models. The identification problem of the structure and the parameters of the ECM are discussed in terms of the Current Interruption Technique (CIT). The CIT measurements were carried out at different constant temperatures from ‐ 10 to 60 °C. During the CIT, the cell is gradually charged and discharged in the calorimeter by interrupting the current after defined percentage of state of charge change, followed by a defined relaxation period. From the voltage drop and the relaxation curve look‐up tables (LUT) have been created for the system parameters of the ECM model. To increase the resolution of the LUTs, the SOC was only decreased in 1 % steps by the current pulses. The unknown nonlinear functions for the parameters could then be approximated by interpolation and extrapolation from theLUT’s and could be implemented into the simulation platform which is using the electronic system level (ESL) behavioural languages SystemC and SystemC AMS [1].

It includes the material's nonlinear hysteresis behavior with accurate modeling of winding and core losses in addition to thermal effects that are not considered by existing models. The model {{is based on the}} principle of separation of static and dynamic contributions as well as Bertotti's theory. Very high speed integrated circuits hardware description language-analog and mixed signals is used as a modeling language due to its multi-domain modeling feature, allowing coupling with a thermal model. The thermal model is represented by a temperature source for static thermal conditions or by an <b>equivalent</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>circuit</b> for self-heating conditions. The magnetic component model is implemented in circuit simulation software SIMPLORER and validated by modeling a nanocrystalline-core inductor. The effects of frequency, temperature, and waveform are studied...|$|R
