China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited {{and she was the}} first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng insisted that the PRC's sovereignty on Hong Kong was non-negotiable, but stated his willingness to settle the sovereignty issue with the British government through formal negotiations, and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Patton's final {{assignment}} was {{to command the}} Fifteenth United States Army, based in Bad Nauheim. The Fifteenth Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff tasked to compile {{a history of the}} war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but quickly lost interest in the duty. He began traveling, visiting Paris, Rennes, Chartres, Brussels, Metz, Reims, Luxembourg, and Verdun, as well as Stockholm, where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. Patton decided he would leave his post at the Fifteenth Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for Christmas leave.

25|$|Sonnet 35 {{deals with}} the speaker being angry with the young man for an {{apparent}} betrayal through infidelity. The apparent homoeroticism between the speaker {{and the young man}} has spurred debates about the sexuality of the speaker and consequently Shakespeare himself. There are 3 main points <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>with</b> this issue: the problem of ambiguity in the writing, the possibility of applying an anachronistic view of love and consequently mistaking these sonnets homoerotic, and finally the implications of Shakespeare's life and homosexual tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Following the February 2004 {{murder of}} a fourteen-year-old boy, Vaz asked for an {{investigation}} {{of the relationship between the}} video games and violence, saying the parents of the victim believed that the killer was influenced by the video game Manhunt.

In an attempt to defuse the tense situation of Roșia Montană, Prime Minister Victor Ponta descended into the underground <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>with</b> miners.

25|$|Wreden {{envisioned the}} game after {{considering}} that most major video game titles confine {{the user to}} its rules, and considered how to construct a narrative to challenge that notion. Outside of Brighting's voice work as the narrator, Wreden built the modification himself, initially as a personal project for his career goals but soon expanding to a wider release once he had shown it to friends and other players. The modification received critical attention as a new variation of creating interactive storytelling within a game engine, and provided a thought-provoking narration <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>with</b> others {{on the nature of}} choice and predestination within video games.|$|E

The departure of Federal troops on April 10 caused Governor Chamberlain and the Republican led government to concede the election to Wade Hampton. A day later on April 11, Hampton became the sole and official {{governor of the state of}} South Carolina.|$|E

In response, Chief of the British Air Staff Portal, who was in Yalta, asked Bottomley to send him a list of objectives <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>with</b> the Soviets. Bottomley's list included oil plants, tank and aircraft factories and the cities of Berlin and Dresden. A British interpreter later claimed that Antonov and Joseph Stalin asked for the bombing of Dresden, but {{there is no mention of}} these requests in the official record of the conference and the claim was assessed as possible Cold War propaganda.|$|E
25|$|On 24 April 1965, three junior {{officers}} requested {{a meeting with}} President Donald Cabral Reid. Reid revoked the commission after receiving news of a suspected anti-government plot. When Chief of staff Riviera Cuesta was instead sent <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>with</b> the officers at the 16 of August military camp, he was immediately detained. A group of military constitutionalists and Dominican Revolutionary Party (DRP) supporters then seized the Radio Santo Domingo building, issuing calls of sedition, {{at the same time}} constitutionalist officers distributed weapons and molotov cocktails to their civilian comrades. The transmissions prompted the garrison of the 27 of February camp and a unit of the Dominican Navy's frogmen to defect. Large numbers of police officers abandoned their positions and changed into civilian clothing.|$|E
25|$|President Daoud met Leonid Brezhnev on a {{state visit}} to Moscow from April 12 to 15, 1977.

In particular, he discussed the intensified Soviet attempt to unite the two factions of the Afghan communist parties, Parcham and Khalq. Brezhnev described Afghanistan's non-alignment {{as important to the}} USSR and essential to the promotion of peace in Asia, but warned him about the presence of experts from NATO countries stationed in the northern parts of Afghanistan. Daoud bluntly replied that Afghanistan would remain free, and that the Soviet Union would never be allowed to dictate how the country should be governed.|$|E

Despite these circumstances, President Zedillo decided to launch a military offensive in an attempt to capture or annihilate the EZLN's main spokesperson, a figure around which a cult of personality was already forming.|$|E
