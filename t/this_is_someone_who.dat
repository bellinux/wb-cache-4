2500|$|Hugh Laurie as Senator Tom James: {{a charming}} senator and Selina's new running mate after Doyle leaves the ticket. He is {{extremely}} popular with his colleagues and with voters. Selina {{was reluctant to}} pick him as a running mate {{out of fear that}} he would remember a time they nearly slept together. He frustrates Meyer at his desire to be involved with the economy, {{going so far as to}} request to serve simultaneously as Vice President and Secretary of the Treasury. In the general election, loophole rules in the Constitution dictate that in certain circumstances, James could become the Acting President (and subsequently President), further angering Selina. He offers that, should this occur, he would like her to be his Vice President. She later appoints him as her economy czar. Before the fourth season, Armando Iannucci met with Laurie in the UK after learning that he was a fan of Veep. The two began developing the character Tom James alongside the show's writers (also based in the UK). Iannucci describes Tom James as a [...] "normal, but ambitious operator ... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> seems to outdo [...] in his ability." [...] (Seasons 4–6) ...|$|E

2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} for voter decline in the recent 2016 {{election}} is likely because of restrictive voting laws around the country. Brennan Center for Justice reported that in 2016 fourteen states passed restrictive voting laws. Examples of these laws are photo ID mandates, narrow times for early voter, and limitations on voter registration. Barbour and Wright also believe that one of the causes is restrictive voting laws but they call this system of laws regulating the electorate. The Constitution gives states the power to make decisions regarding restrictive voting laws. In 2008 the Supreme Court made a crucial decision regarding Indiana’s voter ID law in saying that it does not violate the constitution. Since then almost half of the states have passed restrictive voting laws. These laws contribute to Barbour and Wrights idea of the rational nonvoter. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> does not vote because the benefits of them not voting outweighs the cost to vote. These laws add to the “cost” of voting, or reason that make it more difficult and to vote. In the United States programs such as MTV's [...] "Rock the Vote" [...] and the [...] "Vote or Die" [...] initiatives have been introduced to increase turnouts of those between the ages of 18 and 25. A number of governments and electoral commissions have also launched efforts to boost turnout. For instance Elections Canada has launched mass media campaigns to encourage voting prior to elections, as have bodies in Taiwan and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5000|$|As {{originally}} written, Jerry Dandrige {{was more}} villainous, so Sarandon {{tried to find}} various ways to humanize the vampire, including suggesting the implication that the Amy character was the reincarnation of his long-lost love. [...] "I {{wanted to give the}} audience something to hold onto in terms of understanding that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> at one time--and still is, in certain respects--a thinking, feeling human being," [...] Sarandon said. [...] "This {{is a man who has}} been hunted for all his post-human existence, but who has fallen in love a number of times and who, in a sense, longs for a normal existence." [...] Sarandon also did research into bats and discovered that the bulk of the world's bat population are Frugivores, so he concluded, [...] "Jerry had a lot of fruit bat in his DNA."

[...] Hugh WilsonAdelphi Universityprofessor In late 1990, Ferguson transferred to Adelphi University in Garden City, where he majored in business administration. Ferguson spoke out against coexistence with whites and routinely made calls for retributive revolution. Ferguson regularly accused others around him of racism. During one occasion, Ferguson complained that a white woman in the library shouted racial epithets at him after he asked her about a class assignment. An investigation concluded the incident never occurred. Later, Ferguson attended a symposium by a faculty member discussing her experiences in South Africa. Ferguson interrupted the professor by shouting, [...] "We should be talking about the revolution in South Africa and how {{to get rid of the}} white people" [...] and [...] "Kill everybody white!" [...] When students and teachers tried to quiet him, Ferguson started threatening them, repeatedly saying, [...] "The black revolution will get you." [...] He was suspended from the school in June 1991 as a result of the threats, and although he was free to reapply after the suspension, he chose not to do so.|$|R

In his recent book, Dr. Henderson described Simonson’s role in launching the post-9/11 public health preparedness program at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: “Another important figure was Stewart Simonson, special counsel and long-time confidante of the secretary.
