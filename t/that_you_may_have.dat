By our oral teaching we encourage you too to strive <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> part in His gifts and enjoy them, the gifts of which we, though unworthy, have been partakers through His unutterable goodness.

500|$|Upon its release, it {{received}} positive reviews from music critics. A staff member at CD Journal was positive, complimenting the songwriting {{on how it}} holds a [...] "sharp message" [...] for listeners to understand. The review concluded with the reviewer labeling it [...] "exhilarating". In a similar review, The News Hub's Can Hoang Tran said that [...] "There are times <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> rewound the anime to the very beginning just {{to listen to the}} theme song. I consider myself part of that group of anime let alone Gate fans." [...] He called it one of 2015's [...] "catchy and [...] " [...] anime theme songs. Josh Piedra from The Outerhaven enjoyed the song as a [...] "Kyoudan fan", but stated that [...] "The opening song is a catchy one... but it still sounds like your typical mainstream J-Rock with female lead vocals." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "A trim, grim, vicious, and {{incredibly}} effective action movie with no cut comic-relief bit players, no winks at the audience, and no stars. Just a powder keg of a premise (lifted {{in part from}} Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo), in which a quasi-terrorist group's killing spree culminates in the action described in the title. Carpenter's mastery of wide-screen and almost uncanny talent at crafting suspense and action sequences make Assault such a nerve-racking experience <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> to reupholster your easy chair after watching it at home." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's [...] "most startling" [...] {{song was}} {{considered}} [...] "What About," [...] in which Jackson violently confronts domestic abuse. Jackson stated, [...] "I think it's important to let others know that certain things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> experienced in your life, and that they're not alone, {{and that you}} understand what they're going through, {{and that they can}} make it through." [...] Joel Lyans included it among [...] "The New Soundtrack of Social Consciousness," [...] writing, [...] "Here, Janet does what she does best: demonstrates a coy and shy demeanor before ripping into a confident and empowered voice for those who are afraid to speak up and speak out about a situation that plagues millions of women." [...] Several media reports related its theme with President Bill Clinton's infidelity to Hillary Clinton with Monica Lewinsky. Jackson clarified it to be about her own experience, saying, [...] "President Clinton? People have said that to me. They say 'this is his song'," [...] comparing the situation with her song [...] "This Time" [...] inaccurately related to O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson due to its subject matter.|$|E
2500|$|Young Money in the making, premiered 'Moment 4 Life' January 27, 2011 @ 7:54 PM ET, on MTV (along with an {{interview}} with Minaj). The video takes part in a type of Minaj-assisted fairy tale from a book. The video begins with Minaj sitting by a boudoir as Martha Zolanski appears as Minaj's fairy godmother. After discussing how Roman and Slim Shady {{have been sent to}} boarding school, Martha informs Nicki that this kind of fairy tale is different from ones she's seen, stating [...] "These kinds of nights are fleeting and usually end by mid-night. But my fairy god mother senses tell me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> this moment for life." [...] The song begins as Martha gifts Minaj with a special pair of heels. During Minaj's verse she is seen walking into a ballroom as she is spotted by Drake. When the two meet in a hall, Drake performs his verse with Minaj by a fireplace. During the climax of the song, Drake and Minaj walk down the aisle, where they share a wedding kiss by fireworks as the clock strikes midnight.|$|E

2500|$|God's admonishes Joshua in [...] "to observe to do {{according}} to all the law, which Moses My servant commanded you; turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> good success wherever you go. This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do {{according to}} all that is written therein; for then you shall make your ways prosperous, and then you shall have good success."

2500|$|Arthur C. Parker, Secretary of the Society of American Indians from 1911 to 1915, {{regarded}} McKenzie as the [...] "father of the movement." [...] McKenzie {{respected the}} Society's mantra of [...] "for Indians and by Indians" [...] and understood Indians' distrust of Whites. McKenzie downplayed {{his role as}} [...] "Local Representative" [...] for the Society and worked behind the scenes. He wrote to Parker, [...] "Whatever I may say is subject to two suspicions: First that my race prevents me understanding the situation. Second, that I may have some ulterior motive." [...] "I am always embarrassed by {{doubt in my mind}} as to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence. Everyone who says anything to me tells me to proceed and that the Indians have confidence in me and I am glad and believe that is so, even though doubtful as to what extent that confidence involves action." [...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> to do it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for." [...] Parker teamed with McKenzie to manage the Society and navigate politics. Responsibilities included publications, planning conferences, drafting and lobbying legislation and membership services.|$|E
