5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved <b>to</b> <b>Atlanta</b> <b>to</b> be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E

On January 25, 2005, Magnapop released Mouthfeel on Amy Ray's record label Daemon Records and supported it with a tour through the United States. By 2005, Fletcher had left the group, and drummer Chad Williams had been recruited to replace him on two weeks prior to the first show on the Mouthfeel tour that included an appearance at South by Southwest. One of these performances was recorded for the band's first live album—Magnapop Live at Maxwell's 03/09/2005—which they released independently through online music distributors including eMusic, the iTunes Store, and Rhapsody. In May 2006, the band completed a tour of Belgium and The Netherlands and returned <b>to</b> <b>Atlanta</b> <b>to</b> begin work on the followup to Mouthfeel. They continued touring Europe in 2007 and completed writing and recording for a new album sometime prior to 2008, with the album initially slated {{to be released in}} summer 2009. These sessions recorded with Brian Paulson were released as Chase Park on September 4, 2009, through digital distributors by the band's own, newly created label, The Kraft Records.|$|E

25|$|Nicholson became {{nationally known}} to drag racing fans {{when he won}} the Stock class at NHRA's first Winternationals in 1961 with a 12-second pass.

He received lucrative offers from promoters in the Southeastern United States, so moved <b>to</b> <b>Atlanta</b> <b>to</b> compete in match races. Chevrolet and the other American car manufacturers decided to drop their factory backing in 1963 and his vehicle became uncompetitive. He switched to a Mercury Comet for 1964 in the A/Factory Experimental (A/FX) division. He won over 90 percent of match races he entered that year. That year he made the first 10-second pass in a doorslammer, as well as being the first driver to lift the front wheels when he shifted gears.|$|E

25|$|Looking to {{distance}} themselves from the Yankees, the Blue Jays travelled to Boston for the final time in the 2015 season to battle the last-place Red Sox. Mark Buehrle, who had been pushed back two days due to fatigue, lasted only 3 innings as the Blue Jays fell to the Red Sox 11–4 in game 1, and saw their lead over New York shrink to just a half-game. The second game of the series went into extra innings, tied 1–1, before the Toronto offence scored four runs {{in the top of the}} tenth inning to win 5–1. As the Yankees lost that day, the Blue Jays regained a 1 game lead in the division. The Jays were unable to take the series, however, as in the final game they were defeated 10–4. New York also lost, so the Toronto lead remained 1 games. The Blue Jays would then head to New York for a four-game series, one which many analysts dubbed the most important of the year for Toronto. The first game was postponed due to rain, and a doubleheader was scheduled for September 12. David Price pitched in the opener and earned his sixth win with the Jays, defeating the Yankees 11–5. In the first game of the doubleheader, the Blue Jays won 9–5 in the eleventh inning, and guaranteed that they would leave New York leading the AL East. However, they lost shortstop Troy Tulowitzki to a cracked shoulder blade following a collision with center fielder Kevin Pillar. The second game of the doubleheader would see the return of Marcus Stroman, who pitched five innings and allowed 3 runs before being removed from the game due to a 33-minute rain delay. The Blue Jays led 6–3 at the time of the delay, and would go on to win the game 10–7, taking a 4 game lead over New York. Before the final game of the series, Alex Anthopouos announced that Tulowitzki would miss 2–3 weeks with the injury. Toronto would again be shut down by Yankees' starter Masahiro Tanaka, losing 5–0. Edwin Encarnacion did not play in the game due to a finger injury, but was not expected to miss additional time. The Blue Jays had an off-day following their series in New York, and travelled <b>to</b> <b>Atlanta</b> <b>to</b> take on the Braves in their final regular season series outside of the AL East. Mark Buehrle made his return to the rotation after leaving to get a cortisone shot in his left shoulder, but the Blue Jays would lose the first game of the series, 3–2. David Price would start the second game of the series and earn his 7th win as a Blue Jay, pitching 7 innings and beating the Braves 9–1. In the final game of the series, the Blue Jays would shutout the Braves, 5–0. Marco Estrada allowed just 3 hits and 2 walks against Atlanta, while Edwin Encarnacion, Josh Donaldson, and Cliff Pennington hit home runs for Toronto, ending their 10-game road trip with a 6–4 record and a 3-game lead for the AL East.|$|E
