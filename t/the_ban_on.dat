5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition.

Opponents of lifting <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting <b>the</b> <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
