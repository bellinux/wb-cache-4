40|$|Inventory and {{characterization}} schemes play {{different roles}} in shaping {{a variety of}} footprint indicators. This paper performs a systematic and critical investigation of the hidden inventory aspect and characterization aspect of selected footprints with implications for classification and integration of those footprints. It shows {{that all of the}} carbon, water, land and material footprints have two fundamentally distinct versions, addressing the environmental exchange of substances in terms of emissions and/or extractions either at the inventory level or at the impact assessment level. We therefore differentiate two broad categories of footprints, namely the inventory-oriented footprints and the impact-oriented footprints. The former allow for a physical interpretation of human pressure by inventorying emissions and extractions and aggregating them with value-based weighting factors, whereas the latter assess and aggregate the inventory results according to their potential contributions to a specific environmental impact using science-based characterization factors, with the recognition that these contributing substances are <b>too</b> <b>different</b> <b>to</b> be <b>compared</b> by mass, volume or area. While both categories have individual strengths and weaknesses, the impact-oriented footprints have a better performance than the inventory-oriented footprints on the integration of footprints into a single-score metric in support of policy making. Resembling the general procedure for life cycle impact assessment, we formulate a three-step framework for characterization, normalization and weighting of a set of impact-oriented footprints to yield a composite footprint index, which would allow policy makers to better assess the overall environmental impacts of entities at multiple scales ranging from single products, organizations, nations, even to the whole economy. The main value added of this paper is the establishment of a unified framework for structuring, categorizing and integrating different footprints. It may serve {{as a starting point for}} clearing the footprint jungle and for facilitating the ongoing discourse on a truly integrated footprint family...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We discuss {{aspects of}} recent novel {{approaches}} towards understanding the large N limit of matrix field theories with local or global non-abelian symmetry. The large N limit of field theories whose local {{degrees of freedom}} are N × N matrices continues to intrigue physicists since its discovery by ‘t Hooft 25 years ago [1]. This is striking {{given the fact that}} no field theory with propagating matrix degrees of freedom has up to now been exactly solved by large N techniques. Certainly, one reason for this continuing interest is the significant evidence that this limit indeed entails important simplifications. Furthermore, in the most interesting cases, physics appears <b>to</b> be not <b>too</b> <b>different</b> as <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the finite N case. Lastly, a new aspect of “large N ” has appeared over the years: N = ∞ may not only be a reasonable and tractable approximation to some theory, but may also define the theory. Indeed, we know this to be true in some simple cases such as non-critical string theory, and now there are serious proposals for the case of “real ” (i. e. critical, supersymmetric) string theory and 11 -dimensional M-theory. One of the above mentioned simplifications that seems to occur can be roughly summarized by the correspondenc...|$|R
