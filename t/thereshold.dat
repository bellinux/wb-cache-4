40|$|The one-bit {{quantization}} can {{be implemented}} by one single comparator, which operates at low power and a high rate. Hence one-bit compressive sensing (1 bit-CS) becomes very attractive in signal processing. When the measurements are corrupted by noise during signal acquisition and transmission, 1 bit-CS is usually modeled as minimizing a loss function with a sparsity constraint. The existing loss functions include the hinge loss and the linear loss. Though 1 bit-CS {{can be regarded as}} a binary classification problem because a one-bit measurement only provides the sign information, the choice of the hinge loss over the linear loss in binary classification is not true for 1 bit-CS. Many experiments show that the linear loss performs better than the hinge loss for 1 bit-CS. Motivated by this observation, we consider the pinball loss, which provides a bridge between the hinge loss and the linear loss. Using this bridge, two 1 bit-CS models and two corresponding algorithms are proposed. Pinball loss iterative hard thresholding improves the performance of the binary iterative hard <b>theresholding</b> proposed in [6] and is suitable for the case when the sparsity of the true signal is given. Elastic-net pinball support vector machine generalizes the passive model proposed in [11] and is suitable for the case when the sparsity of the true signal is not given. A fast dual coordinate ascent algorithm is proposed to solve the elastic-net pinball support vector machine problem, and its convergence is proved. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the pinball loss, as a trade-off between the hinge loss and the linear loss, improves the existing 1 bit-CS models with better performances.

Combined equalization consists in performing both pre-equalization at the transmitter and post-equalization at the receiver in order to counteract fading and multi user interference. In this paper we consider partial combining (PC) at the transmitter and threshold orthogonality restoring combining (TORC) at the receiver in the downlink of a MC-CDMA system affected by fading. The analytical framework here proposed allows the derivation of the bit error probability (BEP) and the bit error outage (BEO) and their dependence on the number of subcarriers, the number of active users, the mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) averaged over smallscale fading, the partial combining parameter and the threshold of the detector.

A dipole degree of freedom, well described by the spectrum generating algebra U(4) and the Vibron Model, is a most natural concept in molecular physics. It has been suggested by Iachello with much debate, to be most important for understanding the low lying structure of nuclei and other hadrons. After its first observation in $^{ 18 }O$ it was also shown to be relevant for the structure of heavy nuclei (e. g. $^{ 218 }Ra$). Much like the Ar-benzene molecule, it is shown that molecular configurations are important near threshold as exhibited by states with a large halo and strong electric dipole transitions. The cluster-molecular Sum Rule derived by Alhassid, Gai and Bertsch (AGB) is shown to be a very useful model independent tool for examining such dipole molecular structure near <b>thereshold.</b> Accordingly, the dipole strength observed in the halo nuclei such as $^ 6 He, ^{ 11 }Li, ^{ 11 }Be, ^{ 17 }O$, as well as the N= 82 isotones is concentrated around threshold and it exhausts a large fraction (close to 100 %) of the AGB sum rule, but a small fraction (a few percent) of the TRK sum rule.

40|$|In {{the active}} matrix {{liquid crystal display}} {{industry}} the latest achievements is the increase of the display dimensions, the resolution and {{the reduction of the}} production cost. The first is achieved by increasing the dimensions of the surface of the deposition systems. The thin-film transistors (TFTs) that are used as switching elements in the driver circuits of the liquid crystal displays, are usually manyfactured by hydrogenated amorpous silicon (a-Si:H) because it can be deposited at lower temperatures, on larger surfaces and on cheaper glass substrates. However, the low carrier mobility and the poor stability that the a-Si:H TFTs have, makes them unsuitable for the integration of the driver circuits with the displays. The thin-film transistors have higher stability and carrier mobility and this makes them better choise for high speed, intrinsic stability and higher resolution displays. The disadvantage is the higher temperature that is needed for the crystallization of a-Si:H and the expensive glass substrates, which increases the production cost. The hydrogenated nanocrystalline thin film transistors (nc-Si:H) have been proposed as alternative material for the a-Si:H and polycrystalline silicon because they can be deposited in large area and at low temperature (250 - 400 °C) by using different deposition techniques. In addition, this material has better stability under light and electrical stress, in comparison with a-Si:H. Until today, for the production of the TFTs have been used nc-Si:H thin films at low temperature in basic research small deposition systems and have been produced transistors with better transfer properties than a-Si:H transistors. In addition, in the international bibliography have been reported TFTs with high carrier mobility and high stability under electrical stress. So, it is a challenge to maintain these electrical properties of the TFTs in industrial systems and keep the low deposition temperature over large area, so that low cost glass substrates will be used. For the research for this thesis, at the beginning bottom gate n-channel nc-Si:H TFTs have been studied. The large drain leakage current is the main disadvantage and extended research has shown that it increases with the absolute value of the gate voltage and is produced at the drain junction. It has been found that it consists by two basic mechansms, the Poole-Frenkel (PF) at the low electric fields and the band-to-band tunneling effect. at the high electric fields. The effect of the channel dimensions on the electric properties of the TFTs was investigated at the next stage. Experimental measurements of the transfer and output characteristics of the bottom gate n-channel nc-Si:H TFTs showed that there are two conduction channels. The front conduction channel is at the interface nc-Si/SiNx which is closer to the gate terminal and the back conduction channel is at the nc-Si/SiNx interface which is closer to the source and drain terminals. Investigating the dependence on the channel length on similar devices, it was found that reducing the length from 20 to 2 μm, the <b>thereshold</b> voltage and the characteristic slope of the back interface conduction are increased, whereas the electron mobility is decreased. Contrary to the back interface conduction slope, the front interface slope remains unchanged, independent of the channel dimensions. The overall results suggest that in order to suppress the back channel conduction, it is necessary to reduce the nc-Si film thickness to ensure full film depletion with negative bias applied to the gate. To reduce the leakage current of the TFTs that is observed mainly at the negative gate voltages, transistors with two layers as active channels were made These TFTs had a bilayer nc-Si:H/a-Si:H n-channel with gate at the back side. The improvement was the additional a-Si:H layer that was deposited between the nc-Si:H layer and the drain and source contacts. To study the energy distribution of the traps in the material, low frequency noise measurements were taken and revealed a 1 /f noise which is originated in the carrier number fluctuations in the linear region of operation of the TFTs. For the devices with long channel (L= 20 μm) the observed 1 /Id variation for the normalized drain current noise at low currents is following the Hooge’s mobility fluctuations model. dominate at low drain currents. At high drain currents, the normalized drain current noise density behaviour indicates the dominance of the 1 /f noise generated in the series resistance. The dependence of the behaviour of the nc-Si:H/a-Si:H bilayer TFTs on the channel dimensions was investigated and was found that the leakage current and the back channel conduction were improved due to the presence of the second a-Si:H layer.
