40|$|Atomoxetine (originally named <b>tomoxetine),</b> a new {{therapy for}} {{attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) marketed by Eli Lilly, was compared to methylphenidate in a prospective, randomized, open-label study for 10 weeks duration, at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Carolinas Medical Center, and Lilly Research Laboratories...|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} norepinephrine (NE) transporter inhibitor atomoxetine (formerly called <b>tomoxetine</b> or LY 139603) {{has been}} shown to alleviate symptoms in Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We investigated the mechanism of action of atomoxetine in ADHD by evaluating the interaction of atomoxetine with monoamine transporters, the effects on extracellular levels of monoamines, and the expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos in brain regions. Atomoxetine inhibited binding of radioligands to clonal cell lines transfected with human NE, serotonin (5 -HT) and dopamine (DA) transporters with dissociation constants (K...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Strattera ® is the {{commercial}} {{name for the}} drug <b>tomoxetine,</b> which {{is now known as}} atomoxetine. The ‘ 590 Patent is a method-of-use patent which claims methods of treating Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) with atomoxetine. Claim 1 of the patent covers: ACase 2 : 07 -cv- 03770 -DMC-MF Document 494 Filed 12 / 31 / 09 Page 2 of 43 method of treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of <b>tomoxetine.</b> Claims 2 - 16 cover specific treatment plans for subtypes of ADHD, and for certain groups of patients. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants infringed the ‘ 590 Patent when they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDA”) with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) seeking approval to market a generic version of Plaintiff’s Strattera ® drug products. Defendants notified Plaintiff in separate notice letters that they intended to sell generic atomoxetine capsules. In these letters, Defendants alleged that the ‘ 590 Patent was invalid, unenforceable or would not be infringed by the sale of generic atomoxetine capsules. Plaintiff brings this action for infringement of the ‘ 590 Patent against all Defendants. Defendants respond that Plaintiff’s patent is unenforceable and/or invalid based upon: inequitabl...|$|E
40|$|Most {{drugs are}} {{prescribed}} for several illnesses, {{but it took}} several years for psychotropic drugs to have multiple clinical indications. Our search for serotonergic drugs in affective illnesses and related disorders led to new off-label indications for fluoxetine, sertraline, tryptophan, clonazepam, alprazolam, <b>tomoxetine,</b> buproprion, duloxetine, risperidone and gabapentin. Various clinical trial designs were used for these proof-of-concept studies. Novel therapeutic uses of benzodiazepines, such as in panic disorder and mania, were found {{with the introduction of}} 2 high-potency benzodiazepines, clonazepam and alprazolam, which were thought to have serotonergic properties. Our initial clinical trials of fluoxetine and sertraline led to their approved indications in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder, and our trials of gabapentin led to new indications in anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, panic attack and social phobia) and sleep disorders (insomnia) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of new approaches to obtain optically pure β-hydroxy esters is an important area in synthetic organic chemistry since they are precursors of other high value compounds. Herein, the kinetic resolution of racemic β-hydroxy esters using a planar-chiral DMAP derivative catalyst is presented. Following this procedure, a range of aromatic β-hydroxy esters was obtained in excellent selectivities (up to s = 107) and high enantiomeric excess (up to 99 % ee). Furthermore, {{the utility of the}} present method was demonstrated in the synthesis of (S) - 3 -hydroxy-N-methyl- 3 -phenylpropanamide, a key intermediate for bioactive molecules such as fluoxetine, <b>tomoxetine</b> or nisoxetine, in its enantiomerically pure form.

40|$|Rhesus monkeys (n = 6), {{trained in}} a two-lever, food-reinforced {{paradigm}} to discriminate cocaine (0. 2 or 0. 4 mg/kg, i. m.) from saline, received injections of cocaine (0. 025 - 0. 40 mg/kg, i. v. or i. m.) or various {{direct and indirect}} acting agonists (i. v.). Admin-istration of cocaine resulted in a dose-related increase {{in the percentage of}} responses that occurred on the drug-appropriate lever. The indirect dopamine agonists GBR 1 2909 (0. 2 - 1. 6 mgI kg), mazindol (0. 025 - 0. 4 mg/kg), nomifensine (0. 025 - 0. 2 mgI kg) and bupropion (0. 1 - 1. 6 mg/kg) each produced dose-related increases in cocaine-appropriate responding, with complete sub-stitution for cocaine achieved at the highest doses of each drug. In contrast, the norepinephnne re-uptake blockers <b>tomoxetine</b> (0. 8 - 6. 4 mg/kg) and nisoxetine (0. 4 - 1. 6 mg/kg), the serotonin re-uptake blocker fluoxetine (1. 6 - 1 2. 8 mg/kg), the D 1 agonis...|$|E
40|$|Serotonin and {{norepinephrine}} neurotransmitters {{are intimately}} involved {{in a number of}} neurochemical and physiological processes, such as depression and pain disorders. Selective serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are the important class of antidepressants, such as fluoxetine, niso-xetine, <b>tomoxetine,</b> and duloxetine featuring the structural similarity of 1 -ary- 3 -aminopropanol. 1 Among them, duloxe-tine belongs to a class of antidepressant drugs that simultane-ously inhibit the reuptake of serotonin as well as norepine-phrine. Even though duloxetine was originally marketed as a racemic mixture, (S) -enantiomeric form is now available since it has substantially beneficial biological effects com-pared with its antipode. 2 This also could draw much atten-tion for the preparation of enantiomerically pure duloxetine. Currently, (S) -duloxetine is prescribed for the treatment of major depressive disorder and stress-related urinary in-continence under the name of Cymbalta. Recently, numerous avenues to provide an enantiomeri-cally pure duloxetine have been elaborated using various precursors, in which Friedel-Crafts reaction of thiophene with glyoxylate, aldol reaction of thiophene- 2 -carboxaldehyde with thioamide or malonic acid half thioester, and dynamic kinetic resolution of 2 -hydroxy- 2 -(2 -thienyl) acetonitrile have been reported. 3 Nonetheless, asymmetric reduction of β-substituted ketones is perhaps among the most attractive and straightforward strategies to meet practical demands, in fact enantiomerically enriched γ-chloro or-dimethylamino alcohols are most frequently employed for the preparation of (S) -duloxetine. The initial synthesis of (S) -duloxetine has been reported based on a chirally-modified LAH reductio...|$|E
