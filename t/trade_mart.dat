Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart,</b> where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph the motorcade that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart.</b> Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that day, so he took his personal single-lens reflex camera rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used for news events.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published {{on the front page of}} the Dallas Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and is believed to be the last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart.</b>|$|E

50|$|Birbhum {{was one of}} {{the worst}} sufferers of the famine of 1770. Many {{hundreds}} of villages were entirely depopulated and in the towns not a fourth of the population survived. In the late 18th century, Birbhum and surrounding areas were affected by famines followed by a peasants’ insurrection. Although the insurrection was against zamindars and the government, <b>trade</b> <b>marts</b> were also plundered. In June 1789, Ilambazar, the chief manufacturing and trade centre in the area was sacked in open dylight. Ilambazar survived the sack of 1789 and re-emerged as a busy manufacturing and trade centre since the opening of the 19th century.At the time of Shewill’s survey operations it contained a population of 2,235 souls.|$|R

5000|$|Western historians {{initially}} {{echoed the}} views of British traders and diplomats who saw the Hoppo as obstructing China's entrance into the era of free trade and global interchange. Hosea Ballou Morse, the early chronicler of China's foreign relations, acidly remarked that the Hoppo's office was established [...] "in order to milk the trade of the wealthiest <b>trading</b> <b>mart</b> in the empire, and the incumbent of the post luxuriated in the abundant supply of the richest milk during the whole time that Canton enjoyed its statutory and actual monopoly of foreign trade". Morse wrote that [...] "a share in his gains passed directly to the inmates of the Imperial palace, from the highest down the scale to concubines and eunuchs". Morse saw the office {{as an obstacle to}} progress: [...] "the office of the Hoppo and a fixed tariff did not harmonize, for the proper performance of the duties of a Hoppo depended on the magnitude of the margin between the revenue collection as officially reported and the sums actually taken from the traders." [...] Austin Coates wrote of the [...] "caprice, the greed and the injustice of the Hoppo and his mandarins" ...|$|R
5000|$|The American author, Washington Irving, also {{mentioned}} the Native Americans resident at Wishram in {{his history of}} the Northwest titled Astoria Or, Anecdotes Of An Enterprise Beyond The Rocky Mountains and published in 1836.

Here the salmon caught in the neighboring rapids were 'warehoused,' to await customers. Hither the tribes from the mouth of the Columbia repaired with the fish of the sea-coast, the roots, berries, and especially the wappatoo, gathered in the lower parts of the river, together with goods and trinkets obtained from the ships which casually visit the coast. Hither also the tribes from the Rocky Mountains brought down horses, bear-grass, quamash, and other commodities of the interior. The merchant fishermen at the falls acted as middlemen or factors, and passed the objects of traffic, as it were, cross-handed; trading away part of the wares received from the mountain tribes to those of the rivers and plains, and vice versa: their packages of pounded salmon entered largely into the system of barter, and being carried off in opposite directions, found their way to the savage hunting camps far in the interior, and to the casual white traders who touched upon the coast." ...|$|R
6000|$|Two centuries later, {{among the}} readers of the Travels of Marco Polo was a certain Genoese mariner, Christopher Columbus, who {301} {{conceived}} the brilliant idea of sailing westward round the world to China. In Seville there is {{a copy of the}} Travels with marginal notes by Columbus. There were many reasons why the thought of a Genoese should be turned in this direction. Until its capture by the Turks in 1453 Constantinople had been an impartial <b>trading</b> <b>mart</b> between the Western world and the East, and the Genoese had traded there freely. But the [...] "Latin" [...] Venetians, the bitter rivals of the Genoese, had been the allies and helpers of the Turks against the Greeks, and with the coming of the Turks Constantinople turned an {302} unfriendly face upon Genoese trade. The long forgotten discovery that the world was round had gradually resumed its sway over men's minds. The idea of going westward to China was therefore a fairly obvious one. It was encouraged by two things. The mariner's compass had now been invented and men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night and the stars to determine the direction in which they were sailing, and the Normans, Catalonians and Genoese and Portuguese had already pushed out into the Atlantic as far as the Canary Isles, Madeira and the Azores.|$|R

25|$|Left {{unanswered}} by {{the professional}} analyses {{was the question}} of whose open microphone captured the sounds recorded on the Dictabelt, if not Officer H.B. McLain. Jim Bowles, a Dallas police dispatcher supervisor in November 1963, and later Dallas County Sheriff, believes it originated from a particular officer on a three-wheeled motorcycle stationed at the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart,</b> the original destination of President Kennedy's motorcade, along the same freeway to Parkland Hospital, which would account {{for the sound of}} sirens rushing by. McLain himself believes that it was from a different officer on a three-wheeler near the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart,</b> who was known for his whistling. When interviewed by author Vincent Bugliosi, the officer acknowledged that his microphone could have been stuck in the open position (he did not recall hearing any transmissions for several minutes), and could later have become unstuck after he followed the motorcade to Parkland Hospital.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the disorganization in New York, ABC {{was not able to}} switch to Dallas to speak to its correspondents. Only one feed was available to them at first, which came from the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> and CBS affiliate KRLD reporter Eddie Barker. CBS had earlier aired snippets of Barker's report, but had cut it off to return to its own reporting of the incident before Barker finished; ABC aired the remainder of the report until the end. The reason that ABC was able to air the CBS affiliate's coverage was due to a pool arrangement the three major Dallas stations agreed to for the President's visit. WBAP was responsible for covering the President's visit to Fort Worth and his departure and landing at Love Field, WFAA was assigned to cover the parade through downtown Dallas, and KRLD was set up at the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> for the address the President was to give.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have given}} this process at some length, as {{furnished}} {{by the first}} explorers, because it marks a practiced ingenuity in preparing articles of traffic for a market, seldom seen among our aboriginals. For like reason we would make especial mention of the village of Wishram, {{at the head of}} the Long Narrows, as being a solitary instance of an aboriginal <b>trading</b> <b>mart,</b> or emporium.

And be it enacted, {{that the}} Lord High Treasurer, or the commissioners for {{executing}} his office, shall name two inspectors of the said <b>trade</b> at every <b>mart,</b> who shall {{provide for the}} execution of this act, according to the directions thereof, so far as shall relate to them; and it is hereby provided and enacted, that, as cases of sudden emergency may arise, the said governor or first counsellor, and the first commander of his Majesty's ship or ships on the said station, and the said inspectors, or the majority of them, the governor having a double or casting vote, shall have power and authority to make such occasional rules and orders relating to the said trade as shall not be contrary to the instructions of the African Company, and which shall be valid until the same are revoked by the said African Company.|$|R
25|$|No {{radio or}} {{television}} stations broadcast the assassination live because the area {{through which the}} motorcade was traveling was not considered important enough for a live broadcast. Most media crews were not even with the motorcade but were waiting instead at the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> in anticipation of President Kennedy's arrival. Those {{members of the media}} who were with the motorcade were riding {{at the rear of the}} procession.|$|E
25|$|The President {{had planned}} to return to Love Field to depart for a {{fundraising}} dinner in Austin later that day. For the return trip, the agents selected a more direct route, which was approximately four miles, or 6.4 kilometers (some of this route would be used after the assassination). The planned route to the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> was widely reported in Dallas newspapers several days before the event, {{for the benefit of}} people who wished to view the motorcade.|$|E
25|$|On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy {{arrived at}} Love Field on Air Force One, and {{was assassinated in}} Dealey Plaza less than one hour later while his {{motorcade}} was traveling from Love Field to the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart.</b> Texas governor John Connally was riding in the presidential limousine and was seriously wounded. Ninety minutes later, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson {{was sworn in as}} president aboard Air Force One before its departure from Love Field.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} that the idea {{presented}} itself to the mind of Mr. Astor, of grasping with his individual hand this great enterprise, which for years had been dubiously yet desirously contemplated by powerful associations and maternal governments. For some time he revolved the idea in his mind, gradually extending and maturing his plans as his means of executing them augmented. The main feature of his scheme was to establish a line of trading posts along the Missouri and the Columbia, {{to the mouth of}} the latter, where was to be founded the chief <b>trading</b> house or <b>mart.</b> Inferior posts would be established in the interior, and on all the tributary streams of the Columbia, to trade with the Indians; these posts would draw their supplies from the main establishment, and bring to it the peltries they collected. Coasting craft would be built and fitted out, also {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia, to trade, at favorable seasons, all along the northwest coast, and return, with the proceeds of their voyages, to this place of deposit. Thus all the Indian trade, both of the interior and the coast, would converge to this point, and thence derive its sustenance.|$|R
25|$|On Friday, November 22, 1963, at 11:38a.m. CST, Kennedy, {{his wife}} Jacqueline, {{and the rest}} of the presidential entourage arrived at Love Field in {{northwest}} Dallas aboard Air Force One after a very short flight from nearby Carswell Air Force Base, west of Fort Worth. The motorcade cars had been lined up in a certain order earlier that morning. The original schedule was for the president to proceed in a long motorcade from Love Field through downtown Dallas, and end at the Dallas Business and <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart.</b>|$|E
25|$|A week later, on August 16, Oswald again {{passed out}} Fair Play for Cuba {{leaflets}} with two hired helpers, {{this time in}} front of the International <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart.</b> The incident was filmed by WDSU, a local TV station. The next day, Oswald was interviewed by WDSU radio commentator William Stuckey, who probed Oswald's background. A few days later, Oswald accepted Stuckey's invitation {{to take part in a}} radio debate with Carlos Bringuier and Bringuier's associate Edward Scannell Butler, head of the right-wing Information Council of the Americas (INCA).|$|E
25|$|Special Agent Winston G. Lawson, {{a member}} of the White House detail who acted as the advance Secret Service Agent, and Secret Service Agent Forrest V. Sorrels, Special Agent in charge of the Dallas office, were most active in {{planning}} the actual route. On November 14, both men attended a meeting at Love Field and drove over the route that Sorrels believed was best suited for the motorcade. From Love Field, the route passed through a suburban portion of Dallas, through Downtown along Main Street, and finally to the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> via a short segment of the Stemmons Freeway.|$|E
25|$|A {{proponent of}} {{increased}} international trade, Morrison lent his {{support to the}} construction of the International <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> - precursor to the city's World Trade Center. He traveled extensively in Latin America to promote trade with New Orleans. He became friends with dictators Rafael Trujillo and Juan Perón. Morrison's wish to reinforce ties with Latin America was expressed in such urban renewal projects as having new central area circulators embellished with monuments to Central and South American historical figures. The widened Basin Street was outfitted with monuments to Simón Bolívar, Benito Juárez, and Francisco Morazán. A statue of Bolívar was prominently sited and still stands at the corner of Canal and Basin streets. A new circulator in Central City was renamed Simon Bolivar Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Within {{twenty seconds}} of the announcement, every CBS {{affiliate}} except Dallas' KRLD (which was providing local coverage) was airing the network's feed. The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in shirt and tie but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made {{on the life of}} the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart,</b> where Kennedy was supposed to be making a speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy's condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that the President was dead but stressed it was not confirmed.|$|E
25|$|To {{pass through}} Downtown Dallas, a route west along Dallas' Main Street, rather than Elm Street (one block to the north) was chosen, {{because this was}} the {{traditional}} parade route, and provided the maximal building and crowd views. The route on Main Street precluded a direct turn onto the Fort Worth Turnpike exit (which served also as the Stemmons Freeway exit), which was the route to the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart,</b> because this exit was only accessible from Elm Street. The planned motorcade route thus included a short one-block turn {{at the end of}} the downtown segment of Main Street, onto Houston Street for one block northward, before turning again west onto Elm, in order to proceed through Dealey Plaza before exiting Elm onto the Stemmons Freeway. The Texas School Book Depository was situated at the northwest corner of Houston and Elm.|$|E
25|$|KRLD-TV {{served as}} the home base for CBS' network {{coverage}} of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, when suspect Lee Harvey Oswald (from an upper-floor window at the Texas School Book Depository) shot his rifle at sniper range at the Presidential motorcade carrying Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally as it had turned onto Elm Street. Eddie Barker, who was KRLD-TV's news director {{at the time and}} had been with the station since it signed on fourteen years earlier as one of the original members of its news department staff, {{was the first person to}} announce Kennedy's death on television, relaying a message from an official at Parkland Hospital that Kennedy had succumbed from the gunshot wound as doctors conducted emergency surgery. Because of a local press pool arrangement that was put in place that morning to cover Kennedy's speech at the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> downtown, Barker's scoop appeared live simultaneously on CBS, which had sent correspondent Dan Rather to report from Dealey Plaza, and ABC. Two days later, a KRLD-TV field crew captured footage of Oswald's assassination by nightclub owner Jack Ruby as officers were transferring the former in handcuffs out of the Dallas Police Department's downtown precinct.|$|E
500|$|Marcus {{used his}} public-relations skills once again when Dallas was labeled [...] "City of Hate" [...] {{following}} the November 22, 1963, assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy. An early supporter of Kennedy's {{run for the}} presidency, Marcus had tolerated the closing of several customers' accounts when he announced {{his support for the}} candidate in the 1960 elections. In fact, he had cautioned that Kennedy's visit be reconsidered in light of the city's earlier poor reception of Adlai Stevenson and Vice-President Lyndon Baines Johnson. In Kennedy's memory, Marcus arranged to have 500 hand-typeset and bound copies printed of Kennedy's scheduled speech at the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart,</b> of which the first copy went to Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline. The following New Year's Day, 1964, Marcus took out a full-page advertorial in The Dallas Morning News titled, [...] "What's Right With Dallas?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> {{had been}} preliminarily {{selected}} for the luncheon, and Kenneth O'Donnell—President Kennedy's friend and appointments secretary— had selected the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> as the final destination on the motorcade route [...] Leaving from Dallas Love Field, the motorcade [...] had been allotted 45minutes to reach the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> at a planned arrival time of 12:15p.m. The itinerary [...] {{was designed to be}} a meandering 10-mile (16-km) route between the two places, and the parade route vehicles could be driven slowly in the allotted time.|$|E
2500|$|Several minutes later, when CBS {{switched}} back to KRLD and the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> {{for another}} report, Barker repeated {{the claim of}} the President's death, adding [...] "the source would normally be a good one."

2500|$|From {{the time}} the CBS {{affiliates}} joined Walter Cronkite in the news room at around 2:00p.m. EST to approximately 2:38p.m. EST, the coverage alternated from the CBS Newsroom to KRLD-TV's Eddie Barker at the Dallas <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> where President Kennedy was to give his luncheon address. [...] In the 15 to 20 minutes before Kilduff's official announcement, rumors of the President's death were broadcast on radio and TV.

[...] "Yes, he's been shot and he is dead," [...] the priest told Rather. Almost simultaneously at the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart,</b> a doctor went up to Barker and whispered, [...] "Eddie, he is dead... I called the emergency room and he is DOA." [...] Moments later, as the news cameras panned throughout the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> crowds, Barker gave this report: ...|$|E

[...] Invitations that were sent out specify a noon start time to the luncheon while SS agent Lawson told Chief Curry that after arriving at Love Field and leaving at 11:30 the 38- to 45-minute trip would get them to the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart</b> on time. [...] Air Force One touched down at 11:39a.m. and the Presidential motorcade did not leave Love Field until approximately fifteen minutes later.|$|E
2500|$|President Kennedy's {{motorcade}} {{route through}} Dallas with Johnson and Connally was planned {{to give him}} maximum exposure to local crowds prior to his arrival for a luncheon at the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mart,</b> where he would meet with civic and business leaders.
