50|$|Like Western Area Power Administration's 500 kV line, {{the tower}} {{design for the}} entire {{transmission}} system is not the same, although the difference is not as dramatic as on the WAPA line. For the PG&E line, the differences are subtle and from a casual, far away view, {{it looks like the}} towers are all the same for the entire power line. It seems to be south of the Table Mountain substation, the <b>tower</b> <b>legs</b> spread apart from the tower bridge (upper section of tower) down to the tower base and there are four guy lines for tower stability. In contrast, the towers to the north of Table Mountain have thinner legs and look like thin sticks from far away. The weaker <b>tower</b> <b>legs</b> have two additional guy lines for stability. As for the tower bridge, the towers south of Table Mountain have five X's in between the <b>tower</b> <b>legs.</b> The <b>towers</b> north of Table Mountain have only four X's. In addition, the tower arms {{on either side of the}} towers have smaller steel bars inside for added strength. In the northern towers, they arepositioned like equilateral triangles, but south of Table Mountain, they are shaped like right triangles. See below for a visual comparison.|$|R

50|$|The car {{was divided}} into two {{superimposed}} compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram 12.67 m long and 96.5 cm in diameter in the <b>tower</b> <b>leg</b> with a stroke of 10.83 m: this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped {{back up to the}} reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room {{at the base of the}} south leg.

40|$|In this paper, the {{torsional}} rigidity of arbitrarily shape bar made of different materials is studied {{on the basis}} of theory of elasticity and finite element approach. With additional boundary conditions for the common boundaries of different materials from the continuous conditions of deformation and traction across the interior boundary, the torsion function can be solved numerically from the second boundary-value problem of potential theory. The traction jump boundary conditions across the interior surfaces are enforced in the alternate finite element approach. Several examples are shown to check the computational approach proposed, and the approach, at last, is applied to calculate the {{torsional rigidity}} of reinforced concrete bar and some multiply connected cross sections such as <b>tower</b> <b>leg</b> section of the Tsing Ma Bridge and other engineering structures.

40|$|Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong is {{the longest}} {{suspension}} bridge in the world carrying both highway and railway. It has two H-shape concrete towers, {{each of which is}} composed of two reinforced concrete legs and four deep transverse prestressed concrete beams. A series of wind tunnel tests have been performed to measure the aerodynamic coefficients of the <b>tower</b> <b>legs</b> and transverse beams in various arrangements. A 1 : 100 scaled 3 D rigid model of the full bridge tower assembled from various tower components has been constructed for different test cases. The aerodynamic coefficients of the lower and upper segments of the windward and leeward <b>tower</b> <b>legs</b> and those of the transverse beams at different levels, with and without the dummy bridge deck model, were measured as a function of yaw wind angle. The effects of wind interference among the tower components and the influence of the bridge deck on the tower aerodynamic coefficients were also investigated.

First, the variations of droplet size distribution (DSD) and liquid water content (LWC) in vertical and streamwise directions were measured. Then, variations of ice accretion on an angle bar in the same direction as the flow were measured to determine the aerodynamic forces on a <b>tower</b> <b>leg</b> as a function of ice accretion. The ice accretion experiments were carried out under two conditions with different LWCs and air velocities.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of lightning-induced surges in telecommunication equipment {{due to a}} direct lightning strike at a telecommunication center building or tower should be investigated to maintain the reliability of advanced telecommunication systems.

We observed lightning surges induced in a telecommunication building in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia The {{results show that the}} peak value occurrence frequency and waveforms of direct strike lightning surges were almost the same as those in a temperate area. The peak current relationships between the cables in the building and the tower legs indicate a strong correlation between the current at the tower legs, waveguide, power line, and outer and inner conductors of the coaxial cables. However, the peak value correlations between the <b>tower</b> <b>leg</b> currents and interface cable voltages were not strong.

40|$|NOWITECH (Norwegian Research Centre for Offshore Technology) are {{developing}} a 10 MW offshore reference wind turbine to encourage increased production of renewable energy. This thesis present a mechanical design and dimensioning of a transition piece between the yaw bearing (part of the nacelle) and the tower in this reference turbine. A fatigue analysis to verify the lifetime of 20 years for the main shaft, bed plate and transition piece has also been performed. The final design has shape like a cone, which distributes the loads from the yaw bearing to the whole section of each <b>tower</b> <b>leg.</b> An extreme load case with 50 year occurrence period {{has been used for}} the Ultimate Limit State analysis. The material EN-GJS- 400 - 18 is suggested for the transition piece, bed plate and main shaft. It has a yield strength of 240 MPa and a tensile strength of 370 MPa. The mass of the transition piece is 49. 6 tonnes and a peak stress of 262 MPa in a single node was found. This is further discussed in chapter 12. 3 and 18. The fatigue analysis was calculated with a detailed assessment described in the European standard, EN 13445 - 6 together with IEC 61400. The load case was calculated from a memo with fatigue loads for power production. A static analysis in the software NX/Nastran was performed with conservative estimations. A damage factor for each load each was calculated and used to compute a total damage factor for 20 years.

5000|$|Wembley Park officially {{opened to}} the public in May 1894, {{although}} construction of the tower was still underway and the first stage had not yet been completed. Nevertheless, the park attracted 12,000 visitors during 1895 and was proving to be a popular attraction for Londoners. In September 1895 the first stage of the tower was completed, standing at approximately 47 m high. At this time, work was behind schedule as Watkin retired through ill health. It was soon discovered that the structure's foundations were unsteady — the {{reduction in the number of}} the <b>tower's</b> <b>legs,</b> carried out to reduce costs, had resulted in increased pressure on each leg and this was causing subsidence.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{high-rise}} latticed tower structures {{are made of}} steel tubular members. To facilitate the construction, the <b>tower</b> <b>legs</b> are constructed by connecting the steel tubular members with bolted flange joints. Under the wind load, the bolts of the flange joints may loosen; and this may endanger {{the safety of the}} tower if the bolt looseness and its locations cannot be detected and repaired timely. This paper proposes a new method for identifying the damage locations of bolt looseness of bolted flange joints at <b>tower</b> <b>legs</b> based on the abrupt changes of the structural responses of the towers to the wind load. The bolt looseness is reflected by the reduction of the bending rigidity of elements in the stiffness matrix of the beam element model which is equivalent to the refined solid finite element model of the flange joints. A vector composed of the standardized mean square deviations of the wind-induced longitudinal strain responses at flange joints in a damaged state of the tower related to those in its undamaged state is used as a damage index. It has been shown that the damage index is sensitive to the damage locations but independent of the wind load. Hence. the damage index can be used to identify the damage locations of the bolt looseness at the flange joints. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a latticed steel tubular tower, which shows that the proposed method can accurately identify the damage locations of bolt looseness.

50|$|The {{original}} bridge measured 691 ft overall from anchorage to anchorage and was 45 in wide, {{with a clear}} cable span of 568 ft. The walkway, whose abutments {{were located}} between the towers, had a span of 476 ft with a clearance of about 45 ft over the river. The suspension span was supported by 1.5 in wire rope with 0.375 in wire rope suspenders 8 ft apart. The deck and railings are wood. The 50 ft tall west tower is concrete. Although Gilliam designed the <b>tower</b> <b>legs</b> as large timbers, {{they were made of}} built-up 2x10s which were more readily available.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of body positioning to portray certain postures, including slouching, <b>towering,</b> <b>legs</b> spread, jaw thrust, shoulders forward, and arm crossing. The posture or bodily stance exhibited by individuals communicates a variety of messages whether good or bad. Posture can be used to determine a participant's degree of attention or involvement, the difference in status between communicators, and the level of fondness a person has for the other communicator, depending on body [...] "openness". Studies investigating the impact of posture on interpersonal relationships suggest that mirror-image congruent postures, where one person's left side is parallel to the other person's right side, leads to favorable perception of communicators and positive speech; a person who displays a forward lean or decreases a backward lean also signifies positive sentiment during communication.Posture can be situation-relative, that is, people will change their posture depending on the situation they are in.|$|R
