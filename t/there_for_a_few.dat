5|$|Prior to its Broadway debut, preview {{performances}} of the play were staged in several cities. The first was in Pittsburgh, where it began a scheduled one-week run on September 26, 1921. It was closed early {{on the last day}} by the local Director of Public Safety, who objected to some of the dialogue. Hopwood was upset by the censorship, but Woods was happy to have free publicity from press coverage of the closure. The tryouts then moved to Stamford, Connecticut and Atlantic City, New Jersey, where they proceeded without incident. The play's Broadway opening was at the Times Square Theatre on October 18, 1921. It ran <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks until Woods transferred it to his own Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre on November 7.|$|E

5|$|On May 5, {{the same}} day that Davis officially {{dissolved}} the Confederate Government in Washington, Georgia, Breckinridge discharged most of the men escorting him, retaining only a small contingent of Kentuckians under the command of his cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge. Feeling honor bound to protect Davis, he attempted to create a diversion that would allow him to escape. The next day, his party encountered a large Federal force; while his cousin negotiated with the force's commander, Breckinridge and a small detachment escaped. Riding southward across Georgia, they reached Milltown (now Lakeland) by May 11 and remained <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. Learning of Davis's capture, he left Milltown with only a military aide, a personal servant, and his son Cabell. On May 15, 1865, in Madison, Florida, he was joined by fellow fugitive John Taylor Wood, who had been a captain in the Confederate Navy. Breckinridge and Wood decided to flee to the Bahamas, but because Cabell was allergic to mosquito bites, Breckinridge told him to surrender to the nearest federal officer.|$|E

25|$|In 1858, Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891), a {{pediatrician}} from Paris, {{developed a new}} technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. His method involved introducing a small straight metal tube into the larynx, securing it {{by means of a}} silk thread and leaving it <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days until the pseudomembrane and airway obstruction had resolved sufficiently. Bouchut presented this experimental technique along with the results he had achieved in the first seven cases at the French Academy of Sciences conference on 18 September 1858. The members of the Academy rejected Bouchut's ideas, {{largely as a result of}} highly critical and negative remarks made by the influential Armand Trousseau. Undaunted, Bouchut later introduced a set of tubes ("Bouchut's tubes") for intubation of the trachea, as an alternative to tracheotomy in cases of diphtheria.|$|E
25|$|Dong Lee causes {{numerous}} {{havoc in}} the city, which Subha, Aravind and their gang barely escape. They finally locate a research centre {{where they can}} activate Bodhidharma's DNA in Aravind, and decide to hide <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. They all deactivate their phones so that no-one can trace them. But Dong Lee somehow traces Subha and the gang {{with the help of}} two of Subha's outside friends. However, he kills both of them afterwards. Dong Lee then locates the place of the research centre. Subha and her friends in the research centre escape in a van, but Dong Lee chases them and the van collapses. An unconscious Aravind gets beaten badly by Dong Lee at first, but then gains Bodhidharma's skills and kills Dong Lee. Aravind uses an ancient medicine to cure the disease. Subha and Aravind then get married and finally tell the press about the importance of our history.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of May 1945, Kren left Zagreb and began withdrawing towards Austria. He managed to evade capture by the Yugoslav Partisans and escaped across the Yugoslav border into Italy. He was captured by the Allied forces there {{and placed in a}} prisoner-of-war camp in Grumo Appula, near Bari. He was then transferred to a camp in Grottaglie, where he remained until 1947. That year, Kren escaped from Allied custody while being transported by locomotive to another prisoner-of-war camp. He then went to Rome and hid <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months. In March 1947, British intelligence discovered that Kren was staying in Genoa under the protection of Monsignor Karlo Petranović and that he was planning to leave for Argentina under the alias Marko Rubini. Kren was arrested by British authorities on 4 March 1947 while attempting to board a ship called Philippa, which regularly carried suspected Croatian war criminals along the Genoa–Buenos Aires route. Eight other suspected war criminals were arrested alongside Kren. Kren was extradited to Yugoslavia that same month. He was tried in Zagreb and on 22 October 1948 the city's municipal court found him guilty of mass murder, terrorism, forced mobilization, forced religious conversion, aerial bombardment of civilian areas, and the forced expulsion of civilians. He was sentenced to death by firing squad. Kren appealed the decision to {{the supreme court of the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, but his appeal was dismissed on 9 November 1948. He was executed in Zagreb on 2 December 1948. In 2011, his granddaughter submitted an unsuccessful request for rehabilitation to the Zagreb District court.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} other recent {{narratives}} extolling the divinity of the goddess, which are also linked to Shirdi Sai Baba and his devotees. In one such narration, a priest of Vani village known as Kakaji Vaidya who {{was working in the}} Saptashrungi Temple was quite disturbed by the miseries of life around him and he, therefore, appealed to the goddess to give him peace of mind and relieve him from all worries. Pleased with the priest's devotion to her, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the Baba to set his mind at rest and in peace. As the priest was then not aware of which Baba she meant, he thought it was the Shiva at Trimabakeshwar temple and so he went there and offered worship to Shiva and stayed <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. In the process, he still did not get the feeling of peace and his restless mood continued. He came back to Vani village disheartened. Then, every day after taking bath in the morning he offered prayers to Shiva Linga by reciting Rudra mantra from the Yajurveda, for many days. He still did not get peace of mind. He then went back to the Mata temple and appealed to her to give relief to his restless mind. That night she appeared in his dream and told that the Baba she meant was Sai Samarth of Shirdi and that he should go there. The priest did not know the whereabouts of Sai Baba. Sai Baba through his divine psychic perception realised the need of the priest and so he sent his most loving devotee Madhavarao to meet the priest and bring him to his presence. Coincidentally, Madhavrao had also gone there at the advice of Baba to also offer two silver breasts to the goddess as his mother had forgotten to fulfill her vow of gifting the silver breasts to the goddess. When Madhavarao went to Vani village the priest met him and came to know that he had come from Shirdi to offer silver breast to the goddess. The priest was very pleased, and also for the first time felt peace of mind. He then took Madhavarao to the temple where the silver breasts were placed {{at the feet of the}} goddess in the sanctum as a fulfilment of his mother's vow. The priest then came to Shirdi with Madhavarao and had darshan of the Sai Baba and stayed there for 12 days and felt very peaceful. He then returned to Vani.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the flower}} is {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way as to make the surface almost impossible to cling to, with smooth, downward-pointing hairs; the bees commonly slip and fall into the fluid in the bucket, and the only navigable route out is a narrow, constricting passage that either glues a [...] "pollinium" [...] (a pollen sack) on their body (if the flower has not yet been visited) or removes any pollinium that is there (if the flower has already been visited). The passageway constricts after a bee has entered, and holds it <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes, allowing the glue to dry and securing the pollinium.
