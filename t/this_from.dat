No official reason was ever given as to why Shearer won the award for only one of the two films she was listed for.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1590s, Lopez was wealthy and {{generally}} respected. He owned a comfortable house in Holborn {{and had his}} youngest son Anthony enrolled at Winchester College. He incurred the fury {{of one of his}} former patients, Queen Elizabeth's favourite Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, when he described to Dom António and the Spanish statesman Antonio Pérez occasions on which he had treated Essex for venereal diseases. Learning of <b>this</b> <b>from</b> Pérez, Essex began to assemble evidence implicating Lopez as some sort of fifth columnist in the pay of King Philip II of Spain. The Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley initially thought Essex's allegations against Lopez absurd; the Queen herself also rebuked Essex.|$|E

5|$|Claiming {{the right}} to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly {{proposed}} the name Neptune for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in <b>this</b> <b>from</b> the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E
5|$|In biology, {{homology}} is {{the existence}} of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different taxa. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats, the arms of primates, the front flippers of whales and the forelegs of dogs and horses are all derived from the same ancestral tetrapod structure. Evolutionary biology explains homologous structures adapted to different purposes {{as the result of}} descent with modification from a common ancestor. Homology was explained by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before <b>this,</b> <b>from</b> Aristotle onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555. The term was applied to biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent <b>this</b> <b>from</b> happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E

5|$|Kotarou becomes {{disillusioned with}} Guardian's tactics {{and returns to}} Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again. She tells him she must {{initiate}} re-evolution, but since this {{would lead to a}} dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to bad memories caused by war and conflict. Kotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side. Kazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to stop <b>this</b> <b>from</b> occurring. As a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude for showing her satisfactory memories. Kotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.|$|E
5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} etymology of the various names for this plant, suggests a very different origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and which appears to describe a plant resembling the daffodil. Ellacombe provides further support for <b>this</b> <b>from</b> a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E

However, this causes the baby-injury-related business in Springfield to go in decline.

Żmuda and Młynarczyk returned in the 1–0 home win over East Germany on 2 May 1981, and Boniek was reinstated four months later.

According to Majchrzak, Boniek and Żmuda apologised for their actions before the General Committee for Physical Culture and Sport of the Polish People's Republic, the PZPN's governing body, but kept <b>this</b> <b>from</b> Terlecki, who appealed to have his ban lifted several times, but to no avail.|$|E

5|$|Ptolemy {{decided to}} try to make a night dash from Citium, round Cape Greko, to Salamis, hoping to {{surprise}} Demetrius and combine his fleet with his brother’s sixty ships so they could then outnumber Demetrius. Demetrius, however, informed of Ptolemy's arrival, took steps just in order to prevent <b>this</b> <b>from</b> happening: he equipped his ships with missile-throwers, brought aboard his best troops as marines, and sailed his fleet to anchor just outside the harbour of the city, bottling up Menelaus in the harbour and interposing himself between the two enemy fleets. This meant that Demetrius took a calculated risk that {{he would be able to}} defeat Ptolemy before Menelaus could sail out of the harbour and attack him in the rear.|$|E

Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation, thus confirming the defense's claim of a frame-up. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with Carolyn acting as a facilitator.|$|E

5|$|Such a {{plan would}} still fail if {{sufficient}} ground {{could not be}} taken quickly in Belgium to squeeze the allies against two fronts. Preventing <b>this</b> <b>from</b> happening were the defences of Fort Eben-Emael and the Albert Canal. The three bridges over the canal were the key to allowing Army Group B a high operational tempo. The bridges at Veldwezelt, Vroenhoven and Kanne in Belgium, and Maastricht on the Dutch border were the target. Failure to capture the bridges would leave Reichenau's German 6th Army, the southern-most army of Group B, trapped in the Maastricht-Albert Canal enclave and subjected to the fire of Eben-Emael. The fort had to be captured or destroyed.|$|E
