In June 1953 the New York City Transit Authority, a state agency incorporated {{for the benefit of the}} city, now known to the public as MTA New York City Transit, succeeded the BoT. A combination of factors had this takeover coincide with the end of the major rapid transit building eras in New York City. The City immediately began to eliminate what it considered redundancy in the system, closing several elevated lines including the IRT Ninth Avenue Line and most of the IRT Second Avenue Line in Manhattan, and the BMT Fifth and Third Avenue Lines and most of the BMT Fulton Street Line in Brooklyn.|$|E

Due to Turkish losses suffered at the disastrous battle of Sarikamish, the 1st Expeditionary Force found itself assigned to the 3rd Army. On 11 January 1915 the 5th Expeditionary Force was ordered north to Erzurum and eleven days later the 1st Expeditionary Force was ordered there as well. The Van Gendarmerie Regiment (police force) under the command of Staff Major Köprülü Kâzım Bey (Özalp), who would become the Minister of National Defence and Speaker of Grand National Assembly of Turkey, was the only force available to the Persian frontier. Earlier, on 14 December 1914, Van Mobile Gendarmerie Division had assumed the role of securing the road to Persia through the Qotur valley (Qotur Pass). This paramilitary formation was lightly equipped with artillery and machine guns, being primarily suited for internal security functions rather than for the invasion of a neighboring country.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{other similar}} clashes {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough <b>transportation</b> <b>assets</b> to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. [...] Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to “maintain order” in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. [...] As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists.|$|E
2500|$|Just as {{the nationalists}} had {{attempted}} to fight guerrilla and insurgency warfare against the communists after being driven from mainland China half a decade later, the grave strategic mistake made by the nationalists contributed at least equally if not greater than the enemy’s political and military pressure to the nationalist defeat in this campaign. [...] The very first strategic mistake made by Chiang Kai-shek and his followers was when they had neither the sufficient troops nor enough <b>transportation</b> <b>assets</b> to be deployed into the Japanese-occupied regions of Northeast China. Unwilling to let these regions falling into communist hands, Chiang’s government ordered these bandits to fight communists in any way they could. [...] This grave strategic miscalculation resulted in alienation and resentment to the nationalists by the local population, which had already blamed the nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders during the war. [...] However, the bandits were deeply feared and hated by the local populace they plagued for so long, and nationalist troops left behind joining the bandits certainly did not help them win {{the support of the}} general population. [...] In fact, it served the exact opposite, it caused Chiang’s government to lose popular support to the least, if not strengthening the popular support of their communist enemy.|$|E

40|$|Trade-off analysis, {{one of the}} {{principles}} of <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management, can help decision-makers understand how different resource allocations can affect system 2 ̆ 7 s performance and the relationships between performance measures in the decision-making process. However, the trade-off analysis in <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management has not been studied in depth. In this dissertation, therefore, a general methodology is proposed for conducting trade-off analyses for the project selection problem of <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management. A general trade-off-based multiobjective optimization framework for <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management is first established. Next, a Hybrid NSGA II method is developed to generate Pareto frontiers to conduct trade-off analyses between the cost and performance measures and also between different performance measures. The chance-constrained programming is then applied to incorporate performance measure uncertainties into the multiobjective optimization. Using field data, the proposed methodologies are applied to conduct various trade-off analyses under deterministic and uncertainty situations. The proposed Hybrid NSGA II method ultimately is found to converge faster and generate better-distributed Pareto frontiers compared to the traditional NSGA II method. The trade-off relationships between performance measures are different at different budget levels. Further, at the same budget level, the trade-off relationships between two performance measures can be influenced by the specified levels of other performance measures. Under the uncertainty situation, trade-off relationships at different confidence levels are different; typically, a high confidence requirement results in lower performance at the same cost level. This dissertation also quantified the extent to which high costs are needed to achieve high confidence levels at a given level of pre-specified performance. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Transportation</b> <b>Asset</b> Management (TAM) {{systems are}} in use at many {{transportation}} agencies {{both in the}} United States and around the world. These asset management systems serve as strategic resource allocation frameworks and their degree of implementation and maturity varies. Climatic change, with its potentially adverse impacts on both the built and natural environments, has become of increasing concern around the globe. Given the uncertainties associated with changing climatic conditions, transportation agency stakeholders utilize risk-based decision-making approaches to identify climate change impacts that pose the greatest risk to <b>transportation</b> infrastructure <b>assets.</b> In conjunction with criticality assessments, emerging conceptual frameworks seek to identify higher-risk infrastructure assets, which are both critical to system operations and vulnerable to potential climate change impacts, through standalone study efforts. This research develops a risk-oriented decision-making framework to identify vulnerable, higher-risk <b>transportation</b> infrastructure <b>assets</b> {{within the context of}} existing <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management systems. The framework assesses the relative maturity of an agency’s <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management system and provides guidance as to how an agency’s existing tools and processes can be used to incorporate climate change considerations. This risk-based decision-making framework is applied to three case studies: one at the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, another at the Metropolitan Planning Commission in Savannah – Chatham County, and a statewide case study at the Georgia Department of Transportation. The results of this research demonstrate that readily-available climate projection data can be analyzed and displayed geospatially so that the potential impacts of climatic change on transportation infrastructure can be determined for specific geographic regions. In addition, existing roadway and bridge infrastructure datasets can also be displayed geospatially. The framework uses geospatially-referenced roadway and bridge asset data and multi-criteria decision analysis procedures to develop and visually display criticality scores. Overlaying climate projection data and criticality data helps identify higher-risk <b>transportation</b> infrastructure <b>assets.</b> This research demonstrates that climate change considerations can be effectively incorporated in existing decision-making processes at various levels of maturity of formal TAM systems, making this more broadly accessible to agencies and communities with potential climate hazards.

40|$|Risk {{assessment}} {{is an essential}} part of an effective <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management program. The 2012 surface transportation bill, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century, requires state departments of transportation (DOTs) to establish risk- and performance-based asset management programs for the National Highway System. While the bill’s provisions include requirements only for pavement and bridge assets, they also recommend that DOTs consider other ancillary highway assets such as culverts and earth retaining structures, and hazards such as rockfalls and landslides. This research introduces an integrated risk framework with supporting algorithms to provide for the integration of ancillary assets and hazards into existing <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management systems, and facilitate budget planning and resource allocation. The framework, Highway Assets Risk Management Decision-Support System (HARM-DSS), adopts a system-of systems perspective in defining and evaluating performance, and analyzing and addressing risk. The algorithms are developed using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and risk analysis methods; value functions are applied to scale performance attributes, and additive weighting to integrate multiple risk criteria. The methodology is applied at the corridor-level to analyze three different case studies using data with notable variability from New York, Minnesota and Oregon. The cases demonstrate the process for developing descriptive and visual information on multi-asset/hazard corridors, with sparse to medium data, in order to identify corridors that are vulnerable to failure, as well as exhibit high risk of failure within a transportation network. The results demonstrate that HARM-DSS can be applied across competing corridors or alternatives to produce descriptive and intuitive results that decision makers can use in budget planning and resource allocation. This research extends the risk-based thinking on <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management, by moving it from a silo-ed to an integrated analytical platform that considers multiple non-homogenous assets and hazards simultaneously. It identifies data deficiencies and offers recommendations on the requisite data collection on asset inventory and condition to improve objectivity in the analytical process and confidence in the analysis results. In addition, it offers recommendations on the appropriate use of expert knowledge in supplementing existing data deficiencies in the interim. This work is potentially useful to decision makers involved in distributing resources to preserve the reliability and resiliency of transportation systems, as well as meet the existing performance- and risk-based Federal mandates for <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> management.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Navy recently designated Humanitarian Assistance (HA) and Disaster Relief (DR) as core capabilities, recognizing {{the importance of}} delivering a potent strategic communications message directly to foreign populations. The Ship-to-Shore Transportation Problem (SSTP) refers to the daily need to determine <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> (embarked helicopters, watercraft, and ground vehicles) routing and loading to effect the movement of personnel and patients between Hospital Ship (T-AH) and ashore mission sites during HA/DR operations. The SSTP significantly impacts overall mission performance. The SSTP is formulated as a mixed-integer mathematical optimization model, minimizing cost in a multi-objective merit function reflecting mission performance, personnel strength and <b>transportation</b> <b>asset</b> utilization while reflecting constraints unique to T-AH HA (flight deck limitations, restricted embarkation and debarkation by watercraft). Optimized schedules improve average duration of ashore mission site operations by between 9 % and 13 % compared {{to a set of}} optimistic, pseudo-manually generated schedules, and decrease average time spent by personnel in transit by between 16 % and 43 %. USNS COMFORT (TAH 20) treated nearly 95, 000 patients in 2007 during an HA deployment; operational efficiencies can translate into thousands more benefiting from HA.
