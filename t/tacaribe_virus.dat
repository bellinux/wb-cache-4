40|$|AbstractSeveral New World (Tacaribe complex) arenaviruses (Arenaviridae) {{are known}} to cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. Phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} of the Tacaribe complex arenaviruses previously has been limited by the relative scarcity of sequence data for arenavirus genomes. In the present study, oligonucleotide primers were designed based on conserved regions of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene and then used to amplify, by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, a 613 - to 649 -nucleotide region of the N gene of all known Tacaribe complex arenaviruses. This has allowed completion of the first detailed genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of all known members of the <b>Tacaribe</b> complex. These <b>viruses</b> formed three lineages. Lineage A contained Flexal, Parana, Pichinde, and Tamiami viruses; lineage B contained Amapari, Guanarito (GUA), Junin (JUN), Machupo (MAC), Sabia (SAB), and <b>Tacaribe</b> <b>viruses.</b> Latino and Oliveros viruses occupied lineage C. The highly pathogenic Tacaribe complex arenaviruses (GUA, JUN, MAC, SAB) were all members of lineage B, suggesting {{the possibility that the}} highly pathogenic phenotype is the result of evolutionary radiation from a common ancestor.

The growth rate and morphological characteristics of the persistently infected cells were indistinguishable from normal Vero cells. Virus release declined uring the first 6 passages, a cyclical pattern was observed between passages 6 and 16, and subsequently no virus infectivity could be detected. Co-cultivation with normal RK- 13 or Vero cells enhanced virus yield from virus-producing cultures of Vero-T cells (passage 15), but the addition of susceptible cells {{had no effect on}} non-producer Vero-T cultures (passage 19). Only a small proportion (< 1 %) of the persistently infected cells tested uring the first 16 passages produced infectious virus.

The pyrazine derivative T- 705 (6 -fluoro- 3 -hydroxy- 2 -pyrazinecarboxamide) has demonstrated remarkable antiviral activity against influenza virus and, to a lesser degree, against some other RNA viruses (Y.

The 50 % effective concentrations for T- 705 ranged from 5 to 30 µg/ml and 0. 7 to 1. 2 µg/ml against the bunyaviruses and arenaviruses examined, respectively. We also demonstrate that orally administered T- 705 is efficacious in treating Punta Toro virus in the mouse and hamster infection models, as well as Pichinde virus infection in hamsters. When administered twice daily for 5 to 6 days, beginning 4 h pre- or 24 h post-Punta Toro virus challenge, a 30 -mg/kg of body weight/day dose provided complete protection from death and limited viral burden and liver disease. A dose of 50 mg/kg/day was found to be optimal for treating Pichinde infection and limiting viral replication and disease severity. In general, T- 705 was found to be more active than ribavirin in cell-based assays and in vivo, as reflected by substantially greater therapeutic indexes.

Subsequently, it has caused two laboratory-acquired infections. Its natural distribution and host are still unknown. Using viral RNA and multiple polymerase chain reaction products as templates, the nucleotide sequence of the small (S) RNA segment of Sabiá virus, which codes for the nucleocapsid (N) and glycoprotein precursor, was determined. This virus shares an ambisense genome in common with other arenaviruses, although it has a unique predicted three stem–loop structure in the S RNA intergenic region. Phylogenetic analysis of {{a portion of the}} N gene sequence confirmed that Sabiá virus is distinct from all other members of the Arenaviridae and shares a progenitor with Junin, Machupo, <b>Tacaribe,</b> and Guanarito <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|N-methyl and N-ethyl isatin beta-thiosemicarbazones i {{activate}} cell-free Parana and Pichinde viruses as well {{as three}} strains of lymphocytic horiomeningitis virus. This antiviral activity is abolished {{in the presence of}} the chelating agent EDTA. The rate of virus inactivation by N-methyl isatin beta-thiosemicarbazone is greatly enhanced and contlolled by the addition of cupric sulphate. Divalent cations of other first transition series metals are less effective. A difference xists in the copper equirement for fast inactivation of the prototype arenavirus (lympho-cytic choriomeningitis) and the <b>Tacaribe</b> Complex of <b>viruses</b> (Parana nd Pichinde). In the presence of 20 /zi-N-methyl isatin beta-thiosemicarbazone, LCM and Pichinde viruses can be inactivated at about the same rate if 2 o/zi-CuSO 4 is added to the former and 16 o #M-CuSO 4 is added to the latter. Using 20 /zM-N-methyl isatin beta-thiosemicarbazone and CuSO 4 the inactivation of LCM is reduced, but not eliminated, in the presence of an equal amount of infectious Pichinde virus. Crude and highly purified Pichinde virus are inactivated at the same rate when exposed to identical concentrations of N-methyl isatin beta-thiosemicarbazone and cupric sulphate. There is little detectable change in inactivation rates when Pichinde or LCM viruses are grown in a variety of different cell lines...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a method {{based on a}} coupled reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) {{for the detection of}} Lassa virus using primers specific for regions of the S RNA segment which are well conserved between isolates from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by Southern blotting with a chemiluminescent probe. The assay was able to detect 1 to 10 copies of a plasmid or an RNA transcript containing the target sequence. There was complete concordance between RT-PCR and virus culture for the detection of Lassa virus in a set of 29 positive and 32 negative serum samples obtained on admission to the hospital from patients suspected of having Lassa fever in Sierra Leone. Specificity was confirmed by the failure of amplification of specific products from serum samples collected from 129 healthy blood donors in Sierra Leone or from tissue culture supernatants from cells infected with related arenaviruses (Mopeia, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, <b>Tacaribe,</b> and Pichinde <b>viruses).</b> Sequential serum samples from 29 hospitalized patients confirmed to have Lassa fever were tested by RT-PCR and for Lassa virus-specific antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). RT-PCR detected virus RNA in 79 % of the patients at the time of admission, comparing favorably with IF, which detected antibodies in only 21 % of the patients. Lassa virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in all 29 patients by the third day of admission, whereas antibody was detectable by IF in only 52 % of the patients. These results point to an important role for RT-PCR in the management of suspected cases of Lassa fever...|$|R
