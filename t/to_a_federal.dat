5|$|In 1873, Melvin {{refused to}} {{transfer}} the case of Taylor Strauder, a black man, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> court following his indictment by an all-white Ohio County grand jury {{for the murder of}} his wife. Strauder and his lawyers argued that he would not receive equal treatment in the West Virginia courts due to its all-white jury law and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1866 for a transfer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> court. Following Melvin's ruling, Strauder's murder trial proceeded in the Ohio County court in May 1873, and he was inevitably convicted by an all-white jury. Strauder appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States, where his case Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 (1879) was decided on March1, 1880. The Supreme Court held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries {{for no other reason than}} their race violated the Equal Protection Clause, and Strauder's conviction was overturned due to the Ohio County court's violation of United States constitutional criminal procedure.|$|E

5|$|The Philippines has a {{democratic}} government {{in the form of}} a constitutional republic with a presidential system.

5|$|A {{trademark}} dispute {{involving the}} owners of the identically named Burger King in Mattoon, Illinois led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> lawsuit; the case's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and trademark law in the United States. An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia, while another state trademark in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product, the Whopper, in several counties around San Antonio. The company was only able to enter northern Alberta, in Canada, in 1995, after it paid the founders of another chain named Burger King.|$|E

5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the {{territory}} gained its first representative in the Parliament, although at first with limited speaking and voting rights. In 1974 it gained a fully elected, but still advisory House of Assembly.

The Legislative Assembly legalised some things that were prohibited in other parts of Australia, such as prostitution and X-rated pornography; in 2006, an attempt to allow civil unions for same-sex couples was overruled by the federal government.|$|E

50|$|Instead {{the court}} {{reasoned}} {{that because the}} conspiracy statute didn't require a higher mens rea than the substantive crime, the same mens rea requirement applies to both by default. The court reasoned that one purpose of the assault statute was <b>to</b> provide <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> forum (specific jurisdiction) for assaults on federal officers. Therefore conspiracy <b>to</b> assault <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> officer didn't require proof that the defendant knew that his intended victim was <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> officer.|$|R
5|$|This section covers 3 {{compliance}} requirements concerning recipient performance. They {{may require}} that recipients provide {{a level of}} contributions <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> program, maintain specific levels of performance or achievement, or restrict the amount of federal funds used for a specific purpose. Failure to meet these requirements may result in either limitation of future funds or termination of assistance. Specific requirements for matching, level of effort, and earmarking are unique to each federal program, and are described in the laws, regulations, and contract or grant provisions that pertain to the program.|$|E
5|$|This section {{covers the}} actual management, or handling, of funds {{pertaining}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> program, specifically on how federal assistance is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage the funds until disbursement. The actual transfer of funds, {{commonly referred to}} as “drawdowns”, is usually done electronically by requesting the funds to the federal agency via website or a network. The funds are automatically transferred from the US Department of Treasury to the recipient’s bank account. Federal assistance for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods, also called “funding techniques”: by either advances of funds or by reimbursement of funds.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Stevenson {{defeated}} incumbent Thomas C. McCreery for {{his seat}} in the U.S. Senate after criticizing McCreery for allegedly supporting the appointment of Stephen G. Burbridge, who was hated by most Kentuckians, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> position. In the Senate, he opposed internal improvements and defended a constructionist view of the constitution, resisting efforts to expand the powers expressly granted in that document. Beginning in late 1873, Stephenson functioned as the first chairman (later called floor leader) of the Senate Democratic caucus. He did not seek reelection in 1877, returning to his law practice and accepting future Kentucky Governor William Goebel as a law partner. He chaired the 1880 Democratic National Convention and {{was elected president of}} the American Bar Association in 1884. He died in Covington on August 10, 1886, and was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery at Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, {{reports of}} a sniper {{shooting}} cars along I-96 in four counties led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> investigation and a multi-jurisdictional task force of 100law enforcement officials. As of October 30, 2012, 25shootings had been linked to one suspect. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Crime Stoppers offered a $102,000 reward {{for information leading to}} the arrest of the perpetrator. The suspect, Raulie Casteel of Wixom, was arrested on November 5, 2012, and ordered to stand trial in 2013 in Oakland County for 60charges in one case, with a second trial on terrorism and murder charges to be brought by the Michigan Attorney General. On October 30, 2013, the suspect pleaded no contest, but mentally ill, in the Oakland County case, and he was sentenced to serve anywhere from six years and eight months to 10 years in prison on multiple assault charges (as well as two concurrent years on weapons charges) for that case on February 4, 2014. The trial for the Livingston County case began on January 14, 2014, and after being convicted on the terrorism charge, Casteel was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in state prison.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 2007, Scrushy {{was sentenced}} to six years and ten months in a federal prison, ordered to pay $267,000 in {{restitution}} to United Way of Alabama, three years probation, and a fine of $150,000. Scrushy {{is also expected to}} personally pay for his time in prison and perform 500 hours of community service. Siegelman was sentenced on the same day to seven years and four months in prison, restitution of $181,325 to the state, three years probation, a $50,000 fine, and 500 hours of community service upon his release. U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller would later rule, however, that Sieglman would not be required to pay the $181,325 in restitution. The restitution was based on debts accumulated by the State of Alabama during a fraudulent warehouse deal, but Siegelman was acquitted on charges related to the deal. Upon sentencing, Scrushy and Siegelman were taken into custody and transported <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> prison in Atlanta, Georgia, where they briefly shared a cell.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Skinner arrives home he is met by Mulder, {{who tells}} {{him about the}} case {{and the fact that}} someone is going to great lengths to cover it up. Mulder reveals that Detective Thomas was killed, which shocks Skinner. Mulder tells Skinner that Scully is {{undergoing}} tests regarding her cancer. Later that night Skinner meets with The Smoking Man, who is accompanied by Thomas' murderer, the Gray Haired Man (Morris Panych). Skinner is angry that Thomas was killed and wants to end their arrangement, which The Smoking Man refuses to allow. Mulder calls Skinner, telling him about the woman's body being burned and the blood evidence being tampered with. Mulder tells Skinner that he is trying to match the bullet that killed Thomas to a gun issued <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> agent or local officer. Skinner searches his drawer and realizes that his gun was missing and must have been the one used for the murder. Skinner, realizing he has been set up, calls The Smoking Man, who confirms that Thomas was killed with Skinner's gun and that by going to the police Skinner would end up implicating himself in the murder. The Smoking Man refuses to provide any details on what he is covering up.|$|E
