5|$|On the January 31, 2000 {{edition of}} Raw, the Mean Street Posse asked the Acolytes to protect them, which {{they refused to}} do, until the Posse offered to pay them. When they did, Bradshaw started the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA). In reality, the gimmick of the tag team was created by Bradshaw. To further enhance their gimmick, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> began to appear weekly {{backstage}} in an office, dubbed <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> Office. After protecting many WWF superstars, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> began a feud with Bull Buchanan and The Big Bossman. The feud began on the April 10, 2000 edition of Raw, where Buchanan and Bossman attacked <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> during a match, where they protected Kai En Tai. <b>The</b> <b>APA,</b> however, was unsuccessful in winning a tag team match against them at Backlash. On the May 18, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> were hired to protect Crash Holly for an hour, {{to prevent him from}} losing his WWF Hardcore Championship. After the hour was up, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> left, allowing Gerald Brisco to pin Holly for the Hardcore Championship. The situation resulted in Holly challenging Bradshaw in a Hardcore match, which Bradshaw won. Later that week on SmackDown!, Faarooq defeated Holly in a Hardcore match.|$|E
5|$|On the June 26, 2000 {{edition of}} Raw, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> won a Tag-Team Battle Royal against seven other teams {{to win a}} WWF Tag Team Championship match. During {{the weeks leading up}} to Fully Loaded, Edge and Christian avoided {{defending}} the Tag Team Championship against <b>the</b> <b>APA.</b> On July 10, 2000, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> were scheduled to face Edge and Christian for the Tag Team Championship, but Edge announced that he would face Bradshaw one-on-one in a match, which Bradshaw lost. Later that week on SmackDown!, Edge and Christian were scheduled to defend their Tag Team Championship against <b>the</b> <b>APA,</b> but they again made a one-on-one match, where Christian was defeated by Faarooq. At Fully Loaded, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> won the Tag Team match by disqualification; due to WWF rules, Edge and Christian retained the Tag Team Championship. On the September 7, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the Dudley Boyz and <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> formed an alliance. The following week on Raw, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> faced Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) in a losing effort. Then, on the September 18, 2000 edition of Raw, the Dudley Boyz also lost to Buchanan and The Goodfather. After the match, all the members of the Right to Censor (Buchanan, The Goodfather, Steven Richards, and Val Venis) attacked the Dudley Boyz, which resulted in <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> coming out to help the Dudley Boyz, as a part of their alliance. The Dudley Boyz and <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> were then booked in an Eight-man Tag Team match against Right to Censor at Unforgiven, which Right to Censor won via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|After {{sporadic}} feuds through midway 2001, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> {{were awarded}} a WWF Tag Team Championship match against the Dudley Boyz on the July 9, 2001 edition of Raw, where Bradshaw pinned D-Von {{to win the}} WWF Tag Team Championship. The following month on SmackDown!, however, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to Kanyon and Diamond Dallas Page. After their loss of the Tag Team Championship, Faarooq was briefly absent, while Bradshaw began to pursue singles championships, like on the September 27, 2001 edition of SmackDown!, where Bradshaw lost an WWF Intercontinental Championship match against Christian. On the October 22, 2001 edition of Raw, Bradshaw defeated The Hurricane to win the WWF European Championship. When Faarooq returned, Bradshaw lost the European Championship to Christian on the November 1, 2001 edition of SmackDown!. At No Way Out, <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> won a Tag Team Turmoil match to win a WWF Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania X8. <b>The</b> <b>APA</b> were unsuccessful in winning the Tag Team Championship on two occasions: on the February 28, 2002 edition of SmackDown! and at WrestleMania X8.|$|E

5|$|At No Way Out, the Hardy Boyz {{participated in}} a tag team turmoil match which was won by <b>the</b> <b>A.P.A.</b> At WrestleMania X8, along with <b>the</b> <b>A.P.A.</b> and the Dudley Boyz, the Hardyz {{challenged}} Billy and Chuck for the Tag Team Championship in a Four Corners elimination match. <b>The</b> <b>A.P.A.</b> were eliminated by the Dudleyz, whom the Hardy Boyz managed to eliminate. In the end, however, they were pinned by the champions, thus losing the opportunity. They then began a feud with the newcomer Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman. At Judgment Day, the Hardy Boyz lost to Lesnar and Heyman in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|In early 2004, The World's Greatest Tag Team began a scripted {{rivalry with}} <b>The</b> <b>APA,</b> and beat {{them at the}} No Way Out pay-per-view. Following their loss, The World's Greatest Tag Team mocked <b>The</b> <b>APA,</b> leading to <b>The</b> <b>APA</b> attacking them. Both the team of Scotty Too Hotty and Rikishi and the Basham Brothers also got {{involved}} in the brawl, leading to a fatal four-way match at WrestleMania XX for the WWE Tag Team Championship. At WrestleMania, Scotty Too Hotty and Rikishi retained the championship.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to <b>the</b> <b>APA</b> Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
