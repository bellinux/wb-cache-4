30|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance logging (NMR) {{is an open}} well logging method. Drilling mud resistivity, formation resistivity and sodium ions influence its radio frequency (RF) field strength and NMR logging signals. Research on these effects can provide an important basis for NMR logging data acquisition and interpretation. Three models, water-based drilling mud—water bearing formation, water-based drilling mud—oil bearing formation, oil-based drilling mud—water bearing formation, were studied by finite element method numerical simulation. The influences of drilling mud resistivity and formation resistivity on the NMR logging tool RF field and the influences of sodium ions on the NMR logging signals were simulated numerically. On the basis of analysis, RF field correction and sodium ion correction formulae were proposed and their application range was also discussed. The results indicate that when drilling mud resistivity and formation resistivity are 0.02 Ω·m and 0.2 Ω·m respectively, the attenuation index of centric NMR logging tool is 8.9 % and 9.47 % respectively. The RF field of an eccentric NMR logging tool is affected mainly by formation resistivity. When formation resistivity is 0.1 Ω·m, the attenuation index is 17.5 %. For centric NMR logging tools, the signals coming from sodium ions can be up to 31.8 % of total signal. Suggestions are proposed for further research into NMR logging <b>tool</b> <b>correction</b> method and response characteristics.|$|E

40|$|The {{difficulty}} with information retrieval for OCR documents {{lies in the}} fact that OCR documents comprise of a significant amount of erroneous words and unfortunately most information retrieval techniques rely heavily on word matching between documents and queries. In this paper, we propose a general content-based correction model that can work on top of an existing OCR <b>correction</b> <b>tool</b> to "boost" retrieval performance. The basic idea of this correction model is to exploit the whole content of a document to supplement any other useful information provided by an existing OCR <b>correction</b> <b>tool</b> for word <b>correction.</b> Instead of making an explicit correction decision for each erroneous word as typically done in a traditional approach, we consider the uncertainties in such correction decisions and compute an estimate of the original "uncorrupted" document language model accordingly. The document language model can then be used for retrieval with a language modeling retrieval approach. Evaluation using a TREC standard testing collection indicates that our method significantly improves the performance when compared with simple word correction approaches such as using only the top ranked correction...|$|R

40|$|Metabolic {{acidosis}} is {{a result}} of ongoing pathological processes in the patient. When caused by intoxication with methanol and ethylene glycol, it signals a serious and potentially lethal condition, in which early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for the outcome. Estimation of the anion (AG) and osmolal gaps (OG) are still important diagnostic tools in these intoxications. Correction of severe acidosis with base infusion is usually part of the treatment, {{despite the fact that the}} indication for this is still debated. Osmolal gaps were determined in blood samples from 115 blood donors at Vestfold hospital trust (Sykehuset i Vestfold (SiV)). A nonsystematic search in PubMed was carried out to identify earlier presented normal values of OG. The project thesis lists the normal values of OG found in studies that have used the same equation for calculation as used in this study. Presentation of acid-base theory is based on search in PubMed and in textbooks related to the topic. To consider values of OG under 20 mosmol/kgH 2 O to be normal, seems reasonable in acutely admitted patients. Lower values do not exclude severe methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning. Faster identification of these conditions with new diagnostic equipment would be preferable. Until then, OG and AG are still important as diagnostic <b>tools.</b> <b>Correction</b> of metabolic acidosis can improve outcome in methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, and should be used as part of treatment in these conditions.

40|$|Optical {{instruments}} for areal topography measurement {{can be especially}} sensitive to noise when scanning is required. Such noise has different sources, including those internally generated and external sources from the environment [1]. For some instruments, {{it is not always}} possible to evaluate each single contributor. Nevertheless, it is possible to evaluate the noise added to the output during the normal use of the instrument. Such noise is defined in ISO 25178 part 605 [1] as “measurement noise”. In this work, the measurement noise is assessed for a commercial point autofocus instrument (Mitaka MLP- 3 SP), installed in the manufacturing metrology laboratory at The University of Nottingham. The investigation is carried out by areal acquisitions of 100 µm× 100 µmwith a 100 ×magnification objective and a sampling distance of 0. 1 µm along the x-axis and 1 µm along the y-axis. The measurement noise is evaluated by applying established subtraction and averaging methods described elsewhere [2, 3]. The results reveal a maximum calculated value of 20 nm (subtraction method) and a minimum of 8 nm (subtraction method). An oscillationis observed in the acquired surface topographies, which is due to a thermal drift induced by the air conditioning system. The disturbance can be reduced using the temperature <b>correction</b> <b>tool</b> in the software of the instrument. Experiments performed when the air conditioning system is inactive, showed drift of the instrument due to the temperature which is estimated, in the worst case, as 0. 9 µm/oC(calculated as Sz/ΔT), over one hour measuring time. The investigation was then repeated applying the temperature <b>correction</b> <b>tool</b> and the evaluation of the measurement noise results in a value of 2 nm (both methods). The overall temperature variation, measured in the housing chamber of the instrument, is smaller than 0. 1 o C during each repeated measurement. In conclusion, the point autofocus instrument shows a clear dependence on the environmental noise. The measurement noise uncertainty contributor in the worst case is estimated to be unoise= 20 nmwhen the temperature <b>correction</b> <b>tool</b> Abstract submitted to the www. metprops 2017. se conference is not applied [2].
