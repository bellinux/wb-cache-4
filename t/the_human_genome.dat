5000|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} indicate that some [...] "junk DNA" [...] sequences {{are likely to}} have unidentified functional activity and that the process of exaptation of fragments of originally selfish or non-functional DNA has been commonplace throughout evolution.

5|$|According to a 2005 review, due to {{the high}} levels of {{mortality}} and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P.falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|Genomics {{is central}} to malaria research. With the {{sequencing}} of P.falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome,</b> the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the {{discovery of}} the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published. <b>The</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Project was {{the first step in a}} globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> encodes 16serpin clades, termed serpinA through serpinP, {{including}} 29inhibitory and 7non-inhibitory serpin proteins.

The functions of human serpins have been determined by a combination of biochemical studies, human genetic disorders, and knockout mouse models.|$|E

5|$|CASS4 (Crk {{associated}} substrate 4) is {{the fourth}} and last described member of the CAS protein family. CASS4 was detected by Singh et al. in 2008 following in silico screening of databases describing expressed sequence tags from an evolutionarily diverse group of organisms, using the CAS-related proteins (p130Cas, NEDD9/HEF1 and EFS) mRNAs as templates. Singh et al. subsequently cloned and characterized the CASS4 gene, originally assigning the name HEPL (HEF1-EFS-p130Cas-like) for similarity to the other three defined CAS genes. The official name was subsequently changed to CASS4 by <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).|$|E

5|$|Transcription {{is carried}} out by a DNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome,</b> operates {{as part of a}} large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{has written}} for The New York Times since 1981 as an {{editorial}} writer, science editor and a reporter, including articles supporting the idea of recent human evolution and racial differentiation. His motivation for writing Before the Dawn began during his reporting of genetics, particularly since the sequencing of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> in 2003, as he started to realise {{how it could be}} related to the human past. He sought to put all of the recent research of archaeology, paleoanthropology and linguistics together into one narrative revolving around genetics.

5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, an Italian-led {{consortium}} {{announced they}} had sequenced the complete genome {{of the apple}} in collaboration with horticultural genomicists at Washington State University, using 'Golden Delicious'. It had about 57,000 genes, {{the highest number of}} any plant genome studied to date and more genes than <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> (about 30,000). This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to resistance to disease and drought, and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. The genome sequence also provided proof that Malus sieversii was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple—an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|Insects play an {{important}} role in biological research. Because of its small size, short generation time and high fecundity, the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was selected as a model organism for studies of the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, animal behaviour and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies helps scientists to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the fruit fly's important role in biological research. 70% of the fly genome is similar to <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>genome,</b> supporting the Darwinian theory of evolution from a single origin of life.|$|E
