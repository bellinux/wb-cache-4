50|$|Although {{relatively}} obscure at {{the time}} of its release, the console has recently seen increased interest from fans, hackers/modders, and collectors on the secondary market. Apart from historical interest in the system, several features unique to the Famicom <b>Titler</b> make it a popular system for modification and use. The clarity that comes from internal RGB video generation is a prized feature shared only with the considerably rarer PlayChoice-10 system created by Nintendo as an arcade system for store displays and in video arcades. Since the PlayChoice-10 was not released commercially, the Famicom <b>Titler</b> has recently been recognized as an easier way to get a system with the same clarity for a cheaper price. In addition, the fact that the Famicom <b>Titler</b> is the only system to feature S-Video output has meant that the system enjoys compatibility with setups that allow only this form of component video.|$|E

50|$|Released {{during a}} period of close {{association}} between Sharp and Nintendo, the Famicom <b>Titler</b> followed the C1 NES TV and the Twin Famicom as the third of what would eventually be four products in the Sharp's Nintendo Console family of products. The Famicom <b>Titler</b> was the most technologically ambitious project that Sharp had attempted with the Famicom system. It was the only commercially available Famicom to internally generate RGB video, and this has been identified as responsible for markedly improved clarity of image over other Famicom models. It is the only Famicom console to employ S-Video output. It also features a keyboard and pressure-sensitive touchpad that enables users to produce subtitles directly on the screen during gameplay, and to thereby create demos.|$|E

50|$|Intertitles {{have had}} a long history in the area of amateur film as well. The efforts of home movie aficionados to intertitle their works {{post-production}} have {{led to the development of}} a number of innovative approaches to the challenge. Frequently lacking access to high quality film dubbing and splicing equipment, amateur film makers must plan ahead when making a film to allow space for filming an intertitle over the existing film. Intertitles may be printed neatly on a piece of paper, a card, or a piece of cardboard and filmed, or they may be formed from adhesive strips and affixed to glass. In the early 1980s, digital recording technology improved to the point where intertitles could be created in born-digital format and recorded directly onto the film. Several specialty accessories from this period such as Sony's HVT-2100 <b>Titler</b> and cameras such as Matsushita's Quasar VK-743 and Zenith VC-1800 could be used to generate intertitles for home movies. Early 1980s video game consoles and applications catering to the demo scene were also adapted for the generation and recording of intertitles for home films. Among these were included the ColecoVision, the Magnavox Odyssey² (using programs such as the Type & Talk cartridge and the Voice module), the Bally Astrocade (using the built-in Scribbling program or the more advanced Creative Crayon cartridge), and the intertitle-specialized Famicom <b>Titler.</b>|$|E
