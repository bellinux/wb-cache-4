500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman <b>types,</b> <b>who</b> represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E

2500|$|He {{found that}} one way to enhance his pitches was to extemporize his commercials, poking fun at the {{sponsors}} (while never showing disrespect for the products themselves), the sponsors' company executives, and advertising agency <b>types</b> <b>who</b> wrote the scripted commercials that he regularly ignored.

Encouraged by positive reviews of her comedic performances, Tate chose the comedy Twelve Plus One (1969) as her next project, as she later explained, largely for the opportunity to co-star with Orson Welles.

2500|$|A typical {{admission}} {{staff at}} a college includes a dean or vice president for admission or enrollment management, middle-level managers or assistant directors, admission officers, and administrative support staff. The chief enrollment management officer is sometimes the highest-paid position in the department, earning $121,000 on average in 2010, while admissions officers average only $35,000, according to one estimate. Admissions officers tend {{to be in the}} 30-to-40 age demographic. They are chosen for their experience in admissions, aptitude for statistics and data analysis, experience in administration and marketing and public relations. They serve dual roles as counselors and recruiters, and do not see themselves as marketers or salespeople, according to one view. They are evaluated on how well they [...] "represent their college, manage their office, recruit staff members, and work with other administrators". Michele Hernandez suggested there were basically two types of officers: a first group of personable, sharp, people-oriented go-getter <b>types</b> <b>who</b> were often recent college grads; a second group was somewhat out-of-touch [...] "lifers" [...] who often did not graduate from a highly selective college. Officers are generally paid an annual salary, although there have been reports of some recruiters paid on the basis of how many students they bring to a college, such as recruiters working abroad to recruit foreign students to U.S. universities.|$|E
2500|$|Pangle {{was denied}} tenure at Yale University, in a scandal, during which a senior {{colleague}} explained, in a [...] pronouncement (which became {{the theme of}} a protest panel at the annual convention of the American Political Science Association): [...] "academic freedom is one thing, {{but there are two}} <b>types</b> <b>who</b> will never be permitted tenure at Yale: Leninists and Straussians." [...] The Wall Street Journal ("Dry Rot at College," [...] Editorial Aug. 31, 1979, p.6), Commentary ("God and Man at Yale—Again," [...] by Robert Kagan, February, 1982; Letters exchange, August, 1982) and other journals (The New York Review of Books, May 12, 1983, pp.56–57, [...] "Saving the Free World: An Exchange," [...] statement by Eugene Genovese; Yale Political Monthly, Dec. 1979, pp.2–11, [...] "Academic Freedom at Yale: the Pangle Case"), published editorials, columns, and articles attacking Yale's denial of academic freedom. Yale or its spokespersons denied the imputations. Yale set up a judiciary panel, led by the [...] historian Edmund Morgan, to hear the case—amid campus-wide protests and marches on Pangle's behalf (Yale Daily News, Sept. 10, 1979, p.1, [...] "2,300 Students Protest Tenure Policy"); the panel decided in Pangle's favor and rescinded the decision denying tenure by the Department of Political Science, on the basis of testimony from graduate students about what Political Science faculty had declared in public about the grounds on which Pangle was being denied tenure. Yale instituted a new procedure that took the decision {{out of the hands of}} the department and lodged it in a board, specially designed for Pangle's tenure review, that was composed of five scholars, two not from Yale (led by Peter Gay): Yale University News Release, Monday afternoon, Oct. 15, 1979; Yale Weekly Bulletin and Calendar, Oct. 22-29, 1979, p.1; Yale Daily News, Extra Edition, Oct. 16, 1979, [...] "Pangle Wins New Tenure Review: Original Decision Overruled; Professor says he is 'gratified'". At that point, Pangle resigned, having been offered a tenured position at the University of Toronto (see entries on C. B. Macpherson and Allan Bloom)—and because, as he declared, he no longer felt he could comfortably live with his colleagues in the Yale Political Science Department.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{behavior}} in finitely repeated simultaneous and sequential-move prisoner’s dilemma games {{when there is}} one-sided incomplete information and signaling about players’ concerns for fairness, specifically, their preferences regarding “inequity aversion. ” In this environment, we show that only a pooling equilibrium can be sustained, in which a player <b>type</b> <b>who</b> is unconcerned about fairness initially cooperates in order to disguise himself as a player <b>type</b> <b>who</b> is concerned about fairness. This disguising strategy induces the uninformed player to cooperate in all periods of the repeated game, including the final period, {{at which point the}} player <b>type</b> <b>who</b> is unconcerned about fairness takes the opportunity to defect, i. e., he “backstabs ” the uninformed player. Despite such last-minute defection, our results show that the introduction of incomplete information can actually result in a Pareto improvement under certain conditions. We connect the predictions of this “backstabbing ” equilibrium with the frequently observed decline in cooperative {{behavior in}} the final period of finitely-repeated experimental games...|$|R
6000|$|A modern Utopia {{differs from}} all the older Utopias in its {{recognition}} of the need of poietic activities--one sees this new consideration creeping into thought {{for the first time}} in the phrasing of Comte's insistence that [...] "spiritual" [...] must precede political reconstruction, and in his admission of the necessity of recurrent books and poems about Utopias--and at first this recognition appears to admit only an added complication to a problem already unmanageably complex. Comte's separation of the activities of a State into the spiritual and material does, to a certain extent, anticipate this opposition of poietic and kinetic, but the intimate texture of his mind was dull and hard, the conception slipped from him again, and his suppression of literary activities, and his imposition of a rule of life upon the poietic <b>types,</b> <b>who</b> are least able to sustain it, mark how deeply he went under. To a large extent he followed the older Utopists in assuming that the philosophical and constructive problem could be done once for all, and he worked the results out simply under an organised kinetic government. But what seems to be merely an addition to the difficulty may in the end turn out to be a simplification, just as the introduction of a fresh term to an intricate irreducible mathematical expression will at times bring it to unity.|$|E
60|$|And {{now they}} were herded in {{at the base of}} the Abousir Rock, this little group of modern <b>types</b> <b>who</b> had fallen into the rough clutch of the seventh century,--for in all save the rifles in their hands there was nothing to {{distinguish}} these men from the desert warriors who first carried the crescent flag out of Arabia. The East does not change, and the Dervish raiders were not less brave, less cruel, or less fanatical than their forebears. They stood in a circle, leaning upon their guns and spears, and looking with exultant eyes at the dishevelled group of captives. They were clad in some approach to a uniform, red turbans gathered around the neck as well as the head, so that the fierce face looked out of a scarlet frame; yellow, untanned shoes, and white tunics with square, brown patches let into them. All carried rifles, and one had a small, discoloured bugle slung over his shoulder. Half of them were negroes--fine, muscular men, with the limbs of a jet Hercules; and the other half were Baggara Arabs--small, brown, and wiry, with little, vicious eyes, and thin, cruel lips. The chief was also a Baggara, but he was a taller man than the others, with a black beard which came down over his chest, and a pair of hard, cold eyes, which gleamed like glass from under his thick, black brows. They were fixed now upon his captives, and his features were grave with thought. Mr. Stuart had been brought down, his hat gone, his face still flushed with anger, and his trousers sticking in one part to his leg. The two surviving Soudanese soldiers, their black faces and blue coats blotched with crimson, stood silently at attention upon one side of this forlorn group of castaways.|$|E

I should have stuck here--if it had been possible; and I was too young, at twenty-three, to judge, pour deux sous, whether it were possible. If I had waited I might have seen it was, and then I might have been, by staying here, something nearer to one of these <b>types</b> <b>who</b> have been hammered so hard and made so keen by their conditions.
