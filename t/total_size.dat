Ten tons of buried nails were discovered at the Inchtuthil site, which may have had a garrison of up to 6,000 men and which itself consumed 30linear kilometres of wood for the walls alone, which would have used up 100hectares (247acres) of forest.|$|E

5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} {{as the key}} to maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute to take their place. Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the <b>total</b> <b>size</b> of the military remained the same.|$|E
5|$|The former-Portuguese {{colony of}} East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975, however, {{following}} years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President B.J.

The United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was established to organise and conduct the vote, which {{was held at the}} end of August 1999 and resulted with 78.5% of voters deciding in favour of independence. However, following the announcement of the results pro-Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military, launched a campaign of violence, looting and arson and many East Timorese were killed, while perhaps more than 500,000 were displaced. Unable to control the violence, Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. Australia, which had contributed police to UNAMET, organised and led an international military coalition, known as the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET), a non-UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions. The <b>total</b> <b>size</b> of the Australian force committed numbered 5,500 personnel, and included a significant ground force, supported by air and naval forces, in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945.|$|E

25|$|Surgical {{resection}} {{to remove}} the tumor while preserving enough remaining healthy liver to maintain normal physiologic function. Surgical removal results in favorable prognosis, but only 10-15% of patients are suitable for surgical resection. This is often because of extensive disease or poor underlying liver function. For example, resection in cirrhotic patients is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Preoperative evaluation for resection must include imaging of the liver in order to estimate the amount of residual liver remaining after surgery; {{in order to preserve}} normal function, the residual liver volume should be more than 25% of the <b>total</b> <b>size</b> in a non-cirrhotic liver, and more than 40% of the <b>total</b> <b>size</b> for a cirrhotic liver. The overall recurrence rate after resection is 50-60%. The Singapore Liver Cancer Recurrence (SLICER) score can be used to estimate risk of recurrence after surgery.|$|E
