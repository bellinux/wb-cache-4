More than half of this is under 3,000years old, and about 12% is less than 1,000years of age. Between the years 1700 and 2016, eruptions originated from six vents; four of these lava flows poured into the sea to the west coast.|$|E

Marshall replied <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the Army would like to have Middleton back in uniform, all the Army could do would be to place him in some training role, which would not effectively use his battle experience.|$|E

5|$|This {{control was}} further {{consolidated}} during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, which witnessed English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland) {{are estimated to}} include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have {{died as a result}} of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war. A further 50,000 were sent into indentured servitude in the West Indies. Some historians estimate <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> half of the pre-war population of Ireland may have {{died as a result of}} the conflict.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, {{mostly in the}} form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. In reality, environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited {{it is unlikely that the}} full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new pumped storage schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E

25|$|Television in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, {{with the}} {{founding}} of TV Tupi by Assis Chateaubriand.

25|$|Scientists {{have been}} {{concerned}} that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past. Along with human-made changes in climate (see above), some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting, overfishing, invasive species, or habitat loss. A study published in May 2017 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences argued that a “biological annihilation” akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway {{as a result of}} anthropogenic causes, such as over-population and over-consumption. The study suggested <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 50% of the number of animal individuals that once lived on Earth were already extinct, threatening the basis for human existence too.|$|E
