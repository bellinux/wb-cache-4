5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on <b>their</b> <b>boat,</b> angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys <b>their</b> <b>boat.</b> This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E

5|$|Aside from tidal {{flooding}} along rivers, the storm's {{effects were}} primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy {{off the coast}} of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters.

Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a {{boat and}} head out onto the lake; <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> is quickly struck by {{something}} and sinks.

Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be an alligator. Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being an alligator and not Big Blue. As the agents leave, Big Blue swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Blackmer and Culp depart {{the next}} morning, <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> is {{attacked}} by an alligator, now enlarged {{because of the}} contamination. Orchard's assistant, Hector McGill, manages to rescue only Blackmer.

On the advice of Mrs Files, McGill contacts International Rescue and John (voiced by Ray Barrett) alerts Tracy Island. Jeff (Peter Dyneley) dispatches Thunderbirds 1 and 2. Arriving at the scene, Scott (Shane Rimmer) briefly dispels the reptiles with his hoverjet cannon and accesses the house through the laboratory window.
