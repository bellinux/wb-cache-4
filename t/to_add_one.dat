5|$|There {{are plans}} <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>one</b> lane in each direction, {{as well as}} two {{reversible}} lanes, from I-15 to SR125. These plans were put on hold in 2008 due to a budget shortfall. Completion is scheduled to take place by 2040. Caltrans recommends adding two more lanes between I-5 and I-805, and two HOV lanes between I-805 and I-15.|$|E

Daniel rushed 20times for 75yards and a TD {{while the}} rest of the Tiger's offense was only able <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>one</b> rushing yard on seven carries. The Sooners' QB Paul Thompson went 11 for 19 with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also ran for 28yards and a score while Allen Patrick added 162yards on 36carries. Meanwhile Malcolm Kelly became the fastest player in Oklahoma history to reach 1,000career {{receiving}} yards, after only his 19th game.|$|E
5|$|The Karlovac Operational Zone did not {{assist the}} 137th Infantry Brigade, instead {{directing}} subordinated units to lift JNA sieges of Slunj and Saborsko and securing the Karlovac–Slunj road. This prompted Katušin to request help from Zagreb Operational Zone commander Colonel Stjepan Mateša. Mateša, {{a native of}} Duga Resa, ordered the 7th Brigade of the Croatian TO to deploy a battalion to Karlovac. Although the General Staff approved the order (instructing the 8th Brigade of the Croatian TO <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>one</b> of its battalions), no 8th Brigade troops were sent.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>one</b> new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E

5|$|The primary freeway {{running through}} Lewisville is Interstate 35E, which runs north–south through the city. Before it was built, US Highway 77 (now Mill Street) {{was the main}} through route, {{connecting}} the city with Denton {{to the north and}} Dallas to the south. In 1998, the Texas Department of Transportation carried out a Major Investment Study to examine the possibility of expanding the section of Interstate 35E between Interstate 635 and U.S. Route 380, the primary focus being an stretch from Texas State Highway 121 to the bridge crossing Lewisville Lake. The project is scheduled <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>one</b> general-purpose lane in each direction, in addition to a managed toll lane. The project is expected to allow the city to substantially renovate its portion of the I-35 Corridor. Construction on {{the first phase of the}} project is projected to begin in summer 2013 and finish in late 2016.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the techniques of topo-algebraic recognition for languages beyond the regular setting {{as they relate to}} logic on words. In particular, we provide a general construction on recognisers corresponding <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>one</b> layer of various kinds of quantifiers and prove a related Reutenauer-type theorem. Our main tools are codensity monads and duality theory. Our construction yields, in particular, a new characterisation of the profinite monad of the free S-semimodule monad for finite commutative semirings S, which generalises our earlier insight that the Vietoris monad on Boolean spaces is the codensity monad of the finite powerset functor.

This in game system allowed for user-friendly interaction between friends and bypassed the need for players to exit the game to talk to friends; a feature that was absent from most other PS3 titles, until system firmware 2.40 was released.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, the American Football League {{agreed to}} a merger with its older and more {{established}} rival, the National Football League. Among {{the terms of the}} merger was that the AFL was permitted <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>one</b> additional franchise. One of the reasons the NFL agreed to this was that they wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added that brought the combined total number clubs in the merged league to twenty-six teams. The NFL was content for that team to be in the American Football League because it meant that the existing nine AFL clubs were the ones that had to provide players in the ensuing expansion draft and the NFL owners preferred for the ensuing dilution of talent to occur in what they had always considered to be an inferior league. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million–400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.|$|E

500|$|By February 2005, Paul Lovett and David Elliot, {{who wrote}} di Bonaventura's Four Brothers, were {{rewriting}} Gordon's draft. In their script, the Rex character is corrupted and mutated into the Cobra Commander, whom Destro needs to lead {{an army of}} supersoldiers. Skip Woods was rewriting the script by March 2007, and he added the Alex Mann character from the British Action Man toy line. Di Bonaventura explained, [...] "Unfortunately, our president [...] has {{put us in a}} position internationally where {{it would be very difficult}} to release a movie called G.I. Joe. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>one</b> character to the mix is sort of a fun thing to do." [...] The script was leaked online by El Mayimbe of Latino Review, who revealed Woods had dropped the Cobra Organization in favor of the Naja / Ryan, a crooked CIA agent. In this draft, Scarlett is married to Action Man but still has feelings for Duke, and is killed by the Baroness. Snake Eyes speaks, but his vocal cords are slashed during the story, rendering him mute. Mayimbe suggested Stuart Beattie rewrite the script. Fan response to the film following the script review was negative. Di Bonaventura promised with subsequent rewrites, [...] "I'm hoping we're going to get it right this time." [...] He admitted he had problems with Cobra, concurring with an interviewer [...] "they were probably the stupidest evil organization out there [...] ". Hasbro promised they would write Cobra back into the script.|$|E
