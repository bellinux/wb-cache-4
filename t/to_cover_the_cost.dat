5|$|Prisoners {{would often}} take their {{families}} with them, {{which meant that}} entire communities sprang up inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, and attorneys charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the debtors out. Prisoners' families, including children, often had to find employment simply <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|An urban legend {{surfaced}} in 2011 when a tumblr blog titled Dr. Dre Started Burning Man began proliferating {{the notion that}} the producer, rapper and entrepreneur had discovered Burning Man in 1995 during a music video shoot and offered <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the event's permit from the Nevada Bureau of Land Management under an agreement with the festival's organizers that he could institute an entrance fee system, which had not existed before his participation. This claim was supported by an alleged letter from Dre to Nicole Threatt Young that indicated that Dre had shared his experience witnessing the Burning Man festival with her.|$|E

A variety of small donations allowed Cooper and other Australian athletes to compete. She won three gold and two silver medals, and broke two world records and three Paralympic records.

In October, Toyota agreed <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> overruns associated with preparing the site for construction.|$|E

Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which usually takes one year, or towards a doctorate, which takes three or more years.|$|E

5|$|The College {{was founded}} by Archbishop of Canterbury William Courtenay in 1395. Courtenay died in 1396 and the College and church were {{completed}} by his successor, Thomas Arundel. Richard II endowed the College with land and income from the Hospital of St Peter and St Paul in Maidstone and from the parishes of Linton, Farleigh, Sutton and Crundale. The College was also granted the advowsons for the parishes. <b>To</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of building the College, Courtenay obtained a bull to levy a charge of fourpence in the pound on all ecclesiastical revenue raised in his archbishopric. For most of its existence, the college had an establishment of a master and six chaplains.|$|E

Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of transferring the tape recording to acetate disc.

5|$|Collins {{followed}} up her {{success in the}} 1985 special session with a push for more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers obliged by approving an additional $100million for {{higher education in the}} biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' request for an additional $3.9million to improve the state's vocational education system. Legislators approved calling a referendum on a constitutional amendment– supported by Collins– to make the state superintendent of education an appointive, rather than elective, office. The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a Collins-led campaign in favor of it. The increased corporate tax intended <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the state income tax was abandoned when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.|$|E
5|$|Despite the setbacks, Kasztner, Hansi Brand and {{the rest}} of the {{committee}} secured the release of around 1,684 Jews, including 273 children, who were allowed to leave Budapest for Switzerland by train on 30 June 1944. The committee paid SS officer Kurt Becher $1000 per person in foreign currency, shares, jewellery and gold, raised from the wealthier passengers <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the rest. After an unexplained detour to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, the passengers arrived in Switzerland in two batches in August and December that year. Joel Brand's mother, sister and niece were on the train, as were 10 members of Kasztner's family and 388 people from the Kolozsvár ghetto in his home town. Kastner's relationship with these passengers led to the criticism that his negotiations with Becher had focused on saving people he knew, an allegation that led to his assassination in 1957.|$|E
