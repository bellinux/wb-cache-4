40|$|Since present {{conventional}} glass <b>melting</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{have reached}} their technological limits {{both in terms}} of energy usage and emission, a number of add-on systems have been developed for regenerative and recuperative furnaces in recent years to minimize NO_x emissions and the energy consumption of these conventional furnaces by means of already known primary and secondary measures, the modification of these measures and their combination. The individual components of a glass <b>melting</b> <b>furnace</b> have been designed, coordinated, optimized and developed further for this R and D project in order to develop one of the largest <b>melting</b> <b>furnaces</b> for container glass and to install a trend-setting prototypical full scale unit for the first time which now represents the third generation of a well-known and proven glass <b>melting</b> <b>furnace</b> type. Since glass <b>melting</b> <b>furnaces</b> are a very complex system, many of their parameters cannot be simply applied from one scale to the next so that certain specific tasks had to be redefined, resimulated, retraced and resolved by means of physical model tests and corresponding mathematical computer calculations in order to achieve the aim of this R and D project and to reduce the economic risks with the implementation of the development results. The primary environmental technology involved in the standard LoNOx"c"i"r"c"l"e"d"R Melter does not require any external add-on systems and so the furnace compaign can be extended and savings are achieved in both material and labour costs which will finally result in a lower final unit cost of glass produced.

However, three crucible samples recorded extreme temperatures as high as 1650 °C, suggesting very high flame temperatures for wood fuel. The analyzed red bricks were made with local calcium-poor clay. One of them was tempered with refractory fragments, demonstrating an in-house production and the recycling of such a material after its use.
