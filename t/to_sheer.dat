5|$|It {{was during}} this {{assignment}} that she suffered a near-catastrophe when she ran aground on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank. Agincourt was leading the inshore column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column, and gently ran aground sideways when the senior flagship's navigator failed {{to compensate for the}} set of the tide. Warrior, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> off in time.|$|E
5|$|Behind Volage and Danaé, the Venetian Corona {{had engaged}} Cerberus {{in a close}} range duel, during which Cerberus took heavy damage but inflicted similar {{injuries}} on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of Active caused the Danaé, Corona and Carolina <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> off and retreat to the east. To the rear, Amphion succeeded in closing with and raking Flore, and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the French colours overboard in surrender. Captain Péridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in Flores later movements. Amphion then attacked Bellona and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender. During this combat, the small ship Principessa Augusta fired on Amphion from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off. Hoste sent a punt to take possession of Bellona but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize Flore. Realising Amphion's difficulty, the officers of Flore, who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between Amphion and Bellona, immediately set sail for the French harbour on Lesina (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.|$|E

The finial can also function as a lightning rod, and was once believed {{to act as a}} deterrent to witches on broomsticks attempting to land on one's roof.

25|$|In {{all these}} struggles, {{he was more}} or less unsuccessful, owing partly {{to the fact that he}} and his forces had to oppose {{superior}} generals (e.g. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and Christian IV of Denmark) and partly <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> ill-luck. Compared with his foreign policy, the domestic policy of Charles IX was comparatively unimportant. It aimed at confirming and supplementing what had already been done during his regency. He did not officially become king until 22 March 1604. The first deed in which the title appears is dated 20 March 1604; but he was not crowned until 15 March 1607.|$|E
25|$|A finial from Chapelton House or {{possibly}} a 'wheat sheaf' {{from the old}} Monks' Well {{is used as a}} feature in the gardens. Apart from pure ornamentation the finial can also function as a lightning rod, and was once believed to act as a deterrent to witches on broomsticks attempting to land on one's roof. On making her final landing approach to a roof, the witch, spotting the obstructing finial, was forced <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> off and land elsewhere. An old lintel from a door is recorded in 1939 as being built into a wall in the garden with the inscription 'S.M. 1740', possibly standing for one of the 'Miller' family'.|$|E

For example, Sumiteru Taniguchi recounts that, while clinging to the tremoring road surface after the Fat Man detonation, he witnessing another child being blown away, the destruction of buildings around him and stones flying through the air. Similarly, Akihiro Takahashi and his classmates were blown by the blast of Little Boy by {{a distance of about}} 10 meters, having survived due to not colliding with any walls etc. during his flight through the air, Likewise, Katsuichi Hosoya has a near identical testimony.|$|E

500|$|Steinitz {{strove to}} be {{objective}} in his writings about chess competitions and games, for example he attributed <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> bad luck a poor tournament score by Henry Edward Bird, whom he considered no friend of his, and was generous in his praise of great play by even his bitter enemies. He could poke fun at {{some of his own}} rhetoric, for example [...] "I remarked that I would rather die in America than live in England. ... I added that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, I {{have come to the conclusion}} that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match." [...] At a joint simultaneous display in Russia around the time of the 1895–96 Saint Petersburg tournament, Emanuel Lasker and Steinitz formed an impromptu comedy double act.|$|E
500|$|Cunningham {{stayed on}} in the Mediterranean and in 1915 Scorpion was {{involved}} in the attack on the Dardanelles. For his performance Cunningham was rewarded with promotion to commander and the award of the Distinguished Service Order. Cunningham spent much of 1916 on routine patrols. In late 1916, he was engaged in convoy protection, a duty he regarded as mundane. He had no contact with German U-boats during this time, on which he commented; [...] "The immunity of my convoys was probably due <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> luck". Convinced that the Mediterranean held few offensive possibilities he requested to sail for home. Scorpion paid off on 21 January 1918. In his seven years as captain of the Scorpion, Cunningham had developed a reputation for first class seamanship. He was transferred by Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes to , part of Keyes' Dover Patrol, in April 1918. and for his actions with the Dover Patrol, he was awarded a bar to his DSO the following year.|$|E
500|$|Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams' {{performance}} as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children [...] "needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking {{to understand how}} funny he is."

[...] Furthermore, English-Irish comedian Spike Milligan considered {{it to be the}} greatest film of all time. James Berardinelli gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the [...] "crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults, a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post, who also said [...] "kids are still going to be entranced by the magic and adventure." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters, describing the expressive magic carpet as [...] "its most remarkable accomplishment" [...] and considered that [...] "Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> technical virtuosity." ...|$|E

500|$|Spee, {{making a}} leisurely voyage {{back to the}} Atlantic, wanted to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley and sent the {{armoured}} cruiser [...] and the light cruiser [...] {{to see if the}} harbour was clear of British warships on the morning of 8 December. They were spotted at 7:30 AM, although the pre-dreadnought , grounded in Stanley Harbour to defend the town and its wireless station, did not receive the signal until 7:45. Sturdee was not expecting an engagement and most of his ships were coaling -and hence temporarily defenceless. The armoured cruiser [...] and the light cruiser [...] had one or both of their engines under repair. The armed merchant cruiser Macedonian was patrolling the outer harbour entrance while the armoured cruiser [...] was anchored in the outer harbour, scheduled to relieve the Macedonian at 8:00 AM. The German ships were not expecting resistance and the first salvo from Canopuss guns at 9:20 caused them <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> off from their bombardment of the wireless station and fall back on Spee's main body.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the engagement, Worden {{directed}} Williams {{to steer}} Monitor around the stern of Confederate ironclad, where Lieutenant Wood fired his 7-inch Brooke gun at the vessel's pilothouse, striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold, cracking the structural [...] "iron log" [...] along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was peering out. Worden was heard to have cried out, My eyes—I am blind! Others in the pilothouse had also been hit with fragments and were also bleeding. Temporarily blinded by shell fragments and gunpowder residue from the explosion and believing the pilothouse to be severely damaged, Worden ordered Williams <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> off into shallow water, where Virginia with her deep draft could not follow. There Monitor drifted idly for about twenty minutes. At the time the pilothouse was struck Worden's injury was only known to those in the pilothouse and immediately nearby. With Worden severely wounded, command passed to the Executive Officer, Samuel Greene. Taken by surprise and confused he hesitated briefly and was undecided as to what action to take next, but after assessing the damage soon ordered Monitor to return to the battle area.|$|E
500|$|For {{the opening}} {{night of the}} European leg of the tour in Sunderland, England, Angela Upex of the Evening Chronicle awarded the concert 5 stars, stating [...] "from {{beginning}} to end, Beyoncé's Stadium of Light date was an utter triumph dazzling 50,000 loyal North East fans" [...] and added [...] "As a stalwart of Stadium of Light gigs, I've seen them all but last night {{was one of the}} most mesmerising concerts I've ever witnessed". Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph also awarded the same show 5 stars and opened her positive review with [...] "When it comes <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> innovation, showmanship and creativity in contemporary pop, Beyoncé has everyone else beaten". Reviewing the first show in London, Lewis Corner of Digital Spy awarded the show 5 stars, noting [...] "Her often formidable and fearsome choreography throughout numbers like [...] "Run The World (Girls)", [...] "Bow Down" [...] and [...] "End Of Time" [...] is powerful and mesmerising, but is then offset by the tenderness of [...] "1+1", [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] and [...] "Runnin (Lose It All)". Beyoncé's dynamic ability to be both vigorous and vulnerable can't be matched by her contemporaries. In fact, we'd go as far to say she's effortlessly proven herself to be this generation's Michael Jackson".|$|E

500|$|Closely {{following}} Victory as {{she passed}} through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship Bucentaure, Harvey was forced <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> away quickly, just missing Victorys stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking raking fire from two French ships, the 80-gun Neptune and the 74-gun Redoutable, as she did so. Redoutables broadside carried away Temeraires mizzen topmast. While avoiding a broadside from Neptune, Temeraire narrowly avoided a collision with Redoutable. Another broadside from Neptune brought down Temeraires fore-yard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. Harvey now became aware that the Redoutable had come up alongside the Victory and swept her decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board the Victory. Temeraire was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across Redoutables stern, Temeraire discharged a double-shotted broadside into her. Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, captain of the Redoutable, recorded that [...] "...the three-decker – who had doubtless perceived that the Victory had ceased fire and would inevitably be taken – ran foul of the Redoutable to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It {{would be impossible to}} describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it." ...|$|E

At the age of 19, he left the seminary due <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> frustration because he was appalled that the rectors ate better food and sat at higher tables than the seminarians.

[...] Q reviewer Thea de Gallier wrote that with their previous two albums, Changing Tune and the self-titled, the band rode the line between punk rock and indie rock. They [...] "lean ever more towards the latter and now they arrive at the sparse, bouncy pop" [...] of Safe in Sound.|$|E
2500|$|Gustav Neckel, {{writing in}} 1920, connects Freyja to the Phrygian goddess Cybele. According to Neckel, both goddesses can be {{interpreted}} as [...] "fertility goddesses" [...] and other potential resemblances have been noted. Some scholars have suggested that the image of Cybele subsequently influenced the iconography of Freyja, the lions drawing the former's chariot becoming large cats. These observation became an extremely common observation in works regarding Old Norse religion until at least the early 1990s. In her book-length study of scholarship on the topic of Freyja, Britt-Mari Näsström (1995) is highly critical of this deduction; Näsström says that [...] "these 'parallels' are due <b>to</b> <b>sheer</b> ignorance about the characteristics of Cybele; scholars have not troubled to look into the resemblances and differences between the two goddesses, if any, in support for their arguments for a common origin." ...|$|E
