5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

25|$|The current T-score system grades {{students}} very finely. It {{is unnecessary}} {{at the young}} age to make such fine distinctions between children.

Hence, by having a wider scoring bands, it would mean <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the same band are similar academically.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, a Human Rights Watch report stated <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> government-run Arab schools {{received}} inferior education due {{to fewer}} teachers, inadequate school construction, {{and lack of}} libraries and recreational space.

25|$|The Singapore Sports School is for {{students}} who are perceived by the school to excel in sports it offers. This includes swimming, badminton, table tennis, soccer, golf, track and field, and sailing. It was opened in January 2004 and the school takes students directly into the school provided they have an active background in the sports offered by the school. When the school had its first intake, many students applied who were judged to excel in their sport but were posted to the Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams. The school rejected these pupils as the school sought pupils who excelled both physically and academically. The school was criticised for being too result wise instead of grooming them into future sportspeople. Some of the students were finally accepted on an appeal basis after <b>that.</b> <b>Students</b> <b>in</b> the school aim for the International Baccalaureate (IB) paper, similar to the Singapore Arts School.|$|E

500|$|One of the administration's early major {{initiatives}} was the No Child Left Behind Act, which {{aimed to}} measure and {{close the gap between}} rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002. Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed [...] "No Child Left Behind" [...] into law. Critics argue that it is underfunded and that NCLBA's focus on [...] "high-stakes testing" [...] and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a {{concurrence}} that argued <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> {{public schools}} {{do not have}} a right to free speech and that Tinker should be overturned. Thomas wrote, [...] "In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools." [...] He praised Hugo Black's dissenting opinion on Tinker and called it [...] "prophetic". Thomas cited the doctrine of in loco parentis, meaning [...] "in place of the parent", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. [...] "In short", he continues, [...] "in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed." [...] He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted Tinker for [...] "usurping [...] traditional authority for the judiciary". Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection [...] "would...be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Section 16C-21 of the Cherokee Code {{provides}} for the structure and financing of the Kituwah Language Immersion Fund. Today, the school serves over 75 students ages seven months to seven years. An allotment of [...]60% of the total gaming revenue received by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) Tribal Government is placed aside for the Kituwah initiative. The purpose of this program {{is to improve the}} overall quality of life for Eastern Band of Cherokee members through increased fluency in Cherokee and cultural awareness by garnering community support, developing language programs and materials for all community members, as well as reestablishing a public life for the language in which Cherokee is commonly heard and spoken. Currently there are two total immersion programs; early childhood education and elementary education. Five preschool classrooms are dedicated to educating children ages two to five years old, which accounts for 24 students currently. In 2010 the New Kituwah Academy became independent of the Cherokee Central Schools of which it was a satellite the previous year. All students that attend the New Kituwah Academy are enrolled members of the EBCI. The school currently has a four-star license through the North Carolina Department of Child Development. Student who attend the school learn all the same curriculum material <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> other schools learn, {{the only difference is that}} the instruction at the New Kituwah Academy is in the Cherokee language. [...] The elementary portion of the academy is guided by the North Carolina standard course of study and the No Child Left Behind Act. This is primarily accomplished by pairing teachers and fluent speakers within each classroom. Understanding the need to be bi-literate, and to score well on standardized testing, the academy teaches English language arts at the end of each school day.|$|E
