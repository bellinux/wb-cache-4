5|$|A {{reviewer}} at RPGFan {{praised the}} game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b> As the science fiction elements were well received, later entries in the series gradually {{moved away from the}} dating theme and became more focused on science fiction. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was the 967th best selling video game of the year in Japan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} {{a score of}} 70/100 from Dutch-language music site Metalfan.NL, which preferred the DVD to the CD version. French-language site MusicWaves gave the album a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, and compared Wednesday 13's style to that of Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson. The album {{received a}} rating of 8/10 from German-language site Metal.de, which recommended it as a good gift. The Swedish-language review site Hallowed.se found the album <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b>|$|E

50|$|Jig borers <b>are</b> limited <b>to</b> working {{materials}} that are still soft enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bored.</b> Often a jig is hardened; for a jig borer this requires the material <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bored</b> first and then hardened, which may introduce distortion. The jig grinder was developed as a machine with the precision of the jig borer, but capable of working materials in their hardened state.|$|R

25|$|He had {{a distant}} {{relationship}} with his youngest brother, but a close one with Manfred. Unlike most Prussian nobles Wolfram von Richthofen went to the local Gymnasium (academic high school) {{and did not have}} private tutors at home. He attended school in Striegau. His grades in mathematics and German language were good, but he did not excel at foreign languages (in which he scored average to poor results). He found studying language <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring,</b> but did learn Italian and could converse competently in it in later life.|$|E
500|$|Trouser Press {{was one of}} the {{few major}} media outlets that did not give the album a good review, instead giving it an average review and stating that [...] "more time spent in the songwriting lab might have yielded {{material}} more suitable to the evident studio effort invested and brought Wilco closer to making a truly great album." [...] Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, describing the music as [...] "purty" [...] but stating that he found the lyrics and vocals in general <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b>|$|E
500|$|Writing for Computer & Video Games, Matthew Woodley {{praised the}} game's variety and interface. While he disliked its long loading times, he {{believed}} that they were [...] "a {{small price to pay for}} such a brilliant game". However, Labyrinth was criticized by the three reviewers of Zzap!64. Although he praised its visuals, co-reviewer Paul Sumner called the game too slow-paced for an action title and too simplistic for an adventure. Co-reviewer Julian Rignall considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> and [...] "a real disappointment", given Lucasfilm's strong track record.|$|E

500|$|I don't think it's {{important}} to take it too literally. I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much {{more aware of the}} environment and how we're destroying the planet. We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it. You know {{at the same time we}} don't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> and serious and not have fun so it's kind of like well if we're going to save the planet can we have a good time while we are doing it? ...|$|E
500|$|Ports of Night Trap {{to other}} {{platforms}} received more harsh reviews; critics felt the game did not age well. Staff at GamePro {{said it was}} [...] "innovative at one time, but Traps graphics and sounds now play like standard stuff." [...] Reviewers at GameFan blamed the game's extensive publicity for making it seem better than it truly was, saying [...] "it's a so-so game that {{got a lot more}} attention than it deserved." [...] Critics overwhelmingly found the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> and dull. On a positive note, however, they did agree that the 3DO and 32X provided a larger color palette and higher-quality video than the Sega CD original. Night Trap was a commercial success, with sales totaling 400,000 copies by 1998.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never wanted her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b> She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's {{the kiss of death}} because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E

500|$|Sue Ellen's storylines in {{the first}} season focus on the character's bout with alcohol and her slowly deteriorating {{relationship}} with her husband. The final episode of the season focused on {{the birth of her}} son with J.R., John Ross Ewing III. While her relationship with J.R. is not always harmonious, it's a significant aspect of her overall character. As the series progressed, Sue Ellen came into her own as an individual character. The actress has said of her character's personality: [...] "I never wanted her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b> She was never boring before – she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting." [...] Gray later described Sue Ellen as being, [...] "one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Online Onslaught, {{columnist}} Adam Gutschmidt {{stated that}} {{the first half of}} the event is worth watching. He enjoyed the tag team match and the bout between Jannetty and Michaels. He also found the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match surprisingly good. He did not, however, feel that the match between Big Boss Man and Bam Bam Bigelow was interesting. He also disliked the Royal Rumble match because too many tag team wrestlers were included, there were few exciting moments, and Giant González did not help the match. Scott Keith reviewed the event for 411mania. He found the opening match between the Steiners and Beverlys <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b> He enjoyed much of the match between Jannetty and Michaels but found the ending disappointing. He rated the match between Boss Man and Bigelow as a [...] "dud" [...] but enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship bout. He called the Royal Rumble match one of the worst in history, as he found much of the match boring and did not enjoy the debut of González. Overall, he rated the event as [...] "mildly recommended".|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{is deemed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> by the channel's staff, {{though they are}} {{impressed}} by Bart's performance. Bart is then promoted to be the co-anchor, which leads to jealousy from Lisa. After Bart hears Lisa talking behind his back, he seeks advice from Kent Brockman, who teaches him {{about the power of}} human interest stories. Bart becomes successful after creating a segment called [...] "Bart's People", which Lisa disapproves of due to its sappy, emotionally manipulative content. Out of jealousy, Lisa attempts to copy it, but is twice hampered by the Crazy Cat Lady. She eventually sends a letter acting as an immigrant who lives in a landfill who pleads to be on Bart's People, causing Bart to rush to the landfill for a live broadcast. However, he learns that the immigrant is Groundskeeper Willie, wanting revenge on Bart. Feeling guilty after seeing Willie attack Bart on camera, Lisa arrives and saves him by using similar techniques he used in his stories to stir up Willie's emotions. The siblings then decide to make a good educational news program, resulting in Kidz News being cancelled.|$|E

500|$|In March 1940, all {{cultural}} activities {{came under the}} control of the General Government's Department of People's Education and Propaganda (Abteilung für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda), whose name was changed a year later to the [...] "Chief Propaganda Department" [...] (Hauptabteilung Propaganda). Further directives issued in the spring and early summer reflected policies that had been outlined by Frank and Goebbels during the previous autumn. One of the Department's earliest decrees prohibited the organization of all but the most [...] "primitive" [...] of {{cultural activities}} without the Department's prior approval. Spectacles of [...] "low quality", including those of an erotic or pornographic nature, were however an exception—those were to be popularized to appease the population and to show the world the [...] "real" [...] Polish culture as well as to create the impression that Germany was not preventing Poles from expressing themselves. German propaganda specialists invited critics from neutral countries to specially organized [...] "Polish" [...] performances that were specifically designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> or pornographic, and presented them as typical Polish cultural activities. Polish-German cooperation in cultural matters, such as joint public performances, was strictly prohibited. Meanwhile, a compulsory registration scheme for writers and artists was introduced in August 1940. Then, in October, the printing of new Polish-language books was prohibited; existing titles were censored, and often confiscated and withdrawn.|$|E
500|$|... "Lacrymosa" [...] {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews from music critics. Ed Thompson from IGN called [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] the [...] "most memorable track" [...] {{in the whole}} album. Don Kaye of the website Blabbermouth.net {{said that while the}} song was an [...] "interesting experiment" [...] it came [...] "across as more of a stab at artsiness with its strings and choirs than a real song." [...] Danielle Baudhuin from The Oshkosh West Index stated that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] is one of the songs on the album where Lee's [...] "astounding classical vocals are displayed". An editor from The New York Times said that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] is grandiose [...] "even by the album's standards". Sputnikmusic said that the song is the best on the album and gave it a grade of 4.5 along with [...] "Good Enough", adding that on the last two songs the album stops <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> because of the musical variation. On Postmedia News it was stated that Lee [...] "achieves stunning notes on 'Lacrymosa', which employs a haunting choir". Jordan Reimer from The Daily Princetonian praised Lee's melodies and said that [...] "Cloud Nine" [...] and [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] were her best two arrangements. John Hood from the Miami New Times made a story, [...] "'Call Me When You're Sober' sent a man away, 'Lacrymosa' kept him there, and 'Cloud Nine' told the clueless dolt why he would no longer ever be welcomed back. Joost Melis from the Dutch website FOK! compared [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] to the music of Within Temptation and Nightwish. A writer of The Independent put the song on his list of [...] "Download This" [...] from The Open Door.|$|E
500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to work on My Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewers {{agreed that}} the main [...] "Laughing Man" [...] storyline was satisfying, characterizing it {{variously}} as [...] "interesting", [...] "complex", and [...] "engaging". Reaction to the series' [...] "Stand Alone" [...] episodes, however, was mixed: some reviewers considered these episodes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> and, in some cases, the worst episodes of the series, while others contended that they allowed further development of the characters and the futuristic setting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Billboards Melinda Newman {{described}} the record as [...] "a fine collection" [...] and [...] "beautifully rendered"; she also found Streisand's heavy amount of detail able to [...] "elevate [...] {{the quality of}} this project far above the usual Christmas fare". Tom Santopietro, author of The Importance of Being Barbra, considered it to be Streisand's [...] "most consistently successful CD" [...] since The Broadway Album (1985). He called her [...] "song choices [...] uniformly excellent" [...] and stated that [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas", [...] "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?", and [...] "One God" [...] were the album's three best tracks. William Ruhlmann, of AllMusic, opined that the album [...] "may come to seem like a remarkably dour holiday collection" [...] due to its release taking place after the September 11 attacks, but overall found that its mood [...] "could hardly be improved upon" [...] given the situation. He felt that this exemplified the ability of [...] "great artists", such as Streisand, to create and release music that [...] "take {{the temperature of the}} times with their work". Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine claimed that Christmas Memories contains [...] "timeless holiday ambience courtesy of a consummate pro"; however, she considered the songs between [...] "Snowbound" [...] and [...] "Grown-Up Christmas List" [...] <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b>|$|E
