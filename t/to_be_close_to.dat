5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to {{come in contact with}} target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980. Part {{of the difficulty}} in estimating the city's population {{is that part of}} it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E
5|$|However, nuclear DNA {{sequence}} comparisons {{reported in}} 2017 suggest that Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 million years ago. Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Bornean orangutans, much later, about 670,000 years ago. Orangutans travelled from Sumatra to Borneo as the islands were connected by land bridges {{as parts of}} Sundaland during recent glacial periods when sea levels were much lower. The present range of Tapanuli orangutans is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the point where ancestral orangutans first entered what is now Indonesia from mainland Asia.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} accounted for about 29% of the jobs in Washington, D.C. This is thought to immunize Washington to national economic downturns because {{the federal government}} continues operations even during recessions. Many organizations such as law firms, independent contractors (both defense and civilian), non-profit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations have their headquarters in or near D.C. <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more can}} be said of Padarn, though he later {{attracted}} the usual hagiography, the Vita Sancti Paternus, which recounts many supposed details of his life. He may have been more closely associated with late Romano-British civilization than some other early British saints, as his dedications are apparently connected by Roman roads. Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn Helen) crosses the river Rheidol. Sarn Helen passes close to Strata Florida and Llanddewi Brefi which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were the three most important ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{returned}} to the United States in 1836 and took up the professorship at Harvard. He was required to live in Cambridge <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the campus and, therefore, rented rooms at the Craigie House {{in the spring of}} 1837. The home was built in 1759 and was the headquarters of George Washington during the Siege of Boston beginning in July 1775. Elizabeth Craigie owned the home, the widow of Andrew Craigie, and she rented rooms on the second floor. Previous boarders included Jared Sparks, Edward Everett, and Joseph Emerson Worcester. It is preserved today as the Longfellow Houseâ€“Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site.|$|E

5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E
5|$|Once food {{leaves the}} crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in {{numbered}} diagram), {{also known as}} the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli, increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be {{near the end of the}} midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.|$|E
5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use. However, assuming a random orientation of the planet's orbit, the true mass is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the measured minimum mass.|$|E

However, several of these were once in equilibrium but are no longer: these include all of the moons listed for Saturn apart from Titan and Rhea. Other moons that were once in equilibrium but are no longer very round, such as Saturn's Phoebe, are not included. Satellites are listed first in order from the Sun, and second in order from their parent body.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of Singaporeans pre-booking niches at private crematoria, even though some people consider talking about death and pre-booking a final resting place inauspicious. Reasons for pre-booking include wanting one's ashes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> those of loved ones, and hedging against higher prices for niches in future. The bodies of foreigners (regardless of where they die) can be cremated in Singapore, but their ashes have to be placed in private columbaria. There are also irregular instances of Singaporeans dying overseas, such as the 2015 accident surrounding Huang Lin Davina, a high-profile demise of a Singaporean abroad.|$|E

5|$|Hammond's {{performances}} {{earned him}} selection for the M.C.C. winter {{tour of the}} West Indies in the 1925â€“26 season. At that time, such tours were popular with amateur cricketers, who were often chosen for social rather than cricketing reasons. The touring party contained only eight professionals, who were expected to {{do most of the}} bowling and provide the cricketing quality. The West Indies team did not have Test status, so no official internationals were scheduled, but a series of representative matches against a West Indian team were played. Rain disrupted much of the cricket, but Hammond enjoyed the experience. In first-class matches, he scored 732 runs at an average of 48.80, with two hundreds and two fifties, and took 20 wickets at an average of 28.65. He scored 238 not out in the first representative game against a West Indies side. Following the tour, he won praise from Warner and the captain of the M.C.C. team, Freddie Calthorpe, and was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the full England side.|$|E
5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 15,000.|$|E
5|$|James MacLachlan {{was born}} on 1 April 1919 at Styal in Cheshire, the second of six {{children}} of Hugh MacLachlan and his wife Helen (nÃ©e Orr-Ewing). The MacLachlans lived in the family home in Styal, where Hugh was employed as an oil and chemical manufacturer until his premature death in 1928 from peritonitis. Following their father's death {{the family moved to}} Southampton <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Helen's parents. Her father Archibald Orr-Ewing was connected with the Plymouth Brethren, China Inland Mission and the missionary field. His influence resulted in James enrolling at King Edward's evangelical school for two years. After completing his preliminary education James boarded at the Anglican Monkton Combe School in September 1931 aged 12. James' brothers, Hugh Jnr, Gordon and Archie would follow him through the institution.|$|E
