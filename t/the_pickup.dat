5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used {{a provision in the}} Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time. Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the unit}} was altered for 750 V DC third rail operation, <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> shoes being {{mounted on the}} former MSO and renumbered 316997. After testing, the unit was stored {{at the back of}} Eastleigh T Scrapping took place at Caerwent in July 2006.|$|E

50|$|The Mustang {{is unusual}} in having neither a pickup {{selector}} nor a circuit selector switch, instead just using <b>the</b> two <b>pickup</b> switches to allow <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> to be used either singly or in parallel. The second on position reverses the phase of <b>the</b> selected <b>pickup,</b> allowing <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> to be either {{in or out of}} phase when in parallel. This phasing option was also unusual for 1964.|$|R
50|$|Another popular {{modification}} is {{to reverse}} the electric polarity of one of <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> (or one coil of a dual-coil pickup). When two pickups are selected, this produces a very thin and weak sound, due to phase cancellation between <b>the</b> <b>pickups.</b> <b>The</b> closer <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> are to each other, the greater the cancellation and thus the weaker and thinner the resulting sound. In case of a humbucker {{this results in a}} sound that is so weak as to be almost unusable, as well as the loss of <b>the</b> <b>pickup's</b> hum-cancelling properties (due to the coils being magnetically out-of-phase, but electrically in-phase with each other).|$|R
25|$|If a pin {{had drifted}} but {{still managed to}} be picked up, older table pinsetters would simply realign the pin into the correct spot when placing it back onto the lane. This results in less than {{accurate}} gameplay since the table is changing the pin positions during <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> process.|$|E
25|$|Many inventors {{had built}} {{electromechanical}} television systems before Farnsworth's seminal contribution, but Farnsworth {{designed and built}} the world's first working all-electronic television system, employing electronic scanning in both <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> and display devices. He first demonstrated his system to the press on September 3, 1928, and {{to the public at}} the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia on August 25, 1934.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, SAS Emily Hobhouse, {{under the}} command of Lt Cdr Lambert Jackson Woodburne, landed Special Forces troops, led by Commandant Jan Breytenbach near Dar es Salaam.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pickups</b> {{used for}} <b>the</b> neck and middle pickups are Tex-Mex overwound vintage types which use Alnico 5 magnets that produce a {{stronger}} output {{than those in}} other pickups. Polysol wire {{is used for the}} windings. <b>The</b> middle <b>pickup</b> is reverse-wound causing hum cancellation when engaged in pickup selector positions 2 and 4. <b>The</b> bridge <b>pickup</b> is a Tex-Mex hot bridge pickup which is a part of <b>the</b> Tex-Mex <b>pickup</b> set. Another unique feature is the lack of a tone control on <b>the</b> middle <b>pickup.</b> Instead, <b>the</b> first tone knob is used for <b>the</b> neck <b>pickup</b> and <b>the</b> second for the bridge. <b>The</b> 5-way <b>pickup</b> selector is wired normally, except for the above-mentioned hum-cancelling effect.|$|R

25|$|In 1972, the SAS Emily Hobhouse landed Special Forces troops led by Commandant Jan Breytenbach near Dar es Salaam {{as part of}} a raid on the Tanzanian port.

While making <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> rendezvous, the submarine snagged a fishing net and sunk the fishing vessel dragging the net. This mission earned Woodburne the Van Riebeeck Decoration.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{measures}} include proper {{storage of}} garbage, removal of water sources, and elimination of environments suitable for nesting. Garbage cans {{need to be}} rat-resistant and made out of metal rather than plastic. Because rats easily chew through plastic, the Health Department recommends placing plastic garbage bags inside rat-resistant metal garbage cans. Garbage should be placed {{out on the street}} close to <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> time, rather than the night before.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of commercially viable {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) technology in the 1980s, first <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> tubes were replaced {{with this kind of}} sensor. Later, higher scale integration electronics was applied (mainly by Sony), simplifying and even removing the intermediate optics, thereby reducing the size of home video cameras and eventually leading to the development of full camcorders. Current webcams and mobile phones with cameras are the most miniaturized commercial forms of such technology.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pickups</b> used in <b>the</b> Contemporary {{models were}} {{manufactured}} by Fujigen.

25|$|CD-4 LPs contain two sub-carriers, one in {{the left}} groove wall and {{one in the}} right groove wall. These sub-carriers use special FM-PM-SSBFM (Frequency Modulation-Phase Modulation-Single Sideband Frequency Modulation) and have signal {{frequencies}} that extend to 45kHz. CD-4 sub-carriers could be played with any type stylus as long as <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> cartridge had CD-4 frequency response. The recommended stylus for CD-4 as well as regular stereo records was a line contact or Shibata type.|$|E
25|$|Since colonial times, much of {{the economy}} of the state has {{traditionally}} been linked to livestock, especially cattle, with vaqueros, or cowboys, being {{an important part of the}} state's identity. Today, most are employed in industry and tourism, but the dress and folklore of the vaquero is still important. Jeans and cowboy hats are still extremely popular, especially with men. The cowboy lifestyle is associated with <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> truck. This influence extends into popular music.|$|E
25|$|While {{attempting}} <b>the</b> <b>pickup,</b> a Chinook {{transport helicopter}} crashed {{in the darkness}} at 10:09 PM when the rear rotor hit a tree, and the helicopter slid down the slope and over a cliff, exploding in flames and killing all the crew and passengers. There was an element of ABLE Troop 3-71 CAV 2nd Platoon still left on the PZ after the crash that worked relentlessly to recover the bodies of their 10 comrades and destroy sensitive equipment left among the wreckage.|$|E
5000|$|Each neck had two single-coil pickups. These {{could be}} blended {{by a small}} wheel {{attached}} to a pot that sat just behind the bridge, introduced in 1954. The bridge pick-up was always on, and <b>the</b> neck <b>pickup</b> could be fed in to taste using the blend pot. Because <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> were wired with reversed polarities, blending in <b>the</b> neck <b>pickup</b> caused <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> to be [...] "hum-bucking". A neck selector switch controlled which neck's pickups were 'live'. On earlier 1950s models, the neck selector was controlled by push-buttons. A single tone and a single volume control served the entire instrument.|$|R

25|$|A laser {{turntable}} is a phonograph {{that plays}} gramophone records using {{a laser beam}} as <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> instead of a conventional diamond-tipped stylus. This playback system has the unique advantage of avoiding physical contact with the record during playback; instead, a focused beam of light traces the signal undulations in the vinyl, with zero friction, mass and record wear. The laser turntable was first conceived by Robert S. Reis, {{while working as a}} consultant of analog signal processing for the United States Air Force and the United States Department of Defense.|$|E
25|$|Gordimer's award-winning 2002 novel, <b>The</b> <b>Pickup,</b> {{considers}} {{the issues of}} displacement, alienation, and immigration; class and economic power; religious faith; and the ability for people to see, and love, across these divides. It {{tells the story of}} a couple: Julie Summers, a white woman from a financially secure family, and Abdu, an illegal Arab immigrant in South Africa. After Abdu's visa is refused, the couple returns to his homeland, where she is the alien. Her experiences and growth as an alien in another culture form the heart of the work.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{power was}} {{supplied}} through a unique {{system in which}} a pickup shoe rode in a channel above and {{to one side of}} the track. This proved vulnerable to contamination from coal smoke, and after a short time it was replaced by a conventional third rail system. When the Howard Street track was made into a gantlet to allow higher clearances, <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> contacts on one side were mounted on swinging arms to accommodate the varying distance to the third rail. The electrification was finally discontinued in 1952 when dieselization made it unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Mitchell's friend Fred Walecki, {{proprietor}} of Westwood Music in Los Angeles, developed {{a solution to}} alleviate her continuing frustration with using multiple alternative tunings in live settings. Walecki designed a Stratocaster-style guitar to function with the Roland VG-8 virtual guitar, a system capable of configuring her numerous tunings electronically. While the guitar itself remained in standard tuning, the VG-8 encoded <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> signals into digital signals which were then translated into the altered tunings. This allowed Mitchell to use one guitar on stage, while an off-stage tech entered the preprogrammed tuning for each song in her set.|$|E
25|$|Satriani's guitars {{are usually}} {{equipped}} with his signature DiMarzio humbucker pickups, Mo' Joe and PAF Joe, and his 24-fret JS model features a signature single-coil sized humbucker called the Satch Track {{in the neck}} position. Some of his guitars are still equipped with <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> models he favored in the past, the DiMarzio FRED and PAF Pro pickups. Satriani has used {{a wide variety of}} guitar amps, using Marshall for his main amplifier (notably the limited edition blue coloured 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his Peavey signature series amps, the Peavey JSX, up until his time with Chickenfoot.|$|E
5000|$|Thin-bodied semi-acoustic guitars, {{such as the}} Epiphone Casino. These possess both a {{sounding}} board and sound box, but the function of these is purely to modify the sound transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>pickups.</b> Such guitars are still intended purely as electric instruments, and while they do make some sound when <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> are not used, the tone is weak and not normally considered musically useful.|$|R
5000|$|The guitar {{featured}} a hollow body aluminum frame {{encased in a}} mold of urelite, a dense urethane foam. This made the guitar light, and the hollowness gave it a very distinct sound. The neck of the guitar was glued to the body and then bolted to the frame, so that along with the hollow body {{this would allow for}} maximum sustain. <b>The</b> <b>pickups</b> were custom-made by Ovation. Each coil was wound 10,000 times, more than most pickups, resulting in a high amplitude. <b>The</b> <b>pickups</b> also included switches that would switch the wiring in <b>the</b> <b>pickups</b> from in series to parallel, effectively turning the hum bucker into a single coil in sound quality on the fly. The guitar also had a mono and a stereo output, where the stereo separated <b>the</b> two <b>pickups</b> into their own channels.|$|R
