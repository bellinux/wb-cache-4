5|$|The Memorial Grove honors Bronxites {{who served}} in World War II and the Korean War. It is located by the road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Cortlandt House, close to Broadway. Created in 1949, the grove {{contained}} a tree and a bronze plaque {{for each of the}} 39 soldiers who were memorialized. By the time the grove was renovated in 2011, there were only 18 plaques left. Restoration was completed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|During a 1910s {{excavation}} for a sewer pipe, {{stones were}} unearthed that were suspected {{to be from}} the old van der Donck estate. During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers. Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person, and owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year. By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them on a busy day. However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard could use the field.|$|E

5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|The {{precipitate}} {{action of}} the Hospitallers could have caused Richard's whole strategy to unravel. However, he recognised that the counterattack, once started, had to be supported by all his army and ordered the signal for a general charge to be sounded. Unsupported, the Hospitallers and the other rear units involved in the initial breakout would have been overwhelmed by the superior numbers of the enemy. The Frankish infantry opened gaps in their ranks for the knights to pass through and the attack naturally developed in echelon from the rear <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>van.</b> To the soldiers of Saladin's army, as Baha al-Din noted, the sudden change from passivity to ferocious activity {{on the part of}} the Crusaders was disconcerting, and appeared to be the result of a preconceived plan.|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with {{the name and address}} of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> der Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach because she wanted to see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
5|$|Van der Goes's is the {{earliest}} extant autographed version, {{and one of}} the most important. This panel was originally a diptych wing of which the accompanying panel of the Virgin and Child is lost, and was probably made for a guild. Luke is dressed in a heavy red robe, draws a preparatory sketch in silverpoint, and wears a melancholy expression. Building on van der Weyden's theme of the role, practice and craft of an artist, van der Goes places pieces of charcoal, a knife and the feathers of a small bird in front of the saint. The similarities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> der Weyden are many and striking, and include the painting utensils, red robes, physician's cap and blue mantle. The figure has the same middle-aged facial type and his pose, kneeling on a green cushion, although reversed compared to van der Weyden's, is the same. Van der Goes's adaption both increased van der Weyden's standing in the eyes of the later artist's followers, and led to a new group of copies that were modelled on the later painting.|$|E
