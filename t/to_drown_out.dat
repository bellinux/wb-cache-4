5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|With Jivevaneng decided, the Australians turned {{advancing}} west towards Sattelberg. The {{force that}} {{was chosen for}} this was the recently arrived 26th Brigade, which would be supported by nine Matildas of the 1st Tank Battalion. At the same time, the 4th Brigade, a Militia formation detached from the 5th Division, was brought up to relieve the 26th Brigade of garrison duties around Finschhafen. The tanks moved up to Jivevaneng {{under the cover of}} an artillery barrage <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> their noise {{in an effort to keep}} their presence secret until the start of the advance. On 16 November, the 2/48th Infantry Battalion, supported by the artillery of the 2/12th Field Regiment and the machine guns of the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, captured Green Ridge overlooking the track, which was the designated forming-up point for the advance on Sattelberg, which began the following day.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} calm, swift Parliament foundered on {{the rocks}} of {{religious}} conflict. On 27 February James Morice, a Puritan Member of Parliament, proposed two new bills: one against the bishops of the Church of England, and the other against the Court of High Commission. Morice was placed under house arrest, and seven Members of Parliament were later arrested, but the bills remained in Parliament. They were defended by Francis Knollys, {{one of the few}} remaining Puritan Members of Parliament, while other Puritans spat and coughed <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> speeches by opponents. Coke and Cecil, the government's two strongest defenders in Parliament, made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills. Cecil first pointed out that the Queen had forbidden bills on religion; Parliament ignored him, and the bill went ahead. Coke, as Speaker of the House of Commons (whose job was to schedule any bills), conducted a delaying campaign, first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee; both suggestions were voted down by the Commons. Coke continued talking until the end of the Parliamentary day in a filibuster action, granting a day of delay for the government. Immediately afterwards, Coke was summoned by the Queen, who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty. The warning was accepted by the Commons, and no more action was taken on the two Puritan bills.|$|E

25|$|On the day, about 75 protesters {{arrived by}} coach from {{northern}} England. The demonstration began peacefully as police successfully kept {{the two sides}} apart with crowd control barriers. Both groups shouted {{at each other and}} waved banners and placards.

On September 1, 1987, while being brought into court, Vanunu tried {{to take off his}} helmet and started shouting in an apparent attempt to talk to the reporters nearby. His guards stopped him using physical force, and police sirens were turned on <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> his voice.|$|E
25|$|The IWW was {{condemned}} by {{politicians and the}} press, who saw them {{as a threat to}} the market systems as well as an effort to monopolize labor at a time when efforts to monopolize industries were being fought as anti-market. Factory owners would employ means both non-violent (sending in Salvation Army bands <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> speakers) and violent to disrupt their meetings. Members were often arrested and sometimes killed for making public speeches, but this persecution only inspired activism.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization {{warns that}} {{increasing}} use of headphones and earphones puts 1.1billion teenagers and young adults at risk of hearing loss due to unsafe use of personal audio devices. Many smartphones and personal media players are sold with earphones that do {{a poor job of}} blocking ambient noise, leading some users to turn up the volume to the maximum level <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> street noise. People listening to their media players on crowded commutes sometimes play music at high volumes feel a sense of separation, freedom and escape from their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the {{atmosphere}} among {{the community of}} Brussels, Belgium was tense when the city was put under the highest level state of emergency immediately following the Paris attacks, however internet cats were able to cut the tension by taking over the Twitter feed #BrusselsLockdown. The feed was designed to discuss operational details of terrorist raids, but when police asked for a social media blackout the hashtag was overwhelmed by internet users posting pictures of cats <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> serious discussion and prevent terrorists from gaining any useful information. The use of cat images is {{a reference to the}} Level 4 state of emergency: the French word for the number 4, quatre, is pronounced similarly to the word cat in English.|$|E

50|$|In Judaism, the gragger is {{used for}} the holiday of Purim. The gragger is used every time Haman's name is {{mentioned}} during the reading of the Megillah. Because Haman persecuted the Jews, the noise is supposed <b>to</b> symbolically <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> his name (although every word of the Megillah, including Haman's name, must be heard clearly). The gragger was developed to help make noise during the reading.|$|R
25|$|Jet's Nic Cester ran energetically {{around the}} Green Room whilst Sam Endicott of The Bravery also {{launched}} {{himself into the}} Green Room crowd {{at the end of}} the band's set. Enter Shikari singer Rou Reynolds joined fans in the front few rows, throwing himself into the crowd several times during their Green Room set, whilst the band also bounced on a trampoline on stage. On the Pet Sounds Stage, having managed <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> Biffy Clyro who were on the NME Stage at the same time, David Kitt had stewards pull his younger brother out of the crowd and up onto the stage so they could perform a song together. Editors, playing in the Green Room on the Saturday night, and The Blizzards, playing on the Main Stage on the Sunday afternoon, both made their third consecutive appearance at Oxegen.|$|E
500|$|David Fricke of the Rolling Stone in {{a review}} of ¡Uno! {{compared}} the theme of the song with [...] "Stay the Night", another song on the album, stating; [...] "'Stay the Night' and 'Let Yourself Go' are the kind of pop-smart here's-my-fucking-problem miniatures Armstrong was writing like second nature when he, Dirnt and Cool were too young to drink (legally) where they gigged. But Armstrong is 40 now, married and a dad, and a lot of this ruckus sounds designed <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> the time bombs ticking in his head and the maddening static outside".|$|E

500|$|There {{was just}} enough time before nightfall to storm the {{position}} on its north side (mainly up the steepest part of the slope immediately north of Gustavus's fort), but {{not enough time to}} develop simultaneous attacks from other sides. The attack went in around 18:00, led by the advanced guard of the 'forlorn hope'. This force of 80 English grenadiers from the 1st English Foot Guards, led by Viscount Mordaunt and Colonel Richard Munden, was designed to draw the enemy fire and thus enable the Allied commanders to discern the defensive strong points. The main force followed closely behind. [...] "The rapidity of their movements, together with their loud yells, were truly alarming", recalled la Colonie, who, in order <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> the shouts and hurrahs, ordered his drummer to beat charge [...] "so as to drown them with their noise, lest they should have a bad effect upon our people." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, U2 were in Europe for the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg {{of their}} Zoo TV Tour. Before their 3July show in Verona, Italy, the band {{received}} a fax from Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{asking for an}} interview regarding the situation in Bosnia. The band agreed and met with an American aid worker named Bill Carter, who acted as the station's foreign associate, due to Serbian travel restrictions. Carter described his experiences in Sarajevo helping Bosnians while surviving the dangerous living conditions. Lead vocalist Bono was unnerved to hear that those living in makeshift bomb shelters in the city played music, including U2's, at loud volumes <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> the sound of explosions. While in Sarajevo, Carter had seen a television interview on MTV in which Bono mentioned {{the theme of the}} Zooropa tour leg was a unified Europe. Feeling that such an aim was empty if ignoring the Bosnians' plight, Carter sought Bono's help. He requested that U2 go to Sarajevo to bring attention to the war and break the [...] "media fatigue" [...] that had occurred from covering the conflict.|$|E
2500|$|... "La Marseillaise" [...] was famously used in Casablanca at {{the behest}} of Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> a group of German {{soldiers}} singing [...] "Die Wacht am Rhein". It was also played during the closing card of the movie. Earlier, it appeared in Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion in a similar defiant fashion, sung by French and British POWs.|$|E
25|$|One common {{complaint}} about NBA coverage on ABC {{is the use}} of unconventional camera angles, including the Floorcam and Skycam angles, used by the network throughout its coverage. Other complaints are of camera angles that appear too far away, colors that seem faded and dull, and the quieting of crowd noise so that announcers can be heard clearly (by contrast to NBC, which allowed crowd noise <b>to</b> sometimes <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> their announcers).|$|R

2500|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} GAR built an {{enclosed}} water slide, {{not unusual for}} that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a complete vertical loop at the end, {{similar to that of}} a roller coaster. The resulting slide, called the Cannonball Loop, was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered a hundred dollars to test it. Tom Fergus, who described himself as [...] "one of the idiots" [...] who took the offer, said, [...] "$100 did not buy enough booze <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> that memory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Max Steiner weaves {{quotes from}} [...] "La Marseillaise" [...] {{throughout}} his {{score for the}} 1942 film Casablanca. It also forms an important plot element when patrons of Rick's Café Américain, spontaneously led by Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo, sing the actual song <b>to</b> <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> Nazi officers who had started singing [...] "Die Wacht am Rhein", thus causing Rick's to be shut down. The scene is reminiscent of one in Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion, in which French and British prisoners of war performing amateur theatricals to a mixed audience of guards and fellow-prisoners sing the song aggressively at the Germans upon hearing of a minor French victory.|$|E
5000|$|A {{relatively}} controversial fixture on {{the show}} for several decades was Bells daughter, Lauralee. Lauralee debuted in 1983 in a bit part as Christine [...] "Cricket" [...] Blair.

Longtime fan favorite Terry Lester, who played Jack Abbott, left the show in 1989 and blamed her partly, claiming that the excessive airtime given <b>to</b> Cricket <b>drowned</b> <b>out</b> the other performers.|$|R
