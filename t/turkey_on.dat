40|$|An {{experiment}} with male turkeys {{was conducted to}} test the hypothesis that turkey production performance responds positively to extra crystalline amino acid supplementation (lysine, methionine, and threonine) when subjected to a high ambient temperature regimen (HT) in the grower period. Two diets were formulated to provide lysine, methionine, and threonine concentrations that either 1) met the breeder recommendations or 2) contained 10 ␑igher lysine and methionine concentrations from 22 to 134 d of age and 10 ␑igher threonine concentration from 22 to 68 d of age. Both diets were fed at two temperatures (15 or 25 C) from 42 d of age onward. At 134 d of age, <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> the HT had generally lower BW than those on the low temperature regimen (LT). Up to 68 d of age and from 106 to 134 d of age, feed intake of <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> the HT was significantly lower than that of <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> the LT. Up to 42 d of age, feed conversion ratio (FCR) of <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> the HT were significantly lower than those of <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> the LT. Significant treatment interactions were observed from 22 to 41 d of age. Turkeys fed the amino acid-supplemented diets on the LT had significantly reduced FCR, whereas those on the HT did not respond. From 69 to 105 d of age, <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> the HT that were fed the supplemented diets had significantly increased FCR, but there were no dietary effects among <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> the LT.

Together with her sister ship , Kongō sailed from Shinagawa, Tokyo on 13 August 1889 on a training cruise to the Mediterranean with cadets from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, returning on 2 February 1890. On 5 October, the sister ships departed Shinagawa for Kobe to pick up the 69 survivors of the wrecked , transporting them to their homeland at Constantinople, <b>Turkey,</b> <b>on</b> 2 January 1891, after which the ships' officers were received by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The ships also carried a class of naval cadets on this mission. On the return voyage, the two corvettes made port at Piraeus where they were visited by King George I of Greece and his son, Crown Prince Constantine. Making stops at Alexandria, Port Said, Aden, Colombo, Singapore and Hong Kong, the sister ships arrived at Shinagawa on 10 May where Kongō resumed her training duties.|$|E

Pirlo scored his first goal for Italy from a free-kick in a 4–0 away win in a friendly match against Tunisia. His first major tournament with the Italian senior team was UEFA Euro 2004 under Giovanni Trapattoni, where he made two appearances in Italy's last two group matches: the first in a 1–1 draw against Sweden, and the second in a 2–1 win over Bulgaria. The Italian team was eliminated in the first round, on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the differences in susceptibility to foot pad dermatitis (FPD) of two medium-heavy lines of turkeys, and whether FPD is painful, by detailed analysis of behaviour in birds with and without analgesic treatment (betamethasone). <b>Turkeys</b> housed <b>on</b> dry litter in the first experiment generally had more frequent bouts of different behaviours that were of shorter duration than birds on wet litter. T-patterns (behavioural sequences) were more frequent, varied and complex on dry than on wet litter. Betamethasone-injected birds of line B, but not breed A, had shorter resting and longer standing durations on wet litter than saline-injected birds. In the second experiment, <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> wet litter given saline stood less and rested more than all other treatment groups, suggesting that they experienced pain that was alleviated in birds receiving betamethasone. <b>Turkeys</b> <b>on</b> dry litter had more frequent, varied and complex patterns of behaviour than <b>turkeys</b> <b>on</b> wet litter and birds kept on intermediate litter wetness. Betamethasone provision increased pattern variety regardless of litter treatment. Turkeys with low FPD scores transferred to wet litter and given saline injections had a longer total duration of resting and shorter duration of standing compared to betamethasone-treated birds. Low FPD birds transferred to wet litter had a similar number of patterns and total pattern occurrence as high FPD birds transferred to dry litter. Betamethasone increased pattern variety and frequency compared to saline injections whereas overall pattern complexity was similar. It was concluded that wet litter affects the behaviour of turkey poults independently of FPD and that betamethasone may also change the behaviour of turkeys. There was some evidence from analgesic treatment and T-pattern analyses that FPD was painful. However, {{there was no evidence}} of differences in susceptibility to FPD of the two commercial hybrids. </p...|$|R

5|$|When the Kingdom of Montenegro {{declared}} war on <b>Turkey</b> <b>on</b> 8 October 1912, it was joined quickly by Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece in {{what is known as}} the First Balkan War. George was on vacation in Denmark, so he immediately returned to Greece via Vienna, arriving in Athens to be met by a large and enthusiastic crowd on the evening of 9 October. The results of this campaign differed radically from the Greek experience at the hands of the Turks in 1897. The well-trained Greek forces, 200,000 strong, won victory after victory. On 9 November 1912, Greek forces commanded by Crown Prince Constantine rode into Thessaloniki, just a few hours ahead of a Bulgarian division.

5|$|Though ancient {{rules of}} {{hospitality}} had protected the expedition, {{they knew that}} once {{they were out of}} the Emir's lands, the Anglo-Russian forces as well as the marauding tribesmen of Persia would chase them mercilessly. The party split up into several groups, each independently making its way back to Germany. Niedermayer headed west, attempting to run the Anglo-Russian Cordon and escape through Persia, while von Hentig made for the route over the Pamir Mountains towards Chinese Central Asia. Having served in Peking before the war, von Hentig was familiar with the region and planned to make Yarkand a base from which to make a last attempt to create local Muslim unrest against Anglo-Russian interests in the region. He later escaped over the Hindu Kush, avoiding his pursuers for 130 days {{as he made his way}} on foot and horseback through Chinese Turkestan, over the Gobi Desert, and through China and Shanghai. From there, he stowed away on an American vessel to Honolulu. Following the American declaration of war, he was exchanged as a diplomat. Travelling via San Francisco, Halifax, and Bergen, he finally reached Berlin on 9 June 1917. Meanwhile, Niedermayer escaped towards Persia through Russian Turkestan. Robbed and left for dead, a wounded Niedermayer was at times reduced to begging before he finally reached friendly lines, arriving in Tehran on 20 July 1916. Wagner left Herat on 25 October 1917, making his way through northern Persia to reach <b>Turkey</b> <b>on</b> 30 January 1918.
