5|$|Following his 150th appearance, Selwood {{displayed}} {{an improved}} goal kicking ability by kicking 17 {{goals in the}} remaining 7 games of the season. His coach Chris Scott acknowledged that Selwood had identified goal kicking as an area of improvement within his game, and credited Selwood for taking responsibility <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> improve at it. Geelong began their finals series against Fremantle in a Qualifying Final, but were defeated by 15points. The defeat forced the club into a Semi Final against Port Adelaide—the first finals game between both clubs since the 2007 AFL Grand Final. Selwood contributed 27 disposals, 4 marks, and 4 tackles to lead Geelong to a 16point victory—his first finals win as captain. The win ensured Geelong's progression through to the Preliminary Final against Hawthorn, to play-off for {{a position in the}} 2013 AFL Grand Final. Despite Selwood's contribution of 23 disposals, 4 tackles, and 1 goal however, the Cats were defeated by 5points and finished the season in third place.|$|E
5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> participate in sporting events.|$|E

5|$|To {{encourage}} individual workers <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> produce {{as much as}} {{they possibly}} could, most workers in Soviet industry were paid on a piece-rate; their wage payments depended upon how much work they personally completed. Soviet workers were given individual quotas for the amount of work they should personally deliver and would earn a basic wage (stavka) by fulfilling 100 percent of their quota. The wage rate for work would grow as production over this level increased. If a worker produced 120 percent of his own personal quota for the month (for example, if he was supposed to produce 1,000 items, but actually produced 1,200) he would receive his basic wage for the first 100 percent, a higher rate for the first 10 percent of over production and an even higher rate for the next 10 percent. Soviet authorities hoped that this would encourage a Stakhanovite spirit of overfulfillment of quotas among the Soviet workforce. In 1956, approximately 75 percent of Soviet workers were paid under such a piece-rate system, so the majority of Soviet workers could significantly boost their earnings by increasing their output.|$|E

25|$|Newton's Hertford was a {{relatively}} spartan College, having received no real endowment. Meals were simple and cheap, and the principal insisted on eating the same as everyone else. Students were expected <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and,</b> where Newton found the University's education lacking, he supplemented it with disputations within the College. Newton allowed gentlemen-commoners to matriculate at the College, but they paid double fees for the same accommodation and food as the others. They were originally allowed to wear their coloured gowns and tufted caps, but Newton eventually made them wear the ordinary black gown. Thus, many a well-to-do family sent their sons to Hertford College to instil in them some disciplined education, unlike the privileged wining and dining had by gentlemen-commoners in other colleges.|$|E

I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>and</b> has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E

25|$|In December 2013, Ili {{made the}} move down south as {{he signed with}} the Southland Sharks for the 2014 season. The lure of playing {{alongside}} experienced guards Luke Martin and Kevin Braswell at the Sharks was enough for Ili to put pen to paper. It took some time for Ili {{to adjust to the}} quieter lifestyle of Invercargill, and he said his main focus during his time in the south was <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> get better. However, he appeared in just 10 games for the Sharks in 2014 after he was suspended indefinitely by the team in late May following a fight outside a bar in New Plymouth that he and teammates Reuben Te Rangi and Leon Henry were involved in. The trio were stood down by the team for {{the second half of the}} season, and in June, all three pleaded guilty to attacking bar staff. Ili pleaded guilty to two charges: common assault and assault with intent to injure. In August, Henry and Ili agreed to carry out clinics in Taranaki to assist young basketballers, to help make good the damage they caused to the community. Neither wanted a discharge without conviction. Ili received a four-month sentence of community detention and was ordered to pay reparation of $750 to one victim and $500 to the other.|$|E

Most of her daughters became teachers. Gregoria was the first Filipina to graduate from Oxford University. After the graduation of the three elder daughters, they were offered teaching positions. Lorenza was given an appointment to teach in Malate Catholic School. They so immersed themselves in their respective teaching careers that not one of them chose to be married.

500|$|Later in February, Specter accused Sestak of mistreating his {{employees}} and disobeying {{state and federal}} minimum wage laws by severely underpaying his House staff.

He also noted that Sestak's three highest-paid staffers were members of his family, including his brother Richard Sestak, who worked as campaign manager. T.J.

He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes, including a then-rare performance of the Piano Sonata in B minor. Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him to learn some difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play; these pieces included Liszt's transcriptions of Gounod's Faust Waltz and Meyerbeer's [...] "Patineurs" [...] Waltz from his opera Le prophète. These lessons, the kindness that Liszt continually showed, and Bache's exposure to Liszt in general, became a life-defining experience. Liszt expected him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> Bache applied himself with a purpose to his keyboard studies. The same [...] "musician of high standing" [...] that Constance quotes about Bache's years in Leipzig also states that [...] "there {{can be no doubt that}} it was his friendship with Liszt that he owed that enthusiasm and power of sustained hard work which distinguished him during his career in London, and which was often the astonishment of those who had known him in earlier years." ...|$|E

In the first such crossover, originally broadcast in December 2004, Donna works alongside ED staff members when a fuel tanker crashes into the hospital. She reappears in the fourth edition of Casualty@Holby City, originally broadcast in December 2005, when she is involved in a car crash en route to the staff Christmas party. She and paramedic Paul [...] "Woody" [...] Joyner (Will Thorp) then inadvertently cause a tunnel to collapse while trying to rescue a trapped baby.

Casualty series producer Oliver Kent deemed her [...] "hilariously funny" [...] and [...] "one of Holby best characters". During the episode, the ED staff work through the aftermath of a school shooting.

By utilizing the thermal mass of air and products inside a display cabinet, this optimization scheme forces the compressor <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> cool down more prior to the scheduled defrosts, thus guaranteeing the product temperature after defrost cycles still to be within a controlled safe level.
