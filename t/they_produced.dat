5|$|After {{the pilot}} was {{transmitted}} on 12 July 1991, the BBC were interested in a series. However, Moffat had signed on to write {{the third and fourth}} series of Press Gang as one twelve-episode block so it was not until 1992 that <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> the series. After being postponed from the autumn schedules, the first series was transmitted on Thursday evenings on BBC2 from 7 January until 11 February 1993.|$|E
5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was {{originally}} intended to be designed by Mark Cerny, who had designed all the games in the series thus far, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game under Cerny's direction {{was to be a}} free-roaming title with puzzle elements that would see Crash travelling between different planets. In early 2000, when Universal approached Traveller's Tales to be the development team behind the game, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> a 3-D rendered demo of Crash running through a volcanic level. Development of the game's engine began in mid-2000.|$|E

5|$|Edward Epstein {{recognized}} in 1969 that the atmosphere {{could not be}} completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances {{for the state of}} the atmosphere. Although this early example of an ensemble showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith showed that <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin started {{producing}} musicals together. Feuer was {{the former}} head of the music department at low-budget Republic Pictures; Martin was a television executive. Having secured the rights to the farce Charley's Aunt, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> it as the musical comedy Where's Charley?, with a score by Frank Loesser. Among the backers of Where's Charley? were Rodgers and Hammerstein, which helped secure additional investment. The show was a hit and helped establish Feuer and Martin on Broadway—they would go on to produce Guys and Dolls.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Trillium Cable {{started to}} provide cable TV service to Scarborough. It was {{purchased}} by Shaw Cable in 1995.

These shows were satirized by Mike Myers in his comedy film Wayne's World.|$|E
25|$|Leucophores, usually located {{deeper in}} the skin than iridophores, are also {{structural}} reflectors utilizing crystalline purines, often guanine, to reflect light. Unlike iridophores, however, leucophores have more organized crystals that reduce diffraction. Given a source of white light, <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> a white shine, in red <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> red and in blue <b>they</b> <b>produce</b> blue. Leucophores assist in camouflage by providing light areas during background matching (e.g. by resembling light-colored objects in the environment) and disruptive coloration (by making the body appear to be composed of high-contrasting patches).|$|R

See the Localizations, licenses, and spin-offs section below for details on further releases by both companies.|$|E
5|$|MGM {{made two}} more Ziegfeld films – one {{entitled}} Ziegfeld Girl (1941), starring James Stewart, Judy Garland, Hedy Lamarr, and Lana Turner, which recycled some footage from The Great Ziegfeld, and in 1946, Ziegfeld Follies by Vincente Minnelli. In 1951, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> their Technicolor remake of Show Boat, which Ziegfeld had {{presented as a}} stage musical.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium (named for {{the planet}} Neptune, the next planet out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was {{discovered}} by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 in Berkeley, California. <b>They</b> <b>produced</b> the 239Np isotope (half-life = 2.4 days) by bombarding uranium with slow neutrons. It was the first transuranium element produced synthetically.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was recorded}} on Gray-Milne-Ewing seismographs at weather observation stations at Gifu, Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo {{as well as}} a station housed at the Imperial University of Tokyo. Although the units went off scale after 8.5 seconds at Gifu and 13.5 seconds at Nagoya (probably due to an inundation of large S-waves) the seismograms <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> have been beneficial for seismologists to develop an understanding of the fault rupture process. The records from the stations at Gifu and Nagoya were especially useful as they were the closest to the fault zone.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Stalinist period, most Soviet {{workers had}} been paid for their work based on a piece-rate system. Thus their {{individual}} wages were directly tied {{to the amount of}} work <b>they</b> <b>produced.</b> This policy was intended to encourage workers to toil and therefore increase production as much as possible. The piece-rate system led to the growth of bureaucracy and contributed to significant inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently manipulated the personal production quotas given to workers to prevent workers' wages from falling too low.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the NCVP can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 20 million years ago with the {{emplacement}} of alkali basalt in western Yukon. Several types of volcanic eruptions have since created different landforms across the NCVP, including shield volcanoes, lava domes, stratovolcanoes and cinder cones. Other volcanic formations, notably subglacial volcanoes, take their shape from the environment they formed in regardless of what magma type <b>they</b> <b>produced.</b> The NCVP contains over 100 volcanoes and is the most volcanically active area in Canada, with eruptions expected to occur roughly every 100 years.|$|E

5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria and responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E
5|$|While the {{remnants}} of Gloria were moving through Atlantic Canada, <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> rainfall {{to the north of}} the track, reaching as high as 4.53 in (115 mm) in Quebec. The highest winds in the country were 58 mph (93 km/h), peaking in the Bay of Fundy and to the northeast of Newfoundland. The remnants of Gloria caused wind and wave damage in Nova Scotia. Wind gusts of 55 mph (89 km/h) in Fredericton, New Brunswick knocked down power lines, affecting more than 1,800 people.|$|E
5|$|As during Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, when a Commission of Sciences and Arts had {{accompanied}} the military campaign, a Morea scientific expedition (Expédition scientifique de Morée.) accompanied the troops. Seventeen learned men representing different specialties (natural history and antiquities – archaeology, architecture and sculpture) made the voyage. Their work was of major importance in increasing {{knowledge about the}} country. As an example, the topographic maps <b>they</b> <b>produced</b> were excellent. More significantly, the measurements, drawings, profiles, plans and proposals for the theoretical restoration of Peloponnesian monuments, of Attica and of the Cyclades were, following James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's Antiquities of Athens, a new attempt to systematically and exhaustively catalogue ancient Greek ruins. The Morea expedition and its publications offered a near-complete description of the regions visited. They formed a scientific, aesthetic and human inventory that remained {{one of the best}} means, short of visiting them in person, {{to get to know the}} regions.|$|E
