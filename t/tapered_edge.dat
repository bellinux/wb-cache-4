First, we develop a physically self-consistent accretion disk model with an exponentially <b>tapered</b> <b>edge</b> that matches the spectral energy distribution and spatially resolved millimeter dust continuum emission. Then, we refine the vertical structure of the model using wide range of excitation conditions sampled by the CO lines, in particular the rarely observed J= 6 [...] 5 transition. By fitting 13 CO data in this structure, we further constrain the vertical distribution of CO to lie between a lower boundary below which CO freezes out onto dust grains (T ~ 19 K) and an upper boundary above which CO can be photodissociated (the hydrogen column density from the disk surface is ~ 10 ^{ 21 } cm- 2). The freeze-out at 19 K leads to a significant drop in the gas-phase CO column density beyond a radius of ~ 155 AU, a "CO snow line" that we directly resolve. By fitting the abundances of all CO isotopologues, we derive isotopic ratios of 12 C/ 13 C, 16 O/ 18 O and 18 O/ 17 O that are consistent with quiescent interstellar gas-phase values. This detailed model of the HD 163296 disk demonstrates the potential of a staged, parametric technique for constructing unified gas and dust structure models and constraining the distribution of molecular abundances using resolved multi-transition, multi-isotope observations.

Solar Power Satellite (SPS) is one option {{for meeting the}} huge future energy demand. SPS can send enormous amounts of power to the Earth as the form of microwave (MW). A highly efficient microwave power transmission (MPT) system is needed for SPS. A critical goal of SPS is to maintain highest Beam Efficiency (BE) because the microwaves from SPS will be converted to utility power unlike the MW from communication satellites. Another critical goal of SPS is to maintain Side Lobe Levels (SLL) as small as possible to reduce interference to other communication systems. One way to decrease SLL and increase BE is the <b>edge</b> <b>tapering</b> of a phased array antenna. However, tapering the excitation requires a technically complicated system. Another way of achieving minimum SLL is with randomly spaced element position {{but it does not}} guarantee higher BE and the determination of random element position is also a difficult task.

In order to study the dust within the disk we have also obtained continuum images at 850 μm from the line-free channels. We have spatially resolved the outer disk around T Cha.

We also report the detection of the ^ 13 CO(3 - 2) and the CS(7 - 8) molecular emissions, which show smaller radii than the CO(3 - 2) detection. The continuum observations at 850 μm allow the spatial resolution of the dusty disk, which shows two emission bumps separated by ∼ 40 AU, consistent {{with the presence of}} a dust gap in the inner regions of the disk, and an outer radius of ∼ 80 AU.

40|$|The {{so-called}} Neel walls separating antiparallel domains in {{very thin}} ferromagnetic films are found, {{on the basis}} of accurate calculations, to have a shape differing significantly from the linear rotation model suggested by Neel. In this 180 [degree] rotation, three regions can be distinguished: a central one where the magnetization [ [...] . ] rotates rapidly (positive demagnetizing energy) and two adjacent regions extending in the neighboring domains where the rotation is very much slower. In these "tail" portions of the curve, the direction of [ [...] . ] is determined mostly by a balance between the anisotropy torque and the torque due to the internal field. The calculations have been performed for permalloy films with thicknesses ranging from 0 to 200 [angstroms]. The walls extend up to several microns, in each of the adjacent domains (of the order of 15 [microns] at a thickness of 200 [angstroms]. As a continuation of the study of infinite Neel walls, the case of double walls (360 [degree] rotation) and of cross-tie walls is also analysed on a semiquantitative basis. The main characteristics of these two configurations can be explained {{on the basis of}} the new model found for the pure Neel walls. In a second section, the internal demagnetizing field H[subscript i] is calculated as a function of the shape, the thickness and the edge profile of the film. Along the edges perpendicular to the easy direction, the growth of peaks of reverse magnetization is studied when the external field varies. Also the detailed configuration of the internal field at the edge is found to depend strongly on the profile of the latter.

Aims. The aim of this work is to spatially resolve the outer disk around T Cha and to derive its main properties. Methods. We have obtained high-resolution and high-sensitivity ALMA observations in the CO(3 – 2), 13 CO(3 – 2), and CS(7 – 6) emission lines to reveal the spatial distribution of the gaseous disk around the star. In order to study the dust within the disk we have also obtained continuum images at 850 μm from the line-free channels. Results. We have spatially resolved the outer disk around T Cha.

40|$|Rabolt, JohnChase, D. BruceBacterially {{produced}} poly[(R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate-co-(R) - 3 -hydroxyhexanoate] (PHBHx) is a {{new type}} of bioplastic which not only inherits the excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility of its parent homopolymer, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), but also overcomes PHB’s brittleness and stiffness with the incorporation of 3 -hydroxyhexanoate (Hx) comonomer units with medium-chainlength (mcl) side chains. The tough and ductile PHBHx, with a much lower crystallinity and melting temperature, is well-suited for many practical applications. Efforts have been made to broaden the application range of PHBHx by introducing the beta-form crystalline structure, where the molecular chains adopt a planar zig-zag conformation. However, it is extremely difficult to produce this beta-form in PHBHx due to its much lower crystallinity and much more flexible molecular chains. In this study, we report an approach using the technique of electrospinning. ☐ The strain-induced metastable β-form crystalline structure was successfully introduced in PHBHx by collecting the macroscopically aligned electrospun PHBHx nanofibers across the air gap on a piece of aluminum foil and on the <b>tapered</b> <b>edge</b> of a high-speed rotary disk. The presence of the β-form crystal structure in electrospun fiber mats was confirmed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), with molecular orientation of the polymer chains along the fiber axis revealed by polarized FTIR. ☐ Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and AFM-IR were utilized to investigate the morphological and structural details of individual PHBHx nanofibers. The results demonstrated a coexistence of the thermodynamically stable α-form crystalline structure, where molecular chains adopt a left-handed 21 helical conformation, and the β-form in single fibers. The molecular orientation level and the relative amounts of the two crystalline polymorphs were found to be highly dependent on fiber collection methods and fiber diameter. Moreover, the α and β-form were revealed to be spatially distributed as a core-shell structure consisting of an α-formrich core and a β-form-rich shell, with the thickness of the shell remaining constant despite the variation of fiber diameter. According to these observations, a possible mechanism for the generation of the β-form was proposed. ☐ The effects of electrospinning parameters on the formation of the beta-form were systematically investigated. The results indicated that more β-crystals can be produced when 1) a higher fiber take-up is used, so that the polymer chains are further stretched before fiber solidification; 2) an optimal solution concentration is chosen, so that a balance between polymer chain deformation and relaxation is maintained throughout the whole electrospinning process; and 3) a more volatile solvent is used, so that more planar zig-zag chains are kinetically frozen in the fibers without being converted to the helical conformation as the fibers solidify. These experimental results indicate that the β-content in PHBHx nanofibers can be easily regulated by modifying the electrospinning conditions. ☐ Finally, the influence of the presence of the β-form on the piezoelectric response of the electrospun PHBHx nanofibers was studied. It was observed that the fibers containing the β-form exhibited an obvious piezoelectric response to the applied pressure, possibly due to the planar zig-zag conformation of the chains which gives rise to a significant dipole moment change when subjected to mechanical deformation. xvii In addition, the sensitivity of the piezoelectric PHBHx nanofibers to mechanical pressure was measured to be 7. 46 mV/kPa. These preliminary investigations indicate that the piezoelectric performance of PHBHx can be largely improved by increasing the concentration of the piezoelectric-active β-form crystalline structure. The piezoelectric PHBHx distinguishes itself from all the other piezoelectric polymers with its excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility, environmental-friendliness and most importantly, low manufacturing cost. It is a promising piezoelectric polymer which can be applied in advanced areas including portable/foldable electronic devices, artificial electronic skins and implantable sensors.

The Yoga 2 Pro features a 360-Degree Flip-and-Fold design that encompasses four modes—laptop, stand, tablet, and tent mode and has a subtle rubber trim {{around the edge of}} its top half in order to prevent slipping on hard surfaces when in tent mode. It comes with an backlit AccuType keyboard and features stereo speakers with Dolby Home Theater. Unlike earlier Yoga products, the home button is now a touch-key on the bottom center of the display. Lenovo moved the power button away from the front and to the side in order to prevent accidental key presses.|$|R

50|$|A uniform {{aperture}} distribution, as {{provided in}} the two examples above, gives the maximum possible directivity for a given aperture size, but it also produces the maximum side lobe level. Side lobe levels can be reduced by <b>tapering</b> the <b>edges</b> of the aperture distribution (changing from uniformity) {{at the expense of}} reduced directivity.|$|R
5000|$|Long-slit {{spectroscopy}} {{can also}} be used to observe the expansion of optically-thin nebulae. When the spectrographic slit extends over the diameter of a nebula, the lines of the velocity profile meet at the edges. In the middle of the nebula, the line splits in two, since one component is redshifted and one is blueshifted. The blueshifted component will appear brighter as it is on the [...] "near side" [...] of the nebula, and is as such subject to a smaller degree of attenuation as the light coming from the far side of the nebula. The <b>tapered</b> <b>edges</b> of the velocity profile stem from the fact that the material at the edge of the nebula is moving perpendicular to the line of sight and so its line of sight velocity will be zero relative to the rest of the nebula.|$|R
