50|$|Trans-Eurasia Logistics is a {{joint venture}} between German and Russian rail {{companies}} Deutsche Bahn and RZhD, operating container freight trains between Germany and China via Russia. The first such train arrived in Hamburg from Xiangtan on October 6, 2008, taking 17 days to make the trip.

50|$|Genetically {{modified}} plants must be {{safe for}} the environment and suitable for coexistence with conventional and organic crops. Towards such safety, a major hurdle is posed by the potential outcrossing of the transgene via pollen movement. Plastid transformation, which yields transplastomic plants in which the pollen does not contain the transgene, not only increases biosafety, but also facilitates the coexistence of genetically modified, conventional and organic agriculture. Therefore, developing such crops is a major goal of research projects such as Co-Extra and <b>Transcontainer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, No.99 011 St. Germain was {{dismantled}} in India in 1988. No.99 014 <b>Transcontainer</b> I {{was broken}} up early in 2001, also in India, while No.99 004 Cambridge Ferry met its end in Turkey in 2003 after working off Malta as Ita Uno and Sirio. No.99 007 Vortigern moved to Greece for ferry services around the islands, {{for which she}} was renamed Express Milos. She finished her days as the Nisos Limnos; Greek regulations on the age of passenger ferries prompted her to be sold for scrap in India in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|It is Russia's main {{intermodal}} container transport and integrated logistics company; it transports {{over a million}} TEUs per year. The company owns about 60% of the total flatcar fleet in Russia, holds 52% of the rail container transportation market and 32% of the container terminal handling market in Russia. <b>Transcontainer</b> also owns about 60,000 ISO containers, owns a network of rail-side container terminals, which are located at 46 railway stations in Russia, and operates Dobra container terminal {{on the border of}} Slovakia and Ukraine. It also controls 50% of Kedentransservice, which offers terminal handling at 19 railway stations in Kazakhstan.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to agricultural measures, {{there may be}} also biological tools to prevent the genetically modified crop from fertilising conventional fields. Researchers are investigating methods either to prevent GM crops from producing pollen at all (for example male-sterile plants), or to develop GM crops with pollen that nonetheless does not contain the additional, genetically engineered material. In {{an example of the}} latter, transplastomic plants can be generated in which the genetic modification has been integrated in the DNA of chloroplasts - the cell nucleus contains no transgenes and thus the pollen contains no chloroplasts and thus no transgenes. Two important research projects on co-existence are and Co-Extra. With the end of the de facto moratorium on genetically modified plants in Europe, several research programmes (e.g. SIGMEA, Co-Extra, and <b>Transcontainer)</b> have begun investigating biological containment strategies for GMOs.|$|E
50|$|Modernization of the {{logistics}} infrastructure, {{creation of new}} hubs, terminals and reconstruction of motorways are among priority directions for the region’s development. Kaluga Region has several advantages. The first of them is its geographic position - the region borders with Moscow and, possessing an impressive transit potential, has every chance to become a key logistics center for the entire Central Federal District. The second is its reliable partners. The region cooperates with major logistics operators: GEFCO, Green Logistics, Rhenus Logistics, <b>TransContainer,</b> etc. The third is its consistent strategy for further development of the cluster. The region has built multimodal transport and logistics terminals, customs and warehousing complexes, is developing its motorway, railway and airport infrastructure, i.e. forming the infrastructure required to insure process continuity - from receipt of raw materials to delivery of finished products to consumers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coexistence}} {{has raised}} significant concern in many European countries and so EU law also requires that all GM food be traceable to its origin, {{and that all}} food with GM content greater than 0.9% be labelled. [...] Due to high demand from European consumers for freedom of choice between GM and non-GM foods. EU regulations require measures to avoid mixing of foods and feed produced from GM crops and conventional or organic crops, which can be done via isolation distances or biological containment strategies. [...] (Unlike the US, European countries require labeling of GM food.) European research programs such as Co-Extra, <b>Transcontainer,</b> and SIGMEA are investigating appropriate tools and rules for traceability. The OECD has introduced a [...] "unique identifier" [...] which is given to any GMO when it is approved, which must be forwarded at every stage of processing. Such measures are generally not used in North America because they are very costly and the industry admits of no safety-related reasons to employ them. [...] The EC has issued guidelines to allow the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops through buffer zones (where no GM crops are grown). These are regulated by individual countries and vary from 15 meters in Sweden to 800 meters in Luxembourg. All food (including processed food) or feed which contains greater than 0.9% of approved GMOs must be labelled.|$|E

Thirty-seven Bt maize farmers were interviewed, representing 22. 5 % {{of the total number}} of Bt maize notifications in the country and 31. 5 % of the total area planted with Bt maize in 2007. Additionally, 66 non-Bt maize farmers were surveyed in an attempt to investigate their opinion on the Bt technology, its viability, and its future. The most interesting finding is that almost half of all the surveyed maize farmers stated that the ex-ante regulations are rigid and difficult to apply. The first and third author acknowledge financial support for the survey from the <b>TransContainer</b> project funded by the European Union under the 6 th Framework Programme Priority 5 : Food Quality and Safety...|$|E
