5|$|Car/SUV – Used {{either as}} a fly-car for rapid {{response}} or for patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted {{to the requirements of}} the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{equipped}} with six airbags; two for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passengers,</b> two side impact airbags that deployed from {{the outer edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seats and side curtain airbags that dropped in <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and second row side doors.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{restrictions}} on the new driver. For {{the first three months}} after receiving the license, he may drive only if there is an experienced driver sitting in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> seat, — and the law additionally defines the requirements for the driver to be called [...] "experienced". The charges for violating traffic laws are much more heavy on the new driver; there is a list of traffic law violations that immediately cancel the new driver's license. Additional limitations apply on young drivers; i.e., if the new driver is younger than 21 years old, he may not transport more than two passengers without an experienced driver accompanying him in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> seat.|$|R

25|$|On June 26, 2011, Beasley {{was driving}} in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka when he was pulled over by a {{policeman}} for speeding. The policeman noticed that the car smelled of a strong odor of marijuana. The officer allegedly found marijuana {{in a plastic bag}} under <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat. However, Beasley said the marijuana was not his, but belonged to a friend whom he had just dropped off. Beasley was consequently fined and ticketed.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, {{a mother}} and her {{daughter}} were found deceased in their still-running Porsche Cayenne SUV against a guardrail on Florida's Turnpike, initially thought to be victims of Carbon monoxide poisoning. Their deaths remained unexplained as the medical examiner waited for results of toxicology tests on the victims, until urine tests revealed that hydrogen sulfide was the cause of death. A report from the Orange-Osceola Medical Examiner’s Office indicated that toxic fumes came from the Porsche’s battery, located under <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat.|$|E
50|$|The HiAce rebadged with {{a luxury}} orientation, the Toyota RegiusAce, was {{introduced}} August 1999 with different versions called the Regius HiAce and Regius Touring HiAce sold at Toyopet and Vista dealerships. The RegiusAce uses a cab over setup, meaning that <b>front</b> seat <b>passengers</b> sit {{on top of}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> axle and <b>the</b> 1TR-FE engine is located underneath the floor and between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The four-speed gearbox was not {{bolted to}} the engine, but was a {{separate}} shaft-driven unit mounted between {{the second and third}} crossmembers. While the remote gearbox placement led to a complicated linkage to the column-mounted shifter, resulting in vague shifter action, it also improved legroom for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The seventh {{generation}} Sambar van {{and truck}} {{were introduced to}} Japan April 2, 2012 {{and based on the}} Toyota Pixis Van/Truck.

25|$|Taxicab {{services}} in Honolulu, Hawaii are {{regulated by the}} City and County of Honolulu. In order to be licensed, drivers must have a valid license, pass written and location tests, a background check from the Honolulu Police Department, a physical exam and a clean driving record. A white placard is then placed on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> side with a photo and information, while a sticker identifying the number is placed at the rear bumper sticker. In 2012, more than 1,632 vehicles in Honolulu were registered to operate as taxicab providers.|$|E
25|$|A {{passenger}} airbag was offered {{as an option}} in the Series II facelift of October 1995. The unique design allowed it to protect the not only <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger,</b> but the centre passenger as well (only the entry-level GLi was offered with the optional bench seat). The Fairmont Ghia was the only trim level to receive dual airbags as standard, which also benefited from the XR6 engine, leather upholstery, extensive use of chrome and lowered suspension. With the use of neoprene rubber insulation, road and wind noise was cut off from within the cabin, contributing to vehicle refinement. Ford also dropped the XR6 station wagon from the lineup in the Series II.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{features}} on the ES 350 included dual front airbags, knee airbags, side-torso and curtain airbags, along with traction control, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and electronic brake-force distribution (EBD). A pre-collision system (PCS), which incorporates a grille-mounted sensor and retracts seatbelts and triggers full braking power, was optional, and came with the distance-aware Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> airbag used a twin-chamber design for reduced occupant discomfort upon deployment. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2007 rated the ES 350 the maximum five stars in the Frontal Driver, Frontal Passenger, and Side Driver categories, and four stars in the Side Rear Passenger and Rollover categories.|$|E
5000|$|The Active, {{introduced}} in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, radio/cassette player, driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> airbag {{have been made}} standard. This model has the 1100 cc [...] "FIRE" [...] engine and a five-speed gearbox.|$|R
25|$|Other notable changes {{include the}} {{addition}} of side impact airbags for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passengers</b> and a change of format for the navigation system. The 2000 TL switched from a CD database to a DVD-based navigation system. The entire continental United States became accessible with the navigation system; {{it was possible to}} drive from one coast to the other with the new navigation system.|$|R
30|$|Estimating {{arrival time}} is an {{experiment}} {{promoted by the}} Spanish Traffic Agency to study the speed and time-to-collision perception of young car drivers. The experiment {{was carried out by}} selecting participants from a chosen group of drivers of different gender and age to travel in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger’s</b> seat. <b>The</b> sample was composed by 20 male and 20 female drivers aged between 20 and 30.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Range Rover was given a minor facelift, consisting mainly of redesigned and repositioned switchgear (which saw many of the originally BMW era designed items updated or replaced), along with new options never before available for Range Rover. The 2010 Range Rover also gained new visual display units as also seen in the new for 2010 Jaguar XJ (X351). This change consisted of a 12-inch TFT LCD virtual instrument panel, which replaces the conventional cluster design — instead 'virtual' gauges are displayed where physical analog gauges were previously. This allows various sets of information to be displayed as required — for example navigation and map information can be displayed instead of engine readouts, whilst {{when one of the}} off-road driving modes is selected on the Terrain Response system the 'gauges' are reorganised to provide space to display the schematic of the vehicle's suspension, steering and transmission systems. The other display unit is fitted to the centre console and uses a bi-directional screen to show different images depending on viewing angle (may not be available in the US). This allows navigational information to be displayed to the driver, whilst someone in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat can use the same screen to use the onboard DVD player at the same time, for example. This system also contains a state-of-the-art multi-camera system from Valeo Vision Systems in Ireland, which allows the driver to see around the vehicle during manoeuvres and which contains multiple overlays and views.|$|E

Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station).

However, under the new NHTSA testing methodology introduced in 2010, the 2011 model year XV40 was downgraded to a three-star rating. This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars. A side barrier rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> (female), gave for an overall side-impact protection rating of three-stars. The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars. Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety. This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.|$|E
