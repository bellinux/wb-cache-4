40|$|During {{difficult}} cognitive activity, {{for example}} remembering information, <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> an <b>answer</b> to a question, planning {{what we are}} going to say, and speaking, we often close our eyes, look up at the sky, or look away from the person we are in conversation with. Adults are very good at switching off from environmental stimulation (both live faces and other sorts of visual displays) in order to concentrate better. Until recently we knew very little about whether children use gaze aversion in a similar way. This is a potentially important omission since the efficiency with which children process information influences many aspects of their development, including school progress. In this article I'll describe what our research team at Stirling have been doing to investigate children's gaze aversion, including past and current work. These investigations have been funded through 3 ESRC grants. Children's patterns of gaze promise to yield important cues to their thinking, concentration and mental processing that will be useful to parents, teachers, psychologists and anyone engaged in assessing children's knowledge and development...|$|R

50|$|The {{massacre}} {{has become}} the basic cause leading to {{the foundation of the}} Cultural Association of Kommeno. The association was founded in 1976, the result of collaboration by students and farmers inhabiting the village. One of its main goals is to make the world familiar with the history of the village and to change the habits and ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> its citizens’ mainly the village’s youth. Since 1980, the association has launched a series of activities that aim to trigger the villagers’ interest and to make them more responsive and sensitive when it comes to matters of history and culture. We’ as members of the association, would like the people to understand and feel that they inhabit on a diverse world with different ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and <b>answers</b> on common issues. The young people have to be open minded to new trends according with theories and practices that are becoming the starting points of our era.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we explore}} {{to what extent}} the visual {{presentation}} of open-ended probes, in connection with different prior probing exposure, impacts on response quality. We experiment with two text box sizes for a specific immigrant probe (Which type of immigrants were you <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> when you <b>answered</b> the question?). On the one hand, we use a standard size equal to the other text box sizes in the survey but oversized for the specific response task. On the other hand, we use a smaller text box which fits the response task. The other probes in the survey that use the standard text box are mainly category-selection probes that ask for a reasoning for the chosen answer value. Due to randomized rotation of questions, respondents receive different numbers of category-selection probes prior to the immigrant probe, resulting in different degrees of exposure to category-selection probing prior to the immi-grant probe. For the immigrant probe, we find that respondents who receive the standard text box and who have had a high exposure to category-selection probing are more likely to provide mismatching answers: The mismatch consists <b>of</b> not <b>answering</b> the specific immigrant probe but rather providing a reasoning answer as typically expected for a category-selection probe. Thus, previous experience with probing in the questionnaire can override the actual probe wording. This problem can be minimized by considering possible carryover effects of prior probes and using an appropriate survey design strategy...|$|R

60|$|Morally {{as well as}} physically, {{there were}} moments, at this period of their lives, when even her own father hardly {{recognized}} his daughter of former days. She had lost her childish vivacity--her sweet, equable flow of good humor. Silent and self-absorbed, she went through the daily routine of her duties enduringly. The hope of meeting me again had sunk to a dead hope in her by this time. She made no complaint. The bodily strength that she had gained in these later days had its sympathetic influence in steadying her mind. When her father once or twice ventured to ask if she was still <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> me, she <b>answered</b> quietly that she had brought herself to share his opinions. She could not doubt that I had long since ceased to think of her. Even if I had remained faithful to her, she was old enough now {{to know that the}} difference between us in rank made our union by marriage an impossibility. It would be best (she thought) not to refer any more to the past, best to forget me, as I had forgotten her. So she spoke now. So, tried by the test of appearances, Dame Dermody's confident forecast of our destinies had failed to justify itself, and had taken its place among the predictions that are never fulfilled.|$|R
