5|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> {{returned}} for the 1992 Winter Olympics, however Harris only {{competed in the}} two-man event, with {{his place in the}} four-man team taken by newcomer Ricky McIntosh. Harris and the Stokes brothers would continue to compete at the Winter Games in the bobsleigh events until the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Rix Nicholas, again {{travelling}} with Dorothy Richmond, {{set sail}} for France, intending to exhibit her works in Europe. She voyaged on the Ormonde, {{which was also}} carrying the Australian Olympic team. She befriended several of <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> and painted a portrait of one for an Olympic artists' competition.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the long}} {{extremity}} goes on <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member's</b> shoulder and under his/hers opposite armpit; then this extremity then goes under the armpits of the casualty, {{and again on}} <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member's</b> shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|Once completed, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> had {{to observe}} the dragon dancers {{performance}} and then join in, taking {{the role of the}} Dragons Tail. Once <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> performed <b>the</b> routine correctly, they received their next clue.|$|R
50|$|For {{the second}} Timed Versus, each intersected team {{will have to}} assign one member to {{retrieve}} three keys and jump through a height of 28-metre cliff down to the sea after being geared by the helicopter. Then, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> will have to release from the safety harness and swim across one of three boats and unlock the padlock to free <b>the</b> other <b>team</b> <b>member.</b> <b>The</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> will have to repeat for the two other <b>members.</b> <b>The</b> intersected <b>team</b> who free <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> faster would win.|$|R
5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{the identity of}} the filaments preserved in the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> disagreeing over {{the identity of the}} structures.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Sega, facing {{financial}} {{troubles with}} the underperformance of their Dreamcast console, shifted from first to third-party software publishing, with Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance (GBA) being their primary focuses. A team of developers {{was formed to}} begin development on Sonic the Hedgehog Advance (later renamed Sonic Advance), a Sonic title for the GBA that would commemorate the series' tenth anniversary. Development was led by Dimps—a team formed by several former Neo Geo Pocket Color developers and funded by Sega, Sony, and Bandai—with assistance from Sonic Team. Several of <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> had previously worked on the critically-acclaimed Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure (1999) for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.|$|E
5|$|Rowland {{attended}} RAAF Staff College, Point Cook, in 1956. Promoted to wing commander, he {{took charge}} of ARDU from November 1956 until June 1959. In 1957, he raised concerns that the supersonic Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, touted as a multi-role replacement for the Sabre, was ill-suited for any purpose except interception. The Defence Minister, Sir Philip McBride, had reached a similar conclusion and kept the Sabre in frontline service until a more suitable aircraft could be chosen, namely the Dassault MirageIII delta-wing fighter. From 1961 to 1964 Rowland was based in Paris, as Technical Staff Officer on the RAAF team preparing for the Mirage's acceptance into Australian service. In contrast to most of <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members,</b> he displayed a talent for language and by his second year was chairing meetings in French with Dassault engineers. After returning to Australia, he was posted to the Directorate of Aircraft Engineering at the Department of Air, Canberra, responsible for ongoing technical oversight of the Mirage.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>the</b> Roadblock, one <b>team</b> <b>member</b> rode {{on one of}} Pontcysyllte Aqueduct's canal {{boats and}} worked with a Welsh {{language}} instructor to learn a verse of the Welsh poem [...] "Y Sipsi!". After the 15-minute boat ride {{to the other side}} of the aqueduct was complete, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> disembarked <b>the</b> boat and recited the poem from memory to a waiting linguist. If <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> could recite <b>the</b> poem perfectly, the linguist would award them their next clue.|$|R
50|$|In Round 2, the 2 {{remaining}} couples {{decide which}} {{of them will be}} pushed back. Starting with the couple that brought through the most money (or if there is a tie, the couple who had the least money after 12 questions), Nick asks them a question. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> in front can choose to answer the question themselves for £2,000 or hand it to their team-mate for £4,000 without being able to tell if their team-mate actually knows the answer. This is repeated for the other couple. After both couples have answered a question, their positions are swapped and are asked another question each, worth £4,000 if <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> in front answers or £8,000 if <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> in back answers. Each couple is then asked if they wish to stay as they are or swap positions one more time, with the questions worth £6,000 if <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> in front answers or £12,000 if <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> in back answers. The couple with the least money is eliminated and the winning couple's accumulated money is added to the safe. After this round, the Thunderball draw is shown.|$|R
5|$|The Australian {{team for}} the event was a young and inexperienced foursome. Mark Tonelli was the oldest {{at the age of}} 23, {{followed}} by Mark Kerry, who turned 21 a month after the Olympics. Both were attending their second Olympics, while Peter Evans and Neil Brooks were 18 and 17 respectively and had never represented Australia at the Commonwealth, World Championship or Olympic level. Evans and Brooks were from Western Australia, a state that had never been prominent in Australian swimming. <b>The</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> had some contact prior to their Olympic selection; Brooks' family had billeted Tonelli in 1976 when the Australian Olympic team held a training camp in Perth. Brooks cited his experience with Tonelli as a motivating factor in his career.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. All the players are Caucasian and each one's batting stance is exactly the same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The crowd is represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began work}} on the {{expansion}} in summer 1998, but the task became complicated by Epic's organizational structure. During the development of Unreal, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> at Digital Extremes were working in Ontario, Canada, while the members at Epic were based in North Carolina, United States, requiring regular travel to Ontario. To remedy this, Epic decided to centralize the teams in Raleigh, North Carolina, and by September, work on the expansion could begin. Lead programmer Steve Polge set about laying the foundations for the new game types, such as Capture the Flag and Domination, and level designers created {{the first round of}} maps for testing. The content grew quickly, and soon the team realized that it had underestimated the task. In November, after a meeting with publisher GT Interactive, Mark Rein suggested releasing the work as a standalone game instead of an expansion. The team was reticent at first, but soon accepted the idea, and in December the game became known internally as Unreal: Tournament Edition.|$|E
50|$|At the Wet Market, one <b>team</b> <b>member</b> {{had to use}} a {{three-wheeled}} bicycle {{to transport}} a load of watermelons around a marked course. If any watermelons fell out, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>member</b> would {{have to put it}} back in before continuing. <b>The</b> other <b>team</b> <b>member</b> would be riding along with the watermelons.|$|R

5|$|There is a {{persistent}} misconception {{that the game}} is, or was released in lieu of, a follow-up to Secret of Mana. Other Square titles such as Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger were being localized simultaneously with the production of Secret of Evermore. Fehdrau explained {{in an interview that}} Secret of Evermore was not created in place of Seiken Densetsu 3 and that the team that developed Secret of Evermore was assembled from newly hired staff, and would otherwise never have been assembled. Several of <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> joined Humongous Entertainment, which spawned Cavedog Entertainment, {{while the rest of the}} team spread to other Seattle-area game studios like Electronic Arts, Boss Game Studios, Microsoft Game Studios, and Gas Powered Games, among others.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1900 for the German Far East mail routes, SS Kiautschou {{traveled}} between Hamburg and Far East ports {{for most}} of her Hamburg America Line career. In 1904, she was traded to competitor North German Lloyd for five freighters, and renamed SS Princess Alice. She sailed both transatlantic and Far East mail routes until the outbreak of World War I, when she was interned in the neutral port of Cebu in the Philippines. Seized by the U.S. in 1917, the newly renamed USS Princess Matoika carried over 50,000U.S. troops to and from France in U.S. Navy service from 1918 to 1919. As an Army transport after that, she continued to return troops and repatriated the remains of Americans killed overseas in the war. In July 1920, she was a last-minute substitute to carry {{a large portion of the}} United States team to the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. From the perspective of the Olympic team, the trip was disastrous and a majority of <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members</b> published a list of grievances and demands of the American Olympic Committee in an action known today as the Mutiny of the Matoika.|$|E
5|$|The Chalk River, Ontario, {{site was}} {{established}} to rehouse the Allied effort at the Montreal Laboratory away from an urban area. A new community was built at Deep River, Ontario, to provide residences and facilities for <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>members.</b> The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base, Camp Petawawa. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first {{director of the new}} laboratory was Hans von Halban. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by Bennett Lewis in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as ZEEP (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970. A larger 10MW NRX reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.|$|E
