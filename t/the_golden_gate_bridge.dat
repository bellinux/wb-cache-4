5|$|On 6 October 1984, {{the fourth}} unit, headed by special effects {{supervisor}} John Richardson, began its {{work on the}} climactic fight sequence. At first, only a few plates constructed to resemble <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> were used. Later that night, shooting of the burning San Francisco City Hall commenced. The first actual scenes atop the bridge were filmed on 7 October 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios in London, Iceland, Switzerland, France and the United States. Several French {{landmarks}} such as the Eiffel Tower, its Jules Verne Restaurant and the Château de Chantilly were filmed. The rest of the major filming was done at Fisherman's Wharf, Dunsmuir House, San Francisco City Hall and <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> in San Francisco. The Lefty O'Doul Bridge was featured in the fire engine chase scene. The horse racing scenes were shot at Ascot Racecourse.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of World War II, Colorado {{undertook}} a defensive patrol near <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> in May 1942 to stop a possible Japanese invasion. She then sailed to Fiji to stop any further Japanese advance into the Pacific. Next, she supported the landings on Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, and Tinian. On 24 July 1944, during the shelling of Tinian, Colorado received 22 shell hits from shore batteries, but continued to support the invading troops until 3 August. She later arrived in Leyte Gulf on 20 November 1944 to support American troops fighting ashore. On 27 November, she was hit by two Kamikazes which caused moderate damage.|$|E

5|$|Two bascule bridges—the Paintersville Bridge and Isleton Bridge—replaced {{the free}} ferries in 1923, and {{are of a}} type {{patented}} by Joseph B. Strauss, {{who went on to}} design <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Local businessmen Aven Hanford and Oscar Klatt replaced the toll ferry with the tolled Antioch Bridge in mid-1926, almost a year before they opened the larger Carquinez Bridge to the west. The counties of Contra Costa and Sacramento organized a joint highway district in November 1925 to fund an improvement of the northern approach from Rio Vista; the concrete highway was completed in July 1927, creating a fully paved continuous route between Sacramento and the bay.|$|E
5|$|A popular tourist destination, San Francisco {{is known}} for its cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, and landmarks, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge,</b> cable cars, the former Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, Fisherman's Wharf, and its Chinatown district. San Francisco is also the headquarters of five major banking institutions and various other companies such as Levi Strauss & Co., Gap Inc., Fitbit, Salesforce.com, Dropbox, Reddit, Square, Inc., Dolby, Airbnb, Weebly, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Yelp, Pinterest, Twitter, Uber, Lyft, Mozilla, Wikimedia Foundation, Craigslist and Weather Underground. It is home to number of educational and cultural institutions, such as the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), the De Young Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the California Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|In {{a three-part}} series {{published}} between February and May 1994, Brock attempts to save San Francisco {{as it is}} besieged by an army of goblins. Morbius the Living Vampire and the Demogoblin are magically transported from New York; Morbius joins Brock to defeat the goblins, led by criminal-turned-politician Charles Palentine (who wears a magic necklace which controls the goblins). Palentine uses fear of the goblin attacks to seize control {{of the city and}} convince its citizens to burn it down. Demogoblin takes the necklace, and the liberated goblins attack Palentine. Demogoblin then leads the goblins across <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge,</b> ordering them to leap to their deaths. Demogoblin and Morbius then leave for New York. Of DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1994, Venom: Enemy Within #2 was number 286; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E

5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before the digital age. <b>The</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.|$|E
5|$|The ice-skating {{scenes were}} filmed at Wollman Rink in Central Park, {{requiring}} the rink to {{close to the}} public for three consecutive days. Some scenes with the leads were also shot at Cafe Lalo, the same restaurant where When Harry Met Sally (1989) was shot. The film was also shot at the Rockfeller Center. The producers had earlier scouted for a public bridge in India that they could use for four days, but due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks obtaining permission from a local government was difficult. The search ended in Kuala Lumpur, where a scene of Kiara and Akash attempting suicide was shot. The opening suicide attempt sequence was filmed at <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Several scenes were shot in Nevada, Las Vegas. Additional filming was done in Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault. He mitigates {{the effects of the}} explosion, getting rid of the fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth, but the aftershocks damage <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> and cause the Hollywood Sign and the Hoover Dam to collapse, endangering lives.|$|E

The Brotherhood decides to strike Worthington Labs, and the {{government}} sends multiple teams to attack the Brotherhood's base in the forest, with information gained from Darkhölme, furious over Lehnsherr's betrayal. However, the life forms in the camp are all copies of Multiple Man, and Lehnsherr uses his powers to move <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> so he and his army can get to Alcatraz and facilitate the attack on Worthington Labs. The remaining X-Men confront the Brotherhood, despite being significantly outnumbered, and arrive just as the military troops who thus far have been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission {{received}} a recommendation {{to purchase the}} road {{and was able to}} invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear title deed for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order to convert it into a toll-free highway. He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in distance between the toll road and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938. The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A car ferry service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected {{in one place and}} transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, the length of the ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares would be kept the same and the extra revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. Cost estimates were made based on <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E

5|$|Zorin, who {{had escaped}} in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton, but Bond {{grabs hold of}} the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the {{framework}} of <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Sutton attacks Zorin, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin pursues them with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death {{in the waters of}} San Francisco Bay. An enraged Mortner attacks Bond using sticks of dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship cable free, which causes Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin. The dynamite explodes, killing Mortner and Scarpine and destroying the airship. General Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's strategy. Afterwards, Bond and Sutton make love in the shower of the Sutton home.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area hosts an {{extensive}} freeway and highway {{system that is}} particularly prone to traffic congestion, with one study by Inrix concluding that the Bay Area's traffic was the fourth worst in the world. There are some city streets in San Francisco where gaps occur in the freeway system, partly {{the result of the}} Freeway Revolt, which prevented a freeway-only thoroughfare through San Francisco between the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the western terminus of Interstate 80, and the southern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> (U.S. Route 101). Additional damage that occurred {{in the wake of the}} 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake resulted in freeway segments being removed instead of being reinforced or rebuilt, leading to the revitalization of neighborhoods such as San Francisco's Embarcadero. The greater Bay Area contains the three principal north-south highways in California: Interstate 5, U.S. Route 101, and California State Route 1. U.S. 101 and State Route 1 directly serve the traditional nine-county region, while Interstate 5 bypasses to the east in San Joaquin County to provide a more direct Los Angeles–Sacramento route. Additional local highways connect the various subregions of the Bay Area together.|$|E
5|$|During the 1929 {{stock market}} crash and {{subsequent}} economic depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed, while the region attempted to spur job growth by simultaneously undertaking two large infrastructure projects: construction of <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge,</b> which would connect San Francisco with Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay. After the United States joined World War II in 1941, the Bay Area became a major domestic military and naval hub, with large shipyards constructed in Sausalito and across the East Bay to build ships for the war effort, and Fort Mason acting the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, the United Nations was chartered in San Francisco to help prevent the kind of devastation that occurred over the past decade, and on September 1951, Japan officially surrendered to the Allied forces in San Francisco, with the Treaty of San Francisco entering into force a year later. In the years immediately following the war, the Bay Area saw a huge wave of immigration as populations increased across the region. Between 1950 and 1960, San Francisco welcomed over 100,000 new residents, inland suburbs in the East Bay saw their populations double, Daly City's population quadrupled, and Santa Clara's population quintupled.|$|E
50|$|The Bridge is a 2006 British-American {{documentary}} film by Eric Steel spanning {{one year of}} filming at <b>the</b> famed <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> which crosses <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> entrance to San Francisco Bay, connecting the city of San Francisco, California to the Marin Headlands of Marin County, in 2004.

5|$|Formal {{planning}} for BART {{began with the}} setting up in 1957 of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based special-purpose district body that governs the BART system. The district initially began with five members, {{all of which were}} projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, Contra Costa County, the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, and Marin County. Though invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART in 1957, preferring instead to concentrate on building expressways. In 1962 San Mateo County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents. The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo's departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART's projected cost. Another important factor in Marin's withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck of <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge,</b> an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and San Mateo resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.|$|E

It garnered Olson the Marlon Riggs Award by the San Francisco Film Critics Circle in 2005. Working on the film led Olson to pen an open letter to the San Francisco Chronicle on the matter of <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge's</b> position as <b>the</b> top suicide landmark in the world. Her former colleague, Mark Finch, had jumped from the bridge on January 14, 1995, and Olson used this event to inform her own film. Her letter was published on the tenth anniversary of Finch's death and supported the Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California's launching of a campaign for a barrier to be installed on the bridge. [...] Olson also distributed her film to the bridge's board of directors, noting [...] "several of the bridge directors told me they appreciated seeing the film and found it illuminating", and in March 2005 the board voted to explore the installation of a barrier to prevent jumping.|$|R
50|$|After it was completed, {{many were}} {{disappointed}} by the aesthetics of the low budget bridge, including Frank Lloyd Wright, who reportedly called for its destruction. <b>The</b> neighboring <b>Golden</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>Bridge</b> and <b>the</b> western span of Bay Bridge were considered engineering and historical marvels, and the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge was {{not considered to be}} in the same class. However, the senior engineers for the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge were the same engineers that worked on the Bay Bridge and the resulting design echoed the lessons learned from the eastern span of the Bay Bridge.|$|R

However, this theory cannot be true because Murrieta was from Mexico, not Chile, and because he did not arrive in California until the Gold Rush around 1849. The Rancho Saucelito had already been granted to William Richardson in 1838.|$|R
