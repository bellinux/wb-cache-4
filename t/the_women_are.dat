5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} the woods of rural England. The vanguard of an {{invasion}} force, his mission is to evaluate the suitability of humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E
5|$|Baseball and Bloomers, {{also known}} as Baseball in Bloomers, is a 1911 American silent short sports film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film stars William Garwood and is the debut of Marguerite Snow. The film focuses on a female seminary which organizes a baseball club and challenges another school to a game. The boys accept to the game with amusement and find that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> not good at baseball. Two Harvard University baseball stars {{join the ranks of}} the girls in disguise and defeat the boys team. The script may have been written by Lloyd Lonergan and the film may have been directed by Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. The film was released on January 6, 1911 and it received positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Nesbitt is {{spying on}} a swingers' party, and follows two women {{as they leave}} to buy more alcohol for the party. He impersonates a police officer and pulls their car over. The next day <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> {{reported}} missing by their husbands, and their bodies are found posed in a park. Nesbitt is next seen working in his pharmacy, when another young couple come in to purchase medication in preparation for an exotic honeymoon. Nesbitt instead surreptitiously gives them an MDMA-like drug, suggesting they take it immediately.|$|E
50|$|All {{the victims}} were {{attacked}} indoors while asleep in their beds. Five of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> dragged, unconscious but still alive, and killed outdoors. Three of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> severely mutilated while outdoors.|$|R
60|$|ANTHONY. Except that he mustn't do it till <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> {{tired of}} him. And <b>the</b> Herriott <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> not that.|$|R
50|$|On February 26, 2010 Providence police charged {{four women}} from two city spas on {{prostitution}} charges. Three of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> charged with prostitution, {{and one of}} <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>was</b> charged with permitting prostitution.|$|R
5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> bystanders {{to the murder}} of Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{approached}} by the Dark Figure, who is {{revealed to be}} a Seraph, an angel who descended from the heavens and fathered four children with a mortal woman. God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they are now in a place where they were meant to be.|$|E
5|$|When Arusi is {{old enough}} to travel, Dabeeb and her band of women decide to take him to Zone Three to see Al•Ith. This {{cross-border}} excursion is not ordered by the Providers, and Ben Ata has grave misgivings about their decision. In Zone Three <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> shocked to find the deposed Al•Ith working in a stable near Zone Two. While Al•Ith is pleased to see her son, she too has misgivings about Dabeeb's action. The bumptious women's travels through Zone Three evoke feelings of xenophobia in the locals.|$|E
50|$|An Indian {{study found}} that couples where <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> {{less than one year}} younger than the man have a total meannumber of {{children}} of 3.1, compared to 3.5 when <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> 7-9 years younger than the man.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> {{asked to}} sit in the clinic's waiting room until they {{themselves}} felt fit to leave. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> had access to a stretcher in a separate room if necessary. At departure from <b>the</b> office, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> encouraged to contact the surgeon on a mobile number on which they could reach him {{at any time during the}} first 24  h after surgery, if so needed. Postoperatively, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> instructed to take naproxen 250  mg (or 1  g of paracetamol) 4 and 8  h after the procedure, respectively. All of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> contacted by phone the following morning by the same nurse assistant who was present during the ablation procedure. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> included in <b>the</b> study were the first to whom the hysteroscopic fundal block was applied in this clinic.|$|R
50|$|In Finland, {{abortion}} was illegal until 1950, when the Parliament of Finland legalized abortions {{to preserve the}} physical or mental health of <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> under 16, if the fetus might <b>be</b> deformed, or <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> had <b>been</b> raped. Under pressure from the women's liberation movement and supportive editorials from most national newspapers, Finnish law was further liberalized in 1970. The 1970 law allowed abortion up to 16 weeks of pregnancy for broad socio-economic reasons, if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> younger than 17, if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> older than 40, if <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> had already had four children, or if {{at least one parent}} would be unable to raise the child owing to disease or mental disturbance.|$|R
5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cú Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the Fomorians. She {{falls in love}} with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him {{in the form of a}} pair of swans. Cú Chulainn, not {{realising}} who she is, shoots her down with his sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his foster-son Lugaid Riab nDerg. Lugaid goes on to become High King of Ireland, but the Lia Fáil (stone of destiny), fails to cry out when he stands on it, so Cú Chulainn splits it in two with his sword. When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual desirability and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> inside, killing 150 of them.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> wonderful. They cry {{very little}} and never complain. The very {{magnitude}} of their sufferings, their indignities, loss and anxiety seems to lift them beyond tears… {{only when it}} cuts afresh at them through their children do their feelings flash out.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Foreign Ministry {{has also}} {{recognized}} {{the power of}} cute merchandise and have sent three 18-year-old women overseas {{in the hopes of}} spreading Japanese culture around the world. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> dressed in uniforms and maid costumes that are commonplace in Japan.|$|E

25|$|The Peranakan or Baba-Nyonya are early Chinese {{immigrants}} from Malacca and Penang who later migrated to Singapore. As {{they are of}} mixed Chinese and Malay ancestry, the Peranakans are classified as a separate ethnic group and have a distinct identity from either separate group. The men are known as Baba while <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> known as Bibiks or Nyonyas.|$|E
25|$|Research done in 2011 {{showed that}} the “weight double standard” may be more complex that what past {{research}} has suggested. This is not only relevant to women, but also to men. The smallest income gap differences occur at thin weights (where men are penalized and women are rewarded) and the opposite happens at heavier weights, where <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> affected more negatively.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accounts}} are given {{on how to}} ward off this demon or prevent her creation. Special measures are taken {{in order to stop}} her from coming after her family to torment them. The family might perform special rites and rituals if any woman in their family who is likely to become a Churel, dies. The corpses of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> also buried in a particular way in order to prevent her from finding her family.|$|E

5000|$|Aside {{from the}} fact that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> {{illegally}} arrested for practicing their constitutional right to protest, their human rights were violated continuously throughout their imprisonments. There was continued mistreatment in the form of harsh living conditions, food infested with worms, being denied visitors, [...] "punishment cells" [...] and denied medical care when many of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> ill and some very old. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> beaten and brutally tortured. Many women went on a hunger strike, sparked by the co-founder of the NWP and initiator of the Silent Sentinels, Alice Paul. These <b>women</b> <b>were</b> placed in solitary confinement and subject to force-feeding.|$|R
50|$|The Una Chula II (“A Chula” II) is an 1885 {{painting}} by Luna portraying another lower class Madrileña. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> sitting squarely with arms {{resting on a}} chair, a pose that “almost mannishly exuding (…) sexual confidence and worldliness”. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> holding a lit cigarette between two fingers in a flirtatious way. The burning tip of the cigarette acts as an enhancement to the female’s “painted lips” that supports a “slight smile”. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> gazing towards <b>the</b> viewer of the painting unembarrassed suggesting a persuasive provocation.|$|R
25|$|Encolpius {{is tempted}} to sever the {{offending}} organ, but prays to Priapus at his temple for healing (133). Proselenos and the priestess Oenothea arrive. Oenothea, {{who is also a}} sorceress, claims she can provide the cure desired by Encolpius and begins cooking (134–135). While <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> temporarily absent, Encolpius is attacked by the temple's sacred geese and kills one of them. Oenothea is horrified, but Encolpius pacifies her with an offer of money (136–137).|$|E
25|$|PlayStation 2 {{video game}} God of War {{features}} {{an event in}} the first part of the game where protagonist Kratos can have sex with two topless prostitutes, who reside in a bedroom on his boat. Although no sexual acts are depicted (they occur off-screen and are indicated by sound effects), <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> shown topless. The player interacts by performing button and joystick commands that appear on screen which results in an experience reward for the player.|$|E
25|$|Holly reveals to Harleen {{that she}} has been asked to take part in Athena's {{self-esteem}} workshop; Harleen is overjoyed at the news. Holly is subjected to a purification ritual in which <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> made to fight one another. Holly and Harley are the only warriors left standing. The two are taken to Themiscyra, and told by Athena that their first test is to out-swim the island's water guardians. The recruits are led through a series of increasingly dangerous obstacles.|$|E

5000|$|Contemporary {{newspaper}} accounts {{indicate the}} [...] "colony" [...] {{was composed of}} actual nudists, but local historian Matthew Alice has stated that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> [...] "wearing flesh-colored bras, G-strings, or body stockings so everything was zipped up tight." [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> indeed topless, as countless un-doctored photographs plainly show.|$|R

25|$|On January 23, 2012, {{a lesbian}} couple {{filed a lawsuit}} in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of {{themselves}} and three children, challenging the state's ban on adoption by same-sex couples so they can jointly adopt their children. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, both nurses. One has an adopted son {{and the other two}} adopted daughters, all with special needs. Michigan law restricts second-parent adoption to married couples and does not license or recognize same-sex marriages.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, Sorolla and {{his family}} visited Biarritz in {{northern}} Spain. In the group portrait Paseo de Faro several women walk along the cliffs above the beach. The painter shows here the beach and washed around by underwater rock formation as a background motive. In front of the frieze-like image <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> loosely arranged side by side. Again, white clothing dominates the scene, and only the young girl in the center stands out in a bright red jacket. Large hats and parasols are important props in this image also.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominating}} {{central figure}} {{is flanked by}} a woman to her left and another to the right, positioned slightly behind. Two of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>are</b> holding drapery that flows rigidly down to their legs {{to the base of}} the sculpture. The figures are constructed with a robust, muscular build, distilled in the form of almost androgynous stature, together forming a tight cohesive mass. The heads and features of the figures, seen in both profile and frontal views, are treated as a series of faceted planar forms that communicated in a strange novel 3-dimensional language; one that at the time broke away from every natural and rational convention.|$|E
