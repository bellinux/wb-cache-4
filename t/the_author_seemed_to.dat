Furthermore, Nabokov's decision to translate and publish Mary in English last out of all his Russian novels perhaps {{is an indication of}} his opinion on its quality (the Russian works which he held in most esteem, such as Invitation to a Beheading and The Defense, were translated and published into English decades earlier).

5000|$|Victor de Jouy noted Le jardin Turc in {{an essay}} of 1811 as so jammed that it was {{insufficient}} to the crowds that besieged it, while nearby the Jardin des Princes offered [...] "all the charms of solitude". He returned to it {{in an essay}} [...] "Le Jardin turc", 16 July 1814, noting that it was fashionable to decry it as bourgeois; unaccompanied young couples strolled in its allées and the ébénistes of the faubourg Saint-Antoine enjoyed beers in its pavilion; parties of too-lively soldiers filled a kiosk lit by stained glass, and everywhere <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> find tête-à-têtes and conversations unsuitable for the children who accompanied him, in a mix of company both good and low that made him reflect that good manners belonged to certain families and not to certain districts. Louis-Léopold Boilly painted the crowd at L'entree du Jardin Turc ("The Entrance to the Turkish Garden Cafe") in 1812, and showed the genre piece at the Paris Salon that year. In Boilly's painting, the café's demure façade offers little in a very recognizable Turkish vein to the boulevard save the device of the crescent moon. Opposite the entrance in boulevard du Temple, General Mortier was killed, 28 July 1835, by the [...] "infernal machine", a bomb intended for Louis-Philippe, with whom he was riding. The proprietor of the Jardin Turc, Bonvallet, was among the Marais citizens who strenuously objected to Louis Napoleon's coup d'état of 2 December 1851, calling themselves [...] "Montagnards" [...] to recall the heady days of the First French Republic. One harangued {{the people in the}} boulevard from a balcony of [...] "citoyen Bonvallet, restaurateur", declaring that president Napoléon had placed himself beyond the law; the police soon appeared, and the radicals beat a hasty retreat.

40|$|John F. Allen on {{the role}} of protein {{phosphorylation}} in the regulation of photosynthesis attracted our attention l. In his article, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> suggest that this role could be explained by the molecular recognition hypothesis. We would like to comment on some aspects of this hypothesis. The author suggests that phosphorylation f Thr 6 in light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) induces helicity in the amino-terminal segment by increasing the net negative charge and consequently screening the repulsion between the positively charged residues in the region. To test this proposal, we replaced Thr 6 with Glu and subjected the first 20 amino acids of the amino-terminal segment of LHCII to secondary structure prediction using Garnier's method. As a consequence, the helical content increased from 35 % to 45 %. This increase may not be significant when the uncertainty in the predicted values is considered. Studies by Padmanabhan etal. 2 suggest that the propensity of a sequence to form a helix depends on the sequence context. Therefore, we feel that the amino-terminal segment could have an inherent ability to adopt a helical conformation and phosphorylation ly imparts additional stability to the helix formed. Allen goes on to suggest that when Thr 6 is in its unphosphorylated form, the positively charged residues located within 10 - 12 A repel each other and introduction of a phosphate group diminishes this repulsion. We would like to mention that repulsion between positive charges ituated 10 - 12. ~ apart in a helix would only be marginal. In fact, we generated an c¢-helix with the first 13 amino-terminal residues of LHCII and calculated the charge-charge interaction energy between side chains of different positively charged amino acids using AMBER force-field parameters. We found that electrostatic repulsion is negligible o when charged groups are more than 10 A apart in the helix, but is very signif!cant when they are situated within 5 - 6 A. Thus, we feel that if phosphory~lation induces helicity, its effects would. be felt more by way of stabilization of the helix through salt bridges between phosphate groups and side chains of positively charged amino acids on both sides, rather than by screening the repulsio...|$|E
40|$|In his {{newspaper}} article of 4 June 2014, Ng Chi Sum, a renowned Hong Kong (“HK”) current affairs commentator expressed his amazement about the binary labeling widely circulated {{then in the}} internet community: those who join the June Fourth Candlelight Vigil in Victoria Park (“VP Vigil”) are “Chinese”, and those who join that in Tsimshatsui’s Cultural Centre Piazza (“TST Vigil”) are “Hong Konger”. According to his understanding, as he wrote, this kind of labeling derived from the popular “domestic discourse” which received rising support in recent years, and which promotes, inter alia: absolute segregation of HK and China (“PRC”); that the democracy of HK cannot be dependent on the democracy of PRC; that matters concerning {{the human rights of}} the PRC people, including those like Liao Xiaobo and Li Wangyang, are matters of the PRC people only and HK people should not get involved in them; that the organizer of the VP Vigil, the HK Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China (“the Alliance”), with one of its goals being “building a democratic China, has failed in promoting the democracy of China despite 25 years of effort, and together with the reasons listed above, the Alliance should not be supported anymore. In fact, numerous articles were published since May 2014 in the official online publication “Passion Times” of the TST Vigil’s organizer “Civic Passion”, explaining why it was time for HK people to “change venue” when doing any June Fourth memorial service. In one written in direct response to Ng’s above article, the author went further to say that for HK people, the June Fourth massacre is not about condolences, but about the brutality of the PRC government in killing its own people. It is no occasion for mourning anymore and HK people should attend the TST Vigil to pledge their determination on “domestic movement”, protecting domestic interest, fighting for HK’s democracy, and overturning the PRC regime. The author also highlighted that since some members of the Alliance made deals with the PRC government during the 2010 political reform of HK and betrayed HK people, they should no longer be trusted. Moreover, in face of the “colonization” of the HK by the PRC government/people since the 1997 handover, “patriotisms” is something HK people cannot afford to embrace anymore. And since the Alliance promotes patriotisms, HK people should entirely break their tie with the Alliance. All in all, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> suggest that those who opt for the TST Vigil are real true HK people subscribing to “radical domestic values”, and those attending the VP Vigil are either confused or “patriotic” like Ng. Personally, I am no fan of the Alliance or Civic Passion. However, I have been attending the VP Vigil for at least 20 times during the last 25 years. The reasons for doing so are complex and personal, including mobilization by some first-hand knowledge and experience of myself in 1989. In the morning of 4 June 2014, I posted a photo of last year’s VP Vigil on my Facebook (“FB”) page. Immediately it attracted comments from a FB friend (John Doe, alias) saying that the moment I attended the VP Vigil, I would be “hijacked” by the Alliance to become a supporter of them. He advised me not to go to the VP Vigil, but to the TST Vigil instead (See Appendix I). When talking about June Fourth, one easily associates with struggles of the people against an autocratic and centralized power (the PRC government). However, the above examples just illustrate that this association is far from complete. By just looking at the arguments over the location of the Candlelight Vigil, one can see that the struggles against subjection, the exercise of power amongst the people (i. e. people vs people), and some knowledge being subjugated consequently all interplay in this “site”. The ultimate question to be asked then is: have we been examining “power” with sufficient depth and width {{when we talk about the}} June Fourth Massacre...|$|E
