25|$|In most lugged steel frames, the lugs have {{a simple}} pointed shape. The lug's curves {{maximize}} {{the strength of the}} joint, while minimizing the possibility of stress risers, which would otherwise make the frame prone to cracking at the end of <b>the</b> <b>lug.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lugged steel {{construction}} uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs, external fittings made {{of pieces of}} steel (sometimes stainless steel) which fit over {{the ends of the}} tubing. Before assembly, the builder cuts the tubes to the desired length and precisely mitres their ends, providing a tight fit. The end of the tubes are inserted into the lugs and subsequently brazed with a silver or brass filler metal. <b>The</b> <b>lug</b> greatly increases the strength of the joint by distributing the molten filler metal over a larger surface area via capillary action. When brazing a bicycle frame, builders may use a small positioning structure called a jig to hold the tubes in place and maintain their precise alignment and frame geometry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Lugs are {{numerous}} in aircraft {{and most of}} them are key structures in aircraft, in which fracture break occurs frequently. It is necessary to improve the fatigue life level of <b>the</b> <b>lugs.</b> In this thesis, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the crack propagation life of <b>the</b> <b>lugs</b> with or without interference bushes. The curves of optimization results with different safety margin are gained, which can guide the damage tolerance design of <b>the</b> <b>lugs</b> in engineering. 1...|$|R

25|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her mother. She was seven months {{pregnant}} and had her 10-month-old daughter beside her. While heading west on Highway 132 near Modesto, a car behind her began honking its horn and flashing its headlights. She pulled {{off the road and}} stopped. The man in the car parked behind her, approached her car, stated that he observed that her right rear wheel was wobbling, and offered to tighten <b>the</b> <b>lug</b> nuts. After finishing his work, the man drove off; yet when Johns pulled forward to re-enter the highway the wheel almost immediately came off the car. The man returned, offering to drive her to the nearest gas station for help. She and her daughter climbed into his car.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering <b>the</b> <b>lug</b> nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of the Twilight Zone episode [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", after having a {{nightmare}} {{in which he is}} killed in a bus crash, Bart rides the bus to school one rainy morning. He panics when he sees a gremlin {{on the side of the}} bus loosening <b>the</b> <b>lug</b> nuts on one of the wheels. Bart unsuccessfully tries to convince the other passengers of the danger. In desperation, Bart climbs halfway out the window to scare off the gremlin with an emergency flare. The gremlin catches fire and falls from the bus, but is found by Ned, who decides to adopt the creature. When the bus finally stops, everyone sees the obvious damage, but Bart is still sent away to an insane asylum for the rest of his life for his disruptive behavior. Bart is relieved as he is finally able to rest, but the gremlin appears in the back window of the ambulance, holding Flanders' decapitated (yet still living) head, which makes Bart scream in terror.|$|E
50|$|When {{tensioning}} a head, the tensioning rod {{closest to}} the tensioner should be tightened first. The {{reason for this is}} to keep an even tension across the drum head, which is impossible to do if <b>the</b> <b>lugs</b> are tightened differently. Next, the tension rod opposite <b>the</b> first <b>lug</b> is tightened by the same number of turns. The process is repeated for <b>the</b> remaining <b>lugs</b> in order, moving {{from one side of the}} head to the other.|$|R
50|$|A bolt having four locking <b>lugs</b> {{derived from}} <b>the</b> Schultz & Larsen Model 54J of 1953 and 62M of 1961. <b>The</b> <b>lugs</b> {{were moved to}} the front of the bolt (as opposed to the Schultz & Larsen design) but were of the same ‘generous’ size. The {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>lugs,</b> at 45 degrees when closed, was suggested to be a compromise between the compensation characteristics of the Mauser and Lee-Enfield types of action with the former locking vertically and the latter horizontally.|$|R
5000|$|In Roman times, lugs were on {{some types}} of column-sections to aid in construction. After [...] by rope into {{position}} with a crane, <b>the</b> <b>lugs</b> were then masoned off.|$|R
2500|$|Lugs {{used today}} on higher {{performance}} bicycles are investment cast (aka lost wax process). [...] Copies of the lugs {{are made in}} wax, and they are attached together into a [...] "tree". [...] The tree is surrounded by ceramic and fired in a kiln, thereby melting the wax and setting the ceramic. [...] Finally, molten steel is poured in to produce <b>the</b> <b>lug.</b> [...] Cast lugs have many advantages over stamped lugs: they allow much finer detail, tighter tolerances (and correspondingly less manipulation and file work), and more accurate angles, {{and they can be}} made from superior materials (chromoly or stainless steel). [...] The disadvantages of cast lugs are few: casting doesn't allow for long points or cutouts (done for aesthetic appeal), it is difficult to bend <b>the</b> <b>lug</b> to change the angle (requiring framebuilders to order lug sets that precisely match the desired frame geometry), and they are more expensive.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional stamped lugs (aka pressed lugs) {{are formed}} by {{pressing}} sheet steel over a mandrel, bending them to shape, and then welding the seams. [...] These lugs are of constant thickness resulting in stress risers, if {{large amounts of}} file work are not done to alter the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>lug.</b> [...] They are easily identified by the visible seam.|$|E
2500|$|The Nambu pistol {{series is}} a recoil operated, locked breech, {{semi-automatic}} pistol. The pistols are slender barreled {{with a single}} piece frame. The barrel is forged integrally with the receiver. The breech-lock was achieved by a propping system similar to the breech lock system used in the Glisenti Model 1910. As the barrel moved forward, the block would be lifted as it rode across the frame forcing <b>the</b> <b>lug</b> upward to lock into the bolt. [...] The Nambu series is well balanced despite the main spring chamber protruding from the left side.|$|E
5000|$|Wear bars (or wear indicators) {{are raised}} {{features}} {{located at the}} bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When <b>the</b> tread <b>lugs</b> are worn to the point that the wear bars connect across <b>the</b> <b>lugs,</b> <b>the</b> tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service. Most wear bars indicate a remaining tread depth of 1.6 mm and are tires are deemed [...] "worn out" [...] when the tread is worn down to that point.|$|R

40|$|Two sets of movable lug {{wheel with}} spring {{mechanism}} for hand tractors {{have been designed}} and tested. The wheels were set on local hand tractors and tested for tilling paddy fields in Cianjur and Subang districts, West Java. A local fixed lug wheel was also tested in each location. <b>The</b> movable <b>lug</b> wheel for Cianjur location was equipped {{with a pair of}} coiled type torsion springs on each <b>lug,</b> while <b>the</b> movable <b>lug</b> wheel for Subang location was equipped with a shaft type torsion spring on each lug. Field performances: theoretical and actual field capacities, wheel slip, and wheel shrinkage, were measured during the test. The test result in Cianjur showed that <b>the</b> movable <b>lug</b> wheel had a better traction performance than <b>the</b> fixed <b>lug</b> wheel. <b>The</b> average wheel slip of <b>the</b> movable <b>lug</b> wheel was 11. 54 %, while the average wheel slip of <b>the</b> fixed <b>lug</b> wheel was 20. 89 %. Field efficiency of <b>the</b> movable <b>lug</b> wheel was 76. 33 %, which was bigger than <b>the</b> fixed <b>lug</b> wheel (68. 45 %). However, the test result using shaft type torsion springs in Subang showed that the spring mechanism did not work well, and the spring mechanism should be modified on its torsion-shaft diameter and welding strength.

The styling of the GT went wilder {{with the addition}} of an offset racing-style bonnet scoop, bonnet locks, and blackouts, as well as 'Super Roo' stripes along the full length of the car (these and the bonnet blackouts were a 'delete option'). GT wheels were now 12-slot steel with flat centre caps over <b>the</b> <b>lug</b> nuts and stainless steel dress rims. The twin 'driving lights' introduced on the XT GT were carried over to the XW GT.|$|E
2500|$|A classic type of {{construction}} for both road bicycles and mountain bicycles uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs. Lugs are fittings made of thicker pieces of steel. [...] The tubes are fitted into the lugs, which encircle {{the end of the}} tube, and are then brazed to <b>the</b> <b>lug.</b> [...] Historically, the lower temperatures associated with brazing (silver brazing in particular) had less of a negative impact on the tubing strength than high temperature welding, allowing relatively light tube to be used without loss of strength. [...] Recent advances in metallurgy ("Air-hardening steel") have created tubing that is not adversely affected, or whose properties are even improved by high temperature welding temperatures, which has allowed both TIG & MIG welding to sideline lugged construction in all but a few high end bicycles. [...] More expensive lugged frame bicycles have lugs which are filed by hand into fancy shapes - both for weight savings and as a sign of craftsmanship. [...] Unlike MIG or TIG welded frames, a lugged frame can be more easily repaired in the field due to its simple construction. Also, since steel tubing can rust (although in practice paint and anti-corrosion sprays can effectively prevent rust), the lugged frame allows a fast tube replacement with virtually no physical damage to the neighbouring tubes.|$|E

5000|$|Behind {{the row of}} six key wheels is a {{cylindrical}} drum consisting of 27 horizontal bars. Each drum bar is affixed with two movable lugs; <b>the</b> <b>lugs</b> can be aligned {{with any of the}} six key wheels, or may be placed in one of two [...] "neutral" [...] positions. An effective pin causes its guide arm to tilt forward, contacting the drum. The positioning of <b>the</b> <b>lugs</b> comprises <b>the</b> second part of the internal keying mechanism. Owing to the complexity of setting the internal keying mechanism, it was altered relatively infrequently; changing internal keys once a day was common in practice.|$|R
