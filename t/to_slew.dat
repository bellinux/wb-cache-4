2500|$|Initial {{flight testing}} [...] {{was made by}} Bert Hinkler, who asked Shorts to enlarge the aircraft's rudder area before he {{attempted}} to fly it. On 4 May Hinkler flew the aircraft for the first time, making a flight during which he achieved an average speed of [...] over a measured mile. [...] On landing Hinkler touched down first with the left- hand float, causing the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>slew</b> round, resulting in severe buckling of the float struts. Hinkler reported that the aircraft suffered from severe hunting at full throttle, admitting {{that he had been}} wrong about the rudder area. The main problem encountered was intake surging, which caused the engine to cut out intermittently.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} extreme {{variants}} of the proa are the ones designed for pure speed. These often completely discard symmetry, and are designed to sail only in one direction relative to the wind; performance {{in the other direction}} is either seriously compromised or impossible. These are [...] "one way" [...] proas, such as world record speed holding Yellow Pages Endeavour, or YPE. While the YPE is often called a trimaran, it would be more correct to call it a Pacific proa, because two of the planing/hydrofoil hulls are in line. This design has been considered by others as well, such as the Monomaran designs by [...] "The 40 knot Sailboat" [...] author Bernard Smith, and these designs been called 3-point proas by some, a reference to the 3 point hulls used in hydroplanes. A previous record holding design, the Crossbow II, owned by Timothy Colman was a proa/catamaran hybrid. Crossbow II was a [...] "slewing" [...] catamaran, able <b>to</b> <b>slew</b> her hulls to allow clear airflow to her leeward bipod sail. Although the hulls appeared identical, the boat had all crew and controls, cockpit etc. in her windward hull; the leeward hull was stripped bare for minimal weight.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{the large}} boat, {{profiting}} {{by the experience}} of the small one, had kept more towards the whale's head, and, before Krake had been rescued, Thorward sent a Skraelinger spear deep into its shoulder. But this only acted as a spur to the huge creature, and made it heave about with such violence that it managed <b>to</b> <b>slew</b> right round with its head offshore.|$|E
50|$|On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of 12 war vessels <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> down the British fleet that was invading New York from Canada.

60|$|It was {{too late}} to put about and avoid being seen, for, before the shot was fired, the {{schooner}} had already almost run into the narrow channel between the island and the shore. A few seconds later, she sailed gracefully into view of the amazed Montague, who at once recognised the pirate vessel from Gascoyne's faithful description of her, and hurriedly gave orders to load with ball and grape, while a boat was lowered in order <b>to</b> <b>slew</b> the ship round more rapidly, so as to bring her broadside to bear on the schooner.|$|E

Here, hold my gun a bit, like a good chap; the saddle, you see, ain't all right, an' if it was <b>to</b> <b>slew</b> round, you know, I'd be {{overboard}} in a jiffy. There, that's all right. Now, we'll up anchor, an' off again. I know now that the right way to git on board is by the port side. When I started from Red River I was goin' to climb up on the starboard side, but Dan Davidson kep' me right--though he had a good laugh at me. All right now. Hand me the gun." ...|$|E
6000|$|Such {{a posture}} {{could not be}} {{preserved}} for any considerable period without shifting side for side. Three or four times during the four hours I would be startled from a wet doze by the hoarse cry of a fellow who did the duty of a corporal at the after-end of my file. [...] "Sleepers ahoy! stand by <b>to</b> <b>slew</b> round!" [...] and, with a double shuffle, we all rolled in concert, and found ourselves facing the taffrail instead of the bowsprit. But, however you turned, your nose was sure to stick to one or other of the steaming backs on your two flanks. There was some little relief in the change of odour consequent upon this.|$|E

The men in the batteries tried <b>to</b> <b>slew</b> their guns round, but we didn't give 'em time. They fought desperately, for they knew what their doom was, and there weren't any prisoners taken there. As soon as the village was taken I went straight with Mr. Escombe to the captain's house. His wife was standing at the door, and she gave a little cry as she saw the British uniforms, and ran a step or two to meet us, then she stopped, and her arms dropped by her side.|$|E

"Do you, Mr. Hartwell," [...] {{the captain}} said, {{addressing}} the first lieutenant, [...] "go below and rouse the boatswain and petty officers, and bid them get {{together all the}} men they can depend upon, arm them quietly, {{and be ready to}} rush on deck the instant a stir is heard forward among the soldiers.

Do you, sir," [...] he said to the second officer, [...] "go to the magazine with four of the midshipmen, open it and bring up charges of grape for the guns on the quarterdeck. Be as quick as you can. Now, gentlemen, the rest of us will make our way up quietly, one by one, to the quarterdeck. Go well aft, so that the men in the waist will not notice you. Directly the cartridges come up we will load the guns, and be in readiness <b>to</b> <b>slew</b> them across the deck; and in the mean time, if they should attack before we are ready, we must hold the ladders to the last." ...|$|E
