5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent,</b> {{in such a}} way that the independent sets satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E
5|$|Announced on 6 May 1997, {{only five}} days after that year's General Election, and officially given {{operational}} responsibility for setting interest rates in the Bank of England Act 1998, the Committee was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> of political interference and thus to add credibility to interest rate decisions. Each member has one vote, {{for which they are}} held to account: full minutes of each meeting are published alongside the Committee's monetary policy decisions, and members are regularly called before the Treasury Select Committee, as well as speaking to wider audiences at events during the year.|$|E
5|$|Quisling {{had earlier}} {{pushed for a}} {{corporate}} alternative to the Parliament of Norway, the Storting, which he called a Riksting. It would comprise two chambers, the Næringsting (Economic Chamber) and Kulturting (Cultural Chamber). Now, in advance of Nasjonal Samling's eighth and last national convention on 25 September and becoming increasingly distrustful of professional bodies, he changed his mind. The Riksting became an advisory body while the Førerting, or Fører Council, and parliamentary chambers were now <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> bodies subordinate to their respective ministries.|$|E

5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that the {{executive}} function had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was beholden to the legislature, {{and by the}} late 1780s this was widely seen as being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.|$|E

It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Isma'il al-Azhari {{began to}} assert his power, both Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al-Rahman became {{concerned}} that they would lose their political influence. From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma'il al-Azhari from power. A key issue was whether a plebiscite should be held to determine if Sudan was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> of Egypt, which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma'il al-Azhari opposed. To strengthen his position in parliament, Isma'il al-Azhari started making overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman to explore {{the idea of an}} NUP-Umma coalition. Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956. On 2 February 1956 Isma'il al-Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions.|$|E
5|$|Backed by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (present-day Argentina), a {{small band}} {{declared}} Brazil's southernmost province of Cisplatina <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> in April 1825. The Brazilian government at first perceived the secession attempt as a minor uprising. It took months before a greater threat posed by {{the involvement of the}} United Provinces, which expected to annex Cisplatina, caused serious concern. In retaliation, the Empire declared war in December, triggering the Cisplatine War. The Emperor traveled to Bahia province (located in northeastern Brazil) in February 1826, taking along his wife and daughter Maria. The Emperor was warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of Bahia. The trip was planned to generate support for the war-effort.|$|E

5|$|In {{a general}} peace conference at Sparta, the Spartans, with their {{authority}} {{enhanced by the}} threat of Persian intervention, secured the acquiescence of all the major states of Greece to these terms. The agreement eventually produced was commonly known as the King's Peace, reflecting the Persian influence the treaty showed. This treaty marked the first attempt at a Common Peace in Greek history; under the treaty, all cities were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent,</b> a clause that would be enforced by the Spartans as guardians of the peace. Under threat of Spartan intervention, Thebes disbanded its league, and Argos and Corinth ended their experiment in shared government; Corinth, deprived of its strong ally, was incorporated back into Sparta's Peloponnesian League. After 8 years of fighting, the Corinthian war was at an end.|$|E
5|$|Relations with {{bishops in}} England {{remained}} good, with little {{activity in the}} long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the primacy of Britain. Theobald obtained a vague confirmation of his see's primacy from Celestine II in 1143–1144, but at the Council of Reims in 1148 Eugene clarified that this primacy {{did not affect the}} claims of York <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> of Canterbury. Because of the unsettled election disputes during the 1140s over the see of York, when it was contested between William of York and Henry Murdac, Theobald faced little challenge from either William or Murdac as to the traditional dispute between Canterbury and York. When William of York died in 1154, Theobald secured York for his protégé, Roger de Pont L'Evêque. Further peace between the two sees was ensured when Theobald consecrated Roger without requiring a profession of obedience, which had previously been a major bone of contention between the two.|$|E

Subramaniam cares for his family a lot and excessively dotes upon his children. Santosh, the younger son, does not like this as he wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> and free from his father’s guidance and control. But Santosh acts normally to avoid hurting his father. Santosh has in mind that both his career and wife should be of his choice only and not of his father. Subramaniam wants Santosh to assist him in managing the company but Santosh dreams of starting a new company on his own and does not prefer to work in his father’s company. Meanwhile, Subramaniam arranges Santosh’s wedding with Rajeshwari, daughter of his friend Ramamoorthy. Santosh is shocked as he has no other option rather than agreeing for this wedding.|$|E

5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the moral high ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|With Jongintaba's backing, in 1939 Mandela {{began work}} on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black {{institution}} in Alice, Eastern Cape, with around 150 students. There he studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration, and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department. Mandela stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. He took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local community {{as part of the}} Student Christian Association. Although he had friends connected to the African National Congress (ANC) who wanted South Africa <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>independent</b> of the British Empire, Mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist movement, and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out. He helped to found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, {{and at the end of}} his first year became involved in a Students' Representative Council (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.|$|E
