5|$|Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich {{framed the}} McKinley Tariff that {{would raise the}} tariff even higher, {{including}} making some rates intentionally prohibitive. At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced <b>their</b> <b>rates</b> on American exports. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to {{the reputation of the}} Billion-Dollar Congress.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), <b>their</b> <b>rates</b> are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and Christie set up {{separate}} departments {{for practical}} sciences, such as mathematics, natural history, agriculture, and medicine; literature, such as poetry, drama, and romance; and finally, politics and religion, which encompassed government, theology, philosophy, morality, law, and trade. For each department, {{there was a}} chief reviewer, although {{he or she might}} engage others. Although the reviewers' names were not known to the public, Johnson and Christie managed to acquire several luminaries: the poet William Cowper; the popular moralist William Enfield; the writer and physician John Aikin; the poet, essayist, and children's author Anna Laetitia Barbauld; the Unitarian minister William Turner; the physician and literary critic James Currie; the artist Henry Fuseli; the writer Mary Hays; the scholar Alexander Geddes; and the theologian Joshua Toulmin. The reviewers were all paid, however scholars have been unable to discover <b>their</b> <b>rates.</b> Christie was often absent after the founding of the Analytical Review, leaving the day-to-day operations of the journal up to Johnson. In 1790 he went to Paris for six months, during which he met with revolutionary leaders and started a business; in 1792 he returned to help the French translate their constitution and to dissolve his business. He left for Surinam in 1796 to collect money owed to him, and died there.|$|E

5|$|These {{outcomes}} of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs {{at or above}} the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting <b>their</b> <b>rates</b> of speciation and extinction.|$|E

25|$|A {{differential}} equation is a mathematical equation that relates some function with its derivatives.

25|$|By 1860, {{when the}} Fraser Canyon Gold Rush was {{starting}} to decline, {{more than a dozen}} sternwheelers were working in the on the Fraser River between New Westminster, Fort Hope and Port Douglas and more were arriving from American waters or were being built locally.

The proposal to cap rates was controversial and many in local government were concerned where it would lead to; in particular the Audit Commission, responsible for overseeing local government spending, was concerned that it might be drawn into a political fight, casting doubt on its independence.|$|E

25|$|Newspapers {{were quick}} to {{publicize}} the issue. The injustice of the South Improvement scheme outraged many independent oil producers and owners of refineries. Rogers led the opposition among the New York refiners. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872 sent a committee of three, with Rogers as head, to Oil City to consult with the Oil Producers' Union. Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and the New York delegation managed to forge {{an agreement with the}} railroads, whose leaders eventually agreed to open <b>their</b> <b>rates</b> to all and promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{equations}} {{arise in}} many areas of science and technology, specifically whenever a deterministic relation involving some continuously varying quantities (modeled by functions) and <b>their</b> <b>rates</b> of change in space or time (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is illustrated in classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow one (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In some cases, this differential equation (called an equation of motion) may be solved explicitly.|$|E
25|$|Though the Cherokee {{were well}} {{established}} {{at the southern end}} of the Great Appalachian Valley by the 1720s, having displaced the Muscogee Creek and other tribes, non-Cherokee villages were not completely exterminated from Eastern Tennessee as late as the Long Hunter expeditions of the 1760s, who encountered Yuchi and Siouan traders and villages only to find them wiped out later and replaced by roving Cherokee hunting parties by the 1780s. The aggressive expansion of the Iroquois Confederacy southward and the simultaneous push of the Cherokee people northward far in excess of <b>their</b> <b>rates</b> of population growth cleared large sections of the central eastern United States of most inhabitants, facilitating the rapid settlement by Europeans.|$|E

25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the universal}} default feature of many North American credit card contracts. When a cardholder is late paying a particular credit card issuer, that card's interest rate can be raised, often considerably. With universal default, a customer's other credit cards, for which the customer may be current on payments, may also have <b>their</b> <b>rates</b> and credit limit changed. The universal default feature allows creditors to periodically check cardholders' credit portfolios to view trade, allowing these other institutions to decrease the credit limit or increase rates on cardholders who may be late with another credit card issuer. Being late on one credit card will potentially affect all the cardholder's credit cards. Citibank voluntarily stopped this practice in March 2007 and Chase stopped the practice in November 2007.|$|E
25|$|Molasses Number is {{a measure}} of the degree of {{decolorization}} of a standard molasses solution that has been diluted and standardized against standardized activated carbon. Due to the size of color bodies, the molasses number represents the potential pore volume available for larger adsorbing species. As all of the pore volume may not be available for adsorption in a particular waste water application, and as some of the adsorbate may enter smaller pores, it is not a good measure of the worth of a particular activated carbon for a specific application. Frequently, this parameter is useful in evaluating a series of active carbons for <b>their</b> <b>rates</b> of adsorption. Given two active carbons with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of adsorbate into the adsorption space.|$|E
25|$|Managed {{care plans}} are widely {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount <b>their</b> <b>rates,</b> and causing {{the health care industry}} to become more efficient and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E
