500|$|In July 1966, {{he began}} a thirty-month stint in France as a Mormon missionary, a {{traditional}} rite of passage in his family. He arrived in Le Havre, where he shared cramped quarters under meager conditions. Rules against drinking, smoking, and dating were strictly enforced. Most individual Mormon missionaries do not gain many converts and Romney was no exception: he later estimated ten to twenty for his entire mission. He initially became demoralized and later recalled it as the only time when [...] "most of what I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> rejected." [...] He soon gained recognition within the mission for the many homes he called on and the repeat visits he was granted. He was promoted to zone leader in Bordeaux in early 1968, and soon thereafter became assistant to the mission president in Paris. Residing at the Mission Home for several months, he enjoyed a mansion far more comfortable than the digs he had had elsewhere in the country. When the French expressed opposition to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, Romney debated them. Those who yelled at him and slammed their doors in his face merely reinforced his resolve.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Snowden {{met with}} Barton Gellman of The Washington Post {{six months after}} the {{disclosure}} for an exclusive interview spanning 14 hours, his first since being granted temporary asylum. Snowden talked about his life in Russia as [...] "an indoor cat," [...] reflected on his time as an NSA contractor, and discussed at length the revelations of global surveillance and their reverberations. Snowden said, [...] "In terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished ... I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> validated." [...] He commented [...] "I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA ... I am still working for the NSA right now. They {{are the only ones who}} don't realize it." [...] On the accusation from former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden that he had defected, Snowden stated, [...] "If I defected at all, I defected from the government to the public." [...] In 2014, Snowden said that he lives [...] "a surprisingly open life" [...] in Russia and that he is recognized when he goes to computer stores.|$|E

I went to Milwaukee first, and they made me think I was somebody. Then I came on to New York, and they made me think I was nobody. I had to go to Europe to find out which I was; but after I had been there long enough I didn't care to know.

It was just faith I had lost. Suddenly I had lost my power of work. My confidence in the rightness of what I was doing evaporated. My will failed me. I don't know if you will understand what that means. It wasn't that my reason didn't assure me just as certainly as ever that what I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> the right thing to try to do.

Quarterback Bert Jones told Sports Illustrated in 1986: [...] "Irsay couldn't have told you how many players there were on the field, never mind what plays we had.

[...] In his 1989 autobiography, Michigan's Bo Schembechler wrote that he believed Hayes, who was diabetic and may have had a high blood sugar level, didn’t believe he struck Bauman.

5000|$|Although [...] "Real Love" [...] {{was more}} {{complete}} than [...] "Free as a Bird", which had required {{the addition of}} some lyrics by McCartney, the song also suffered from problems with Lennon's timing.

[...] Lynne emphasised that the three remaining Beatles were keen to ensure the song sounded very [...] "Beatles-y": [...] "What we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> create a record that was timeless, so we steered away from using state-of the-art gear.

However Bowie played down this interpretation in an interview shortly before the release of Scary Monsters, saying {{that what he was}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> [...] "move on a little from that Ray Davies concept of fashion, to suggest more of a gritted teeth determination and an unsuredness about why one's doing it".

5000|$|In 1976 Macpherson {{was criticized}} from some {{on both the}} left and the right.

[...] His combination of Marx's political economy with T.H. Green's ethical liberalism is best understood as left-leaning neo-Hegelian Canadian idealism.

What Jimmy Harrison was doing and how the incident occurred, what he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> really well worth it.

Despite every kind of problem, the Unit produced numerous publications on language and related subjects, including information retrieval and automatic classification. For over ten years the Unit's presence was strongly felt in the field, always with an emphasis on basic semantic problems of language understanding. Margaret had no time for those who felt that all that needed doing was syntactic parsing, or that complete parsing was necessary before you did anything else. Now that the semantics of language are regarded as a basic part of its understanding by machine, the ideas of C.L.R.U. seem curiously modern.|$|E
