5|$|Written by P.J. Hammond, {{the story}} was {{commissioned}} as End of Term on 10 February 1986 {{as a replacement for}} Pinacotheca for episodes 9 - 12. It involved the Doctor investigating the resort of Paradise Five, while Mel goes undercover as a hostess. When this script too failed, it was replaced in turn by Pip & Jane Baker's <b>Terror</b> <b>of</b> the Vervoids. It was later adapted as Paradise 5 by Andy Lane for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in March 2010.|$|E

5|$|In December, fifty-three peninsulars were banished to Salta, and the {{decision}} {{was sent to the}} Junta for approval. The vocal Domingo Matheu, who had business associations with Tulla and Pedro Salvador Casas, arranged the annulment of the act, arguing that Castelli had been influenced by slander and unfounded accusations. Support for Castelli began to decline, mainly due to the favourable treatment of natives and the determined opposition of the church, which attacked the public atheism of Bernardo Monteagudo, Castelli's secretary. Both royalists in Lima and Saavedra in Buenos Aires compared them with Maximilien Robespierre, leader of the Reign of <b>Terror</b> <b>of</b> the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The <b>Terror</b> <b>of</b> Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many of the horror stories of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various real and imagined Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E
5|$|Some of the tele{{recorded}} Pertwee episodes also {{survive on}} NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early {{form of the}} Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution colour signal from these sources with the high-resolution black-and-white signal from the black-and-white film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, <b>Terror</b> <b>of</b> the Autons, and The Dæmons. Off-air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E

5|$|The {{document}} {{states the}} need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the Reign of <b>Terror</b> <b>of</b> the French Revolution. It rejected the use of political moderation, considering {{that it would be}} dangerous during revolutionary times. It compared the South American revolution, still in its early stages, with the French and North American ones, and even the revolution in Spain itself, pointing out that none of those relied solely in conspiracies or secret meetings. The document proposes to favor patriots, and fill the state offices with them. Peninsulars, on the other hand, should be carefully monitored, and punished at the slightest proof of action against the Junta, and executed if they were rich or influential. For this end, the Junta would need to create an espionage network. This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the Liniers counter-revolution, and similar to the one employed by Simón Bolívar in the North shortly after. Moreno thought that José Gervasio Artigas would be an invaluable ally, and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have him join the fight against absolutism. He noted the internal conflicts in Chile and Paraguay, and urged support of local patriots against local royalists.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} and <b>terror</b> <b>of</b> Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their {{government was not}} doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that {{came to be known as}} the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.|$|E
