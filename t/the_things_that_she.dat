When her husband {{mentions}} the Wheelers, Helen starts to talk about why she did not like them. As she continues talking about all of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not like about them, her husband turns off his hearing aid.|$|E
25|$|Artemis {{believed}} {{that she had been}} chosen by the Fates to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo. All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of Lipara, where Hephaestus and the Cyclops worked.|$|E
500|$|Melody Maker {{columnist}} Sharon O'Connell {{said the}} album was [...] "the very best bit of fucked up rock 'n' roll [...] all year", and it was {{named one of the}} 20 best albums of the year by Spin in December 1991. Deborah Frost of The Village Voice, in her review of the album, called it [...] "genre-defying", taking note of Love's reputation on the album as [...] "the girl who won't shut up... She is all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should not be, and she shoves it, raw, right in your face." [...] The Seattle publication The Stranger took note of the album's production work by Gordon and Fleming, stating that [...] "despite Pretty on the Insides reputation as an unhinged, raw-sounding debut, a great deal of professional calculation went into putting this record together." [...] They also applauded Love's lyrics, and said the album [...] "judiciously toes the line between the evasively obtuse and overtly obscene".|$|E

60|$|Speechless I {{stared at}} her a moment, so taken was I with the immensity of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> suggested. Fear, amazement, and joy jostled one another for the {{possession}} of my mind.|$|R
60|$|In {{the same}} manner Mrs. A., B., and C., and the good matrons through the {{alphabet}} generally, with doleful lamentations, each one consents to <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> allows not, and the affair proceeds swimmingly to the great satisfaction of the juveniles.|$|R
500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought about <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E
500|$|Beholder {{initially}} {{developed a}} reputation as a [...] "temperamental diva." [...] As a young filly, she was prone to rearing when she got upset and later turned to bucking. [...] But the people who worked with her every day viewed her differently; her exercise rider in 2013, David Nuesch, described her as [...] "straightforward", explaining, [...] "she kind of likes it to be her idea and doesn't want to be told too much what to do." [...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the time to figure out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. <b>The</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E

Mendez's Puerto Rico Institute Jr. College and later as the Resident Director of the [...] "Señoritas de la Universidad del Sagrado Corazon" [...] (University of the Sacred Heart). In 1989, she was named consultant to the Director of Veterans Affairs in Puerto Rico. In her position she became an activist and worked {{for the rights of}} the Puerto Rican women veterans. Among <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> sought and her accomplishments, while in her position, were the following: ...|$|E
60|$|La Montespan turned white. The piety {{in which}} she had been reared--the habits of which clung to her despite the {{irregularity}} of her life-made her recoil before <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> desired. Sorcery was of the Devil. She told him so. But Vanens laughed.|$|R

6000|$|On the Friday {{morning there}} was a little {{conversation}} between the two sisters, just before Georgiana's departure to the railway station, which was almost touching. She had endeavoured to hold up her head as usual, but had failed. <b>The</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was going to do cowed her even in the presence of her sister. 'Sophy, I do so envy you staying here.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Following her death, John F. Kennedy Jr. stated to the press, [...] "My {{mother died}} {{surrounded}} by {{her friends and}} her family and her books, and the people and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> loved. She did it in her very own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that." [...] On May 23, 1994, the funeral was held {{a few blocks away}} from her apartment at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, the Catholic parish where she was baptized in 1929 and confirmed as a teenager. She was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, alongside President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella. President Bill Clinton delivered a eulogy at her graveside service.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, that is finished," [...] said Ada sharply, as she {{put away}} <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had used in the {{dressing}} of the wound. [...] "I hope that every foe thou hast {{to deal with in}} future may let thee off as well." ...|$|E
60|$|Gertrude {{was a girl}} {{of great}} natural quickness of apprehension, and she had not pondered over this {{announcement}} {{more than half an}} hour before she was struck with the extraordinary coincidence between the list of items desired and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> herself knew.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he began}} his {{preparation}} for the lottery of death, while Jane Porter sat wide-eyed and horrified at thought of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was about to witness. Monsieur Thuran spread his coat upon {{the bottom of the}} boat, and then from a handful of money he selected six franc pieces. The other two men bent close above him as he inspected them. Finally he handed them all to Clayton.|$|R

40|$|What do {{language}} users {{know about}} particular utterances, {{and how do}} they com- pute this knowledge? Consider the English sentence Kate was seen by Mary. English speakers are able to determine, among other <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> Mary is <b>the</b> underlying sub- ject of the sentence (<b>that</b> is, <b>she</b> is the person who did <b>the</b> seeing); <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> saw was Kate; that the utterance is in the passive voice, and that the "seeing" event referred to by the utterance occurred in the past. In this article, we demon- strate that the process of computing such syntactic knowledge is NP-hard according modern transformational grammars...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't wish to forget,' he answered, {{shaking his}} head. 'It's {{possible}} that you will hear from Margaret. She'll want <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has left here, and I daresay will write to you. I should like you {{to tell her that}} I bear her no ill-will for anything she has done, and I will never venture to reproach her.

60|$|She felt, too, {{for those}} fond, {{faithful}} servants, {{to whom she}} was as daylight and sunshine. Children do not usually generalize; but Eva was an uncommonly mature child, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had witnessed of the evils of the system under which they were living had fallen, one by one, {{into the depths of}} her thoughtful, pondering heart. She had vague longings to do something for them,--to bless and save not only them, but all in their condition,--longings that contrasted sadly with the feebleness of her little frame.|$|E
60|$|The {{interview}} of course immediately bred {{the necessity for}} at least a dozen more; for he had to explain this thing, and qualify that, and, on reflection, would find by the next day that the explanation and qualification required a still further elucidation. Rose also, after the first conversation was over, was troubled at her own boldness, and at <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> in her state of excitement had said; and so was only too glad to accord interviews and explanations as often as sought, and, on the whole, was in the most favorable state towards her penitent.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding Terry's kiss with Stan Larsen, Jamie Anne Allman stated: [...] "I {{think this}} is her feeling guilt about giving Rosie her ID, which she opened a bank account with, and that Rosie found out about Beau Soleil through Terry, being on her {{computer}} in her bedroom, and the guilt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has from <b>that.</b> And the guilt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has from all those <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wants forgiveness for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she’s</b> done, and <b>the</b> secrets <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has...She just needs some kind of comfort. I think that’s where, for both of them, I feel like that’s what was stemming from that. And then it was awkward, because I think they both realize it was wrong, but they needed it, but it was weird." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} what you mean, Basil. It was <b>the</b> only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could do, to invite the young lady {{to go on with}} them. I wonder her husband had the sense to think of it first. Of course she'll have to lend her things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{wants her}} to marry Mr. Tippengray, which she is very willing to do, and then he is quite sure that they will go away and travel, and stay abroad for a long time. He knows {{that this will be}} <b>the</b> very <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would want to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{young lady}} is very good--very good indeed," [...] said Crawley; [...] "but I trust she {{will return to}} her home to-morrow. It is {{impossible}} that she should remain in so poor a house as mine. There will be nothing here of all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will want." [...] The dean thought that Lucy Robarts's wants during her present occupation of nursing {{would not be so}} numerous as to make her continued sojourn in Mrs. Crawley's sick room impossible, and therefore took his leave with a satisfied conviction that the poor lady would not be left wholly to the somewhat unskilful nursing of her husband.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would turn}} people into--king's sons, {{rightful}} princesses, such sort of people--people who after a time, one would think, must have quite forgotten what they started as. To {{let her have}} her way was a lesson to me in natural history both present and pre-historic. The most beautiful damsel that ever lived she would without a moment's hesitation turn into a Glyptodon or a Hippocrepian. Afterwards, when I could guess at the spelling, I would look these creatures up in the illustrated dictionary, and feel that under no circumstances could I have loved the lady ever again. Warriors and kings she would delight in transforming into plaice or prawns, and haughty queens into Brussels sprouts.|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox {{lived with}} Granny Fox. You see, Reddy {{was one of}} a large family, so large that Mother Fox had hard work to feed so many hungry little mouths and so she had let Reddy go to live with old Granny Fox. Granny Fox was the wisest, slyest, smartest fox in all the country round, and now that Reddy had grown so big, she thought it about time that he began to learn the things that every fox should know. So every day she took him hunting with her and taught him all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had learned about hunting: about how to steal Farmer Brown's {{chickens}} without awakening Bowser the Hound, and all about the thousand and one ways of fooling a dog which she had learned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mountjoy's Miss Mountjoy. That, of course, is over. Mountjoy {{has brought}} himself {{to such a}} pass {{that he is not}} {{entitled}} to have a Miss Mountjoy any longer.

25|$|There is also Agnes’s fear {{of going}} insane and {{her fear of}} confrontation; Tobias’s fear of having another child; Julia’s fear of growing up and her fear of being {{displaced}} in her parents’ lives; and Claire’s fear of life and her fear of love, <b>the</b> one <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> desperately wants.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately for Eve, {{trouble is}} also coming {{from within the}} police force. Officer Ellen Bowers is deranged, and obsessed with Eve.
