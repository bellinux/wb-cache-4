25|$|In {{contemporary}} psychiatric practice, ECT is used {{mainly in}} the treatment of depression. It is occasionally used {{in the treatment of}} other disorders such as schizophrenia. When undergoing modern ECT, a patient is given an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant. A brief-pulse electric current of about 800 milliamperes is passed between two electrodes on the head for several seconds, causing a seizure. The resulting convulsion is modified by the muscle relaxant. ECT is usually given on an inpatient basis; about one in five treatments are given on an outpatient basis. Treatment is usually given twice a week (occasionally three <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week)</b> <b>for</b> a total of 6–12 treatments, although courses may be longer or shorter. About 70 per cent of ECT patients are women. About 1,500 ECT patients a year in the UK are treated without their consent under the Mental Health Acts or the provisions of common law.|$|E

On January 17, it was chiropractic's turn." [...] In an article of the magazine Canadian Chiropractor, Steven R. Passmore (D.C., M.S.) and Lorraine Kochanowski-Sutter (D.C.) analyzed the portrayal of chiropractors in the media. They gave [...] "Pokey Mom" [...] {{as an example of how}} [...] "chiropractors on sitcoms pok fun at themselves as they prescribe the duration of a course of care. [...] Dr. Steve on The Simpsons corroborates this stereotype when telling Homer that he will need to see him 'three <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> many years.'" [...] Passmore and Kochanowski-Sutter also noted that in the episode [...] "we see a dreamcatcher on the wall behind Dr. Steve as he treats Homer. This strategically placed decoration could suggest that the chiropractor is in touch with native and/or natural healing, or it could be a jab at the field’s more esoteric practitioners." ...|$|E

In general, if the travel time of respondents’ daily trips is longer, {{they are more likely}} to suffer more congestion and feel worse. The significant variables of trip purposes are commuting, work-related trips, grocery shop, recreation, or social activities, and picking up other people. During trips with these five purposes, respondents will be more likely to meet more congestion or feel worse than those with other trip objectives.|$|R

2500|$|With {{effect of}} 1August 1850, {{the first day}} at school after the summer holidays, four public {{libraries}} opened, numbered I to IV. Each was located in a gymnasium (grammar school) or other highschool {{of the city and}} run by its respective director or another appointed teacher. In the city centre, at [...] ( [...] Grammar School) on Werderscher Markt, Volks⸗Bibliothek No.I was located, while Volks⸗Bibliothek No.IV was situated in the Louisenstädtische höhere Stadtschule (Luisenstadt Higher City School) on Sebastianstraße 49, both libraries were then in what is Mitte since 1920. The first four libraries opened three <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> an hour, all residents of Berlin were entitled to use them free of charge. Library users had to procure a certificate of bailment, by which a city or government official or another known citizen of Berlin committed himself to honour the user's eventual open obligations to the library. The certificates of bailment were to renewed every quarter. The starting stock of books, in all four libraries together, was 7,800 pieces. Many books were donated in kind, popular literature was mostly missing.|$|E

2500|$|It took Eakins {{nearly two}} years to paint The Concert Singer. Cook posed for him {{numerous}} times, three or four <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> the first year. Each time she did, Eakins asked her to sing [...] "O rest in the Lord" [...] from Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah so he could observe her throat movements; the portrait's specificity is such that some scholars have interpreted Cook as being shown {{in the act of}} [...] "forming the e sound in the word rest." [...] The opening bars of the aria are carved in the wooden frame of the painting. Eakins later wrote: [...] "I once painted a concert singer and on the chestnut frame I carved the opening bars of Mendelssohn's 'Rest in the Lord.' It was ornamental unobtrusive and to musicians I think it emphasized the expression of the face and pose of the figure." [...] This was a practice Eakins also implemented in his Portrait of Professor Henry A. Rowland, in which the painting of the physicist was shown in a frame made by the artist, with carvings of symbols and formulas related to Rowland's work.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2004, {{however, the}} D.C. City Council {{proposed}} scrapping the redevelopment deal. [...] Local architect Ted Mariani had proposed building a 1,500-room hotel and convention exhibit halls (linked underground {{to the new}} convention center) {{on the site of}} the old convention center, and convinced several members of the City Council that this would be a better use of the land. The Williams administration strongly opposed this plan. Over the next month, members of the Williams administration and City Council staff began meeting to Mariani's proposal. Joe Sternlieb, head of the Downtown D.C. Business Improvement District; James A. Jemison, mayoral planning aide; and city development consultant Ron Kaplan met three <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> two to three hours each day with council staff to convince them that the Mariani proposal was inappropriate. Mayoral staff said they could agree to a hotel and some meeting space underground, so long as the council approved the development deal by late June. But Council Chair Linda W. Cropp and Council Member Jack Evans (in whose ward the site was located) both favored the Mariani plan. Cropp said she voted to approve construction of the new convention center only because she had been led to believe that the old convention center would continue to exist and provide exhibit space for the city. On July 15, 2004, the two sides reached an agreement to proceed with the existing Williams-backed plan, so long as it included at least 1,200 housing units and a new city main public library—but not convention exhibit halls, a major hotel, or a music museum. The agreement permitted the construction of private offices or a boutique hotel atop the library building. It also allowed the Hines-led development group to lease the site for 99 years in return for a fixed multimillion-dollar annual rent payment as well as 25 percent of the project's profits. However, some City Council members, the Washington Convention and Sports Authority, and the Federal City Council opposed to the agreement. Going a step further, the Washington Convention and Sports Authority (WCSA) commissioned a study of the old convention center site, which it said would be ready in August 2004.|$|E
