5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> {{of people who have}} died in the nursing home and channel them into existence. In this state, <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E

5|$|What then is <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only}} tell you my own faith. <b>The</b> <b>spirit</b> of liberty is <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> which is not too sure that it is right; <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of liberty is <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of liberty is <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of liberty is <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|R

50|$|Many {{years before}} the events in Beyond Oasis, the warrior Ordan gives his young pupil Leon the Golden Armlet, {{so that he can}} become <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> King of Oasis.

5|$|The Octagon is also {{believed}} {{by some to}} be haunted by <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> of African American slaves who once lived there. When the house held bells to summon servants, <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> of the dead slaves would announce their presence by ringing these bells loudly. The ghostly bell ringing first occurred in the 1870s. General George D. Ramsay, Chief of Ordnance for the United States Army and commander of the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C., was attending a dinner at The Octagon when all the bells in the house began ringing. As Marian Gouverneur, wife of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (the first American consul in Foo Chow, China), related the story, General Ramsay seized the bell ropes to stop the bells from sounding, but to everyone's shock they did not stop ringing. Although Gouverneur's report was not made until 1911, the mysterious ringing of the bells had been reported in 1874 and again in 1889, each time attributed to <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> of dead slaves.|$|E

[...] But gradually the undesirable methyl alcohol content reduces and what emerges is <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> that will end up as whisky. The distiller has to judge {{the right moment to}} redirect the flow of product to <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> receiver instead of the low wines receiver. This is when the alcohol content, measured by a hydrometer in <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> safe, falls to 75%, or when <b>the</b> emerging <b>spirit</b> no longer turns water cloudy, another test conducted remotely inside <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> safe.|$|R
5|$|In May, McMahon signed another {{handicap}} match, with <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad facing Michaels. <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad instead attacked Michaels {{before the}} match started, and Triple H {{came out to}} help <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad. Triple H felt disrespected by <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad however, and as a result, helped Michaels instead. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D-Generation X (DX) and they began a feud with <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad. DX played various sophomoric jokes on <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad and <b>the</b> McMahons, as well as defeating <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|R

5|$|Elemental Spirits, {{also called}} Mana Spirits, are beings who govern the magic {{elements}} of the series' world, and are {{at the core of}} the games' magic system as they are used to cast magic spells. Eight types of spirits have appeared in the series since Secret of Mana, and each embodies a different element. Their names are homonyms of mythological beings or phenomena. In Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, usage of their power is enabled upon the main characters' meeting with them. In Legend of Mana, <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> serve as factors in the Land Creation System. In Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana, multiple spirits of the same elemental type appear. In terms of storyline, in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Heroes of Mana, <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> are charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight elemental benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of SD3). In Dawn of Manas North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> {{cannot be}} seen as a place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named pÅ‚anetnik, chmurnik, or obÅ‚ocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> of infants who had died without baptism, or <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, pÅ‚anetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The pÅ‚anetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds.|$|E
2500|$|Paul also {{discusses}} {{the relationship of}} eternal life to <b>the</b> Holy <b>Spirit,</b> stating that to be with <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> and to think with <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> leads to eternal life, e.g. : :"he who sows to <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> shall of <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> reap eternal life." [...] For Paul future eternal life arrives {{as a result of}} the indwelling of <b>the</b> Holy <b>Spirit</b> during <b>the</b> present life, and the inter-related statements about the present life, <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> and future life form a key element of the teachings on the topic in Galatians.|$|R
60|$|If <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> {{of love is}} <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of God, and <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> {{of wisdom}} is <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of God, then they must be <b>the</b> same <b>spirit.</b> For if they be two {{different}} spirits, then there must be two Holy Spirits; for any and every Spirit of God must be holy,--what else can He be?

5|$|Shamanism was the {{dominant}} {{religion of the}} Jurchen people of northeast Asia and of their descendants, the Manchu people.

60|$|Answer.
