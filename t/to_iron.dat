5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent <b>to</b> <b>iron</b> deposits, probably due <b>to</b> <b>iron</b> input.|$|E

5|$|After 1872, steel {{started to}} be {{introduced}} as a material for construction. Compared <b>to</b> <b>iron,</b> steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight.

5|$|From the {{northern}} terminus, a tramway connected the canal <b>to</b> <b>iron</b> works at Aberdare and Hirwaun. This {{was built in}} 1803, and included an incline just north of Glynneath, which was powered by a high-pressure Trevithick steam engine. The Tappenden brothers had bought into the iron industry in 1802, and built the tramway because of high tolls on the Glamorganshire Canal, but by 1814 they were bankrupt, and had no further connections with the canal.|$|E

5|$|Andriamanelo is {{typically}} {{portrayed as a}} civilizing king {{in contrast to the}} primitive Vazimba against whom he waged war. As such, oral history credits him with discovering such diverse arts as silversmithing and astrology (sikidy) in addition <b>to</b> <b>iron</b> working. He reputedly introduced knowledge about the construction and use of pirogues, and was the first in the highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through the construction of dikes in the valleys around Alasora. The Merina rite of circumcision, described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy {{through the end of the}} 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production <b>to</b> <b>iron</b> plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E

Ulysses is then approached by Eternity and takes a place at his side as a new cosmic entity.
