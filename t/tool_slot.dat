40|$|The {{following}} project thesis {{addresses a}} vital pre-release decision that directly affects the operational {{effectiveness of a}} flexible manufacturing system- the machine-loading problem. Flexible manufacturing {{is a concept that}} allows manufacturing systems to be built under high customized production requirements. Issues such as cutting down of inventories and shortened product life cycles, reducing the cost of products and services to grab more market shares, etc have made it almost compulsory for many companies to switch over to flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) as a viable means to accomplish the above goals while producing consistently good quality and cost effective products. The combinatorial and NP-hard nature of this problem makes it arduous to secure the best solutions. The objectives are minimization of the system unbalance and maximization of throughput, whereas the system’s technological constraints are determined by the availability of machining time and <b>tool</b> <b>slots.</b> Due to the large number of random sequences generated as the number of jobs increase, an eliminator function displays and computes the system unbalance and throughput only for a fixed number of sequences, thus improving the quality of the solution and reducing the computational burden.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} finding duplicates in data is {{ubiquitous}} in data mining. We cast {{the problem of}} finding duplicates in sequential data into a poly-cut problem on a fully connected graph. The edge weights can be identified with parameterized pairwise similarities between objects that are optimized by structural support vector machines on labeled training sets. Our approach adapts the similarity measure to the data and is independent {{of the number of}} clusters. We present three large margin approximations of learning the pairwise similarities: an integrated QPformulation, a sequential multi-class approach and a pairwise classifier. We report on experimental results. 1 Introduction The problem of identifying duplicates has applications ranging from recognizingobjects from different perspectives and angles to the identification of objects that are intentionally altered to obfuscate their true identity, origin, or purpose. This occurs, for instance, in the context of email spam and virus detection. Spam and virus senders avoid mailing identical copies of their messages be-cause it would be an easy giveaway. Identifying a batch of messages would allow email service providers to hold back the entire batch, and to identify hijackedservers that are being used to disseminate spam or viruses. Therefore, spam senders generate messages according to templates.

It is also {{available}} at: [URL] planning of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is plagued by two interrelated problems, i. e. part type selection and operation allocation on machines. The combination of these problems is termed the machine-loading problem, which is a well-known complex puzzle and treated as a strongly NP-hard problem. In this research, a machine-loading problem has been modelled, taking into consideration several technological constraints related to the flexibility of machines, availability of machining time, <b>tool</b> <b>slots,</b> etc., while aiming to satisfy the objectives of minimizing the system unbalance, maximizing throughput, and achieving very good overall FMS utilization.

In this paper, {{a new kind of}} genetic algorithm, termed a genetic algorithm with chromosome differentiation, has been used to address a well-known machine-loading problem.

A week-long study explored the feasibility of a new Optimal Profile Descent (OPD) arrival into the airspace as well as a novel application of a Terminal Area Precision Scheduling and Spacing (TAPSS) enhancement to the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) arrival scheduling tool to coordinate high volume arrival traffic to intersecting runways. In the simulation, four en route sector controllers and four terminal radar approach control (TRACON) controllers managed traffic inbound to Newark International Airport's primary runway, 22 L, and its intersecting overflow runway, 11. TAPSS was used to generate independent arrival schedules for each runway and a traffic management coordinator participant adjusted the arrival schedule for each runway 11 aircraft to follow one of the 22 L aircraft. TAPSS also provided controller-managed spacing <b>tools</b> (<b>slot</b> markers with speed advisories and timelines) to assist the TRACON controllers in managing the arrivals that were descending on OPDs. Results showed that the tools significantly decreased the occurrence of runway violations (potential go-arounds) when compared with a Baseline condition with no tools. Further, the combined use of the tools with the new OPD produced a peak arrival rate of over 65 aircraft per hour using instrument flight rules (IFR), exceeding the current maximum arrival rate at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) of 52 per hour under visual flight rules (VFR). Although the participants rated the workload as relatively low and acceptable both with and without the tools, they rated the tools as reducing their workload further. Safety and coordination were rated by most participants as acceptable in both conditions, although the TRACON Runway Coordinator (TRC) rated neither as acceptable in the Baseline condition. Regarding the role of the TRC, the two TRACON controllers handling the 11 arrivals indicated that the TRC was very much needed in the Baseline condition without tools, but not needed in the condition with tools. This indicates that the tools were providing much of the sequencing and spacing information that the TRC had supplied in the Baseline condition...|$|R
