40|$|Objective: There are {{multiple}} possible etiologies for <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> in children. There is growing evidence {{that many students}} identified as having <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> have significant working memory deficits. To determine, {{in a sample of}} primary school students in Jakarta, Indonesia, the prevalence of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> co-morbid with working memory deficits. Methods: Subjects (N= 423) were recruited via proportional random sampling from 27 primary schools. The first stage was a cross-sectional study of these students, while the second stage was a case-control study comparing all students with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and working memory deficits with controls matched by school type, grade level, and gender. Results: Among the students, whose mean age was 9. 34 years (1. 78), 13. 7 % had a <b>learning</b> <b>difficulty,</b> while 8. 04 % had a <b>learning</b> <b>difficulty</b> with working memory deficit.

40|$|To {{examine whether}} <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{play a role}} in {{depressive}} symptoms, 658 Finnish adolescents were asked to complete scales for depression three times during the transition to post-comprehensive education. They also reported on their <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and feelings of inadequacy as a student. The results showed that <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> prospectively predicted depressive symptoms. Moreover, the impact of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> was mediated via inadequacy as a student: <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> predicted feelings of inadequacy as a student which, in turn, contributed to greater increases in depressive symptoms. Finally, gender moderated the association between <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and depressive symptoms: both being a girl and having a high level of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> predicted a higher initial level of depressive symptoms.

This is also evidenced in the fact that, in comparison to childhood, depression levels rise during the adolescent years (for a review, see Hankin & Abramson, 2001). At the same time aca-demic demands at school increase and adolescents become more aware of individual differences in abilities and achievement (Renick & Harter, 1989).

An eclectic approach, using both qualitative and quantitative methods was adopted. Thus I studied the lives of six workers with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and considered the case files of a further 200 similar employees in the English city of Northtown {{in order to develop}} an understanding of their employment experiences and to gain insight into the perceptions of their employers in mainstream workplaces. Twenty one employers completed a survey questionnaire and 12 were interviewed. I also investigated how supported employment providers (SEPs) promote `meaningful work' opportunities for people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> The research findings helped me to formulate policy recommendations and applications for Iran. The social model of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> was the main stance of this research. The research showed that people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> were excluded from many aspects of life particularly employment, due to the social, cultural, political and structural barriers within society. All the SEPs and most employers perceived employees with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> as capable, punctual, reliable, willing, hard-working very helpful and trustworthy workers. This study highlighted that the current supported employment programme, despite supporting employees with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> at work and increasing the employers' awareness of their ability was not successful in enabling people in gaining meaningful work. The Workstep programme, however, did appear to help people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> to get paid jobs.

40|$|This article {{draws on}} work {{undertaken}} {{as part of}} the Economic and Social Research Council's Learning Society Programme. The project from which data are drawn, entitled 'The Meaning of the Learning Society for Adults with Learning Difficulties', focused on lifelong learning opportunities available to people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and experiences of these services. The article begins by examining theories of late modernity, their use by feminist and disability studies theorists and their relationship to ideas of a learning society. Subsequently, using case study material, it is argued that the identities of people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are not chosen freely from a range of options but are socially ascribed. The status of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> is used as a dominant category to justify deprivation of basic political and economic rights. In addition, the lives of people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are structured by gender and class, and these intersect with the category of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> For both women and men, the advantages of middle-class social and economic capital are overridden by the negative category of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> In relation to gender, men with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are more likely to receive post-school training, but in inappropriate areas of the labour market. Their domestic needs are also likely to be attended to by others, but in the absence of employment, they find themselves without any valued social role. Women with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are also likely to be excluded from the labour market, but {{are more likely to be}} involved in reciprocal, albeit limited, social relationships.

40|$|Paid {{employment}} {{for people with}} <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> became central to social inclusion agendas over the period of Labour governments between 1997 and 2010. This found its clearest expression in Valuing Employment Now (2009) the first policy document in UK history to specifically focus {{on the role of}} employment in the lives of people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> This thesis tests the validity of the claims made in this and other policy documents seeking to embed the idea that employment supports social inclusion. The overarching research question addressed by the thesis is: Is employment a vehicle for social inclusion for people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties?</b> Using a qualitative multi-method approach, this question is explored through an analysis of how policy has informed practice over time; the extent to which young people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are prepared for employment; what employment means to people with learning difficulties; and how the identities associated with people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> influence inclusion through employment. The thesis analyses relationships between structure and agency in the specific context of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and employment. The thesis investigates how {{employment for}} people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> has been contextualised by policy, service provision and ideologies over time. It interrogates how people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> have interpreted this policy- provision-ideas context, and attempted to negotiate it. The thesis analyses the extent to which people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> consider employment as an opportunity for them to become involved in a process of social inclusion. In order to support this analysis, the thesis utilises concepts drawn from sociological theory, in particular the concept of structuration (Giddens, 1990). The research found that people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> - employed and unemployed - consider employment to have the potential for social inclusion. However, as well as numerous structural barriers research also found that a combination of policy and practice over time has constructed and maintained identity 'types' (Giddens, 1990 : 118) which constrain the extent to which employment can facilitate social inclusion. Further, the research found evidence that people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are aware of the identities they are being invited to adopt and draw on them in contradictory ways.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Hall report {{specified}} {{the early}} detection of mild to moderate <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> as one aim of child health surveillance (CHS). This study examines the efficacy of preschool CHS in the early recognition of children with these disorders. DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study. SUBJECTS: All children (n = 408) with mild to moderate <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> born between 1 July 1983 and 30 June 1984 and resident in North and West Belfast. CONTROLS: 2406 birth records and 150 full child health records controlled for age and geographical area. RESULTS: The prevalence of mild to moderate <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> in North and West Belfast was 16 %. Only 6 % of children with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> were identified by the CHS in the preschool period, although the detection rate for children eventually requiring placement in schools for moderate <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> was better. Coverage of the CHS ranged from 90 % at the 2 year examination to 98 % at the 4 year examination. Perinatal variables associated with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> after multiple logistic regression analysis were lower social class (odds ratio (OR) 3. 9), prematurity < 35 weeks (OR 3. 0), male sex (OR 1. 6), and birth to an unmarried mother (OR 0. 6). Independent preschool variables identified by the CHS were speech delay (OR 3. 3), poor parenting skills (OR 4. 0), behaviour problems (OR 2. 8), enuresis (OR 2. 4), poor visual acuity (OR 1. 8), and otitis media with effusion (OR 1. 4). A statistical model for the {{early detection of}} <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> using these risk factors is unable to predict accurately the children who will develop mild to moderate <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The CHS as it existed from 1983 to 1989 in North and West Belfast was poorly sensitive to the detection of mild to moderate <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> despite excellent coverage.

This thesis presents {{the result of a}} study on <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> among primary school children carried out in Lagos State of Nigeria. The study determined teachers' perceptions of special education, determined whether primary school children had <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties,</b> the relative proportion of children who have <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and the types of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> that they have. It described how the children's needs were met and how appropriate the provisions made to meet these needs were. In addition it evaluated the implications of the research findings for teacher education.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to break down the various stages design {{activity}} into a number of smaller units, to enable pupils with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> to be able to cope with its logic /philosophy of the design process. Key Stage 3 pupils with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are the target for the ideas and considerations set out in this paper. The pupils in question are those that have moderate <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties,</b> who may have some form of statement and who are, in general, in main stream schools. In spite of the National Curriculum for Technology (and Design) having a series of levels for each Attainment Target and Key Stage, some if not all of the various levels, whenever they occur, are perhaps asking too much of some pupils with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> in a design context not only refer to lack of reading and writing skills but also spatial/drawing skills, and the ability to sequence and manipulate information...|$|R
