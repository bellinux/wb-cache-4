5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an oblique, isometric format and is set inside a haunted castle. As Sir Arthur Pendragon, the player's main objective is to collect sixteen pieces of a key before midnight, which when all connected will form {{the shape of a}} pentacle. The pieces of the pentacle are guarded by various magical creatures, some of which can be defeated by casting spells, others requiring accurately timed attacks and nimble dodging. Once a piece is obtained, the player must <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific chamber within the castle. Once all pentacles have been placed in their chambers, the player can establish the whereabouts of the Staff of Karnath, which must be destroyed before midnight.|$|E

Once they have taken what they want, he is permitted to reclaim whatever remains. It is permissible to choose three people whom one knows will not claim the produce for themselves, even though they are legally entitled to.|$|E
25|$|Both semi-finals {{were on the}} {{schedule}} on Day 11, with Serena Williams against Nicole Vaidišová first to take the court. Vaidišová broke early on for a 2–0 lead, but she squandered that advantage. At 5–4, the Czech {{had a chance to}} serve out the first set and take the advantage, but Williams fought back to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tie-break and take the first set. In the second set, Williams continued to dominate moving ahead 5–1 and just points from wrapping up the victory, but it was Vaidišová who showed her fighting spirit saving four match points at 5–3 to Williams and then saving another in the last game of the match before Williams finally wrapped up the 7–6(5), 6–4 victory by converting her sixth match point and reach her first Grand Slam final since her Australian Open win two years previously.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} secure storage {{stretches}} {{far back in}} time. The earliest known locks {{were made by the}} Egyptians. Ancient Romans used a more sophisticated locking system, called warded locks. Warded locks had special notches and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient India, Russia, and China, where the combination lock is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron safes fitted with a key lock up until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century. After the Gold Rush of 1849, unsuccessful prospectors turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break into the bank using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief could get it out a window, and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> secluded spot to break it open.|$|E
25|$|Safin's next tournament was in Valencia. He {{defeated}} {{former world}} No. 1 and fourth seed Juan Carlos Ferrero. In {{spite of the}} fact that Ferrero is from the Valencia region, Safin was the more popular player, having been based in Valencia for many years and being a well-known Valencia CF fan. – local player Ferrero controversially favouring Real Madrid. He played Dutch teenager Robin Haase in the next round. He won the first set and was up 4–2 in the second set. However, Haase broke back to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tiebreak. Safin had four match points, including one on his serve, but lost the tiebreak, and eventually the match. In the Monte Carlo Masters, Safin defeated Xavier Malisse, but then lost to No. 5 David Ferrer. He then entered the 2008 BMW Open in Munich, Germany, where he beat Carlos Berlocq in the first round. In the second round, he edged out Michael Berrer, but lost to Fernando González in his first quarterfinal of the year, and the first since June 2007 at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. Safin entered the 2008 French Open but was eliminated in the second round by countryman and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, in straight sets.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{began his}} French Open with a four sets win over Andrey Golubev, and then {{defeated}} Marinko Matosevic {{to set up}} a third round match with Philipp Kohlschreiber. The 28th seeded German proved a much tougher prospect and after Murray failed to see out the match from a commanding position in the fourth set, play was abandoned due to bad light at 7–7 in the deciding fifth set. Despite having never been beyond 7–5 in a decider, Murray held his nerve to take it 12–10 when play resumed the following day. He then returned the next day to take on Fernando Verdasco, but this match proved less troublesome with Murray picking up the win in straight sets. In the quarter-finals, Murray played childhood friend Gaël Monfils and stormed into a two set lead. Monfils hit back though, winning the next two to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> decider. Despite the momentum seeming to be against Murray, he turned the match round spectacularly to take the final set 6–0 and reach the semi-finals, equalling his best ever result at the French Open. The result saw him become only the 10th man to reach multiple semi-finals at all four Grand Slams and also reach a British-record 14th Grand Slam semi-final. In the semi-finals he faced Rafael Nadal for the second consecutive tournament. Nadal was at his best throughout the match and Murray struggled to keep up, weakened by the two long, five-set matches he had already played. In the end, Nadal saw off Murray in under two hours, winning comfortably in straight sets.|$|E

Businessman Leonardo Fariña {{said in an}} interview that he helped businessman Lázaro Báez to divert money from public works, and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> financial firm located in the Madero Center luxury hotel. This firm, informally known as [...] "La Rosadita", would have sent the money abroad to tax havens, using shell companies. Given the amounts of money involved, the money was weighed instead of counted to determine the value. Federico Elaskar, owner of the firm, confirmed Fariña's claims in another interview. Both of them retracted their statements after the program was aired, but prosecutor José María Campagnoli confirmed their links with Báez. Báez denied any wrongdoing. Campagnoli was suspended as a prosecutor, accused of leaking information, and abusing his authority. Báez is also linked with the Kirchners to the Hotesur scandal, a suspected case of money laundering. According to a criminal complaint by opposition deputy Margarita Stolbizer, his company Valle Mitre S.A. has rented 1,100 rooms per month, for years, at the Hotesur and Alto Calafate hotels, but without occupying them.

500|$|Cromwell's head {{remained}} on a spike above Westminster Hall {{until the late}} 1680s, not counting a temporary removal for roof maintenance in 1681. The position of the head, {{in relation to the}} heads of Bradshaw and Ireton, has been called into question. Pearson and Morant upheld the originally understood position—traditionally, Bradshaw's head was in the middle, with Cromwell to the right and Ireton to the left— through careful analysis of contemporary poems and plans. The circumstances in which Cromwell's head came into private ownership are rumoured to be tied with a great storm towards the end of James II's reign (16851689), which broke the pole bearing the head, throwing it to the ground. A sentinel guarding the Exchequer's Office came across it, after which he hid it under his cloak and stored it, hidden, in the chimney of his house. The loss of the head was still significant in London at the time, and many searched for it, hoping to claim the “considerable reward” being offered for its safe return. The guard, after seeing “the placards which ordered any one possessing it to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain office...was afraid to divulge the secret”. Only circumstantial evidence has been established for the whereabouts of the head following its fall from Westminster Hall until 1710, when it was in the possession of Claudius Du Puy, a Swiss-French collector of curiosities, who displayed it in his private museum in London. According to Fitzgibbons, Du Puy's museum was internationally famous and ranked among the top attractions in London at the time, attracting visitors such as a traveller named Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach, who was not impressed by what he saw. After hearing Du Puy's boast that he could sell the head for as much as 60 guineas (£63, or the equivalent of about £5000 in today's British money), Uffenbach exclaimed his surprise that [...] "this monstrous head could still be so dear and worthy to the English".|$|E

2500|$|At 5ft 9 in and 215 pounds (1.75 m and 98kg), Wagner was not {{particularly}} physically imposing by professional wrestling standards, nor was he an exceptionally gifted athlete, although he was a gifted amateur wrestler.
