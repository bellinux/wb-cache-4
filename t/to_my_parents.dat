500|$|Miliband is of Jewish heritage—the first Jewish {{leader of}} the Labour Party—and {{describes}} himself as a Jewish atheist. After marrying Thornton in a civil ceremony on 27 May 2011, he paid tribute to his Jewish heritage by following the tradition of breaking a glass. In 2012, Miliband wrote, [...] "Like many others from Holocaust families, I have a paradoxical relationship with this history. On one level I feel intimately connected with it – this happened <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> and grandparents. On another, it feels like a totally different world." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E

500|$|Kate Elizabeth Winslet {{was born}} on 5 October 1975 in Reading, Berkshire, England, to Sally Anne (née Bridges) and Roger John Winslet. Her mother worked as a nanny and waitress, and her father, a {{struggling}} actor, took labouring jobs to support the family. Her maternal grandparents were both actors and ran the Reading Repertory Theatre Company. Winslet has two sisters, Anna and Beth, {{both of whom are}} actresses, and a younger brother, Joss. The family had limited financial means; they lived on free meal benefits and were supported by a charity named the Actor's Charitable Trust. When Winslet was 10, her father nearly lost his foot in a boating accident and found it harder to find work, leading to more financial hardships for the family. Even so, Winslet has said, [...] "We never felt like the poor kids, which is absolutely a credit <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents.</b> We lived in a lovely terrace house and we all had each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Asche {{is married}} to Angela Albers, whom he presumably met in college at Nebraska. He {{is a fan of}} {{football}} and an ardent supporter of the Nebraska Cornhuskers; he routinely drives six hours to attend their home football games. He also [...] "appreciates the speed and violence of hockey"; conversely, he does not like basketball. During the offseason, he resides in O'Fallon, Missouri, which is barely over [...] from his birthplace of St. Charles, Missouri. According to his MLB.com biography, his hobbies include golfing, fishing, and completing crossword puzzles. In an interview, Asche said his favorite television show was Parks and Recreation, and his favorite food was chicken parmesan. He is close to his family, and noted that he started playing baseball around age five or six, with his first experience being playing in the back yard with his father and brother. When he was first called up to the major leagues, he noted, [...] "Emotions were crazy. Trying to hold back tears seeing your parents in the stands for the first time was tough, then playing on top of that made it a little crazy to start. But that is all part of it. I think the phone call I got to make <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> the day I was called up was the most memorable part ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{ambiguity}} {{about the}} writer's parentage, because [...] "Ayn Rand and God" [...] {{can be read}} as in apposition <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> leading the reader to believe that the writer claims Ayn Rand and God are the parents.

2500|$|... "I {{asked him}} [...] {{when he had}} his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always {{interested}} in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted {{to make him feel}} good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I {{was the only one who}} did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Haggard {{describes}} {{feeling the}} call of God on his life after {{his first year in}} college, {{while he was in the}} kitchen at home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to pastor. [...] "I was totally surprised," [...] Haggard wrote in The Life-Giving Church. [...] "I [...] [...] [...] told the Lord I wanted to serve Him. But before I mentioned this to anyone, especially <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> I asked the Lord to assure me by using others to confirm His calling on my life. I felt as though He consented [...] [...] [...]" [...] Within forty-eight hours, Haggard felt that he received four unsolicited confirmations: from a Sunday school teacher, a pastor, a friend, and from his father. Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1978.|$|E
