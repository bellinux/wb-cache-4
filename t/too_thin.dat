5|$|An {{alternative}} hypothesis suggest that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos {{and that the}} claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images. The implication is that the ice is <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> to support the convective diapir model of feature formation.|$|E
5|$|By March 1905, Potter {{was anxious}} to begin work on the tale. She thought the 1903 version <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. The deck and turret roof armour proved to be <b>too</b> <b>thin,</b> and the structure supporting the side armour was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|Lee’s army {{fought a}} series of battles in the Appomattox Campaign against Grant that {{ultimately}} stretched thin his lines of defense. Lee's extended lines were mostly on small sections of thirty miles of strongholds around Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. His troops ultimately became exhausted defending this line because they were <b>too</b> <b>thinned</b> out. Grant then {{took advantage of the}} situation and launched attacks on this thirty mile long poorly defended front. This ultimately led to the surrender of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox.|$|R

5|$|In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme {{were the}} first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was {{considered}} <b>too</b> <b>thin,</b> demanding a substantial redesign. The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are <b>too</b> <b>thin.</b> In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> to block a cannon shot or for a man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E

60|$|The cloud floated by and {{the moon}} came out as though from an eclipse; the smoke of the fire, <b>too,</b> <b>thinned</b> by degrees. As it melted and the light grew again, I became aware that {{something}} was materializing, or had appeared {{on the point of}} the rock above us. A few seconds later, to my wonder and amazement, I perceived that this something was the spirit-like form of a white woman which stood quite still upon the very point of the rock. She was clad in some garment of gleaming white cut low upon her breast, that may have been of linen, but from the way it shone, suggested that it was of glittering feathers, egrets' for instance. Her ruddy hair was outspread, and in it, too, something glittered, like mica or jewels. Her feet and milk-hued arms were bare and poised in her right hand was a little spear.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} lithological characteristics, and lateral and {{vertical}} facies trends of poorly understood, deep-marine matrix-rich sedimentary rocks. Two laterally extensive, well-exposed outcrops of slope and proximal basin floor deposits were investigated from the Neoproterozoic Windermere Supergroup. Significantly, matrix-rich beds {{have been found}} to undergo the same lateral trends (over ~ 200 - 650 m) in both outcrops. Initially, thicker, clayey sandstone transitions laterally to a bipartite bed with the development of an upper, planar-based, more matrix-rich unit. Further laterally, the basal unit progressively thins until it pinches out, and all that remains is the upper, more matrix-rich unit – a sandy claystone. It <b>too</b> <b>thins</b> and then pinches out. Draping the entire transect is a thin, matrix-poor structured unit overlain by a mudstone or claystone cap. These trends are interpreted to reflect a progressive but rapid lateral evolution of flow structure controlled primarily by particle settling, namely sand, from mud-rich avulsion-related flows...|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were <b>too</b> <b>thin,</b> causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is <b>too</b> <b>thin,</b> expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{can take}} several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which {{consists}} of a motte (a mound)– surmounted by a keep or tower– connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and fortified manor houses. Ringworks are similar to motte-and-bailey castles but lack the motte; although contemporary with motte-and-baileys, they are an uncommon form of fortification. A ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> to provide a proper motte or {{simply because of the}} preference of the builder. A fortified manor house was the administrative centre of a manor– a division of land in medieval England– and was usually the home of the local lord. Fortified manor houses are considered castles because they often had battlements or crenellations.|$|E

Creamy or yellow tint, especially around the neck and cheeks, large paunch, bony or angular frame, or fur that is <b>too</b> harsh, <b>thin,</b> wooly or short is frowned upon. Dewlaps in either sex are considered a serious fault. White-topped or very dark exhibits are discouraged. White toenails are a minor fault.|$|R
5|$|Lasting over 680 years, the Roman–Persian War was {{the longest}} {{conflict}} in human history. Despite this, the frontier remained largely stable. A game of tug of war ensued: towns, fortifications, and provinces were continually sacked, captured, destroyed, and traded. Neither side had the logistical strength or manpower to maintain such lengthy campaigns far from their borders, and thus neither could advance too far without risking stretching its frontiers <b>too</b> <b>thin.</b> Both sides did make conquests beyond the border, but in time the balance was almost always restored. The line of stalemate shifted in the 2nd century AD: it had run along the northern Euphrates; the new line ran east, or later northeast, across Mesopotamia to the northern Tigris. There were several substantial shifts further north, in Armenia and the Caucasus. Although initially different in military tactics, the armies of both sides gradually adopted {{from each other and}} by {{the second half of the}} 6th century they were similar and evenly matched.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. MacArthur's plan for holding all of Luzon against the Japanese collapsed as it spread out the American-Filipino forces <b>too</b> <b>thin.</b> However, he reconsidered his confidence {{in the ability of}} his Filipino troops after the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at Lingayen Gulf on 21 December, and ordered a retreat to Bataan. Within two days of the Japanese landing at Lingayen Gulf, MacArthur had reverted to pre-July 1941 plan of attempting to hold only Bataan while waiting for a relief force to come. Most of the American and some of the Filipino troops were able to retreat back to Baatan, but without most of their supplies, which were abandoned in the confusion. Manila was declared an open city at midnight on 24 December, without any consultation with Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commanding the Asiatic Fleet, forcing the Navy to destroy considerable amounts of valuable material.|$|E
5|$|USS Galena was a wooden-hulled {{broadside}} ironclad {{built for}} the United States Navy during the American Civil War. The ship was initially assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and supported Union forces during the Peninsula Campaign in 1862. She was damaged during the Battle of Drewry's Bluff because her armor was <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> to prevent Confederate shots from penetrating. Widely regarded as a failure, Galena was reconstructed without most of her armor in 1863 and transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in 1864. The ship participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay and the subsequent Siege of Fort Morgan in August. She was briefly transferred to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron in September before she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for repairs in November.|$|E

5|$|When {{considering}} his appearance for Soulcalibur, different designs were considered, including {{one with a}} heavily bandaged eye and scarred appearance intended to imply his fate {{at the end of}} Soul Edge, and another modeled after his appearance in Soul Edges opening sequence, featuring a wide-brimmed hat, though both designs were rejected as the developers felt they made the character appear <b>too</b> <b>thin.</b> Elements from both were reused for Soulcalibur III, retaining the hat while giving his left eye a damaged appearance. Elements of his previous design were retained, {{with the addition of a}} green vest and bracers, and the lengthening of the tail of his coat to his mid-thighs. His alternate character model from Soul Edge was added as his alternate in the game, featuring minimal changes save for opening the vest to have his chest be bare.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} {{began at}} 16:00 on 16 September; {{by the second}} day, JNA 9th (Knin) Corps commanding officer Major General Vladimir Vuković modified the initial plan because of significant resistance from the ZNG and Croatian police (who relied on populated areas and terrain features {{to hold back the}} JNA). Vuković's changes involved diverting part of the force to attack Drniš and Sinj, resting the remainder of the attacking force. These orders were confirmed on 18 September by the JNA Military-Maritime District commander, Vice Admiral Mile Kandić. The Yugoslav Navy began a blockade of the Croatian Adriatic coast on 17 September, further isolating Zadar, and the city's electricity supply was cut {{on the first day of}} the JNA attack. The ZNG was driven out of Polača, towards Škabrnja, on 18 September. Croatian forces captured seven JNA facilities in Zadar, the most significant the Turske kuće barracks and depot. The captures provided the ZNG with about 2,500 rifles, 100 M-53 machine guns and ammunition, although the Yugoslav Air Force bombed the barracks on 22 September in an unsuccessful attempt to hinder removal of the weapons. The captured weapons bolstered the Croatian defence, but JNA attacks north of the city resulted in a stalemate; Croatian forces were spread <b>too</b> <b>thin</b> to defend the city and capture the remaining barracks, and the besieged JNA garrisons were too weak to break out.|$|E

50|$|Clothing {{protects against}} {{many things that}} might injure the {{uncovered}} human body. Clothes protect people from the elements, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, {{as well as from}} the sun.

Some clothing protects from specific environmental hazards, such as insects, noxious chemicals, weather, weapons, and contact with abrasive substances. Conversely, clothing may protect the environment from the clothing wearer, as with doctors wearing medical scrubs.|$|R
