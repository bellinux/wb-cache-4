Material: experiment covered 186 sportsmen of 14 - 17 years old age. Quantitative indicators <b>of</b> limbs’ <b>traumas</b> and damages were registered in competition and training processes during yearly macro-cycle by results of processing of official competitions’ records and by medical records of football players. Results: application of stretching techniques in training process and in football players’ physical rehabilitation permitted to reduce quantitative indicators <b>of</b> <b>traumas</b> <b>of</b> upper and lower limbs from 18 (season 2012 - 2013) to 7 cases (season 2013 - 2014).

5|$|Ilya Ulyanov {{died of a}} brain {{haemorrhage}} in January 1886, when Lenin was 16. Subsequently, Lenin's behaviour became erratic and confrontational, and he soon renounced {{his belief}} in God. At the time, Lenin's elder brother Alexander—whom he affectionately knew as Sasha—was studying at Saint Petersburg University. Involved in political agitation against the absolute monarchy of the reactionary Tsar Alexander III, Sasha studied the writings of banned leftists and organised anti-government protests. He joined a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before the attack could take place the conspirators were arrested and tried, and in May, Sasha was executed by hanging. Despite the emotional <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> his father's and brother's deaths, Lenin continued studying, graduated with a gold medal for exceptional performance, and decided to study law at Kazan University.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit the <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that}} the natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about her}} role in voicing Saya, Mizuki said that she {{initially}} thought she would need to reimagine the entire character for her performance as Saya in the movie. It was later decided that the core character had changed little despite {{the events of the}} series finale, so Mizuki did not have to adjust her performance by much. Mizuki worked with the staff to help portray Saya's strained condition and deliberate isolation from others after the <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> the series' events, although the sense of love still formed a strong part of Saya's character. Hashimoto's role as Mana was her first role in an anime movie, which proved challenging as Hashimoto needed to adjust to a new work environment, in particular performing convincingly without acting physically. She accepted the part based on her liking for CLAMP's manga work, recording all her lines separate {{from the rest of the}} cast. Fukuyama voiced Watanuki, making a cameo appearance from CLAMP's manga series xxxHolic. For the character's role in The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic.|$|E
5|$|When {{the series}} begins, Allen is about 15 years old. Although {{most of his}} colleagues assume he is ageing normally, one of his enemies (Nea, who later {{possesses}} his body), suspects {{that he may be}} growing younger. Allen is often accompanied by Timcampy, a small flying golem given him by his mentor (Exorcist general Cross Marian). As a result of the <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> attempting to revive his guardian, Mana Walker, Allen's reddish-brown hair becomes white. Mana's curse of the boy's left eye allows Allen to distinguish Akuma from humans. Allen is devoted to helping the Akuma find peace until he meets the Exorcists of the Black Order, who become his friends. Realizing that he fights to save the souls of the Akuma and for his human friends, he devotes himself equally to both causes. Allen's master, Cross Marian, notes that the boy (originally cynical and rude), has adopted Mana's formal speech, mannerisms and personality. Allen begins to speak less formally during the series, reverting to his speech before he met Mana.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} unleashing of the king's power, Veigue's Force of Ice {{goes out of}} control, causing his friend Claire to become imprisoned in an ice pillar. One year after this, Veigue is {{contacted}} by Eugene and Mao, who help free Claire from the ice pillar. Shortly after this, Claire is taken away by agents of Agarte, who is searching for the most beautiful Huma woman in the land. Veigue heads out with Eugene and Mao to rescue Claire, eventually joining forces with Annie, Tytree and Hilda. Upon reaching the royal capital of Balka, the group find Agarte using her Force of the Moon to resurrect Geyorkias {{in the belief that}} the spirit will save her kingdom from the chaos consuming it, having been prompted by Zilva. When summoned, Geyorkias declares his intent to destroy the Huma population, forcing the group to attack and destroy his physical form. With Geyorkias gone and Claire rescued, the group part ways, but are brought back together as outbreaks of racial violence from both Huma and Gajuma begin destabilizing Karegia, caused by the hatred the summoned Geyorkias released after his defeat. To quell the violence, the group decide to summon the other Sacred Beasts in the hope of purging Geyorkias' hatred from the land. After rescuing Agarte from a Huma mob, it is revealed that Agarte switched bodies with Claire. In the aftermath, Agarte reveals that she originally captured Claire so she could switch bodies and realize her love for her bodyguard Milhaust, as relations between Huma and Gajama are taboo. Unfortunately, the <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> events has caused Agarte to lose her Force abilities, leaving Claire and Agarte trapped in each other's bodies.|$|E

40|$|The paper first {{considers}} {{the role of}} Jungian ideas in relation to academic disciplines and to literary studies in particular. Jung is a significant resource in negotiating developments in literary theory because of his characteristic treatment of the ‘other’. The paper then looks at The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) by C. S. Lewis whose own construction of archetypes {{is very close to}} Jung’s. By drawing upon new post-Jungian work from Jerome Bernstein’s Living in the Borderland (2005), the novel is revealed to be intimately concerned with narratives <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> and <b>of</b> origin. Indeed, a Jungian and post-Jungian approach is able to situate the text both within nature and in the historical <b>traumas</b> <b>of</b> war as well as the personal <b>traumas</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity. Where Bernstein connects his work to the postcolonial ethos of the modern Navajo shaman, this new weaving of literary and cultural theory points to the residue of shamanism within the arts of the West.

40|$|Reflecting on the otherness <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> and its vexed {{relationship}} to representation, this article considers {{some aspects of}} the writing <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> in Michael Cunningham’s 2005 novel Specimen Days; a text that offers a particularly powerful literary imaging of culture’s disavowals that return to haunt. The article focuses on how the text conveys the workings <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> structurally and stylistically through repetition, paratactic syntax and the use of multiple narrator voices, also considering the novel’s distinctly self-reflexive discussion of the ethical implications of fictional representations <b>of</b> <b>trauma.</b> The question <b>of</b> the reader’s relation to aesthetic representations <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> and to the wider debates concerning ethical responses to trauma that the novel seems to question are also discussed. The article argues that Cunningham offers an innovative writing <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> that foregrounds the <b>traumas</b> <b>of</b> everyday violence, social injustice and oppression, whilst also making links to the types <b>of</b> cultural <b>trauma</b> that typically achieve more public recognition. In doing so, the article suggests, his novel opens up for new responses to trauma that require a rethinking of our {{relationship to}} otherness and the other, challenging the dominant responses to public trauma that are imbued by and dependent on injurious discourses of othering...|$|R
5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of blunt injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the incidence of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these people may not be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are so small that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury sometimes is not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true incidence. However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after <b>trauma.</b> <b>Of</b> all neck and chest traumas, including people that died immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The incidence is estimated at 2% in blunt chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest trauma. Laryngotracheal injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of blunt chest trauma deaths. In people with blunt trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of blunt chest trauma revealed an incidence of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The incidence of iatrogenic TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the incidence may be as high as 15%.|$|E
5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E

Cloud and Zack were then taken for experiments by Hojo, with Zack escaping {{four years later}} with a catatonic Cloud. The two were eventually cornered by Shinra soldiers, and Zack was killed; the combined <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> his experience, the experiments and Zack's death triggered an identity crisis, with Cloud constructing a false persona around Zack's stories and his own fantasies. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud recovers and together with Tifa reunites with the party.
