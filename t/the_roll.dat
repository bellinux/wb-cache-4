5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roll</b> of honour was not {{completed}} as quickly. After {{a series of}} budget reductions, it was delivered in June 1929 but was of poor quality, {{and in the meantime}} the trustees of the castle museum had decided that the castle was not an appropriate place for <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> to be kept. It had also exceeded the reduced budget of £500, though Lutyens waived his fee and offered to pay the difference. The trustees changed their minds after improvements were made to the quality, and <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> of honour was installed in the castle on 13 January 1931 without ceremony as a result of embarrassment over the delay.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increased}} number of civilian casualties compared with the World War I, Winston Churchill agreed to Ware's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths. A supplemental chapter {{was added to the}} Imperial War Graves Commission's charter on 7 February 1941, empowering the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War, which resulted {{in the creation of the}} Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour. <b>The</b> <b>roll</b> eventually contained the names of nearly 67,000civilians. The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> was complete and hostilities had ended. The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956; it added the final volume to the showcase in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in <b>the</b> <b>roll,</b> the length of <b>the</b> <b>roll,</b> the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E

After De La Matyr gave a brief, fiery speech, they proceeded to call <b>the</b> <b>roll,</b> which included delegates from every state except Oregon. As <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> call finished, Matilda Joslyn Gage, a suffragist, mounted the stage, provoking cheers from some delegates and howls of outrage from others.

5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years between the Colossus-class ships' commissioning {{and the start of}} World War I, and the most important development was the director firing system.

The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, both ships were equipped with a director by December 1915.|$|E
