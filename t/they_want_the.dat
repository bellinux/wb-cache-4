5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
5|$|The company {{focuses on}} {{creating}} video games that provoke emotional responses from players. Its employees have stated that, {{while they are}} not opposed to making action-oriented games, they believe that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Thatgamecompany employees start by mapping out what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> player to feel, rather than by establishing game mechanics. Employees have stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.|$|E
5|$|Kyle becomes annoyed, {{responding}} {{that the}} economy is not actually angry with them, and that they should be out spending money, and continues to preach {{that the economy}} only exists as a mental construct, and that people have lost their faith in it because of the recession. He then convinces his friends that if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> economy to be strong, they must have faith in it. Upon hearing of this heresy, Randy and his makeshift economic council decide that they must kill Kyle. Cartman, in his desire to obtain a copy of , says that he will deliver Kyle to Randy and his friends in exchange for the game.|$|E
5000|$|Fairfax {{offered his}} own [...] "practicable scheme" [...] for ending slavery through {{colonization}} when he developed his “Plan for Liberating the Negroes within the United States” in 1790. Many of these plans {{were similar in}} that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> abolition of slaves to be gradual, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> government to compensate the slave owners for <b>the</b> lost property, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> government to pay to educate and prepare free blacks for life as independent people, and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to colonize <b>the</b> freed slaves in a separate place from the white society. This was because most people at the time believed that the races {{would not be able}} to get along if they tried to live together.|$|R

5|$|The game {{features}} an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of}} the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>The</b> story of the game is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} sold {{and the new}} owners, the Deetz family, arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz is a former real estate developer; his wife Delia, a sculptor; and his goth {{daughter}} Lydia, from his first marriage, is an aspiring photographer. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, Delia begins to transform the house into a posh modern art piece. Consulting the Handbook, the Maitlands travel to a netherworld waiting room populated by other distressed souls, where they discover that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and the usual overworked caseworkers. The Maitlands' own caseworker, Juno, informs them that they must remain {{in the house for}} 125 years. If <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> Deetzes out of the house, it is up to them to scare them away. Barbara's and Adam's attempts at scaring the family prove counterproductive, despite their ability to shape-shift into monsters.|$|E

25|$|Since the Vocaloid or its vocal {{library is}} {{released}} for producers {{to do as}} they please, some producers think of the Vocaloids as dolls {{and that they can}} make them sing whatever <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>The</b> portrayals of Vocaloids can at times touch controversial issues.

Eventually Police gave in and released the footage. 2 days later, Port was arrested.|$|E
50|$|After {{defeating}} Randy Orton at Night of Champions for the WWE Championship, Daniel Bryan {{was stripped}} of the title when referee Scott Armstrong admitted to a fast 3-count. However, Triple H did not give Orton the title back since {{he and his wife}} Stephanie McMahon believed that Orton's performance at Night of Champions was not what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> face of the WWE to be, stating that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> more ruthless Orton that they feuded with previously. Bryan and Orton were scheduled to face off once more for the vacant championship.|$|R

25|$|In the 1980s, the war {{on drugs}} led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize {{proceeds}} of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, money can be confiscated and {{it is up to the}} individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> funds back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.|$|E
25|$|Bachelor {{groups are}} made up of {{adolescent}} and bucks not holding territory. Any new members must perform intimidation displays to enter the group. However, bachelor groups tend to be very loose and members can leave whenever <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>The</b> larger, older males with thick horns have the best chance of establishing a territory. Conflicts between adult males are usually solved with intimidation displays. The bucks circle each other and swing their necks from side to side, displaying their neck power. Neck strength is important in an actual fight and the male that cannot keep up yields. Gazelles of nearly equal neck strength are {{more likely to engage in}} actual combat. Fighting occurs in young bucks more often than older ones. Dominant bucks can simply run off subordinates rather than having to display to them.|$|E
25|$|Some {{automatic}} smart playlists {{that are}} added to the user’s library include Top 25 Most Played, Recently Played, Recently Added, My Top Rated, Music Videos, Classical Music, Purchased, and 90’s Music. While creating Smart Playlists the user has to choose whether <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> playlist to be based on genre, whether or not the songs have album artwork, date added, etc. and if they want it to contain or not contain certain genres or artists. For example, a genre like country music, or songs added in a specific month or year, or an individual artist. The user can also limit the amount of songs they want in the playlist or they can leave it as unlimited. The Live Updating option will automatically update their new playlist as their library changes.|$|E

25|$|Further studies {{reveal that}} the {{identification}} of second-generation immigrants, of Caribbean heritage, as African Americans leads these children to be more aware of racial discrimination in the U.S. In addition, the assimilation into black society and black culture in the U.S. by these children is hindered by their parents' oppositional stance to American black culture, contributing to identity conflict. In the case of Haitians, first generation Haitians hold on strongly to their foreign identity, as they associate the preservation of their culture with stronger solidarity in the community. These first generation Haitians attempt to instill this same Haitian pride in their children as <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> children to succeed {{on the basis of}} ethnic solidarity and the preservation of Haitian culture, and not by giving in to American culture. This creates a clash between the ideas and values these children learn at home, and from their peers and the non-Haitian black community. Thus, these children face conflicting pressures from family, non-second generation immigrant peers, and discrimination by the larger society.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{improvements}} The Book of Air has over its predecessors is a system of hints for locating difficult items. Although {{it is still possible}} to get hung up on some of the game's more taxing brainteasers, players will no longer find themselves stuck trying to find items thanks to a recharging magnifying glass 'hint power' {{that can be used to}} reveal an object's location. But if there are not any, the power of hints is not used. There are two difficulty modes to play, Casual and Challenge. Each mode has the same puzzles but their complexities are different. At the beginning, the game offers players the option to play in either Casual or Challenge Mode, and if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> game to offer the slightest bit of resistance they would pick the former. While Casual Mode offers simpler puzzles and the ability to skip them if players get stuck long enough, Challenge Mode offers slightly harder puzzles, but will not let players skip any. Players cannot change the difficulty once they have chosen it.|$|E
25|$|Once {{one or more}} {{units have}} been {{selected}}, the player can click {{on the ground to}} make them walk to the selected spot, or click on an enemy to make them attack. Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. This is accomplished by pressing the left or the right arrow key or moving the mouse to rotate the direction of the units as they move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations, of which there are nine available. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground where <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat. All formations, as well as commands such as stopping, guarding, scattering, retreating, and reversing direction, are also available via a single click in the Control Bar {{at the bottom of the}} screen.|$|E
