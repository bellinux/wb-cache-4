Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn {{more likely to be}} damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees. Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the Mima mounds of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of pocket gophers, while the so-called fairy circles of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.|$|E

The Detroit Free Press wrote that Howley [...] "never is quite so contented" [...] as he is when arguing with Bush and added: [...] "Bush would fight {{at the drop of}} a hat for Dan, yet the midget never gets nearly so mad at anyone as he does when Howley, with deliberate intent, corners Donie somewhere and starts a debate[...] [...] [...] Often Donie becomes so enraged that he pulls his cap off his head and throwing it off the door of the hotel lobby or in the turf of the ball field, stamps on it in his hysteria." [...] For the first half of the season, Bush continued as the Tigers' starting shortstop. Halfway through the season, however, Cobb moved Bush from his regular shortstop position to second base.|$|R

50|$|Vegetation {{patterns}} such as <b>tiger</b> <b>bush</b> and fir waves {{form for}} different reasons. <b>Tiger</b> <b>bush</b> consists of stripes of bushes on arid slopes {{in countries such}} as Niger where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation absorbs rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. In contrast, fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tiger</b> <b>bush</b> never {{develops}} on {{moderate to}} steep slopes, because {{in these cases}} surface runoff concentrates into narrow threads or rills instead of flowing over the surface as sheet flow.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Mathematics, Washington State UniversityThe {{development}} of spontaneous stationary vegetative patterns in an arid flat environment is investigated {{by means of}} a weakly nonlinear diffusive instability analysis applied to the appropriate model system for this phenomenon. In particular, that process can be modeled by a partial differential interaction-diffusion equation system for the plant biomass density and the surface water content defined on an unbounded flat spatial domain. The main results of this analysis can be represented by closed-form plots in the rate of precipitation versus the specific rate of plant density loss parameter space. From these plots, regions corresponding to bare ground and vegetative patterns consisting of parallel stripes, labyrinth-like mazes, hexagonal arrays of gaps, irregular mosaics, and homogeneous distributions of vegetation, respectively, may be identified in this parameter space. Then those theoretical predictions are compared with both relevant observational evidence involving <b>tiger</b> and pearled <b>bush</b> patterns and existing numerical simulations of similar model systems as well as placed {{in the context of the}} results from some recent nonlinear vegetative pattern formation studies.

50|$|<b>Tiger</b> <b>bush</b> or brousse tigrée is a {{patterned}} vegetation {{community and}} ground consisting of alternating bands of trees, shrubs, or grass separated by bare ground or low herb cover, that run roughly parallel to contour lines of equal elevation. The patterns occur on low slopes in arid and semi-arid regions, {{such as in}} Australia, Sahelian West Africa, and North America.|$|E
50|$|Patterns {{can form}} {{for other reasons}} in the vegetated {{landscape}} of <b>tiger</b> <b>bush</b> and fir waves. <b>Tiger</b> <b>bush</b> stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn {{more likely to be}} damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees. Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the Mima mounds of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of pocket gophers, while the so-called fairy circles of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.|$|E
50|$|The West African giraffe survive {{primarily}} {{on a diet}} of leaves from Acacia albida and Hyphaene thebaica as well as Annona senegalensis, Parinari macrophylla, Piliostigma reticulatum, and Balanites aegyptiaca. In the late 1990s, an anti-desertification project for the area around Niamey encouraged the development of woodcutting businesses. An unintended effect of this was the destruction of much <b>Tiger</b> <b>bush</b> and giraffe habitat within the region. The Nigerian government has since moved to limit woodcutting in the area.|$|E
50|$|ASGN and its {{partners}} have assisted the local community with bore holes, cereal banks, grain mills, seeds and fertilizer {{to encourage them to}} protect the giraffes, which can be destructive to crops.However, the population of giraffes is threatened by loss of its habitat, the <b>tiger</b> <b>bush,</b> which is gradually being cleared for agriculture.The African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) partners with the ASGN in conservation efforts.The AWF is helping with reforestation.In August 2010, a tree nursery in Kouré produced about 3,500 seedlings. AWF planned to establish another nursery in the area in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternating}} pattern {{arises from the}} interplay of hydrological, ecological, and erosional phenomena. In the regions where <b>tiger</b> <b>bush</b> is present, plant growth is water-limited - the shortage of rainfall prevents vegetation from covering the entire landscape. Instead, trees and shrubs are able to establish by either tapping soil moisture reserves laterally or by sending roots to deeper, wetter soil depths. By a combination of plant litter, root macropores, and increased surface roughness, infiltration into the soil {{around the base of}} these plants is enhanced. Surface runoff arriving at these plants will thus likely to become run-on, and infiltrate into the soil.|$|E
50|$|Kouré is {{best known}} for West African giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta), an endemic {{subspecies}} of West Africa.The population of giraffes in Niger reached a low of 50 animals 1984, but according to the Association to Safeguard Giraffes in Niger (ASGN) there are now 170 of them. ASGN and its partners have assisted the local community with bore holes, cereal banks, grain mills, seeds and fertilizer to encourage them to protect the giraffes, which can be destructive to crops.However, the population of giraffes is threatened by loss of the <b>tiger</b> <b>bush</b> habitat, which is gradually being cleared for agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Yet another {{theory is}} that heuweltjies are caused by {{differential}} erosion in places where the availability of water limits the growth of vegetation, creating natural patterns such as <b>tiger</b> <b>bush.</b> In favour of this theory, Michael Cramer and his colleagues note that heuweltjies contain at least ten times more soil than any termite nests in South Africa, {{and that they can}} occur on bedrock, which termites could not be tunnelling through to move soil upwards. Further, the heuweltjies had the same spatial distribution as bush-clumps, patches of woody vegetation forming patterns. They suggest that heuweltjies formed from bush-clumps as these protected the soil from eroding away, producing calcrete hardpans.|$|E
