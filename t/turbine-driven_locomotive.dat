Initial operation was on the Union Railroad burning distillate fuel oil. Later, operation was on the Pittsburgh and Lake Eire Railroad using residual oil fuel.|$|E
50|$|Since Zoelly was {{convinced}} of {{the superiority of the}} steam turbine to the steam piston engine, in 1913 Escher Wyss abandoned the production of steam engines and concentrated fully on turbines. Zoelly's vision also extended to steam locomotives (which traditionally used piston engines) using steam turbines as drive. Until his resignation from Escher-Wyss Zoelly devoted himself {{to the development of a}} steam <b>turbine-driven</b> <b>locomotive,</b> which he drove forward to serviceability (1926 Zoelly- SLM), and later in 1930 Krupp Zoelly). Since diesel and electric power was increasing, the steam locomotive lost its significance.|$|E
