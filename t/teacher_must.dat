At the same time, he employed the latest European and American pedagogical methods. The theories of the American educator John Dewey especially influenced him. Kanō's manner had the desired effect upon the students, but the administration was slower to warm to his methods {{and it was not}} until the arrival of a new principal that Kanō's ideas found acceptance.|$|E

25|$|Teachers {{meet with}} needs based groups which are created {{based on the}} {{feedback}} from formative assessment with the aim being for students to progress toward completing the outcome or skill independently. Formative assessments are planned in accordance with specific outcomes, which {{make it easier for}} teachers to group students. Groups may change frequently and are not static groups for the entire school year. Student groups change throughout the year based on assessed performance and not on teacher perceived ability. Each group has a purpose and the teacher plans instructional lessons based on the common needs of the group. Guided instruction gives the teacher an opportunity to differentiated instruction small group instruction, vary the level of prompting and also vary the end product. The <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> be flexible since the instructional goal of the group may change throughout the sessions.|$|E

25|$|To {{obtain a}} Professional certificate, the {{applicant}} must have completed a NYS-approved {{teacher education program}} at a college/university and hold a master's degree or above. Each state has different requirements to become a permanently certified teacher, and the requirements keep increasing. For example, professional certification in NYS requires three years of classroom teaching experience. It also requires being mentored by a certified teacher within the first year teaching. However NYS no longer offers permanent certification to those who haven't already been certified by February 2004.The Professional certificate replaces it. To maintain a professional certificate, a <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school. One {{does not have to}} teach in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.|$|E

2500|$|An {{article in}} American Psychologist [...] sums up Milgram's {{obedience}} experiments: In Milgram's basic paradigm, a subject {{walks into a}} laboratory believing that s/he {{is about to take}} part in a study of memory and learning. [...] After being assigned the role of a teacher, the subject is asked to teach word associations to a fellow subject (who in reality is a collaborator of the experimenter). The teaching method, however, is unconventional—administering increasingly higher electric shocks to the learner. Once the presumed shock level reaches a certain point, the subject is thrown into a conflict. On the one hand, the strapped learner demands to be set free, he appears to suffer pain, and going all the way may pose a risk to his health. On the other hand, the experimenter, if asked, insists that the experiment is not as unhealthy as it appears to be, and that the <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> go on. In sharp contrast to the expectations of professionals and laymen alike, some 65% of all subjects continue to administer shocks up to the very highest levels.More recent tests of the experiment have found that it only works under certain conditions; in particular, when participants believe the results are necessary for the [...] "good of science".|$|E

60|$|Simultaneous recitation, {{by which}} I mean the {{practice}} of addressing a question to all the class, to be answered by all together, is a practice, which has been for some years rapidly extending in our schools, and, if adopted with proper limits and restrictions, is attended with great advantage.

60|$|The {{reader will}} {{understand}} that the object of such measures is, simply to secure as large a majority as possible, to make voluntary efforts to observe the rule. I do not expect that by such measures, universal obedience can be exacted.

Upon this subject, however, I shall speak more particularly at a future time.|$|E
60|$|The business, therefore, of a {{thorough}} {{examination of the}} class must not be omitted.

A great deal of ingenuity may be exercised, in contriving means for effecting this object, in the shortest possible time.

Approximation to excellence is all that we can expect; for unprincipled and deceiving characters will perhaps always be found, and no system whatever can prevent their existence. Proper treatment may indeed be the means of their reformation, but before this process has arrived at a successful result, others similar in character will have entered, so that the teacher can never expect perfection in the operation of any of his plans.|$|E
