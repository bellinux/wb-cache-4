30|$|We cannot {{assume that}} the {{ecosystem}} in this study will have any specific responses <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> since previous studies show rather arbitrary or complex effects from trampling on vascular plants and there are few studies on bryophytes and lichen. However, since alpine heath ecosystem might be vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>trampling</b> in general, but in particular {{those who have a}} high proportion of bryophytes and lichens that are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>trampling,</b> it would seem likely to assume that proximity to trail could induce decreases of the vegetative cover, species richness and diversity of the canopy and understory.|$|R
