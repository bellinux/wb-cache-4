One current technique, Mercury bougienage, uses a tapered rubber rod filled with Mercury. The Mercury falls because of gravity, inducing an outward pressure on the esophagus. Two main problems with this procedure are the large longitudinal forces involved and the dependence upon the "feel" of the physician in applying the force. As a result, there is 'an uncertain risk of tissue perforation under this treatment. Other procedures have met with limited success and are difficult to apply to narrow or tortuous strictures. My design, developed with Carr Everbach, involves the use of a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>braid</b> that expands radially when compressed and becomes narrow when stretched. Using a screw with left and right-handed threads, two sleeves were constructed so that they could slide up and down the screw. The sleeves are attached to each end of the braid. To test the device, an apparatus was built that applies an internal pressure to a latex tube, causing it to expand. The expansion was measured with a column of water and the pressure was recorded with a pressure transducer. Preliminary mechanical tests indicate that the device will exert forces necessary for esophageal dilation. Testing of the braid shows that the radial force varies linearly with the diameter of the braid. If the radial force is monitored by a control system, the device should allow for greater sensitivity of forces applied, resulting in more effective dilation...|$|R

For this purpose, samples were exposed to 90 C, 120 C, 150 C, and 180 C (below and above the glass transition tem-perature of the matrix resin) for various periods of time up to 13 days. The flexural properties combining with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), weight loss, scanning electron micro-scope (SEM), and optical microscope analyses were performed on the unaged and aged samples. The results revealed that the thermo-oxidative behavior of the braided composite was {{significantly different from the}} neat resin. The flexural strength of the neat resin decreased dramatically due to the oxidation degradation of the sample surface when the aging temperature was equal to its glass transition temperature. The extensive degradations of both the matrix and the fiber/ matrix interface, especially for the interface, were responsible for the significant decrease in flexural strength of the braided composite. The flexural strength retention rates of the braided composite were higher than that of the neat resin after exposure to 90 C, 120 C and 150 C because the integral structure of the braided composite can make the fiber bear flexural force together although the matrix resin and the fiber/matrix interface had a certain degree of damage after longtime thermo-oxidative aging...|$|R

Influences of fiber volume fractions and interior braiding angles on the effective thermal conductivities of 3 D four-directional braided composites were then studied. The results show that a larger fiber volume fraction leads to a larger effective thermal conductivity along the transverse and longitudinal directions; a larger interior braiding angle brings a larger transverse thermal conductivity but a smaller one along the longitudinal direction.

My research interest focuses on the exploration of new aesthetics within cloth investigating the visual effects of movement using light as a continuous, time-based medium. The exhibited artefacts use PMMA optical fibre technology in braided structures, activated by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and using a microcontroller as an interface to realize novel, light-emitting textiles. Rhythm exercise {{is a part of the}} research for my doctoral thesis which investigates the following research question: What does it mean, if time and change – constant movement – become part of the textile design expression? The research question has been investigated in a number of experiments which explore the visual effects of movement by using light integrated into textile structures as a medium. Thereby, the textile design pattern reveals its composition, not in one moment of time any more, but in fact over time. My practice based research work aims to create time-based textiles with an emphasis on developing aesthetics of movement – or to establish movement as an aesthetic moment in textile design. (Jansen, 2013) ContextWith the beginning of the era of Smart Textiles, the textile designer is challenged with a range of materials which are characterized by their ability to change expressional and functional properties. These materials respond to environmental stimuli, user interaction and pre-programmed parameters and visualize their responses to the viewer. They open up opportunities to explore new material behaviours and designing with novel and complex aesthetics (Berzina, 2011, Krogh, N. D., Layne, N. D., Taylor, 2010, Wingfield, N. D.). The availability of these new materials changes the conditions of conventional textile design; a textile pattern expression is no longer static, it once had one face, one gestalt or expression, whereas now it can show different expressions, a definite or indefinite number of times. (Jansen, 2013, page 7) InstallationRhythm exercise is an installation based on eight braided structures, displayed in three steel frames. The current exhibition displays parts of this installation. The <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>braided</b> artefacts are each based on thirteen lengths of optical fibres. They are lit by LEDs and programmed to create moving patterns of white light using a microcontroller digital interface. They have been designed to show different qualities of lighting interplay using varying rhythms and speeds. The different braids are created in identical braiding structures and with equal amount of lengths of optical fibres, thirteen per braid. The braided structures have, however, been connected to different numbers of LEDs; braid one has been connected to one light source, braids two to five have been connected to two light sources per braid and, finally, braids six to eight to thirteen light sources per braid. This allows displaying an increasing complexity of moving light patterns inside the braided structures.
