5|$|Initially part of squadrons {{cruising}} off the French coast, {{she played}} {{an important part in}} the Action of 23 April 1794, capturing the French frigate Engageante, and at a later engagement, where she helped to capture the French frigate Virginie. From 1797 until the early 19th century she had especial success against privateers, capturing a large number in the West Indies and in the Atlantic. She had a narrow escape from a superior French force in 1801, but was able <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> her pursuer, the 40-gun Bravoure into submission. She was prevented from capturing her by the arrival of French reinforcements. Her last years were spent on a variety of stations, including at the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies. Laid up in 1807, she was sold for breaking up in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos {{found himself}} {{isolated}} with his tagmata and the Kurds {{on the hill}} of Anzen. The Arabs proceeded to surround the hill, but the Byzantines were saved by a sudden rain, which loosened the strings of the Turkish bows, rendering them useless. Afshin then sent for catapults to be brought up <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> the Byzantine position. At the same time, Theophilos's officers, afraid of treachery by the Kurdish troops, persuaded him to withdraw. Breaking through the Arab lines and suffering many wounds in the process (the sources variously credit Manuel, who was severely wounded and possibly died soon after, and Theophobos for saving the Emperor), Theophilos and his small escort managed to reach safety at Chiliokomon, where he gradually re-assembled the remnants of his army.|$|E

5|$|Further {{disturbances}} {{took place}} during the troubled reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1567), and its aftermath. In 1558 the Protestant Lords of the Congregation marched on Edinburgh against the Catholic French Regent, Mary of Guise, and were able {{to take control of the}} town without difficulty, despite the guards posted at the city gate. Following the forced abdication of Queen Mary, Scotland's nobility was divided between her supporters, and those of the infant King James VI, represented by a series of regents. Edinburgh was held for the Queen by William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and in May 1571 the town was besieged by the Regent's forces under James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. Repairs were made to the walls, and the Netherbow was barricaded. Nearby houses were pulled down to improve defences, and the siege gun Mons Meg was employed <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> houses outside the wall which were being used by snipers. Unable to make any headway, the besiegers withdrew on 20 May.|$|E

On 5 December, she left the area for Pearl Harbor, where she prepared for the next attack, against the Marshall Islands. On 31 January 1944, Idaho {{and the rest of the}} fleet arrived off Kwajalein to begin the preparatory bombardment. She continued <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> Japanese forces until 5 February, by which time the Marines had wrested control of the small island from its Japanese garrison. Idaho replenished fuel and ammunition at Majuro before returning to shell Japanese positions on other islands in the Marshalls before steaming to Kavieng, New Ireland to conduct a diversionary bombardment on 20 March.|$|E

25|$|She {{faced the}} issue of succession. At the time she took the throne, she created Li Dan, the former Emperor Ruizong, crown prince, and {{bestowed}} the name of Wu on him. The official Zhang Jiafu, however, convinced the commoner Wang Qingzhi (王慶之) to start a petition drive to make her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince, arguing that an emperor named Wu should pass the throne {{to a member of}} the Wu clan. Wu Zetian was tempted to do so, and when the chancellors Cen Changqian and Ge Fuyuan opposed sternly, they, along with fellow chancellor Ouyang Tong, were executed. Nevertheless, she declined Wang's request to make Wu Chengsi crown prince, but for a time allowed Wang to freely enter the palace to see her. On one occasion, however, when Wang angered her by coming to the palace too much, she asked the official Li Zhaode <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> Wang—and Li Zhaode took the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> Wang to death, and his group of petitioners scattered. Li Zhaode then persuaded Wu Zetian to keep Li Dan as crown prince—pointing out that a son was closer in relations than a nephew, and also that if Wu Chengsi became emperor, Emperor Gaozong would never again be worshiped. Wu Zetian agreed, and for some time did not reconsider the matter. Further, at Li Zhaode's warning that Wu Chengsi was becoming too powerful, Wu Zetian stripped Wu Chengsi of his chancellor authority and bestowed on him largely honorific titles without authority.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914 the Fort de Suarlée was {{under the command of}} Captain-Commandant Moisse, with about 400 artillerymen and 80 {{fortress}} troops.

The Germans did not bother with infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Liège, at a heavy cost, preferring <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. On the 24th the fort was hit by about 1500 heavy projectiles, causing significant damage. On the 25th Suarlée was hit from the rear by another 1500 210mm, 305mm and 420mm shells, nearly destroying the fort and resulting in its surrender that day.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine women's {{responses}} <b>to</b> <b>battering</b> within the context of Chinese culture. The stories of 11 Chinese women living in Hong Kong formed the basis of the inquiry. Analysis of the women's accounts revealed Chinese values in their responses to battering: they adopted ren, or endurance, as a coping mechanism and used yuan, or predestination, as an explanation for their failed relationship. The resilience and resourcefulness of the women are clearly demonstrated in the strategies they employed to cope with the abuse. Their responses <b>to</b> <b>battering</b> were purposeful and varied according to the status of their relationship. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The Germans did not bother with infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Liège, at a heavy cost, preferring <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. Telephone contact with the outside was lost on 23 August, the same day that the infantry in the intervals between the forts were withdrawn. The fort repelled an infantry attack early on the 24th, but took heavy German fire from 1530 to 1945. At 2100 the garrison surrendered, while the Germans continued to fire around them to prevent their escape.|$|E
25|$|With the {{completion}} of the assault ramp, Vespasian ordered a battering ram brought up against the wall. Various stratagems were used by the defenders against the ram, including lowering sacks filled with chaff to receive its blows (until these were torn away by the Romans) and sallying forth and setting fire to the ram. Josephus also chronicles an incident in which one of the defenders, renowned for his strength, cast a huge stone on the ram from above, breaking off its head. Nevertheless, the attempts <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> down the wall continued. When Vespasian himself was wounded by a defender's dart, the Romans were so incensed that they continued their bombardment of the wall throughout the night. By morning a breach had been created and the Romans were ready to assault the walls. The besieged, however, charged through the breach, and when the Roman attempted to scale the walls, scalding oil was poured down upon them from above and they were beaten back.|$|E
25|$|The troops {{then set}} about filling the ditch {{protecting}} {{the northern part}} of the Temple enclosure and building two ramparts, one next to the Baris and the other on the west, while the defenders, from their superior position, sought to hinder Roman efforts. When the banks were complete, Pompey erected siege towers and brought up siege engines and battering rams from Tyre. Under the protection of slingers driving the defenders from the walls, these began <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> the walls surrounding the Temple. After three months, Pompey's troops finally managed to overthrow one of the Baris' towers and were able to enter the Temple precinct, both from the citadel and from the west. First over the wall was Faustus Cornelius Sulla, son of the former dictator and a senior officer in Pompey's army. He was followed by two centurions, Furius and Fabius, each leading a cohort, and the Romans soon overcame the defending Jews. 12,000 were slaughtered, while only a few Romans troops were killed.|$|E

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{various forms of}} artillery, the Macedonians possessed the ability to build an effective array of siege engines. Prominent {{in a number of}} sieges, including the epic Siege of Tyre (332 BC), were siege towers; these allowed men to approach and assault the enemy walls without being exposed to potentially withering missile fire. Equally, they meant that more men could be put on the walls in a shorter period of time, as simple ladders constrained the men attacking to moving up in single file, thus making the task of defending the walls far easier. These structures, which were wheeled and several stories high, were covered with wet hide or metal sheathing to protect from missile fire, especially incendiaries, and the largest might be equipped with artillery. The Macedonian army could also deploy various forms of suspended, metal-tipped, rams. Such rams were usually provided with a wheeled, roofed covering to protect their users from missile fire; they were employed <b>to</b> <b>batter</b> down gates or to dislodge masonry from walls and so cause a breach (this latter form was sometimes called a 'drill' rather than a ram).|$|E
