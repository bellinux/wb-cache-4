5|$|A {{month after}} Arbeideren went defunct, <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party gave {{its name to}} a new {{newspaper}}, which was set up as the new main newspaper of <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party in 1930. This new paper was based in Oslo as the replacement of Norges Kommunistblad, which had been liquidated as well. Olav Larssen and Evald Solbakken found a new outlet in Hamar Arbeiderblad, which {{had been set up}} as the new Hamar organ of the Labour Party in 1925. <b>The</b> <b>Communist</b> Party later tried to create a weekly newspaper in Hamar, Rød Front, but it was short-lived and existed only between 1932 and 1933. The Oslo version of Arbeideren went defunct in 1940, and many years after that, the name was used from 1951 to 1953 for a third newspaper, published in Brumunddal, not far from Hamar city.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{struggle}} which threatened to ruin <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> League, Marx's opinion prevailed {{and eventually the}} Willich/Schapper group left <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party {{seized power}} in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city {{became part of}} the Eastern Bloc. The city annexed new land, and the {{population}} rose significantly, becoming 90% Slovak. Large residential areas consisting of high-rise prefabricated panel buildings, such as those in the Petržalka borough, were built. <b>The</b> <b>Communist</b> government also built several new grandiose buildings, such as the Most Slovenského národného povstania bridge and the Slovak Radio headquarters.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>communist</b> {{revolution}} in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union was worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|Even if <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> {{were able}} {{to take control of the}} Japanese-occupied territories, this would still be {{beneficial}} to Chiang. <b>The</b> <b>communists</b> were strong enough to greatly reduce the strength of the warlords; at the same time <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> would be weakened by the fighting, making it easier for the Kuomintang to prevail.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, some stayed {{hidden in}} the jungles with <b>the</b> <b>communists,</b> and when Chin Peng and {{remnants}} of <b>the</b> Malayan <b>Communist</b> Party ended their struggle in 1989, two former Japanese soldiers emerged from the jungle with <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> and surrendered.|$|R

5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both joined <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party. In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party. A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party, and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the party at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër Fortress {{dominates the}} town and overlooks the {{strategically}} important route along the river valley. It is open to visitors and contains a military museum featuring captured artillery and memorabilia of <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> resistance against German occupation, {{as well as a}} captured United States Air Force plane, to commemorate <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> regime's struggle against the imperialist powers. Additions were built during the 19th and 20th centuries by Ali Pasha of Ioannina and the government of King Zog I of Albania. Today it possesses five towers and houses a clock tower, a church, water fountains, horse stables, and many more amenities. The northern part of the castle was turned into a prison by Zog's government and housed political prisoners during <b>the</b> <b>communist</b> regime.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the political unrest in Saigon, <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> leadership in North Vietnam were far {{more concerned about the}} best strategy to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland, different factions within <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party disagreed on the best method to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co-existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their differences of opinion, <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the military regime in Saigon was able to hold out because <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military.|$|E
50|$|Following <b>the</b> elections, <b>Communist</b> leader Klement Gottwald {{formed a}} {{coalition}} government. However, <b>the</b> <b>Communists</b> gradually tightened their {{grip on the}} country. After the non-Communist members resigned from the Cabinet on 25 February 1948, <b>the</b> <b>Communists</b> seized full control of the country.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, Rákosi and <b>the</b> <b>Communists</b> {{appeared}} {{willing to}} work within the system. From 1947 onward, however, he and <b>the</b> <b>Communists</b> began pressuring <b>the</b> other parties to push out those not {{willing to work}} with <b>the</b> <b>Communists</b> on <b>the</b> grounds that they were [...] "fascists" [...] or fascist sympathizers. Later on, after <b>the</b> <b>Communists</b> won complete control, Rákosi referred to this practice as [...] "salami tactics," [...] saying he destroyed the non-Communist forces in the country by [...] "cutting them off like slices of salami." ...|$|R
50|$|The Polish {{legislative}} elections, 1947 were rigged by <b>the</b> <b>communists,</b> {{who previously}} conducted the Polish people's referendum of 1946. The unchallenged rule of <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> that followed, combined with extensive repressions and persecution, forced many opposition leaders {{to leave the}} country. The new Sejm, which replaced the KRN, was totally dominated by <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> and their allies.|$|R
5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed {{because the}} other parties abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, in which <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the Labour Party {{broke out of}} the Comintern. Subsequently <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party {{broke away from the}} Labour Party. The local chapter of the Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reaction}} within <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Bloc was mixed. Hungary's János Kádár {{was highly}} supportive of Dubček's appointment in January, but Leonid Brezhnev and others grew concerned about Dubček's reforms, which they feared might weaken {{the position of}} <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Bloc during the Cold War.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>communists</b> {{launched}} a second insurrection in 1968. This second emergency ended in 1978, when the remaining MCP insurgents fled to Thailand. However, <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> continued {{to press for}} negotiations, proposing a [...] "Democratic Coalition Government" [...] with the Malaysian government. Too cautioned the government against paying this offer any heed, as <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> had nothing to bargain with.|$|R
50|$|After those former nationalist-turned Japanese puppet regime {{force had}} rejoined the nationalists {{after the end}} of World War II, they refused to {{surrender}} to <b>the</b> <b>communists,</b> <b>the</b> only Chinese force in the region according to Chiang Kai-shek’s order. This had obvious lead to numerous clashes with <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> and <b>the</b> local population that strongly supported <b>the</b> <b>communists,</b> and eventually <b>the</b> full scale battle between the two sides erupted in December 1945.|$|R
5000|$|Marx also {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>Communists</b> {{as separate}} from the oppressed proletariat. <b>The</b> <b>Communists</b> were to be a unifying party among the proletariat; they were educated revolutionaries who could bring the proletariat to revolution and help them establish the democratic dictatorship of <b>the</b> proletariat. <b>The</b> <b>Communists,</b> according to Marx, would support any true revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Communists</b> aide <b>the</b> proletariat in creating the inevitable classless society (Vladimir Lenin takes this concept a step further by stating that only [...] "professional revolutionaries" [...] can lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie).|$|R

5|$|Mary Docherty (27 April 1908 – 2 February 2000) was {{an activist}} {{and member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party of Great Britain. Born to a working-class family in Cowdenbeath, Scotland, she was {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>communist</b> beliefs of her father, a miner, {{as well as by}} the poverty she grew up in. She joined <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party at the age of 18, and in 1929 traveled to the Soviet Union as a Scottish delegate to a gathering of young communists. She founded a local children's wing of <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> Party, carried out a successful agitation to declare 1 May a school holiday, and worked for communist Member of Parliament Willie Gallacher. She retired from active politics at the age of 60, but continued to give talks and write her memoirs, published in 1991 as A Miner's Lass.|$|E
50|$|Like similar clashes {{following}} World War II between <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> and <b>the</b> nationalists in China, the Xinghua Campaign {{stemmed from}} Chiang Kai-shek's realization that his nationalist regime had neither sufficient troops nor adequate transportation {{to move his}} army into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Chiang feared that <b>the</b> <b>communists,</b> who already dominated much of rural China, would further expand their territories by being the first Chinese faction to accept the official Japanese surrender, thus adding the regions occupied by Japan to the area controlled by <b>the</b> <b>communists.</b> Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their wartime puppet regime not to surrender to <b>the</b> <b>communists,</b> and furthermore to quell unrest and fight off <b>the</b> <b>communists</b> until <b>the</b> eventual arrival of the nationalist troops.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>communists,</b> {{strong in}} <b>the</b> poor province, {{attempted}} {{to appeal to}} the Ukrainian element by espousing union with Soviet Ukraine.
