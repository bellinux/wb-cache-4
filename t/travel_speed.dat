40|$|AbstractIn urban areas, {{logistic}} transportation operations often {{run into}} problems because <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> change, {{depending on the}} current traffic situation. If not accounted for, time-dependent and stochastic <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> frequently lead to missed time windows and thus poorer service. Especially {{in the case of}} passenger transportation, it often leads to excessive passenger ride times as well. Therefore, time-dependent and stochastic influences on <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> are relevant for finding feasible and reliable solutions. This study considers the effect of exploiting statistical information available about historical accidents, using stochastic solution approaches for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem (dynamic DARP). The authors propose two pairs of metaheuristic solution approaches, each consisting of a deterministic method (average time-dependent <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> for planning) and its corresponding stochastic version (exploiting stochastic information while planning). The results, using test instances with up to 762 requests based on a real-world road network, show that in certain conditions, exploiting stochastic information about <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> leads to significant improvements over deterministic approaches...|$|R

The expressway, combined with the existing Lincoln Alexander Parkway, completes an express bypass south of Hamilton's urban core.

Supporters argued that the portion of Highway403 running through Hamilton, {{also known as the}} Chedoke Expressway, had limited expansion capacity due to its older design, as well as its winding and hilly nature that reduced <b>travel</b> <b>speed.</b> The 1990s reconstruction of the Freeman Interchange (QEW-403-407) from its original semi-directional T configuration to incorporate the extension of Highway407 had resulted in a lowered capacity for QEW to Highway403 traffic to bypass Hamilton traffic.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Among {{the main}} factors {{affecting}} road crash injuries, speed is {{considered as a}} leading cause and contributing factor. There are numerous studies linking <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> and road crashes. Hence, {{an essential part of}} road safety plans and interventions is devoted to speed management. However, to manage <b>speed,</b> actual <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> have to be systematically and consistently monitored and analyzed. In this study, a system for the collection and analysis of free-flow <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> on the road network is presented, enabling speed monitoring at the nationwide level. The paper focuses on the collection and analysis of <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> on different road sections. Using the information gathered through advanced technologies combined with geographical information systems, a comprehensive speed database in space and time is provided allowing visual presentation and comparison of the results.

40|$|AbstractRoad design {{characteristics}} should {{deliver a}} clear message to drivers on the appropriate speeds. This approach is known in the literature as “self-explaining roads” (SER). In Israel, new guidelines for setting speeds on the road network were introduced aiming at a balance between the target and actual <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> on various road types and, thus, supporting the SER concept. However, engineering tools are needed to implement the new approach. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the relationship between <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> and road infrastructure characteristics, on single-carriageway roads, aiming to identify the features influencing the travel speeds’ selection by Israeli drivers. Statistical relations between road characteristics and speed indicators were explored using multivariate classification methods and regression models. The design speeds were reconstructed based on the infrastructure characteristics, and analyzed in relation to the <b>travel</b> <b>speeds.</b> Among the road characteristics most influencing the <b>travel</b> <b>speeds</b> were found: shoulder width and the recovery-zone width, where lower values of both characteristics were associated with lower speeds; junction density and road curvature, where higher presence of these characteristics had a moderating effect on speeds. It was concluded that changing shoulder width, recovery-zone width or junction density may be applied for promoting the SER concept and may affect <b>travel</b> <b>speeds,</b> yet a fine-tuning of existing design guidelines is required...|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that an {{interstellar}} mission that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate). On the other hand, Andrew Kennedy has shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the rate of <b>travel</b> <b>speed</b> derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now. Voyages undertaken before the minimum will be overtaken by those who leave at the minimum, whereas those who leave after the minimum will never overtake those who left at the minimum.|$|E
25|$|The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) {{defines a}} {{singularity}} as “a condition {{caused by the}} collinear alignment {{of two or more}} robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.” It is most common in robot arms that utilize a “triple-roll wrist”. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot’s wrist (i.e. robot's axes 4 and 6) to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. Another common term for this singularity is a “wrist flip”. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robot’s path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robot’s <b>travel</b> <b>speed,</b> thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.|$|E
