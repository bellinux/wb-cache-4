5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great <b>torquing</b> of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, <b>torquing</b> the bolt to the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.|$|E
25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by <b>torquing</b> a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E

The preloads for the unlubricated bolt sample had a standard deviation from the mean value of 1100lbf, whereas the lubricated sample had a standard deviation of 680lbf. If the preload value and torques are used in the above relation to solve for the nut factor it is found to be K = 0.208, which is very close to the recommended value of 0.20 ...|$|E
2500|$|Bolt preload {{can also}} be {{controlled}} by <b>torquing</b> the bolt {{to the point of}} yielding. Under some circumstances, a skilled operator can feel the drop off of the work required to turn the torque wrench as the material of the bolt begins to yield. At that point the bolt has a preload determined by the bolt area and the [...] yield strength of the bolt material. This technique can be more accurately executed by specially built machines. Because this method only works for very high preloads and requires comparatively expensive tooling, it is only commonly used for specific applications, primarily in high performance engines.|$|E

40|$|At {{the present}} time, both control and {{estimation}} accuracies of engine <b>torque</b> are causes for under-achieving optimal drivability {{and performance in}} today’s production vehicles. The major focus in this area has been to enhance <b>torque</b> estimation and control accuracies using existing open-loop <b>torque</b> control and estimation structures. Such an approach does not guarantee optimum <b>torque</b> tracking accuracy and optimum estimation accuracy due to air flow and efficiencies estimations errors. Furthermore, current approach overlooks the fast <b>torque</b> path tracking which {{does not have any}} related feedback. Recently, explicit <b>torque</b> feedback control has been proposed in the literature using either estimated or measured <b>torques</b> as feedback to control the <b>torque</b> using the slow <b>torque</b> path only. I propose the usage of a surface acoustic wave <b>torque</b> sensor and in-cylinder pressure sensor to measure the engine brake and indicated <b>torques</b> respectively and feedback the signals to control the <b>torques</b> using both the fast and slow <b>torque</b> paths utilizing an inner-outer loop control structure.

50|$|Heat {{setting is}} a term used in the textile {{industry}} to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, heat setting {{is also used to}} improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased <b>torquing</b> just after spinning, cabling or twisting. Heat setting can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable <b>torquing.</b> At the winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, an increased tendency to <b>torquing</b> can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using heat setting for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the diminishing of <b>torquing</b> but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the heat setting process. Heat setting benefits staple yarns as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. Heat setting often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as “bulk development”. All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as heat setting. The term “thermal fixation” is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called “heat setting”.|$|E
