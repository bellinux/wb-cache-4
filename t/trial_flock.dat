40|$|A {{study of}} wool fibre {{intrinsic}} material strength (IMS) variation {{in relation to}} staple strength was performed. Fleece wools of varying midside staple strength were generated in a pen-feeding trial in which four groups of non-pregnant Romney ewes were placed on differential nutritional levels over winter. Two principal sources of staple strength variation were identified in the trial; 1 / a variation in mean staple strength between the four nutritional groups and 2 / variation in mean staple strength between sheep within the groups. The variation in staple strength between nutritional groups was determined largely by the level of wool fibre cross-sectional area reduction undergone by the groups. No significant variation in wool fibre IMS occurred between groups. The between-sheep within-group differences in staple strength {{were found to be}} unrelated to fibre cross-sectional area change and also could not be wholly explained by variation in winter wool growth efficiency between sheep. However, large differences in IMS occurred between sheep. This variation in IMS was strongly correlated with the variation of midside staple strength between sheep within the groups. In a systematic analysis {{it was found that the}} sheep-to-sheep differences were the most important source of IMS variability within the <b>trial</b> <b>flock.</b> Only small variations in IMS were found between nutritional groups, between fleece body-sites within sheep, with fibre diameter, with fibre ellipticity, or with fibre break-type. No significant change in fibre IMS occurred within the "break" region of staples with low tensile strength. The between-sheep variation in IMS and its role in determining staple strength may resolve the longstanding controversy on the origin and nature of so-called "tender" and "sound" wools...|$|E

Broilers were housed in environmental chambers with continuously measured gas concentrations and airflows. Ross 308 male broilers were allocated to one of the chambers at hatch and grown for 42 days. Three sequential <b>trials</b> (<b>flocks)</b> were done to determine the impact of build-up litter. Broilers on the C treatment were fed based on a four phase feeding program: starter (St), grower (Gr), finisher (Fn), and withdrawal (Wd) diets. Broilers on the LP treatment were fed based on a six phase feeding program: prestarter (PreSt), St, Gr 1, Gr 2, Fn, and Wd diets. Formulated protein concentrations were 22. 1, 20, 17. 2, and 16. 6 % for the C St, Gr, Fn, and Wd diets, respectively while those for the LP PreSt, St, Gr 1, Gr 2, Fn, and Wd diets wer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} a {{competitive}} exclusion (CE) product, Broilact, on Salmonella contamination of broiler chickens was studied on the farm and at the processing plant. In {{the first part of}} the study, two flocks per week, a CE-treated and an untreated control flock, were placed in similar broiler houses. The CE treatment was administered in the hatchery using a modified spray vaccination cabinet. Salmonella was analyzed from the paper pads of the transport boxes on arrival at the farm and from fecal samples taken 2 wk before slaughter. The results of Salmonella sampling were received for 67 flocks. The other 141 flocks of the company that were reared during the trial period were also sampled for Salmonella and the results were compared to those of treatment and control groups. Broiler performance, including mortality, weight, and feed conversion, was recorded for the <b>trial</b> <b>flocks.</b> In the second part of the study, Salmonella contamination of neck skin samples taken at the processing plant from 18 CE-treated and 28 control flocks was compared. The Broilact-treatment significantly reduced Salmonella con-tamination both on the farm and at the processing plant. At the level of the farm, the percentage of Salmonella-positive flocks was essentially the same in the control flocks and in other flocks reared during the trial period. An improvement in broiler performance was indicated, although the difference was not significant...|$|R
40|$|Conflicts {{with human}} {{interests}} have reappeared following recovery of large carnivores in Europe. Public acceptance {{is higher than}} historically {{but there is a}} need to identify effective, acceptable techniques to facilitate coexistence. We present a case study of predation on livestock in Slovakia. Damage, mitigation measures and public opinion were assessed using compensation records, analysis of farm conditions, questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, diet analysis and on-farm trials of livestock-guarding dogs. Economic damage was inconsequential on a national scale but high locally: c. 80 % of reported losses occurred at 12 % of sheep flocks. Grey wolves Canis lupus were held responsible for four to six times more damage than brown bears Ursus arctos, although livestock occurred in only 2 of 78 wolf faeces during spring-autumn, when sheep and cattle were most vulnerable. Losses to Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx were negligible. Compared to other sectors of society shepherds had the most negative attitudes, particularly towards wolves, despite compensation payments. Appropriate use of livestock-guarding dogs was associated with fewer losses: median loss at <b>trial</b> <b>flocks</b> with predation was 70 % lower than at control flocks. We conclude that identifying vulnerable farms and targeting them for mitigation could reduce damage, although lack of motivation and awareness are obstacles. This study shows that damage levels need not be excessive despite high predator densities in human-dominated landscapes. Conflicts were unevenly distributed, with much of the variation explained by local conditions and husbandry practices, especially preventive measures. Livestock-guarding dogs are particularly appropriate where wolves are present in proximity to unfenced pastures. © 2011 Fauna and Flora International...|$|R
50|$|After her PhD, Price {{joined the}} Cornell Duck Research Laboratory, {{where she worked}} from 1959 to 1977, {{teaching}} at Long Island University, where she became an adjunct professor. She worked on developing a vaccine, undertaking <b>trials</b> of mixed <b>flocks</b> of vaccinated and unvaccinated ducklings, working every day, and conducting daily autopsies. In 1964, Ebony magazine featured Price and her work in an extensive photo-essay describing and showing her work on vaccine development, in the Duck Research Laboratory and on the farm. Price describes the heavy workload, made more onerous by the four-mile distance between the laboratory and farm where the flocks of ducklings were managed.|$|R

50|$|However, {{support among}} the {{population}} began to fade as people increasingly realized that everybody was at risk of ending up on the pyre. Peasants refused to supply wood for the burnings. The final straw came with the <b>trial</b> of Dorothea <b>Flock,</b> member of a well-off merchant family from Nuremberg. She was arrested in December 1629 and her husband did {{everything he could to}} obtain her release. An Imperial edict was issued by the Hofrat, but the witch hunters learned about its imminent delivery and executed Dorothea shortly before its arrival. This caused outrage among the leadership of the Catholic church in Germany, who held the bishop responsible. An investigation by the Hofrat prevented any further trials from being launched.|$|R
50|$|Hardened by the Franco-British {{wars and}} {{the trials of}} forced exile in the Great Deportation, these Acadians, disoriented and without guidance, dejected and stateless, lost little by little the moral {{underpinnings}} of their religion and adopted social manners alien to Christian custom. Sigogne revived his hard work of ?disposing of this can of worms. He was a dedicated man, at once severe and ?intransigent ?unshakeable, and with great generosity. His ministry was characterised by numerous incessant difficulties, and marked by serious disagreements which tormented others during {{the greater part of}} his life. Animated, however, by an ardent and ?uninterested ?unbiased zeal, this priece became ?unshakeable in recourse to all his personal resources for pursuing his apostolacy in conformance with the rules of the church and the ordinances of his bishop. In getting past these recalcitrant obstacles and the <b>trials</b> which his <b>flock</b> ?exposed him to, he gained admiration and respect, not only from his own people, but also, and above all, the English rulers of the province. He served devotedly and faithfully the Acadians for 45 years, as a providential pastor, a builder of churches and schools, as an educator and as a defender of civil rights.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the factors affecting the survivability of goat kids to weaning, in a small-scale communal grazing system. Goat kids are the most vulnerable component of communal goat flocks and increasing their survival could increase productivity. Some of the main factors which contributed towards kid survivability were evaluated and ranked and cost benefit analysis was done. Initially 20 farmers in Jericho District, North West Province, were subjected to a structured interview. The mean age of farmers was 68. 9 years and the mean number of does was 11. Thirteen farmers remained in the trial throughout and were visited once a month. The average number of does for farmers remained in the trial was 13. Body condition scores of does were estimated, kids were weighed, faecal samples were collected and the veld evaluated. Management and socio-economic aspects were observed and informal discussions were conducted with farmers. Goat housing was evaluated using a housing checklist. Monthly precipitation and temperature data were recorded. Survivability to weaning of 63 % of kids was recorded from the total number of kids born (131) from 170 does of the 13 farmers who remained in the <b>trial.</b> The <b>flocks</b> of goats examined were parasitised by Haemonchus contortus, Trichuris globulosa, Coccidia as well as Moniezia. Although faecal egg counts were relatively low, there was a significant correlation with kid mortalities. Three of the six goats submitted for necropsy also died of internal parasites. The species of ticks were Amblyoma, Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus spp. Lice species found were identified as Bovicola caprae, Bovicola limbatus and Linognathus africanus using scanning electron microscopy. Flea infestation was observed in three flocks, the flea species was identified as Ctenocephalides felis felis. Management was found to be suboptimal and in 92. 31 % of flocks, housing was inadequate. Build-up of faeces and poor drainage probably contributed to internal parasites. Other factors such as climate and feeding could not be correlated to kid mortalities. Cost benefit analysis suggested that strategic de-worming and improvement of hygiene and drainage in the housing would be the most affordable and effective way to reduce mortalities in kids.
