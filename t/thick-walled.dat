5|$|Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 2.5–3.4μm in diameter. They are <b>thick-walled</b> {{with a short}} pedicel (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented with tiny spines (verrucae) that are roughly {{equidistant}} from each other. Capillitial threads are long, hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4–4μm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises <b>thick-walled,</b> inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, <b>thick-walled</b> hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times as thick {{as those in the}} surrounding subcortex.|$|E
5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, <b>thick-walled</b> {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick {{secondary}} walls. The capillitial hyphae are 1.5–9.5µm wide, <b>thick-walled,</b> often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella hyphae are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), <b>thick-walled,</b> often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide hyphae with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial hyphae are densely interwoven, <b>thick-walled,</b> and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched hyphae with clamps. The peristome hyphae are <b>thick-walled,</b> 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled hyphae of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled hyphae {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has <b>thick-walled</b> hyphae 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped hyphae. <b>Thick-walled</b> hyphae are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of <b>thick-walled,</b> branched and densely interwoven hyphae (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E
5|$|Gloeopeniophorella: corticioid; surface almost smooth; hyphae without clamp connections; <b>thick-walled</b> cystidia (metuloids) and gloeocystidia present; spores with {{wrinkled}} (rugose) ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|Spores {{typically}} have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are <b>thick-walled,</b> hyaline or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8µm.|$|E
5|$|The spores of H.utriformis {{are roughly}} spherical, smooth, and <b>thick-walled,</b> {{with a single}} oil droplet. They have {{dimensions}} of 4.5–5.5µm.|$|E
5|$|Its spores are spherical, {{measuring}} 8–13µm, {{and have}} a surface of irregular, coarse warts. The capillitium refers to late-maturing, <b>thick-walled</b> cells in the gleba. The main axes of these branched cells are 20–30µm thick, and they are covered with numerous spines.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius: agaricoid or gasteroid; exuding latex*; caps {{sometimes}} zonate, viscose or glutinate, {{but never}} annulate; rarely <b>thick-walled</b> cells in cuticles of the cap (pileipellis) and the stipe (stipitipellis) and sphaerocytes in the gills.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus: agaricoid or pleurotoid; exuding latex*; caps never zonate, viscose or glutinate, but {{sometimes}} annulate; <b>thick-walled</b> cells in cap and stipe cuticles; often sphaerocytes in the gill trama.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white; spores are {{cylindrical}}, smooth, and measure 7–11 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club-shaped, and dimensions of 20–40 by 3–5μm. The hymenium features numerous hyphidia (modified terminal hyphae), which measure 2–3μm. The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis confragrosa is trimitic, meaning {{that there are}} three types of hyphae in the fruit body: skeletal hyphae, which provide structural support, are thick walled, measuring 3–7μm in diameter; generative hyphae, responsible for new growth, can be either thin- or <b>thick-walled,</b> may contain clamps, and measure 2–6μm; binding hyphae, <b>thick-walled</b> and much branched, are 2–5μm.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{variety of}} Boletellus ananas has {{consistently}} larger fruit bodies than B.ananas var. minor Singer from Brazil and Nicaragua, and lacks the <b>thick-walled</b> cheilocystidia of B.ananas var. crassotunicatus Singer from Nicaragua and Panama.|$|E
5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types, including <b>thick-walled</b> structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, {{but these are not}} reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are white. Spores are cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, and measure 9–12 by 3–3.5µm. Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of {{generative}} hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to <b>thick-walled,</b> frequently branched, and measure 2–10µm in diameter, while those of the pores are roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their walls that gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, and measure 7–9µm in diameter. They are cylindrical, thin-walled to moderately <b>thick-walled,</b> hyaline, have a septum at the base, and measure 60–120 by 5–10µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 25–35 by 6–7µm.|$|E
5|$|Spores of Hydnellum {{are almost}} spherical to oblong and tuberculate, and are brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are {{narrowly}} club-shaped and usually four-spored; {{there are no}} cystidia in Hydnellum. Three types of hyphae {{are found in the}} flesh of Hydnellum: generative hyphae (thin-walled, not inflated); skeletal hyphae (<b>thick-walled</b> and narrow); and thin-walled gloeoplerous-like hyphae, which stain with methyl blue.|$|E
5|$|The terete leaves readily {{distinguish}} Isopogon anethifolius {{from other}} members of the genus, which have flat leaves and are greater than 1mm (in) across. On a microscopic level, the supporting ground tissue of I.anethifolius differs from some of its genus by its irregular misshapen sclereids (<b>thick-walled</b> cells that make up part of the ground tissue) and contorted cell body.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thick-walled</b> spores {{are roughly}} spherical, rusty-brown, finely and densely warted, and have diameters of 5–6.5µm. Elaters are 50–80 by 4–6µm, and have ring-like or spiral thickenings. The endoperidium {{consists}} of densely interwoven hyphae that are 3–9µm {{in diameter and}} walls less than 1µm thick; they are septate, branched, pale yellow, with clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|In glomeromycetes (formerly zygomycetes), haploid hyphae of two {{individuals}} fuse, forming a gametangium, a specialized cell structure {{that becomes a}} fertile gamete-producing cell. The gametangium develops into a zygospore, a <b>thick-walled</b> spore formed by the union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{internal transcribed spacer}} DNA sequences shows that C.vinicolor groups in a clade with the closely related C.jamaicensis and C.pseudovinicolor. All of these species feature darkly-amyloid flesh and <b>thick-walled</b> cystidia. Based on this analysis, Miller considered C.jamaicensis to be insufficiently distinct genetically from C.vinicolor to warrant designation as a separate species; however, as of 2012, both MycoBank and Index Fungorum list it as a valid species.|$|E
5|$|Spore {{prints are}} purplish brown to {{chocolate}} brown. The smooth, <b>thick-walled</b> spores are broadly ellipsoidal, and typically measure 5.8–7.3 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, hyaline (translucent, and measure 20–21.3 by 5.8–7.0μm. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are sac-shaped to club-shaped, hyaline to pale yellowish brown in color, and have dimensions of 18.3–25.6 by 7.3–11.0μm; {{there are no}} cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia).|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical {{or nearly}} so, reddish-brown, <b>thick-walled</b> and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' {{dimensions}} are 7–11µm; the warts are about 1µm long. The spores are non-amyloid, {{and will not}} stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent. The use of scanning electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} spines are 0.90–1.45µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5–6.5µm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11–15 by 18–24µm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are <b>thick-walled,</b> long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3–5.5µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4–6μm in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6–8μm diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3–4μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3–6μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{spindle-shaped}} or elliptical, <b>thick-walled,</b> smooth, {{and have}} dimensions of 13–16 by 5.5–6.5μm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped (clavate), attached to 1 to 4 spores, and have dimensions of 35–90 by 9–12μm. The cystidia (sterile, non-spore-bearing cells found interspersed among the basidia) in the hymenium have dimensions of 33–60 by 8–12μm. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of B.pulcherrimus.|$|E
5|$|The spores are white, smooth, roughly elliptical, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 7–8.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 17–23 by 7.5–10μm, and four-spored with sterigmata around 3 μm long. The paraphyses are 5–8μm wide, {{shorter than the}} basidia, more abundant and form a somewhat gelatinous layer. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the cap edge) are 60 by 7–21μm, hyaline, conical or ventricose (inflated). The tips of the cheilocystidia are drawn out to a point, or have a short appendage measuring 15 by 2–3μm, which is sometimes branched, and is thin or slightly <b>thick-walled.</b> There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Pileocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of}} the cap) are club-shaped, measuring 25–60 by 13–25μm. They are somewhat <b>thick-walled,</b> and spiny on the exposed surface with short simple outgrowths extending up to 3μm long. The pileocystidia are joined together and form a continuous layer over the young cap, but break up as the cap expands. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are conical or lance-shaped, hyaline, and smooth, with walls that are thin or slightly thickened. They measure up to 300 by 10–25μm, but are shorter in the upper regions of the stem. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E
5|$|The spores of G.pectinatum are {{brown and}} opaque. They have a roughly spherical shape and are ornamented with {{transparent}} (hyaline), truncate warts; the diameter is 4–4.5µm, or 5.5–6.5 if the lengths of the warts is included. Spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 2- or 4-spored, while cystidia (specialized sterile cells that {{occur at the}} hymenial surface in some mushrooms) are absent. The capillitia—a mass of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores—are light brown and 3–7µm in diameter. They are tapered, <b>thick-walled</b> with a narrow interior, and either smooth or slightly encrusted.|$|E
5|$|The spores of L.echinatum, roughly spherical with warts on the surface, have diameters between 4 and 6µm. The capillitia (coarse <b>thick-walled</b> hyphae in the gleba) are elastic, {{brown in}} color, contain small pores, and are 5–8µm thick. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) may be {{attached}} to two to four spores, and the sterigmata (tapered spine-like projections from the basidia that attach the spores) are up to 5µm long.|$|E
5|$|This puffball was {{originally}} described in 1790 by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard as Lycoperdon utriforme, and since then, has been variously {{placed in the}} genera Bovista, Lycoperdon, Calvatia, and Utraria. In 1989, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel described the genus Handkea to include species of Calvatia that had distinct microscopic features: Handkea species have a unique type of capillitium (coarse <b>thick-walled</b> hyphae in the gleba), with curvy slits {{instead of the usual}} pores. Although accepted by some authors, the genus concept has been rejected by others.|$|E
5|$|Two other Chroogomphus {{species with}} a {{morphology}} and coloration similar to C.vinicolor include C.rutilus and C.ochraceous. C.vinicolor is most reliably distinguished from these {{on the basis}} of having <b>thick-walled</b> cystidia (up to 5–7.5μm at the widest part). The other two species have been separated {{on the basis of}} color, with C.ochraceous having brighter colors (yellowish-orange to ochraceous) than C.rutilus. Molecular analyses of European and North American collections suggest that C.rutilus is restricted to Europe, C.ochraceous only occurs in North America, and that cap coloration cannot be reliably used for species determination.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is <b>thick-walled,</b> and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of <b>thick-walled,</b> unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another <b>thick-walled,</b> muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} white spore print. Spores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 3.5–5 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped and four-spored, with dimensions of 18–22 by 5–5.6μm. H.nidulans has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only generative hyphae with clamp connections. In the flesh, these hyphae are <b>thick-walled</b> and highly branched, measuring up to 10μm in diameter; hyphae comprising the pores and the subhymenium are thinner (up to 6μm wide) and less branched. A chemical test {{can be used}} to help identify H.nidulans: all parts of the fruit body will instantly stain bright violet if a drop of an alkaline solution is applied. Dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH), is often used for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} appear almost black, tinged with purple. The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, <b>thick-walled,</b> and lack a germ pore. They are nonamyloid (not {{absorbing}} iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), black-brown, and have dimensions of 4.5–7.5 by 5.5–6.5µm. There is a prominent scar where the spore was once attached to the basidium (the spore-bearing cell) through the sterigma. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and mostly four-spored, with long, slender sterigmata. Unlike other Agaricus species, the spores of A.deserticola are not shot off, but are instead dispersed when they sift out of the dried, mature fruit bodies after the peridium breaks open.|$|E
5|$|Knap of Howar Neolithic {{farmstead}} {{is probably}} the oldest preserved house in northern Europe. Situated {{on the island of}} Papa Westray (which may have been combined with nearby Westray in the early Neolithic), the farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular <b>thick-walled</b> buildings with low doorways linked by a passageway. This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site of an even older settlement. Unstan ware pottery pieces were found on the site, which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides.|$|E
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii {{produces}} a white spore print. Individual spores are ellipsoid {{with a small}} germ pore, smooth, <b>thick-walled,</b> and measure 13.4–24.8 by 9.6–16.0µm. They have a dextrinoid staining reaction (reddish-brown) with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, measuring 38.0–50 by 10.2–13.6µm. They are two-, three-, or four-spored, with sterigmata up to 8.0µm long. Collections with predominantly four-spored basidia will generally have smaller spores than those with two-spored basidia. Two-spored basidia produce spores with four nuclei. Cheilocystidia are plentiful {{on the edge of}} the gill. They have dimensions of 24.8–42.4 by 7.2–10.4µm, with a cylindrical to club shape. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips, including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} a veil. Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, <b>thick-walled</b> setae on the cap, and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{possess a}} dimitic trama, meaning {{that there are}} in its mycelia two kinds of hyphae. The first type is {{brownish}} skeletal hyphae, which provide stability to the fruit body. These hyphae run parallel to the bark and often have hairpin-like turns, so that the loops form <b>thick-walled,</b> cystidium-like structures, the so-called pseudocystidia. The second type is generative hyphae. They are translucent (hyaline) and serve to promote {{the growth of the}} fungus. Genuine cystidia arise in the hymenium and the layer directly below, the subhymenium. Both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted, meaning that they feature crystal-like structures on the top.|$|E
5|$|The spores are ellipsoid, have {{a central}} germ pore, and measure 10–14 by 5.75–8μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are {{club-shaped}} and four-spored. The colorless pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) measure 70–140 by 20–45μm, and are roughly elliptical to flask-shaped, while the similarly shaped cheilocystidia (found on the gill edge) measure 50–95 by 15–25μm. Clamp connections {{are present in}} the hyphae of all tissues of P.auricoma. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of club-shaped, thin-walled cells measuring 25–40 by 10–30μm interspersed with long, dark, <b>thick-walled</b> setae. Yellowish-brown setae are plentiful on the cap surface, and consist of an elongated, hair-like segment up to 315μm long, attached to the surface by a bulbous base that is 3–9μm wide.|$|E
5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris spores are {{narrowly}} ellipsoid, {{and measure}} from 9 to 14 by 4 to 5.5 micrometres (μm). The spores are white, and contain small granules. The spores are borne on basidia which measure 50 to 70 by 7 to 8 μm, with four spores on each basidium. The downy covering {{of the stem}} {{is made up of}} <b>thick-walled</b> hairs, each measuring 15 to 60 by 3 to 7 μm, though they are often swollen towards the base. The sclerotium measures from 1.5 to 3 by 0.5 μm, and is a pale yellow colour. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.|$|E
