500|$|Carter {{also sought}} to rectify small issues that fans had with the 1998 feature film, The X-Files, explaining, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was any trouble with the movie, it was that we promised {{so much that we}} didn't deliver all of it. I think we wanted to deliver a lot, and all at once, in these two episodes". Episode co-writer Frank Spotnitz agreed, saying that when The X-Files film was being {{promoted}} with the tagline [...] "The Truth is Revealed," [...] he realized that the answers presented in the movie would not be the answers that many of the fans were wanting to hear. Spotnitz also felt that writing [...] "One Son" [...] was difficult because the episodes that gave answers seemed to be less entertaining for viewers than episodes that presented new questions. Spotnitz, however, acknowledged that this episode was necessary to help explain the complex mythology of the show; he called the episode the [...] "biggest chapter we had time to explore in the nine years we were on the air".|$|E
2500|$|Weber's second wife, {{astronomer}} Virginia Trimble, {{was seated}} {{in the front row}} of the audience during the LIGO press conference. In an interview with Science Magazine afterwards, she was asked if Weber really saw gravitational waves. [...] She replied, “I don’t know. But I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> had been two technologies going forward they would have pushed each other, as collaborators not as competitors, and it might have led to an observation sooner.” ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a teasing look in March's eyes, and {{he broke}} into a laugh, at the {{firmness}} with which his wife said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is to be any housekeeping, I will stay, too; and help to look after it. I would try not intrude upon you and your guest." ...|$|E
5000|$|After Zabrecky {{performed}} on Penn & Teller's Penn & Teller: Fool Us in August 2016, Penn Jillette said [...] "We {{were trying to}} <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> ever been a mentalist doing a mentalist act that was sincerely funny and sincerely good. You {{may be the first}} ever." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to being called gothic, he stated, [...] "If you're doing nonsense {{it has to}} be rather awful, because there'd be no point. I'm trying to <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> sunny nonsense. Sunny, funny nonsense for children—oh, how boring, boring, boring. As Schubert said, there is no happy music. And that's true, there really isn't. And there's probably no happy nonsense, either." ...|$|R

6000|$|Dick had partly {{expected}} this, and had {{his answer}} ready. [...] "Not so firm as you <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> was no other way, it would force me to stop payment and inform my employer. It {{would be much better}} that Jake should have to deal with his father than with your friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> {{had been}} treasure," [...] Harry went on, [...] "that this stone {{would have been}} closed with the {{greatest}} care. They would hardly have left it so carelessly closed that anyone who examined the wall would have noticed it, just as we did. We found the other places most carefully closed, though {{there was nothing in}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were {{anything}} {{good on the}} other side, I'd widen the gap so that the less agile and the needy could crawl through." [...] He smiled at her. [...] "You see, I owe some of them a good deal. They were the only friends I had when I first tramped, jaded and footsore, about the Province." ...|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS [confidently] Oh no: I <b>think</b> not. <b>If</b> <b>there's</b> {{any trouble}} he shall have it with me, not I with him. And we {{are sure to}} get {{something}} interesting out of him.|$|R
5000|$|Americans were {{reportedly}} disturbed by Benton and Corday's interracial relationship, many simply assuming Corday was black {{in order to}} cope. Alex Kingston, who played Corday, later said: [...] "You see interracial relationships {{all over the place}} America. I kind of naively thought it would be even more liberal in America. And it couldn't have been further from the truth. In fact, I'm trying to <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> a television show right now 2013 where there's an African American and Caucasian relationship. They're few and far between." ...|$|R
60|$|OLIVER. Just {{left the}} gap?--Perhaps, if {{everything}} has to come asunder. But I <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> ever <b>there</b> is to be life--hope,--then you had to come back. I always knew it. There is something eternal between you and him; and <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is to be any happiness, it depends on that. But perhaps there is to BE no happiness--for {{our part of the}} world.|$|R
6000|$|The Second Lady: [...] "I am so {{glad you}} {{happened}} to ask me. It has all been so dreadfully sudden, and I am quite bewildered. Let me <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is anything more!" [...] As she stands with her finger to her lip, the first lady makes a movement as if about to speak, but does not say anything. [...] "No, there is nothing more, I believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hoot!" [...] said Alan, [...] "the man's a Whig, nae doubt; but I {{would never}} deny {{he was a}} good {{chieftain}} to his clan.

6000|$|... "Mr. St. Clare is a {{singular}} man," [...] said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a complaining tone. [...] "I used to <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was {{anything in the}} world he did love, it was our dear little Eva; but he seems to be forgetting her very easily. I cannot ever get him to talk about her. I really did think he would show more feeling!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, there I {{should think}} you do them, as a class, a great injustice,' said Ernest, quietly; 'you're evidently prejudiced against your own people.

6000|$|Vane's {{expression}} changed. [...] "No," [...] he said.

6000|$|She {{had given}} him her hand for good-bye, and he thus for a moment did keep her. Something then, while he seemed to <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were {{anything}} more, came back to him; though something of which there wasn't too much to be made. [...] "Of course if there's anything I {{can do for your}} friend: I mean the gentleman you speak of--?" [...] He gave out in short that he was ready.|$|E
6000|$|... "God {{preserve}} us {{from the}} wenches, Samkin! But indeed I <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is money to be gathered you {{are as likely to}} get your fist full as any man who goes to the war. But hasten, lad, hasten! Already your young master is over the brow." ...|$|R
5000|$|One justice {{wanted to}} know about the {{adhesion}} issue. Could it be used to defeat the contracts even if they were held arbitrable? It hadn't been discussed in the lower courts, [...] "and that's a major problem in this whole arbitration area," [...] Downey claimed, since it could only have been brought up if the contract was challenged as fraudulently induced. [...] "District courts really don't get to review these things until after arbitration," [...] he commented. Leaving such issues to the enforcement stage needlessly delayed dispute resolution, since it was necessary sometimes to rearbitrate the case. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> a fundamental claim like that, the district court ought to decide it up front." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{are making}} a journey?" [...] he said, nodding at the knapsack. [...] "You are early--I am late; our friend has admirable kummel--I have drunk too much.

60|$|And {{the lesson}} was this: {{when we are}} puzzling our brains with plans to help {{ourselves}} out of our troubles, let us always stop a moment in our planning, and try to <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is not some simple {{way out of the}} difficulty, which shall be in every respect perfectly right. If we do that we shall probably find the way, and also find it much more satisfactory as well as easier than any of our ingenious and elaborate plans.|$|E
60|$|It {{makes me}} smile, {{at such a}} time as this, to <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were any one to see me sitting in my easy-chair, my gray head hanging down, my eyes bent thoughtfully upon the glowing embers, and my crutch - emblem of my {{helplessness}} - lying upon the hearth at my feet, how solitary I should seem.

6000|$|... "Some {{one else}} was here!" [...] said Demorest sternly, with {{his eyes fixed on}} Whiskey Dick. The dull glaze which seemed to veil the outer world from the drunkard's pupils shifted {{suddenly}} with such a look of direct horror that Demorest was fain to turn away his own. But the veil mercifully returned, and with it Dick's worked-up sense of injury. Nobody was there--not [...] "a shole." [...] Did Demorest <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> had been any of his friends there they would have stood by like [...] "dogsh" [...] and seen him insulted? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in what you say, and I have thought of it," [...] said Robert, sighing. [...] "But I can't tell how it is; but there {{is something}} in this uncertainty, this peril, this cloud before us, that makes it sweeter to love and to be loved than amid all seeming quiet and serenity. Really, I <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were to be no death, the beauty of life would be all tame. So we take our chance, or our dispensation of Providence, and are going to love, and to be married, just as confidently as if we were sure of living forever." ...|$|E

"It IS easy-that's {{exactly what}} I <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> <b>there</b> were things he DID miss, and if {{in spite of}} them he were always sweet, then, no doubt, {{he would be a}} more or less unappreciated hero. He COULD be a Hero--he WILL be one if it's ever necessary. But it will be about {{something}} better than our dreariness. I know," [...] the Princess declared, [...] "where he's magnificent." [...] And she rested a minute on that. She ended, however, as she had begun. [...] "We're not, all the same, committed to anything stupid.
