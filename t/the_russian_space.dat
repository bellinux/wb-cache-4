5|$|After {{completion}} of NSYNC's PopOdyssey Tour, Bass moved to Star City, Russia, in much publicized {{pursuit of a}} seat on a Soyuz space capsule. Bass was certified by both NASA and <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> Program after several months of cosmonaut training, and planned to join the TMA-1 mission to the International Space Station. However, after his financial sponsors backed out, Bass was denied {{a seat on the}} mission.|$|E
5|$|The Shuttle–Mir Program was a {{collaborative}} space program between Russia and the United States, which involved American Space Shuttles visiting <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> station Mir, Russian cosmonauts flying on the shuttle, and an American astronaut flying aboard a Soyuz spacecraft {{to engage in}} long-duration expeditions aboard Mir.|$|E
5|$|The project {{also served}} as a {{political}} ruse {{on the part of the}} American government, providing a diplomatic channel for NASA to take part in the funding of the cripplingly under-funded Russian space program. This in turn allowed the newly fledged Russian government to keep Mir operating, in addition to <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> program as a whole, ensuring the Russian government remained (and remains) friendly towards the United States.|$|E

5|$|In June 1992, American President George H. W. Bush and Russian {{president}} Boris Yeltsin {{agreed to}} co-operate on space exploration by signing the Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes. This agreement called {{for setting up}} a short, joint space project, during which one American astronaut would board <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts would board a Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> {{program and}} NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E
5|$|The commander, Bill Shepherd, was {{a former}} Navy SEAL, whose only spaceflights were on shuttle missions, and at the {{beginning}} of the mission his total time in space was about two weeks. Questions had been raised by <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> agency about the choice of Shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience. Flight engineer Sergei Krikalev had spent over a year in orbit, mostly on Mir, and would become the first person to visit the ISS twice. He had felt excitement to have been one of the first people to enter the Zarya module (the first component of the space station) in 1998, during STS-88, and was looking forward to returning. Yuri Gidzenko was designated commander and pilot of the two-day Soyuz mission to the station, had one previous spaceflight, which was a 180-day stay aboard Mir.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E

25|$|In the 21st century, ESA started new {{programmes}} {{in order}} to create its own crew vehicles, most notable among its various projects and proposals is Hopper, whose prototype by EADS, called Phoenix, has already been tested. While projects such as Hopper are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation with <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> Agency have emerged. Following talks with <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> Agency in 2004 and June 2005, a co-operation between ESA and <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> Agency was announced to jointly work on the Russian-designed Kliper, a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance part of it. A €50 million participation study for Kliper, which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by the ESA member states. The Russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> Agency {{as well as}} ESA {{announced}} that they would continue to look for other international partners such as Japan to invest in Kliper.
