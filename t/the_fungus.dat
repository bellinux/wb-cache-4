Specimens in coastal dune vegetation were reported killed by <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> Armillaria luteobubalina, with mycelial sheaths of <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> beneath the bark of the root collar.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} fruit bodies cause neurotoxic symptoms if ingested, {{an effect}} {{attributable to the}} compound polyporic acid, which is present in high concentrations. When an alkaline solution is placed on <b>the</b> <b>fungus,</b> the flesh turns violet. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> is used in mushroom dyeing to produce purple colors.|$|E
5|$|According to Takahashi, <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> is best {{classified}} in {{the section}} Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays microsporidia {{are placed}} within <b>the</b> <b>Fungi</b> or as a sister-group of <b>the</b> <b>Fungi</b> {{with a common}} ancestor.|$|R
50|$|When the hyphae of <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> burrow into <b>the</b> {{skin and}} release enzymes to digest keratin, they may irritate nerve endings and cause the host to itch, which may elicit the scratch reflex, which directs the host to scratch. Scratching {{directly}} transfers fungi and dead skin particles that are infested with <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> to <b>the</b> fingers {{and under the}} finger nails. From there they can be transmitted {{to other parts of}} the host's body when the host touches or scratches those. Scratching also damages skin layers, making it easier for <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> to spread at the site of the infection. If <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> and infested debris are not washed from the fingers and fingernails soon enough, <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> can also infect the skin of the fingers (tinea manuum), and burrow underneath and into the material of the fingernails (tinea unguium). If left untreated, <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> continue to grow and spread.|$|R
50|$|Leymus arenarius {{benefits}} from the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal <b>fungi.</b> <b>The</b> presence of <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> increases <b>the</b> ability of L. arenarius to have an extensive root system and to bind soil particles. When adding fungi in its natural habitat, more seeds survived and grew than without <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> present.|$|R
5|$|Although Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus is edible, {{opinions}} are divided regarding its taste. Besides its usage as an edible mushroom, <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> possesses antibiotic-like compounds.|$|E
5|$|Amanita aestivalis is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{meaning it}} forms a mutualistic relationship in which the vegetative hyphae of <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> grow around and enclose the tiny roots of trees and shrubs. In this way, the plant is better able to absorb phosphorus and other soil nutrients, while <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> receives moisture, protection, and nutritive byproducts of the plant's metabolism. Fruit bodies of <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> grow {{on the ground in}} deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests. A preference has been noted for oak woods containing Tsuga or Pinus species, as well as beech wood with Picea, Abies, and Betula. Fruit bodies typically appear from late June until autumn. In North America, it has been found in the states of New England, as well as Alabama, New York, and Virginia. The distribution extends north to the southeastern provinces of Canada and south to Florida.|$|E
5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> with a carbon source, and <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E
50|$|Rose {{powdery mildew}} {{is caused by}} <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> Podosphaera pannosa, a member of <b>the</b> Ascomycete <b>fungi.</b> It infects {{a wide variety of}} roses, but {{especially}} those grown in dryer climates as <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> has <b>the</b> rare characteristic that not only does it not need water to germinate and reproduce, it can be inhibited by it.|$|R
50|$|Lymexylidae larvae have a {{symbiotic}} association with {{certain types of}} <b>fungi.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fungi</b> grow in sheltered environments where they are tended by the larvae, such as the holes burrowed into the wood and, in return, the larvae feed on <b>the</b> <b>fungi.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fungi</b> were {{originally}} treated as plants. For {{a short period}} Linnaeus had classified them in the taxon Vermes in Animalia, but later placed them back in Plantae. Copeland classified <b>the</b> <b>Fungi</b> in his Protoctista, thus partially avoiding the problem but acknowledging their special status. The problem was eventually solved by Whittaker, when he gave them their own kingdom in his five-kingdom system. Evolutionary history shows that <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> are {{more closely related to}} animals than to plants.|$|R
5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A sample of <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution {{and was found}} to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> also {{plays a role in}} the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cirrhata {{is known}} from temperate, boreal, and alpine or arctic habitats. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> is {{widespread}} in Europe, including Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Scandinavia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The mushroom is also common in northern montane regions of North America. In Asia, <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> {{has been reported}} in Korea, and in Hokkaido, northern Japan. It is also known from Greenland. A 2009 publication suggested that based on the known evidence, the species' distribution may be circumboreal.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fungi</b> {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} and thoroughly integrated {{treatment of the}} biology of <b>the</b> <b>fungi.</b> This modern synthesis highlights the scientific foundations that continue to inform mycologists today, as well as recent breakthroughs and the formidable challenges in current research. <b>The</b> <b>Fungi</b> combines a wide scope with the depth of inquiry and clarity offered by three leading fungal biologists. The book describes the astonishing diversity of <b>the</b> <b>fungi,</b> their complex life cycles, and intriguing mechanisms of spore release. The distinctive cell biology of <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> is linked to their development {{as well as their}} metabolism and physiology. One of the great advances in mycology in recent decades is the recognition of the vital importance of <b>fungi</b> in <b>the</b> natural environment. Plants are supported by mycorrhizal symbioses with fungi, are attacked by other fungi that cause plant diseases, and are the major decomposers of their dead tissues. Fungi also engage in supportive and harmful interactions with animals, including humans. They are major players in global nutrient cycles...|$|R
50|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which these plants gain sugars from fungi are not known {{and has not been}} demonstrated scientifically. Two pathways have been proposed; they may either degrade fungal biomass, particularly the fungal hyphae which penetrate plant cells in a similar manner to in arbuscular mycorrhizae, or absorb sugars from <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> by disrupting their cell membranes, through mass flow. To prevent the sugars returning to <b>the</b> <b>fungi,</b> they must compartmentalise the sugars or convert them into forms which <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> cannot use.|$|R

5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> colonized the highest proportion of root tips. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> fruits {{in late summer}} and autumn. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> has been noted to fruit readily on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they blend in with their surroundings.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{market and}} modem market (Supermarket) sells many ready made food such as: ayam bumbu kuning, telur asin, pepes ikan, udang bumbu tepung, sosis sapi and bakso daging. Fast food should be sold fast {{otherwise}} {{it will be}} contaminated with fungi and bacteria, then the appearance of food will not be interesting {{and the quality of}} food became bad. <b>The</b> <b>fungi</b> will produce toxin, called mycotoxin. Mycotoxin will remain in the food although <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> died. But some fungi can still alive at high temperature. Fungi which produce mycotoxin among others: A. jlavus. A. fongigatu. s, A. ochrachius, Scopulariopsis sp., Fusarium sp., and Geotricum sp. This preliminary study was able to examine <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> grown in fast food, the input of spices used in ready made food. Flies investation was also observed. The results of the study showed that the spices can preserve the food since the spices can prevent the growth of <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> which contaminated <b>the</b> food. Most of <b>the</b> <b>fungi</b> that contaminated <b>the</b> food is air borne <b>fungi</b> dan <b>the</b> atsiri oil of same spices can be used as repellent...|$|R

5|$|In 2009, {{an unknown}} species of Boletopsis was {{discovered}} in the Orongorongo valley near Wellington, New Zealand. In 2010, <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> was found again {{in the same place}} and also discovered on the South Island. Morphological comparisons and molecular analysis of other species of the genus suggested that <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> could not be attributed to any known representative of the genus, and so it was described by mycologists Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard as a new species. The species description of Boletopsis nothofagi appeared in the journal MycoKeys in 2012. The two authors chose the epithet nothofagi based on the characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> as mycorrhizal symbiont of Nothofagus fusca.

5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of <b>the</b> <b>fungus</b> can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. <b>The</b> <b>fungus</b> promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens.
