The monohydride catalytic pathway (Path I) and the dihydride catalytic pathway (Path II) for the hydrogenation of CO 2 have been explored. In these two cases, a weak H.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of nitric oxide reduction in a ba 3 -type heme-copper oxidase {{has been investigated}} using density functional theory (B 3 LYP). Four possible mechanisms have been studied and free energy surfaces for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> including proton and electron transfers have been constructed by comparison to experimental data. The first nitric oxide coordinates to heme a 3 and is partly reduced having some nitroxyl anion character (3 NO−), and it is thus activated toward the attack by the second NO. In this reaction step a cyclic hyponitrous acid anhydride intermediate with the two oxygens coordinating to CuB is formed. The cyclic hyponitrous acid anhydride is quite stable in a local minimum with high barriers for both the backward and forward reactions and should thus be observable experimentally. To break the NO bond and form nitrous oxide, the hyponitrous acid anhydride must be protonated, the latter appearing to be an endergonic process. The endergonicity of the proton transfer makes the barrier of breaking the NO bond directly after the protonation too high. It is suggested that an electron should enter the catalytic cycle {{at this stage in}} order to break the NO bond and form N 2 O at a feasible rate. The cleavage of the NO bond is the rate limiting step in the reaction mechanism and it has a barrier of 17. 3 kcal/mol, close to the experimental value of 19. 5 kcal/mol. The overall exergonicity is fitted to experimental data and is 45. 6 kcal/mol...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The ThyA {{gene that}} encodes for {{thymidylate}} synthase (TS) is absent in the genomes {{of a large}} number of bacteria, including several human pathogens. Many of these bacteria also lack the genes for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidine kinase and are totally dependent on an alternative enzyme for thymidylate synthesis. Thy 1 encodes flavin-dependent TS (FDTS, previously denoted as TSCP) and shares no sequence homology with classical TS genes. Mechanistic studies of a FDTS from Thermotoga maritima (TM 0449) are presented here. Several isotopic labeling experiments reveal details of the catalyzed reaction, and a chemical mechanism that is consistent with the experimental data is proposed.

PKC catalytic activity in the nuclei of HEL cells showed a peak after acute (30 min) treatment with PMA, followed by a significant (P < 0. 05) decline after prolonged exposure (72 h) to the same agonist, when most HEL cells had acquired a differentiated megakaryocytic phenotype.

We report the crystal structures of GlmS alone and in complex with the glucosamine- 6 -phosphate product at 2. 95 A and 2. 9 A resolution, respectively. Surprisingly, although the whole protein is present in this crystal form, no electron density for the glutaminase domain was observed, indicating its mobility. Comparison of the two structures {{with that of the}} previously reported GlmS-Fru 6 P complex shows that, upon sugar binding, the C-terminal loop, which forms the major part of the channel walls, becomes ordered and covers the synthase site. The ordering of the glutaminase domains likely follows Fru 6 P binding by the anchoring of Trp 74, which acts as the gate of the channel, on the closed C-terminal loop. This is accompanied by a major conformational change of the side chain of Lys 503 # of the neighboring synthase domain that strengthens the interactions of the synthase domain with the C-terminal loop and completely shields the synthase site.

Also nature employs catalysts, i. e. enzymes, for its reactions. To improve on the already existing catalysts one can learn a lot from nature which often uses earth-abundant elements in the enzymes which have also been optimized and finely tuned for billions of years. To gain a deeper understanding of both enzymatic and artificial catalysis one needs to investigate the mechanism of the catalytic process. But for very efficient catalysts with turnover frequencies of several thousand per second this is not easy, since an investigation of the mechanism involves resolving intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The intermediates in these instances are short-lived corresponding to their turnover frequencies. A maximum turnover frequency of 1, 000 s- 1 e. g. means that each catalyst goes through <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> in 1 ms.

To date, this role has not been discovered. Most historical {{research has focused on}} new oxide catalyst development and performance improvement over the existing oxide catalysts [10, 11, 12]. There is limited effort on the fundamental investigation of three-phase electrochemical interface. In particular, graphene is the most interesting carbon support, which has been widely used to replace the traditional carbon support, like Vulcan carbon and acetylene black. There are literally tons of research papers reporting the significant catalytic performance enhancement of graphene supported versus carbon black or carbon nanotube supported the same catalysts. Interestingly, the enhancement most often is explained by a synergistic effect between graphene and catalyst particles. However, what the meaning of this synergistic effect remains unclear. Some researchers ascribed it to the higher conductivity of graphene, but this is doubtful. In principle, although graphene has a high conductivity, the “graphene” used as catalyst support is actually reduced graphene oxide, which contains sp 3 carbons and its conductivity is actually lower than that of graphite (2400  ±  200  S m− 1 for reduced graphene oxide and 2500  ±  20  S m− 1 for graphite) [13]. When used in powder form and as catalyst support, graphene does not show a significant difference in conductivity as compared to other carbons, like acetylene black.

The detailed reaction mechanisms {{as well as the}} high cis-diastereoselectivities of the reactions have been firstly clarified. Our calculated results reveal that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>catalytic</b> process is presumably initiated with the nucleophilic attack of phosphine catalyst at the allenoate to produce the zwitterionic intermediate M 1, which subsequently undergoes gamma-addition to the electron-poor C=O (or C=N) dipolarophile to form another intermediate M 2. The following [1, 3] hydrogen shift of M 2 is demonstrated to proceed via two consecutive proton transfer steps without the assistance of protic solvent: the anionic O 6 (or N 6) of M 2 first acts as a base catalyst to abstract a proton from C 1 to produce the intermediate M 3, and then the OH (or NH) group can donate the acidic proton to C 3 to complete the [1, 3] hydrogen shift and generate the intermediate M 4. Finally, the intramolecular Michael-type addition followed by the elimination of catalyst furnishes the final product. High cis-diastereoselectivities are also predicted for both the two reactions, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations. For the reaction of allenoates with trifluoromethyl ketones, the first proton transfer is found to be the diastereoselectivity-determining step. The cumulative effects of the steric repulsion, electrostatic interaction as well as other weak interactions appear to contribute to the relative energies of transition states leading to the diastereomeric products. On the contrary, in the case of N-tosylbenzaldimines, the Michael-type addition is found to be the diastereoselectivity-determining step.

The kinetics of the oxidative addition of aryl halides to dmim-ligated Pd(0) species has been characterized. Deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) demonstrated that C-H bond cleavage is involved in the turnover limiting step of the catalytic cycle. Complexes of formula ArPd(dmim) 3 I have been isolated and characterized for the first time. They behave as a mixture of trans-[ArPd(dmim) 2 I] and dmim in apolar solvent, while in polar solvents they partially dissociate to give the [ArPd(dmim) 3]+. The latter cationic species is active towards the direct arylation of dmim at room temperature in the presence of AcO- as a base. Preliminary kinetic data point out that C-H bond cleavage occurs by a concertated metalation-deprotonation mechanism with AcO- acting as an outer-sphere base. Reactivity studies on 1 -aryl- 2 -methylimidazole showed that the reaction under study is faster for electron-poor imidazole substrates. We propose a revised catalytic cycle, consistent with all the experimental data. We are confident that our results will be useful for the development of enhanced catalytic systems for C-H activation...|$|E
40|$|The prototypical {{tryptophan}} synthases form {{a stable}} heterotetrameric RββR complex {{in which the}} constituting TrpA and TrpB 1 subunits activate {{each other in a}} bidirectional manner. The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus does not contain a TrpB 1 protein but instead two members of the phylogenetically distinct family of TrpB 2 proteins, which are encoded within (sTrpB 2 i) and outside (sTrpB 2 a) the tryptophan operon. It has previously been shown that sTrpB 2 a does not functionally or structurally interact with sTrpA, whereas sTrpB 2 i substantially activates sTrpA in a unidirectional manner. However, in the absence of catalysis, no physical complex between sTrpB 2 i and sTrpA could be detected. In order to elucidate the structural requirements for complex formation, we have analyzed the interaction between sTrpA (R-monomer) and sTrpB 2 i (ββ-dimer) by means of spectroscopy, analytical gel filtration, and analytical ultracentrifugation, as well as isothermal titration calorimetry. In the presence of the TrpA ligand glycerol 3 -phosphate (GP) and the TrpB substrate L-serine, sTrpA and sTrpB 2 i formed a physical complex with a thermodynamic dissociation constant of about 1 μM, indicating that the affinity between the R- and ββ-subunits is weaker by at least 1 order of magnitude than the affinity between the corresponding subunits of prototypical tryptophan synthases. The observed stoichiometry of the complex was 1 subunit of sTrpA per 2 subunits of sTrpB 2 i, which corresponds to a Rββ quaternary structure and testifies to a strong negative cooperativity for the binding of the R-monomers to the ββ-dimer. The analysis of the interaction between sTrpB 2 i and sTrpA in the presence of several substrate, transition state, and product analogues suggests that the Rββ complex remains stable during <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> and disintegrates into R- and ββ-subunits upon the release of the reaction product tryptophan. The formation of a transient tryptophan synthase complex, together with the observed low affinity of sTrpB 2 i for L-serine, couples the rate of tryptophan biosynthesis in S. solfataricus to the cytosolic availability of L-serine...|$|E
40|$|The aquo-amido {{complexes}} TpRu(PPh 3) (H 2 O) (NHQO) R) (R = Me, Ph), {{which can}} be prepared by refluxing a THF solution of TpRu(PPh 3) (RCN) H containing excess water or more conveniently by reacting TpRu(PPhARCN) CI with NaOH in THF {{in the presence of}} water, are found to be active for catalytic hydration of nitriles to amides. The catalysis proceeds via a mechanism that is distinctly different from the common ones involving intramolecular nucleophilic attack of a hydroxo (or aquo) ligand or external attack of a hydroxide ion (or water) at the carbon atom of the eta(1) -coordinated nitrile to form the metal amide intermediate and subsequent protonation of amido ligand by an adjacent aquo ligand or solvent water. The new mechanism involves the intermediacy of a relatively stable complex containing a chelating N-imidoylimidato ligand; ring-opening nucleophilic attack of this ligand by water is the product-generating step. Formation of the N-imidoylimidato complex from TpRu(PPhAH(2) O) (NHC(O) R) involves several steps. The initial one is displacement of the H 2 O ligand by a nitrile molecule to yield the nitrile-amido species TpRu(PPhARCN) (NHQO) R). This is followed by an unusual linkage isomerization of the N-bonded amido ligand to an O-bonded imido, which then undergoes nucleophilic attack at the carbon atom of the nitrile ligand in the complex; facile 1, 3 -proton shift between the nitrogen atoms on the resulting ring completes the reaction. The N-imidoylimidato complexes TpRu(PPh 3) (kappa(2) -NO-NH= CMeN=CMeO), TpRu(PPh 3) (kappa(2) -NO-NH=CPhN=CPhO), and TpRu(PPh 3) (kappa(2) -N,O-NH=CMeN= CPhO) were independently prepared, and the molecular structure of TpRu(PPh 3) kappa(2) -NO-NH=CPhN= CPhO) was determined by X-ray crystallography. To study the feasibility of the proposed mechanism for nitrile hydration with the aquo-amido complexes, theoretical calculations were performed at the Becke 3 LYP level of DFT theory to examine <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle.</b> It is learned that there is a substantially high barrier for the hydrolysis of the highly stable N-imidoylimidato complex, a step involving the ring-opening nucleophilic attack of this ligand by water, and this is probably the reason for the requirement of a relatively high reaction temperature.

40|$|We report new results {{concerning}} {{the role of}} surface mobile species in catalytic processes. More precisely, the proposed contribution deals with cooperative effects due to diffusion of some surface species {{from one to another}} kind of surface. The understanding of atomic scale phenomena leads to new modelling and chemical engineering developments which will be outlined. With sulfide and oxide catalysts, new catalytic sites are created by the reaction of spillover species with the surface of a potentially active phase, thus modifying its activity and selectivity. This is the remote control (RC). A most conspicuous result is a strong catalytic synergy between two or several distinct solids. In addition, the active phase is protected against unwanted solid-state transformations leading to deactivation. When a RC operates, some part (phase) of the catalysts dissociates a molecule (O- 2 or H- 2) to form surface mobile species. These species flow, namely "spillover", over the other part. In this way, they create active sites, or regenerate sites deactivated by some infrequent but harmful processes occurring in the normal course of catalytic reactions. These may be failure of sulfur atoms to be eliminated by hydrogen in hydrotreating (HDS, HDN, etc.) or surface reduction in selective catalytic oxidation. Remotely controlled reactions lead to special kinetic equations, which consist of the product of a function determining the number of sites by another function reflecting the occupancy of sites and the intrinsic reaction rate (e. g. of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood type). Hydrotreating reactions are particularly interesting in this respect, because the remote control causes an interconversion between hydrogenation sites and sites responsible for the hydrogenolysis of carbon-heteroatom bonds. A new model will be shortly presented, which reflects all the specificities of hydrotreating reactions, including transient effects. In selective oxidations, {{the presence or absence of}} spillover oxygen has an effect on the facetting and reconstruction of MoO 3 crystallites, as demonstrated using SEM and AFM. These results highlight the necessity to keep the surface structure in an optimal configuration during <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle.</b> A modified Mars-van Krevelen model can account better than previous ones for the reduction-oxidation cycle and the change in number of the active sites asa function of the reaction conditions. The outlooks for the development of new fundamental concepts or for a general chemical engineering approach to catalytic processes will be summarized. RC takes place in numerous reactions. Many aspects are influenced by consideration of the RC concept: activity and selectivity, catalyst formulation and "architecture", ageing processes, kinetic modelling, and process operation. A general philosophy emerging from the results presented is that full consideration of the dynamics of structural changes occurring at the catalyst surface permits conspicuous advances in both the atomic and molecular mechanisms and the macroscopic kinetic modelling...|$|E
