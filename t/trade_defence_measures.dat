40|$|When the Enlargement {{took place}} on 1 May 2004, The Common Trade Policy with all trade policy {{instrument}} were automatically applied to imports into the enlarged European Union. As a result, current EU trade defence law and measures are automatically in force in Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Following this the new Member States no longer apply their own, national trade defence action, they also cannot use trade defence instruments against each other. It means, furthermore, that all <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measures</b> that EU- 15 had against imports {{from any of the}} new Member States disappeared automatically after 1 May 2004. Equally, measures among the new Member States also disappear. Undoubtedly, the EU Eastern Enlargement created new conditions in which found themselves 8 countries from Central and Eastern Europe that became EU new members as well as Russia that stayed outside the Community. The aim of this paper, therefore was to analyse the potential effect of adopting the EU trade laws and measures applicable to Russian imports by Poland - country that always had the strongest trade ties with Russia from all post –Soviet bloc. Despite the comparative analysis of customs duty rates applied to Russian products and as well as selection of <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measures</b> against Russia's export before and after Poland's accession to the EU in chapter third, the paper also describes the EU Common Trade Policy and what the adoption of this policy means for member states and non-members. Moreover, a short outline of mutual Russia - Poland trade relations is included in order to present subject in more comprehensive way and make reader familiar with the back ground of research.

40|$|Owing to the EU-Turkish customs union, {{there is}} already a {{considerable}} degree of convergence between Turkey and the EU in the area of trade. In fact, Turkey is the only candidate country that has a customs union with the EU. At least with respect to the trade in goods, Turkey is almost part of the Single Market. The challenge of enhancing the present state of trade integration could be approached in two ways. First, the customs union could be deepened by refining the arrangements and addressing its shortcomings. Secondly, the degree of trade integration could be enhanced by incorporating areas such as services and agriculture – thus widening the customs union – which is also explored in detail. The paper concludes that the Turkish-EU customs union has been a technical success overall and functioned on a sound basis. Nevertheless, both parties should work flexibly towards eliminating <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measures</b> and forging a more comprehensive framework of trade integration...|$|E
40|$|The EU's import {{policies}} towards {{developing countries}} are complex, stemming from important sectoral and country variations in policy. Average tariffs are modest, and, while there are tariff peaks and escalation {{in some areas of}} interest to developing countries, these are being reduced {{as a result of the}} implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round. The use of non-tariff measures has fallen, particularly as a result of agricultural tariffication, and is being further reduced in textiles and clothing. The elimination of VERs has not led to an increase in the use of alternative measures. Contingency protection falls more heavily in chemicals, iron and steel, certain textile items and certain electrical consumer goods and on Asian, Central and Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries. The operation of various factors appears to be working to mitigate the use of <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measures</b> in recent years, helping to counter pressures that seem likely to arise as liberalization proceeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{category}} of ‘Union interest’ plays a specific role in EU common commercial policy. Its significance is especially substantial {{in the field}} of <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> instruments. Even though <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> instruments reflect on international trade distortions, their main objective is to protect European industries and other economic operators against the injurious practices of competitors from third countries, the imposition of restrictive trade measures might not only offer advantages to the affected EU industries, but also disadvantages to other actors in the European Union. Consequently, the Union interest test makes sure {{the other side of the}} coin is looked at and the European Union is prevented from imposing <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> instruments, when the negative impacts on certain interested actors are clearly disproportionate to the positive impacts the <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measure</b> might have on the protected EU industries. The current paper is focusing on the nature and character of the ‘Union interest’. The paper starts by defining some basic concepts regarding the EU interests in EU law, examines the nature of ‘Union interest’ in the <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> procedures, and then attempts to reflect on the new trade enforcement regulation and the EU general trade interests...|$|R
40|$|As well as {{the most}} other {{importing}} countries of the world, the European Union applies a system of <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> instruments. These instruments empower the European Union to defend its traders against unfair trade of imported products or subsidized imports as well as against change in clear trade flows, if they are harmful to the EU economy. Economical legitimacy of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> actions is generally {{based on the fact}} that the international trade has no mechanism for correcting anti-competitive practice similar to the competition authorities that operate in almost all national economies. The European Union applies <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> instruments following the rules prepared by WTO agreements, which determine <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> instruments and principles of application thereof as the legal tools of multi-country free trade system.

30|$|Firstly, at {{the global}} level, {{in most of the}} studies {{quantifying}} trade impacts of FTAs, assessment of tariff removal has been a necessity and considered the first-order effect before conducting any other assessment of non-tariff barriers, even though the impacts of non-tariff barriers might be higher. In fact, the committed tariff schedule is more transparent and predictable, therefore the impact results are easier to be quantified and more persuasive. The impacts of non-tariff barriers on the contrary are much more difficult to be predicted and quantified because non-tariff barriers are less stable, related to policies and regulations that could be adjusted by domestic laws, and not bounded as stringently as tariff barriers. Especially for pharmaceutical products which affect considerably human’s lives and health, the possibility of countries to adopt beyond the border policies and <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measures</b> for the purpose of protecting the health of community is eligible in many cases. Therefore, even though impacts of tariff removal might be not so high, this assessment is treated as the first persuasive start to understand quantified changes in imports from FTAs.|$|E

It highlights the need for <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measures</b> and the possibilities of customising these for each ACP region. While favouring similar rules of origin for all ACP regions so as to facilitate the later consolidation of regional agreements into broader agreements, the Commission expresses an openness to crafting rules of origin according to {{the specific needs of}} each ACP region. The note also outlines in summary form the likely scope of negotiations on trade in services and trade facilitation. The note recognises that ACP countries will face 'difficult economic and social restructuring' as a result of moves towards free trade with the EU but expresses the view that this should not allow ACP countries to defer much needed reforms which will enhance their competitiveness.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the implications and remaining challenges behind the seemingly happy {{ending of the}} recent EU–China trade dispute on solar products. First, the EU's choice of a specific trade defence measure – anti-dumping – was based on shaky arguments. Second, further trade disputes on green goods are very likely, in particular because China is increasingly implementing domestic support policies on green sectors, bringing down Chinese export prices. Third, <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measures</b> could be adopted as an expensive option. Alternatively to this, the EU and China could consider setting up constructive and preventive mechanisms in order to stabilize trade and broaden their economic relationship. Policy relevance In July 2013 the EU accepted an undertaking by Chinese solar wafer, cell, and module manufacturers to fix minimum import prices for their products, along with a volume cap to be imposed on Chinese solar exports to the EU. In spite of the seemingly happy end of a trade dispute between the two {{major players in the}} renewables sector, we show that the possibility of trade disputes over low-carbon products in the near future cannot be ruled out. Drawing on the China–EU photovoltaic 'dumping case', we highlight some weaknesses in the EU's choice to resort to anti-dumping measures and emphasize the urgent need to invent new forms of trade dialogues between the EU and China as first-choice trade dispute settlement policies.

40|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that protectionist activity since the financial crisis has been muted, raising the question whether the historically well-documented relationship between growth, real exchange rates and trade protectionism has broken down. This paper re-visits this relationship for the time period since 2009. To this end, we use a novel and comprehensive dataset which considers {{a wide range of}} trade policies stretching beyond the traditionally considered tariff and <b>trade</b> <b>defence</b> <b>measures.</b> We find that the specter of protectionism has not been banished: Countries continue to pursue more trade-restrictive policies when they experience recessions and/or when their competitiveness deteriorates through an appreciation of the real exchange rate; and this finding holds for a wide array of contemporary trade policies, including 2 ̆ 01 cmurky 2 ̆ 01 d measures. We also find differences in the recourse to trade protectionism across countries: trade policies of G 20 advanced economies respond more strongly to changes in domestic growth and real exchange rates than those of G 20 emerging market economies. Moreover, G 20 economies 2 ̆ 019 trade policies vis- 0 -vis other G 20 economies are less responsive to changes in real exchange rates than those pursued vis- 0 -vis non-G 20 economies.
