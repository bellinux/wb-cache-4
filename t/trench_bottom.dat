Concentration of anorthositic breccias is less in the Apollo 15 soils, but is higher in the Front samples. The Rille edge soils are rich in basalt fragments.

40|$|The {{influence}} of starting surface topography on the nucleation {{and growth of}} epitaxial silicide layers was investigated. CoSi 2 layers were grown via the template technique on one‐dimensionally patterned Si(100) substrates. These substrates contained mesa stripes, running parallel to Si[011], and exhibited either a number of Si {hkl} facets, or ‘‘smoothly varying’’ sinusoidal profiles. Conventional plan view and high resolution cross section transmission electron microscopy showed that the orientation and morphology of the CoSi 2 grains depend on the angle (θ) between the CoSi 2 /Si interface normal and Si(100). CoSi 2 (100) grains nucleated on mesa tops and <b>trench</b> <b>bottoms,</b> where θ< 5 °, and formed atomically sharp interfaces. CoSi 2 (110) and CoSi 2 (221) grains nucleated along sidewalls of the mesa structures, in regions where 5 °<θ< 11 ° and θ≳ 5 °, respectively. CoSi 2 (110) grains formed highly stepped interfaces with the substrate which were punctuated by step bunches at the grain boundary/substrate triple points. CoSi 2 (221) grains formed rough interfaces with the substrate which were punctuated by facets and B‐type silicide/substrate interfaces along Si{ 111 } planes. Analysis of these data suggests that nucleation of CoSi 2 (110) grains {{is associated with the}} presence of double height steps and step bunches with small surface misorientation, and that nucleation of CoSi 2 (221) grains is associated with Si{ 111 } facets, Si{ 311 } facets, and step bunches with larger surface misorientation. © 1996 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|The Central European Watershed {{divides the}} Rhine-Main {{catchment}} and the Danube catchment. In the Early Medieval period, when ships were important means of transportation, Charlemagne decided to link both catchments by {{the construction of}} a canal connecting the Schwabian Rezat and the Altmühl rivers. The artificial waterway would provide a continuous inland navigation route from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The shortcut is known as Fossa Carolina and represents {{one of the most important}} Early Medieval engineering achievements in Europe. Despite the important geostrategic relevance of the construction it is not clarified whether the canal was actually used as a navigation waterway. We present new geophysical data and in situ findings from the trench fills that prove for the first time a total length of the constructed Carolingian canal of at least 2300 metres. We have evidence for a conceptual width of the artificial water course between 5 and 6 metres and a water depth of at least 60 to 80 cm. This allows a crossing way passage of Carolingian cargo scows with a payload of several tons. There is strong evidence for clayey to silty layers in the trench fills which reveal suspension load limited stillwater deposition and, therefore, the evidence of former Carolingian and post-Carolingian ponds. These findings are strongly supported by numerous sapropel layers within the trench fills. Our results presented in this study indicate an extraordinarily advanced construction level of the known course of the canal. Here, the excavated levels of Carolingian <b>trench</b> <b>bottoms</b> were generally sufficient for the efficient construction of stepped ponds and prove a fina...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on building a power UMOSFET on SiC. The major {{problem of the}} Conventional UMOSFET is that the <b>bottom</b> <b>trench</b> oxide breaks down before avalanche breakdown occurs in the SiC. This restricts the full usage of the SiC high avalanche field property. A novel structure Protected UMOSFET for protecting the <b>bottom</b> <b>trench</b> oxide and increasing blocking voltage is analyzed. Simulation shows that the protected UMOSFET increases the blocking voltage but also increases the on-resistance as it introduces a JFET resistance. A trade-off problem exists for designing the trench depth: if the trench is too deep, the protection effect is lost, if too shallow, on-resistance increases or pinch-off happens. Another novel structure, called Optimized UMOSFET, is proposed to solve this trade-off problem. Simulation shows the Optimized UMOSFET {{not only has the}} ideal blocking voltage but also lower on-resistance than the conventional UMOSFET. Some design issues as well as fabrication issues are discussed. Actual device fabrication shows a low inversion layer mobility. The low inversion layer mobility is partially avoided by using an Accumulation Layer in the channel. Measurement results of the Conventional UMOSFET, Protected UMOSFET, Optimized UMOSFET, and Accumulation Layer Optimized UMOSFET are presented along with detail discussions. Nearly ideal blocking voltage is achieved in real devices, and the forward on-resistance is 20 times lower than theoretical Si devices designed with the same blocking voltage. In order to get the theoretical SiC performance, channel mobility needs further improvement. Future research is suggested to push the power UMOSFET to its SiC theoretical limit. ...|$|R

40|$|Trench depth is {{important}} in low-voltage trench MOSFETs because it affects the switching losses through the gate-drain capacitance (C(GD)). The dependence of C(GD) on the trench depth is investigated by analytical modeling and experimental characterization. An analytical model that relates the trench depth, <b>trench</b> <b>bottom</b> oxide thickness, n(-) layer doping, and drain voltage (V(D)) to C(GD) is developed and validated by experimental measurements. Trench MOSFETs with thick bottom oxides have been fabricated with 1. 3 -, 1. 5 -, 1. 7 -, and 2 -mu m deep trenches. CV measurements show that C(GD) {{is proportional to the}} trench depth at low V(D) and becomes increasingly independent of trench depth as V(D) is increased. The model is used to show that this is due to C(GD) being dominated by the oxide capacitance at low V(D) and the depletion capacitance at high V(D). The fact that the average thickness of the <b>trench</b> <b>bottom</b> oxide decreases as the trench depth increases (because of additional sidewall oxide overlapping the drain) means that the impact of the trench depth is the highest at low V(D), where the depletion capacitance is ineffective...|$|E
