5|$|Since 2006, all {{prisoners and}} parolees in Queensland have been {{prohibited}} by law (section 132 of Queensland's Corrective Services Act, {{introduced by the}} Beattie Labor Government) from speaking to reporters without permission. Thus, {{for the duration of}} his imprisonment and parole, Wotton could not lawfully speak to <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> attend public meetings without prior approval from his parole officer. Gracelyn Smallwood of the Indigenous Human Rights Committee believed it was designed to muzzle the truth. Terry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, has called it 'obnoxious'. Stewart Levitt, the director of the Black and White Justice Foundation remarked that it was unusual for a public spokesman and former politician to be prohibited from a public meeting. Welcoming Wotton back home, Alf Lacey, mayor of Palm Island, commented that the conditions were excessive.|$|E

25|$|After the 1979 Labour defeat, Jim Callaghan {{tried in}} vain to keep the left-wing of the party (in which Tony Benn was prominent) and the right-wing (in which Roy Jenkins was prominent) together. In 1980, the Labour Party conference was {{dominated}} by factional disputes and what Callaghan regarded as Bennite motions. Callaghan resigned as party leader late that year, and was replaced by Michael Foot, a left-winger who by then had distanced himself from Benn but failed to transmit this to <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> the voters. The following year, Denis Healey only narrowly won the deputy leadership in a contest with Benn.|$|E

25|$|Often {{there is}} a {{noticeable}} difference between the perceived risk of becoming a victim of crime and the statistical probability. However, hearing about events in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> knowing others who have been victimised increases public perception {{of the risk of}} victimisation. In some western countries, crime accounts for up to 25% of news coverage. The formation of a ‘fear of crime' feedback loop allows more citizens to be surveyed as fearful, more politicians {{to be able to use}} crime fear as a political issue, in an ever increasing spiral that crime is out of control.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{objectification}} {{has been}} studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can take place in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> through personal experience. Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are socialized to objectify their own physical characteristics from a third person perception, which is identified as self-objectification. Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social gender roles and inequalities between the sexes.|$|E
25|$|Platforms like LinkedIn {{create an}} {{environment}} for companies and clients to connect online. Companies that {{recognize the need for}} information, originality/ and accessibility employ blogs to make their products popular and unique/ and ultimately reach out to consumers who are privy to social media. Studies from 2009 show that consumers view coverage in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> from bloggers as being more neutral and credible than print advertisements, which are not thought of as free or independent. Blogs allow a product or company to provide longer descriptions of products or services, can include testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages. Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping customers, and also for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social network pages. Online communities can enable a business to reach the clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure their standing in the corporate world, sites enable employees to place evaluations of their companies.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} body {{satisfaction}} and appearance esteem {{continues to increase}} with the abundance of; billboards, magazines, and conversations, displaying “unrealistic images of beauty” (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices brought up in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet. In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability.  This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the mainstream media, whereby women {{are assumed to be}} perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance. Hence, a women’s attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society’s obsession with thinness.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism, [...] "Antisemitic {{discourse}} is, by its nature, {{harder to}} identify and define than a physical attack on a person or place." [...] It is not normally targeted at an identifiable victim, but at Jews as a group. It influences and reflects hostile attitudes to Jews and Jewish-related issues, and can fuel antisemitic incidents against Jews and Jewish institutions. It {{may be found in}} <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> in more private social interaction and often reflects some of the features of old antisemitism, playing on Jewish stereotypes and myths, and seldom uses expression of contemporary antisemitism.|$|E

Despite not agreeing with Rosenblat, the family never revealed the truth to <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> Rosenblat's publishers or producers.

2500|$|Honorific nicknames {{in popular}} music are terms used, {{most often in}} <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> by fans, to {{indicate}} the significance of an artist, and are often religious, familial, or (most frequently) royal and aristocratic titles, used metaphorically. Honorific nicknames were used in classical music in Europe {{as early as the}} early nineteenth century, with figures such as Mozart being called [...] "The father of modern music" [...] and Bach [...] "The father of modern piano music". They were also particularly prominent in African-American culture in the post-Civil War era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery, and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie.|$|E
2500|$|Keane has reiterated his displeasure {{with the}} {{attitude}} and selection {{policy of the}} FAI. In March 2007, Keane claimed that several Republic of Ireland players get picked {{solely on the basis}} of their media exposure and that the organisation was biased towards players originating from Dublin or other regions of Leinster: [...] "Once you keep playing them on the reputation they've built up through <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> because they do lots of interviews, then it's wrong. There's a fine line between loyalty and stupidity." [...] Keane claimed that Sunderland player Liam Miller was not picked because he was from Cork and that players with significant potential were failing to get picked for the national team. He also alleged that the FAI were incompetent in the running of their affairs.|$|E
2500|$|A {{third term}} of The Global Village that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. The tetrad is {{something}} like threads in a complexly interwoven flowing superspace, a four-fold pattern of transformation. [...] "At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other." [...] Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>or</b> technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.|$|E
