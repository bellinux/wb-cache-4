5|$|In the UK, {{the use of}} cyclodienes as seed {{dressings}} for autumn-sown cereals {{was banned}} in 1975 and the levels of the chemicals present in the bird population began to fall. <b>The</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> largely recovered to pre-decline levels, with an increase seen in many areas, for example northern Europe. In Sweden, the population also decreased drastically from the 1950s, but recovered again once organochlorines were banned in the 1970s.|$|E

The borough of Basingstoke was merged with other local districts in 1974 to form the borough of Basingstoke and Deane. Since then most census data {{has been for the}} larger area: before 1974, census information was published for the town as a separate entity.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} {{for the great}} spotted woodpecker is estimated at 73.7–110.3million individuals, with 35% {{of the population in}} Europe. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable or slightly increasing, especially in Britain, where <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> recently overspilled into Ireland. For this reason the great spotted woodpecker is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|By 1860, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> was 120. By 1936, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>had</b> {{grown to}} 250. By 1958 however, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>had</b> dwindled down to 200. In 1993 {{and again in}} 2000, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> was 145.|$|R
25|$|Palmyra {{continued}} to grow steadily through the 19th & 20th Centuries. By 1845, the settlement consisted of 160 people in about 20 dwellings.

5|$|There is some {{optimism}} {{about the possibility of}} future developments in, for example, renewable energy generation, tourism, and education, and after declines in the 20th century <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> stabilised since 2003, although it is ageing.|$|E
5|$|Trapping resumed in the U.S. after 1962 once numbers had {{recovered}} sufficiently. During the early 1970s, {{the value of}} fisher pelts soared, leading to another population crash in 1976. After {{a couple of years}} of closed seasons, fisher trapping re-opened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits. <b>The</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite a much lower pelt value.|$|E
5|$|Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) (Griffith, 1821): Also {{called the}} Iranian or Indian cheetah. Formerly {{occurred}} across the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), it {{is confined to}} Iran, and is thus the only surviving cheetah subspecies indigenous to Asia. It has been classified as Critically Endangered. A 2004 study estimated the total population at 50 to 60. Later, a 2007 study gave the total population in Iran as 60 to 100; the majority of individuals {{were likely to be}} juveniles. <b>The</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> declined sharply since the mid-1970s. As of 2012, only two captive individuals are known.|$|E
50|$|In 1881, {{the year}} of the first census of England and Wales, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> of Hudswell was 181. By 1891, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>had</b> {{increased}} to 223.

5|$|Beatty's {{population}} grew {{slowly in the}} first half of the 20thcentury, rising from 169 in 1929 to 485 in 1950. The first reliable electric company in the community, Amargosa Power Company, began supplying electricity in about 1940. Phone service arrived during World War II, and the town installed a community-wide sewer system in the 1970s. When a new mine opened west of Beatty in 1988, the population briefly surged from about 1,000 to between 1,500 and 2,000 by the end of 1990. Since the mine's closing in 1998, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> fallen again to near its former level.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of the {{population}} and settlements in the county continued during the Tudor and more recent periods. Agriculture and coal mining expanded until the 18th century, although other industries declined during the industrial revolution. In modern times <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> grown, particularly in the seaside towns, notably Weston-super-Mare. Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the acreage of apple orchards is less than it once was.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of {{the plan}} will reduce waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata of <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance. According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation {{of the plan}} will increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other things being equal).|$|E

5|$|In recent years, Gyeongju has {{followed}} the same trends that have affected the rest of South Korea. Like {{the country as a}} whole, Gyeongju has seen its population age and the size of families shrink. For instance, the mean household size is 2.8 people. Because this has fallen in recent years, there are more households in the city as of 2008 (105,009) than there were in 2003, even though <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> fallen.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.|$|E
5|$|On land, young sea otters {{may face}} attack from bears and coyotes. In California, bites from sharks, {{particularly}} great white sharks, have been estimated to cause 10% of sea otter deaths and {{are one of}} the reasons <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> not expanded further north. The great white shark is believed to be their primary predator, and dead sea otters have been found with injuries from shark bites, although {{there is no evidence that}} sharks actually eat them.|$|E
50|$|As of 1831 {{there were}} 2,918 inhabitants, of whom 173 {{lived in the}} village.According to a 2002 Census, Quin <b>had</b> a <b>population</b> of 853.

5|$|Since the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> {{increased}} considerably, {{with the}} population of West Mersea rising from 3,140 in 1961 to 6,925 in 2001. Mersea Island has suffered less from the increased popularity of holidaying abroad when compared to nearby resorts such as Clacton and Southend, predominantly due to its isolated and rural atmosphere, and the continued popularity of sailing. In 2006, {{more than a thousand}} locals signed a petition against the proposed opening of a Tesco Express store on the island, expressing concern that it would take trade away from local businesses. Planning permission was granted the following year.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota is {{relatively}} notable for {{its lack of}} large urban centers. Sioux Falls, the largest city in the state, only ranks as the 152nd largest in the country, and the state's third-largest city, Aberdeen, {{has a population of}} less than 25,000. However, because the population in many rural areas has decreased over the last 50 years, and many cities in the state have grown at a rapid pace; <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>has</b> become more concentrated and less rural than it once was. According to 2007 census estimates, the three most populous counties in the state, Minnehaha, Pennington, and Lincoln, were home to 38.8% of South Dakotans, while in 1910, those counties held only 9.3% of the population.|$|E
