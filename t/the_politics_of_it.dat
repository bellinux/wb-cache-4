6000|$|... "--executive power," [...] he {{was saying}} as Lydia entered. [...] "That's a very good expression, gentlemen, and one that I can tell you a lot about. We {{have been told that}} if we want to civilize our neighbors we must do it mainly by the example of our own lives, by each {{becoming}} a living illustration of the highest culture we know. But what I ask is, how is anybody to know that you're an illustration of culture. You can't go about like a sandwich man with a label on your back to tell all the fine notions you have in your head; and you may be sure no person will consider your mere appearance preferable to his own. You want an executive power; that's what you want. Suppose you walked along the street and saw a man beating a woman, and setting a bad example to the roughs. Well, you would be bound to set a good example to them; and, if you're men, you'd like to save the woman; but you couldn't do it by merely living; for that would be setting the bad example of passing on and leaving the poor creature to be beaten. What is it that you need to know then, in order to act up to your fine ideas? Why, {{you want to know how}} to hit him, when to hit him, and where to hit him; and then you want the nerve to go in and do it. That's executive power; and that's what's wanted worse than sitting down and thinking how good you are, which is what this gentleman's teaching comes to after all. Don't you see? You want executive power to set an example. If you leave all that to the roughs, it's their example that will spread, and not yours. And look at <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> We've heard a good deal about the French to-night. Well, they've got executive power. They know how to make a barricade, and how to fight behind it when they've made it. What's the result? Why, the French, if they only knew what they wanted, could have it to-morrow for the asking--more's the pity that they don't know. In this country we can do nothing; and if the lords and the landlords, or any other collection of nobs, were to drive us into the sea, what could we do but go? There's a gentleman laughing at me for saying that; but I ask him what would he do if the police or the soldiers came this evening and told him to turn out of his comfortable house into the Thames? Tell 'em he wouldn't vote for their employers at the next election, perhaps? Or, if that didn't stop them, tell 'em that he'd ask his friends to do the same? That's a pretty executive power! No, gentlemen. Don't let yourself be deceived by people that have staked their money against you. The first thing to learn is how to fight. There's no use in buying books and pictures unless you know how to keep them and your own head as well. If that gentleman that laughed know how to fight, and his neighbors all knew how to fight too, he wouldn't need to fear police, nor soldiers, nor Russians, nor Prussians, nor any of the millions of men that may be let loose on him any day of the week, safe though he thinks himself. But, says you, let's have a division of labor. Let's not fight for ourselves, but pay other men to fight for us. That shows how some people, when they get hold of an idea, will work it to that foolish length that it's wearisome to listen to them. Fighting is the power of self-preservation; another man can't do it for you. You might as well divide the labor of eating your dinner, and pay one fellow to take the beef, another the beer, and a third the potatoes. But let us put it for the sake of argument that you do pay others to fight for you. Suppose some one else pays them higher, and they fight a cross, or turn openly against you! You'd have only yourself to blame for giving the executive power to money. And so long as the executive power is money the poor will be kept out of their corner and fouled against the ropes; whereas, by what I understand, the German professor wants them to have their rights. Therefore I say that a man's first duty is to learn to fight. If he can't do that he can't set an example; he can't stand up for his own rights or his neighbors'; he can't keep himself in bodily health; and if he sees the weak ill-used by the strong, the most he can do is to sneak away and tell the nearest policeman, who most likely won't turn up until the worst of the mischief is done. Coming to this lady's drawing-room, and making an illustration of himself, won't make him feel like a man after that. Let me be understood, though, gentlemen: I don't intend that you should take everything I say too exactly--too literally, as it were. If you see a man beating a woman, I think you should interfere on principle. But don't expect to be thanked by her for it; and keep your eye on her; don't let her get behind you. As for him, just give him a good one and go away. Never stay to get yourself into a street fight; for it's low, and generally turns out badly for all parties. However, that's only a bit of practical advice. It doesn't alter the great principle that you should get an executive power. When you get that, you'll have courage in you; and, what's more, your courage will be of some use to you. For though you may have courage by nature, still, if you haven't executive power as well, your courage will only lead you to stand up to be beaten by men that have both courage and executive power; and what good does that do you? People say that you're a game fellow; but they won't find the stakes for you unless you can win them. You'd far better put your game in your pocket, and throw up the sponge while you can see to do it.|$|E

The four men and one woman exchange tales about their early years, some went to prison the majority of their young lives, while others held meetings with their groups members to discuss issues in their communities and governments. Act One ends with the Bethlehem schoolgirl talking about her life in Israel around Christmas and how she feels hostility towards local soldiers.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} journey between my worlds, the North and the South, {{examining}} {{the politics and}} poetics of diaspora. In this process I’ve assembled an archive of memory that has been complied over many years. This archive {{is a collection of}} memories and artefacts, of items that I still keep as well as items that were left behind a long time ago, and whose imprints are still very much alive in me. Furthermore, this thesis deals with art in Chile that arose out of the tumultuous period of unrest and unbalance following the rise of the dictatorship in 1973. In this thesis, I deal with artists such as Alfredo Jaar, Lotty Rosenfeld, and Eugenio Dittborn, among others. The work of these artists during this artistic period of resistance is constantly imprinted with signs and codes, as well as staunchness and obliqueness, marking a pivotal role in the continued resistance to the oppressors. Likewise, throughout this thesis I examine the ideas and the prevalently latent shift or “in-betweeness” that exists in the narrative of diaspora and in my own narrative as well. Here, I examine the works of artists, cultural theorists and writers including Stuart Hall, Edward Said, Nelly Richard, James Luna, and Salman Rushdie (among others) to reflect on how their work has influenced, shaped and directed my study of Diaspora, and to a greater extent, my understanding of <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Likewise, throughout his thesis I work to understand of the heterogeneous yet situated bodies of knowledge and experience that make up the contemporary cultural archive of diaspora. This includes various definitions of diaspora that both interrupt the text as well as enrich it...|$|E
40|$|Although Foucault did {{not address}} the {{question}} of the animal, he asserted the assessment of whether a new politics of truth can be constituted as 2 ̆ 2 the essential political problem 2 ̆ 2 (1980, p. 134). Though the 2 ̆ 2 essential political problem 2 ̆ 2 may be considered {{as it relates to the}} politics of truth about animals, a Foucaultian perspective does not allow a prediction in response, other than the recognition that change may occur. What is understood to be 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 about animals may change if the relationships between events that exist at a given time (2 ̆ 2 conditions 2 ̆ 2) require the emergence of a different way of knowing. This Foucaultian critique of thought about animals examines 2 ̆ 2 truth 2 ̆ 2 about animals as an historical contingency, variable according to the conditions that have allowed its production. This project contributes to the development of a theoretical context of the politics of truth about animals. The politics of truth about animals is understood to be the push and pull of knowledge generated and perpetuated about them, together with concurrent power apparatuses in support of that knowledge as well as the ever present resistance to that power. By applying and extending Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s theory of power -that is, that knowledge is a carrier of power, power is a perpetuator of knowledge, and all power relations have resistances - this work employs Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s archaeological method to uncover dominant and subjugated discourses about animals and to describe power-knowledge associated with statements about animals that are understood to convey true things. This project describes the changeable nature of 2 ̆ 2 truth 2 ̆ 2 about animals and, necessarily, <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> since the politics of truth is understood to be propelled by whichever knowledge and associated power are then dominant. Statements in 2 ̆ 2 error 2 ̆ 2 are also examined as resistance to power-knowledge about animals. The project describes subjugated discourses about animals that have been understood in various times and places to have truth-telling powers or, at least, to have been understood as 2 ̆ 2 error, 2 ̆ 2 which provided points of resistance to the dominant discourse. It describes the partial derivation of discourse about animals by examining dominant discourses (e. g., the discourse of law and the discourse of lines) and subjugated discourses (e. g., animals are not personal property, karmic discourse, transmigration of souls discourse, rational animal discourse). Additionally, it describes like disperse statements among different referents (i. e., slave, animal, woman) that comprise various discursive formations that have been understood at various times to have truth-telling power about different referents. Subjugated discourse sometimes emerges as new 2 ̆ 2 truth, 2 ̆ 2 though no such prediction can be made. To illustrate the point, the project describes the emergence of the new academic field related to the question of the animal, which resurrects or draws from some subjugated discourse (e. g., animals are not personal property) ...|$|E
