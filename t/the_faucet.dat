5|$|In {{day-to-day life}} {{all of us}} observe that a stream of water {{emerging}} from a faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from <b>the</b> <b>faucet.</b> This {{is due to a}} phenomenon called the Plateau–Rayleigh instability, which is entirely a consequence of the effects of surface tension.|$|E

At least that is what they think until they {{discover}} how interesting things always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises {{up in the air and}} into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of <b>the</b> <b>faucet</b> in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.|$|E
25|$|Retail water tariffs. The same retail tariff {{structure}} {{applies to the}} entire country. Water and sewer tariffs in Morocco follow an increasing-block {{tariff structure}}, under which the tariff per cubic meter rises as consumption increases. The residential tariff has four blocks, the lowest applying to consumption of less than 6 m³ per month and the highest to consumption above 40 m³ per month. However, the level of retail tariffs varies from one locality to another. Standpipe services, which are common for the urban poor, are typically free. Utilities send bills to local governments. In a few cases, standpipe management has been entrusted to a gardien/gérant, who operates <b>the</b> <b>faucet</b> and charges users. According to a World Bank report, free standpipe services are pro-poor. But they are also increasingly unsustainable for operators, {{both in terms of}} wasted water (up to 40 percent) and in terms of lack of revenues. Operators are in favor of promoting individual connections in order to strengthen their revenue base.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{electric}} <b>faucet</b> {{concept was}} realized and demonstrated by embedding cobalt nanocrystals in a TiN/SiO 2 /FeOx/FePt structure. The thermal annealing induced cobalt nanocrystals in silicon oxide would shrink both the operation voltage and variation {{as well as}} improves <b>the</b> electric <b>faucet</b> stability. <b>The</b> thickness effect and area size effect would be discussed, which indicated the optimized design and possible resistive switching mechanism for the FeOx-based memristor. The improvement of resistive switching stabilities and switching power characteristics show that the embedded nanocrystals in the insulating layer would localize <b>the</b> electric <b>faucet</b> formation and rupture at interface region. Importantly, a proposed mathematical model to describe the compliance current effect shows that <b>the</b> electric <b>faucet</b> was grown in two dimensions. These electrical results not only provide a possible physical picture to image the dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> electric <b>faucet’s</b> growth, but also introduce a possible mathematical method to quantify <b>the</b> electric <b>faucet</b> properties...|$|R

500|$|As the clitoris's {{external}} location {{does not}} allow for direct stimulation by sexual penetration, any external clitoral stimulation while in the missionary position usually results from the pubic bone area, the movement of the groins when in contact. As such, some couples may engage in the woman-on-top position or the coital alignment technique, a technique combining the [...] "riding high" [...] variation of the missionary position with pressure-counterpressure movements performed by each partner in rhythm with sexual penetration, to maximize clitoral stimulation. Lesbian couples may engage in tribadism for ample clitoral stimulation or for mutual clitoral stimulation during whole-body contact. Pressing the penis or a dildo in a gliding or circular motion against the clitoris (intercrural sex), or stimulating it by movement against another body part, during any number of sex positions, may also be practiced. A vibrator, or specifically a clitoral vibrator, or other sex toys, may be used during or absent of any of the aforementioned practices. Other women stimulate the clitoris by use of a pillow or other inanimate object, by a jet of water from <b>the</b> <b>faucet</b> of a bathtub or shower, or by closing their legs and rocking.|$|E
500|$|It was in Indianapolis that Ruth Hoskins {{learned the}} game, {{and took it}} back to Atlantic City. After she arrived, Hoskins made a new board with Atlantic City street names and railroads, and taught it {{to a group of}} local Quakers. It has been argued that their {{greatest}} contribution to the game was to reinstate the original Lizzie Magie rule of [...] "buying properties at their listed price" [...] rather than auctioning them, as the Quakers did not believe in auctions. Another source states that the Quakers simply [...] "didn't like the noise of the auctioneering." [...] Among the group taught the game by Hoskins were Eugene Raiford and his wife, who took a copy of the game with Atlantic City street names to Philadelphia. Due to the Raifords' unfamiliarity with streets and properties in Philadelphia, the Atlantic City-themed version was the one taught to Charles Todd, who in turn taught Esther Darrow, wife of Charles Darrow. After learning the game, Darrow then began to distribute the game himself as Monopoly and never spoke to the Todds again. Darrow initially made the sets of the Monopoly game by hand {{with the help of his}} first son, William Darrow, and his wife. Their new sets retained Charles Todd's misspelling of [...] "Marvin Gardens" [...] and the renaming of the Shore Fast Line the Short Line. Charles Darrow drew the designs with a drafting pen on round pieces of oilcloth, and then his son and his wife helped fill in the spaces with colors and make the title deed cards and the Chance cards and Community Chest cards. After the demand for the game increased, Darrow contacted a printing company, Patterson and White, which printed the designs of the property spaces on square carton boards. Darrow's game board designs included elements later made famous in the version eventually produced by Parker Brothers, including black locomotives on the railroad spaces, the car on [...] "Free Parking", the red arrow for [...] "Go", <b>the</b> <b>faucet</b> on [...] "Water Works", the light bulb on [...] "Electric Company", and the question marks on the [...] "Chance" [...] spaces, though many of the actual icons were created by a hired graphic artist. While Darrow received a copyright on his game in 1933, its specimens have disappeared from the files of the United States Copyright Office, though proof of its registration remains.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} access the water, one would go through the {{entrance}} (sar-dar) [...] which would always be open, traverse a stairway and reach the bottom where there would be faucets {{to access the}} water in the storage. Next to <b>the</b> <b>faucet</b> would be a built-in seat or platform, a water drain for disposing water from <b>the</b> <b>faucet,</b> and ventilation shafts. Depending on where (i.e. what depth) the faucets would be, the water would be colder or warmer. Some storages would have multiple faucets located at intervals along the stairway. Thus nobody had direct access to the body of water itself, hence minimizing possible contamination. The storage compartment is completely isolated from the outside except for ventilation shafts or windcatchers. To further minimize contamination, the storage tank’s interior was scattered with a salty compound that would form a surface on top of the water. The storage tank would then be monitored year round to ensure that the surface had not been disturbed. The water of course would be drawn from the bottom using the pasheer.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> role of <b>faucets</b> as {{a reservoir}} for Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization/infection of patients hospitalized {{in intensive care}} units (ICUs). DESIGN: Prospective epidemiological investigation performed during a nonepidemic period of 1 year. The inner part of <b>the</b> ICU <b>faucets</b> were swabbed for P. aeruginosa. Data were recorded on all patients {{with at least one}} culture of a clinical specimens positive for P. aeruginosa. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to characterize the strains. SETTING: Five ICUs of a university hospital which are supplied by two separate water distribution networks. PATIENTS: During a 1 -year period 132 cases were investigated. RESULTS: In 42 % of cases (56 / 132) there were isolates identical to those found in <b>the</b> <b>faucets,</b> with a total of nine different genotypes. Among the nine genotypes isolated from both patients and faucets one of them, the most prevalent, was isolated in the two networks and in 30 cases. The other eight genotypes were recovered almost exclusively from either one (three genotypes in 12 cases) or the other (five genotypes in 12 cases) network and from the patients in the corresponding ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the water system of the ICUs was the primary reservoir of patient's colonization/infection with P. aeruginosa in a substantial proportion of patients, although the exact mode of acquisition could not be determined...|$|R
