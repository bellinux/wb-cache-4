Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of <b>table</b> <b>salt</b> mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate.

The iodine content {{of each of the}} three brands of salt sample were carried out using the titrimetric method. Potassium Iodide (KI) was used for salt iodization. Results show that the Dangote fine edible salt contained 39. 6 ppm of iodine while the Royal edible salt contained 41. 8 ppm and the Mr. Chef edible salt contained 42. 9 ppm. The result confirms that each of the three samples met the iodine content requirements approved by NAFDAC.

An electrolytic cell for the determination of iodine was constructed which was based on redox reaction. The determination of iodine was done by using KI electrolysis mechanism.

5|$|<b>Table</b> <b>salt</b> {{is made up}} of {{just under}} 40% sodium by weight, so a 6g serving (1teaspoon) {{contains}} about 2,300mg of sodium.

Most of the sodium in the Western diet comes from salt. The habitual salt intake in many Western countries is about 10 g per day, and it is higher than that in many countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The high level of sodium in many processed foods has a major impact on the total amount consumed.

Micro- and nano-particles of silver were investigated for the fabrication of different electrodes. The iodide assay was based on IC with amperometric detection (IC-AD) at a silver composite electrode polarized at + 0. 080 V versus Ag/AgCl. Free iodide and organoiodide compounds were studied. The detection process was characterized by studying the redox behavior of iodide ions at both silver and silver composite electrodes by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The presence of iodide ions in solution was found to considerably facilitate metallic silver oxidation, with response currents directly related to iodide concentration. The calibration curve at the selected silver carbon paste electrode was linear in the concentration range comprised between 0. 635 microg/L and 63. 5 microg/L iodide. The relative standard deviation (R. S. D.) for successive injections was below 3 % for all iodide standard solutions investigated. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0. 47 microg/L (3. 7 nmol/L) for an injection volume of 20 microL, i. e. 74 fmol injected.
