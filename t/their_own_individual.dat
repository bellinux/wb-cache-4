In the fashion advice book, women can interpret which shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>individual</b> shape.

5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>individual</b> levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E

5|$|The Witness {{uses its}} own engine {{developed}} by Blow and his team, which took {{a significant portion}} of the development time. Blow was insistent on using his own game engine instead of an existing solution such as Unity, as he would be able to fully control every element of a game engine that he created himself. As a compact game world compared to open-world games, the whole of the island of The Witness was treated as one zone, simplifying the gameplay and engine development. This presented a secondary challenge to the team as to concurrently work on the project, they needed to find a means to allow multiple developers to edit areas without resorting to using locking on their version control system as well as being able to work without being connected to a central server. Blow and his team developed an unconventional means of serializing the game world into text files that would have revision control while at the same time making it easy for individuals to discover conflicting edits. They also converted the 10,000-some entities in the game world into <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>individual</b> files for tracking to further reduce conflict between edits. Other features of this system including using defined control points for terrain elements to automatically recalculate seamless connections between them within the game's rendering engine, and a built-in world editor within the game engine to easily access existing serialized elements and create new ones.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{information}} fusion architectures {{are challenged}} by developments in sensor networks that allow individually-owned (and thereby selfish) sensors to interact and share data. Given this, we advocate {{the use of}} tools and techniques from computational mechanism design, a field {{at the intersection of}} computer science, game theory and economics, to address the challenges posed by these networks. These techniques allow us to engineer networks with desirable system-wide properties, in which sensors are represented as selfish rational agents, each attempting to fulfill <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>individuals</b> goals. In this paper, we present the work of the Argus II DARP project ([URL] and we demonstrate the application of mechanism design within a real world information fusion sensor network scenario.
