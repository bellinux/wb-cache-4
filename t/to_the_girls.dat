The Marias also attended the première of the film You, Me and Dupree in Leicester Square.|$|E
5|$|Among Waugh's growing {{circle of}} friends were Diana Guinness and Bryan Guinness (dedicatees of Vile Bodies), Lady Diana Cooper and her husband Duff Cooper, Nancy Mitford who was {{originally}} a friend of Evelyn Gardner's, and the Lygon sisters. Waugh had known Hugh Patrick Lygon at Oxford; now he was introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> and their country house, Madresfield Court, which became the closest {{that he had to}} a home during his years of wandering. In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer Aubrey Herbert. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in Portofino, where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.|$|E

5|$|Several days earlier, Black meets Emma Shetterly (Gwynyth Walsh), the school's vice-principal. Shetterly {{explains}} that five students have {{claimed to be}} experiencing visions of Saint Mary; she believes the girls involved are unlikely candidates for divine visions, particularly the trouble-making Clare McKenna (Genele Templeton). Black speaks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls,</b> who claim to have had visions during a sermon by Reverend Hanes; Hanes' son Alex refutes this. Black returns to Shetterly's office, and is met by Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who works {{with her husband in}} the Millennium Group. Means {{explains that}} the Group has explored many such reported visions.|$|E
5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girls</b> Dead Monster songs.|$|E

5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on December 9, 1910. Both films are comedies, but Thanhouser advertisements refer <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Girls</b> He Left Behind Him as a drama. The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain, but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls He Left Behind Him as being three-quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel in length. This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production, {{which could have been}} about 625 feet and 400 feet in length and still be a single reel. Very few advertisements for the films have been found, but the films likely had a wide national release. One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri, but The Girls He Left Behind Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater. Selig would release a similarly titled work The Girl He Left Behind in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The Powerpuff Girls Movie was {{released}} in the United States on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. and Cartoon Network. The movie, a prequel to the series, {{tells the story of}} how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain. After Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium to help the city against crime, they end up only causing chaos in Townsville. Down about how everyone refers to them as freaks, they turn to Mojo Jojo, a monkey who says he is there to help make people like them again. Unknown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls,</b> Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's lab chimp helper who was mutated as a cause from the Powerpuff Girls being made and has become super smart as a result and jealous of them. Mojo Jojo ends up tricking the girls into helping him make a machine to mutate other chimps. Seeing what they have done the kids run away in shame but come back after seeing Professor Utonium in trouble, and Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup end up beating Mojo Jojo and his army of mutated smart chimps and saving the day, thus becoming Townsville's new defenders. The movie received a rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes and received some criticism for the violence involved. In all, the movie grossed $16 million worldwide with an $11 million budget.|$|E

25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{maintain that}} the devadasi system is not described in the holy scriptures of Hinduism as the scriptures do not refer to any form of sacred prostitution or temple girls.

25|$|The Company grew rapidly, being {{joined by}} women from {{throughout}} {{her hometown of}} Desenzano. They came to be organized in groups, according to the parish in which they lived, and the Company spread throughout the Diocese of Brescia. One of the early works of the new Company was to give religious instruction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> of the town at the parish church each Sunday, which was an innovation for the period, having traditionally been left to the local parish priest. Their work quickly spread to other dioceses in the region. Angela Merici died on 27 January 1540.|$|E

25|$|By {{the year}} 1866-67 a {{movement}} was afoot for remodelling Bethune School {{because the school}} was not sought after. That Banga Mahila Vidyalaya was higher type of school was also admitted. Monomohun Ghose who was secretary to the Bethune School Committee was also connected with Banga Mahila Vidyalaya. He played {{an important part in}} the amalgamation of these two institutions. Chief Justice Sir Richard Garth, who was president of Bethune School paid a visit to Banga Mahila Vidyalaya and was highly pleased with the arrangements and the instruction imparted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls.</b> The result was an offer from the committee of Bethune School to Banga Mahila Vidyalaya for amalgamation, which came about on 1 August 1878. With the amalgamation Bethune School entered a new phase in its history.|$|E

Christine told the expert, Paul Atterbury, that she believed, as her mother had done, that the fairies in the fifth photograph were genuine. Atterbury estimated the value of the items at between £25,000 and £30,000. The first edition of Frances' memoirs was published a few months later, under the title Reflections on the Cottingley Fairies.
