5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E
25|$|Mary was a {{striking}} {{six feet tall}} presence with a curvy figure. She had large grey eyes set in an oval face, glossy chestnut-brown hair drawn back into a loose knot at <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> and delicate hands and feet.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, American {{journalist}} Marguerite Young {{interviewed her}} father {{at his own}} request for the CPUSA-controlled Daily Worker. Young noted that Dodd met her because she already knew his daughter Martha. She wrote of Martha, [...] "his daughter, whom I'd met and liked, an attractive young woman, light yellow hair, large black velvet bow at <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck." ...|$|R
60|$|Nor was he {{disappointed}} entirely, for as {{she walked}} away she raised one hand to the black, waving mass at <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck--the peculiarly feminine gesture that admits cognizance of appraising eyes behind her--and Tarzan saw upon a finger of this hand the ring of strange workmanship {{that he had seen}} upon the finger of the veiled woman a short time before.|$|R
60|$|Clara sat in {{the cool}} parlour reading. He saw <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white neck, and the fine hair lifted from it. She rose, looking at him indifferently. To shake hands she lifted her arm straight, {{in a manner that}} seemed at once to keep him at a distance, and yet to fling {{something}} to him. He noticed how her breasts swelled inside her blouse, and how her shoulder curved handsomely under the thin muslin at the top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|R
25|$|Mating occurs from May through June. Copulation is {{preceded by}} {{numerous}} head-bobs {{on the part}} of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> He then attempts to restrain the female in order to maneuver his tail under hers to position himself for intromission. Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. Anywhere from two to eighteen eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. The eggs go through a 90- to 100-day incubation period hatching in September and October. It has been noted that Cyclura eggs are some of the largest eggs laid by any lizard.|$|E
500|$|While filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Padukone began {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} with co-star Ranbir Kapoor. She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> She {{has said that the}} relationship {{had a profound effect on}} her, transforming her into a more confident and social person. The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years. The couple broke up a year later; she professed in an interview to feeling [...] "angry" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] for a long time, but insisted that they remained on good terms. In a 2010 interview, Padukone made a comment that the media speculated was a reference to her break-up with Kapoor: ...|$|E
500|$|Max was genetically {{engineered}} and carried to term {{by a woman}} who was not permitted to meet her. She was created for a secret government supersoldier program called Manticore, then located in Gillette, Wyoming. As with almost all Manticore's soldiers, Max has a barcode on <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> with her identifying number sequence (332960073452). She is an X5 model and is thus referred to as X5-452. Designed to be [...] "the perfect soldier," [...] Max is extremely strong, athletic and agile. She can see in the dark, can zoom in with her eyes to view distant objects, does not need to sleep and has a photographic memory. She also has enhanced hearing, can leap up or down from great heights with ease, can hold her breath underwater for extended periods and can dodge bullets with her super speed. Max lies, cheats and steals when she needs to and shows no remorse when doing so, though she is morally opposed to guns. Max rides a Kawasaki motorcycle and enjoys riding at high speed. When she wants to be alone she sits atop of the derelict Space Needle. Max's forms 'family' bonds with her best friend and flatmate Original Cindy, her ally Logan Cale and her fellow X5 escapees. Upon escaping from Manticore, Max chooses the last name [...] "Guevara" [...] for herself.|$|E
60|$|Engaged in {{the study}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ear and <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white neck, he {{suddenly}} {{became aware of the}} presence of a lady still further ahead in the aisle, whose attire, though of black materials in the quietest form, was of a cut which rather suggested London than this Ultima Thule. For the minute he forgot, in his curiosity, that Avice intervened. The lady turned her head somewhat, and, though she was veiled with unusual thickness for the season, he seemed to recognize Nichola Pine-Avon in the form.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly--in her American way; a long face, {{with the}} hair parted {{in the middle and}} hanging over <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck. <b>Her</b> mouth is quite classic.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{situation}} {{was not only}} extraordinary in itself, but singularly disturbing to me. Who the girl was, or whence she came, I had no thought or notion as I surveyed her. She would be of about my own age, or perhaps a little younger, and from her garb it was plain that she belonged to the peasant class. She wore a spotless bodice of white linen, which but indifferently concealed the ripening swell <b>of</b> <b>her</b> young breast. <b>Her</b> petticoat, <b>of</b> dark red homespun, stopped short above her bare brown ankles, and her little feet were naked. Her brown hair, long and abundant, was still fastened at <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> slim neck, but fell loose beyond that, having been disturbed, no doubt, in her scuffle with Rinolfo. Her little mouth was deeply red and it held strong young teeth that were as white as milk.|$|R
60|$|Totty, however, had {{descended from}} her chair with great swiftness, and was already in retreat towards the dairy {{with a sort of}} {{waddling}} run, and an amount of fat on <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig.|$|E
6000|$|... "You carried {{yourself}} first rate," [...] said Lingard, {{smiling at}} <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> her ear, the film of escaped hair, the modelling {{of the corner}} of her eye. He could see the flutter of the dark eyelashes: and the delicate flush on her cheek had rather the effect of scent than of colour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hadn't {{you better}} go in?" [...] he suggested, after {{watching}} {{for a while}} <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> a patch of dazzling white skin and soft shadow above the sombre line of her shoulders. Her wrap had slipped down to her elbows. [...] "You'll have all the town coming out presently. I'll wait here a bit." ...|$|E
60|$|Lord Grenville took a hasty {{farewell}} of {{the ladies}} and slipped back into his box, where M. Chauvelin had sat through this ENTR'ACTE, with his eternal snuff-box in his hand, and with his keen pale eyes intently fixed upon a box opposite him, where, with much frou-frou of silken skirts, much laughter and general stir of curiosity amongst the audience, Marguerite Blakeney had just entered, accompanied by her husband, and looking divinely pretty beneath the wealth <b>of</b> <b>her</b> golden, reddish curls, slightly besprinkled with powder, and tied back at <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> graceful neck with a gigantic black bow. Always dressed in the very latest vagary of fashion, Marguerite alone among the ladies that night had discarded the crossover fichu and broad-lapelled over-dress, which had been in fashion {{for the last two}} or three years. She wore the short-waisted classical-shaped gown, which so soon was to become the approved mode in every country in Europe. It suited her graceful, regal figure to perfection, composed as it was of shimmering stuff which seemed a mass of rich gold embroidery.|$|R
5000|$|Further in 1935, U.S. {{ambassador}} to Germany, William E. Dodd, personally described to her Young publication FDR's {{lack of support}} for him. She notes that Dodd met her because she already knew his daughter, Martha Dodd, who was (unbeknownst to her father) a Soviet spy.) She writes of Martha [...] "his daughter, whom I'd met and liked, an attractive young woman, light yellow hair, large black velvet bow at <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck." [...] Ambassador Dodd reported to Young that his anger because the State Department had no [...] "secure communications" [...] or meetings: [...] "he could not make an appointment to meet privately with anyone in Berlin, even members of his staff, without its becoming known instantly... both his critics and his supports {{knew what he was}} doing before he told them. Young filed the story-and it never appeared in print. She traveled to New York and met directly with Earl Browder. The only explanation that Browder offered was [...] "'You know that we are supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt'...He just looked very solemn, implacable, and pious, pious, pious." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw her shrug her {{uncovered}} shoulders impatiently. Her forehead {{was against}} the very blackness of the panes; pulled upward from <b>the</b> beautiful, strong <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, <b>the</b> twisted mass <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tawny hair was held high upon her head by the arrow of gold.|$|R
60|$|They {{turned to}} follow Madame into the house. And as Alvina went before him, {{she felt his}} fingers stroke <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> and pass in a soft touch right down her back. She started as if some unseen {{creature}} had stroked her with its paw, and she glanced swiftly round, to see the face of Ciccio mischievous behind her shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well!" [...] he said, {{a little}} doubtfully, [...] "it's just a phase," [...] and {{bent down and}} rested {{his hand on her}} {{shoulder}} for a moment, with his heart beating and his nerves a-quiver. Then as she lay very still, with her hands clinched and her black hair tumbled about her face, he came still closer and softly kissed <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck....</b>|$|E
60|$|Polly sat for {{a little}} time {{on the side of}} the bed, crying. Then she dried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped the end of the towel in the water-jug and {{refreshed}} her eyes with the cool water. She looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear. Then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind secret, amiable memories. She rested <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> against the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a reverie. There was no longer any perturbation visible on her face.|$|E
60|$|The throng {{carried her}} out just before him. He could nearly touch her. She {{did not know}} he was there. He saw <b>the</b> brown, humble <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck under its black curls. He would leave himself to her. She was better and bigger than he. He would depend on her.|$|R

60|$|Jean {{heard a noise}} at {{the cabin}} door, a rustle, and then a knock of {{something}} hard against wood. Silently he moved {{his head to look}} down through a crack between the rafters. He saw the glint of a rifle leaning against the sill. Then the doorstep was darkened. Ellen Jorth sat down with a long, tired sigh. She took off her sombrero and the light shone on the rippling, dark-brown hair, hanging in a tangled braid. <b>The</b> curved <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck showed a warm tint of golden tan. She wore a gray blouse, soiled and torn, that clung to her lissome shoulders.|$|R
60|$|The {{owner of}} the farm was Angus Fraser, {{and he and his}} wife seemed to be a reserved, uncouth pair, with no {{apparent}} interest in life save to scratch a bare living out of their few stony acres. He had an impression that they were childless and was at a loss to place this girl who poured his tea and brought in his toast. She did not resemble either Fraser or his wife. She was certainly not beautiful, being very tall and rather awkward, and dressed in a particularly unbecoming dark print wrapper. Her luxuriant hair was thick and black, and was coiled in a heavy knot at <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Her features were delicate but irregular, and her skin was very brown. Her eyes attracted Reeves's notice especially; they were large and dark and full of a half-unconscious, wistful longing, as if a prisoned soul behind them were vainly trying to reveal itself.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she began}} to dance you forgot her ugliness; her gaunt arms gained shape, her face was transfigured, her dark eyes flashed, and her mouth and smile said a {{thousand}} eloquent things. Even <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> which in most women has no significance, with her was expressive. A consummate actress, she exhibited all her skill in the bolero, which represents a courtship; she threw aside the castanets and wrapped herself in a mantilla, while her companion, dressed as a man, was hidden in a capa. The two passed one another, he trying to see the lady's face, which she averted, but not too strenuously; he pursued, she fled, but not too rapidly. Dropping his cloak, the lover attacked with greater warmth, while alternately she repelled and lured him on. At last she too cast away the mantilla. They seized the castanets and danced round one another with all manner of graceful and complicated evolutions, making love, quarrelling, pouting, exhibiting every variety of emotion. The dance grew more passionate, the steps flew faster, till at last, with the music, both stopped suddenly dead still. This abrupt cessation {{is one of the}} points most appreciated by a Spanish audience. 'Ole!' they cry,'bien parado!' ...|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{hung up the}} 'phone {{and flew}} to Jims. But she did not wring that injured infant's neck. Instead she {{snatched}} him bodily out of his chair, crushed him against her face, kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth, and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms. After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity, gave him {{the rest of his}} dinner properly, and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all. She sewed at Red Cross shirts {{for the rest of the}} afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams, all a-quiver with rainbows. Ken wanted to see her--to see her alone. That could be easily managed. Shirley wouldn't bother them, father and mother were going to the Manse, Miss Oliver never played gooseberry, and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven. She would entertain Ken on the veranda--it would be moonlight--she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up--yes, she would--at least in a low knot at <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Mother couldn't object to that, surely. Oh, how wonderful and romantic it would be! Would Ken say anything--he must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone? What if it rained--Susan had been complaining about Mr. Hyde that morning! What if some officious Junior Red called to discuss Belgians and shirts? Or, worst of all, what if Fred Arnold dropped in? He did occasionally.|$|E

[...] She turned; <b>the</b> very <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white neck [...] Was rosed with indignation: but the Prince [...] Her brother came; the king her father charmed [...] Her wounded soul with words: nor did mine own [...] Refuse her proffer, lastly gave his hand.|$|R
5000|$|Hans Edvard Nørregård-Nielsen notes how {{the subject}} who is leaning towards {{the right is}} offset by the platter she is holding on her hip. The effect is {{achieved}} with strong brush-strokes which provide a balancing contrast with the blue and white tureen in the left half of the picture. It serves to concentrate the viewer's attention on <b>the</b> pretty <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, highlighted between the demure black dress and the simple tight braid <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair. It has also been noted that the portrait {{is a good example}} of light and shade. Ida's dark hair contrasts with the fair skin on her neck with light coming in from the left, while her black clothing stands out against the pale background, while the play of light and shadow on the folds <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress adds depth to the otherwise flat character of the painting.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the first}} and most {{important}} preparation for that event the old fellow ordered from his Singapore agent a Steyn and Ebhart's [...] "upright grand." [...] I was then commanding a little steamer in the island trade, and it fell to my lot to take it out to him, so I know something of Freya's [...] "upright grand." [...] We landed the enormous packing-case with difficulty on a flat piece of rock amongst some bushes, nearly knocking the bottom out of one of my boats in the course of that nautical operation. Then, all my crew assisting, engineers and firemen included, by the exercise of much anxious ingenuity, and by means of rollers, levers, tackles, and inclined planes of soaped planks, toiling in the sun like ancient Egyptians at the building of a pyramid, we got it as far as the house and up on {{to the edge of the}} west verandah--which was the actual drawing- room of the bungalow. There, the case being ripped off cautiously, the beautiful rosewood monster stood revealed at last. In reverent excitement we coaxed it against the wall and drew the first free breath of the day. It was certainly the heaviest movable object on that islet since the creation of the world. The volume of sound it gave out in that bungalow (which acted as a sounding-board) was really astonishing. It thundered sweetly right over the sea. Jasper Allen told me that early of a morning on the deck of the Bonito (his wonderfully fast and pretty brig) he could hear Freya playing her scales quite distinctly. But the fellow always anchored foolishly close to the point, as I told him more than once. Of course, these seas are almost uniformly serene, and the Seven Isles is a particularly calm and cloudless spot as a rule. But still, now and again, an afternoon thunderstorm over Banka, or even one of these vicious thick squalls, from the distant Sumatra coast, would make a sudden sally upon the group, enveloping it for a couple of hours in whirlwinds and bluish-black murk of a particularly sinister aspect. Then, with the lowered rattan- screens rattling desperately in the wind and the bungalow shaking all over, Freya would sit down to the piano and play fierce Wagner music in the flicker of blinding flashes, with thunderbolts falling all round, enough to make your hair stand on end; and Jasper would remain stock still on the verandah, adoring the back view <b>of</b> <b>her</b> supple, swaying figure, the miraculous sheen <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fair head, the rapid hands on the keys, <b>the</b> white <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck--while <b>the</b> brig, down at the point there, surged at her cables within a hundred yards of nasty, shiny, black rock-heads. Ugh! ...|$|R
