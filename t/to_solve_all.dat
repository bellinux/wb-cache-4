25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> the major problems. This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated land holding patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, critics contend, have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. They point out that in spite of these measures, Bengal’s agricultural infrastructure and financial situation is no better than in most other states.|$|E
25|$|A Sudoku {{may also}} be {{modelled}} as a constraint satisfaction problem. In his paper Sudoku as a Constraint Problem, Helmut Simonis describes many reasoning algorithms based on constraints which {{can be applied to}} model and solve problems. Some constraint solvers include a method to model and solve Sudokus, and a program may require less than 100 lines of code to solve a simple Sudoku. If the code employs a strong reasoning algorithm, incorporating backtracking is only needed for the most difficult Sudokus. An algorithm combining a constraint-model-based algorithm with backtracking would have the advantage of fast solving time, and the ability <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> sudokus.|$|E
25|$|Also, for {{the first}} time, the limits of {{mathematics}} were explored. Niels Henrik Abel, a Norwegian, and Évariste Galois, a Frenchman, proved {{that there is no}} general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four (Abel–Ruffini theorem). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to trisect an arbitrary angle, to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>all</b> of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks.

In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage.

Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked.
