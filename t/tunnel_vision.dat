5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially <b>tunnel</b> <b>vision),</b> ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness.

The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E

Live and studio recordings were made but never released.In 1998 Ritsema was asked by the local radio station Radio Rijnmond to play during their weekly talk show Studio Gloria. Initially Ritsema reunited with Grem (on piano) and Aalberts, calling themselves Trio Raskolnikov. After a few radio shows, double bassplayer Peter Jessen was recruited and the band name was changed to Mark Ritsema & Trio Raskolnikov. Combining Ritsema's new songs, written each week, with jazzy improvisations, they rapidly became an established band that began playing throughout the Netherlands. With the financial help of Radio Rijnmond and Rotown they also released a collection of radio recordings on CD Studio Gloria (1999). In 2001 they were part of the music, dance and film performance Dorst, with Regina Magnus (choreography, dance), Sanja Hasagic (dance) and Favola Film (visuals) for Rotterdam Cultural Capital. In 2001, together with members of the Q-Club from Hoorn, Ritsema founded UNSOUND, an organisation and record label that established the musical freedom of its members in a lengthy manifest (UNSOUND0001), which is partly an indictment of the commercial, <b>tunnel</b> <b>visioned,</b> music world. In 2003 UNSOUND released new albums by both Q-Club and Raskolnikov (with Aalberts again replaced by De Bruijn), and the two bands also shared the stage during the theatrical music show UNSOUND0007, with visuals and video footage by Favola Film. The recording of the on-line-only album Portrait of Raskolnikov As A Young Man was financed by a group of Raskolnikov fans. During 2007/2008 Raskolnikov was fairly inactive, due to Ritsema's solo-activities, Grem's work for Charlie Dée and Jessens's growing activities in the classical/avant-garde music world. New live shows and recordings are being planned for 2009.|$|R

40|$|In May 2012, {{a meeting}} was held between various {{stakeholder}} {{representatives of the}} Western Baviaanskloof to discuss {{the concept of a}} proposed landowner-enterprise. This concept was put forward in response to a need for collaboration in the midst of economic, environmental and social issues at play in the Baviaanskloof. Owing to the conservation value and rapidly decreasing economic output of the land, a radical shift to sustainable land-use practices was called for by various stakeholders. Suggested as a vehicle to generate income for the local landowners through alternative sustainable land-uses, the proposed enterprise may aid in addressing this shift by use of a bottom-up approach. During the stakeholder meeting, it was requested by the representative landowners that a feasibility assessment be conducted on the concept of the proposed enterprise prior to establishment. As an integral part of this assessment, the researcher took on the task of investigating stakeholder reception to the enterprise by means of a stakeholder analysis. It was decided to limit this to three markets: water, carbon and tourism. The purpose of this research study is twofold, namely to: investigate stakeholder influence and their reception of the proposed enterprise using a stakeholder analysis; and also to identify and advise on the opportunities and constraints relating to stakeholders, thus contributing to determining the feasibility of the proposed enterprise. In achieving the purpose of this study, a systematic stakeholder analysis framework was constructed, based on existing theory. This was necessary because, although stakeholder analysis is commonly practiced, no study was found to provide a theoretically based framework for the purpose of feasibility in the initial stages of enterprise establishment. Thus the contribution of the study is also twofold, namely the practical outcome of determining stakeholder reception for feasibility, and a secondary outcome of constructing a stakeholder analysis framework. The stakeholder analysis framework is based on an interpretation of existing stakeholder theory, with the addition of four "relational indicators" – goals, intentions, relationships, and resources. These four indicators provide a link between theory and practice in gauging the two attributes of stakeholder influence – power and interest. Dealing with a number of stakeholder interests in a unique context, the study takes on a single network case study approach in the paradigm of phenomenology. To suit the complex nature of the study, semi-structured interviews with various stakeholder representatives were conducted, using groups or organisations as units of analysis. Drawing from the stakeholder analysis framework and overall purpose of the study, four research objectives were set. The first was to identify the proposed enterprise's legitimate key external stakeholders, based on the three markets: water, carbon and tourism; the second to describe, categorise and assess relative dyadic influence of the above stakeholders by gauging their power and interest; the third, to determine the stakeholder network influence and probable reception of the proposed enterprise; and the last to advise the landowners on any identified opportunities or constraints stakeholders might pose, and thus to contribute to determining feasibility. In addressing the first objective, 21 stakeholders were identified, 12 of whom were found to be key to the current investigation. These key stakeholders were: Gamtoos Irrigation Board (GIB), LivingLands, R 3 G, Rhodes Restoration Group, Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency (ECPTA), Department of Water Affairs (DWA), Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan (NMBM), Saaimanshoek, South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), Department of Economic Development, Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEDEAT), Baviaans Tourism, and Baviaans Municipality. In applying the stakeholder analysis framework, ECPTA was categorised as the definitive (most influential) stakeholder to the enterprise, and DEDEAT, SANBI (through Working for Wetlands), Baviaans Tourism, GIB, and NMBM were categorised as pivotal (influential and active). In discerning stakeholder interest in the proposed enterprise, a number of emerging themes were found to affect the projected interest and behaviour of stakeholders, apart from their specified goals. Emerging themes included: <b>tunnel</b> <b>visioning,</b> internal disparity, individual/personality clashes, and misaligned interests. In addition to this, in interpreting stakeholder interest, specific intentions or agendas that might affect the interest shown towards the proposed enterprise were also taken into account. Five predominant intentions of stakeholders were identified as: implementing a stewardship programme, establishing a tourism association, establishing a water users' association, social development, and "the big vision". Findings on the final objective revealed a number of perceived opportunities and constraints relative to the feasibility of the enterprise. Three prime opportunities were identified as: partnerships with definitive and pivotal stakeholders, the possibility of tendering for implementer of the "Working for" programmes, and taking on the role of Tourism Association. The following potential constraints were also emphasised by participants: social aspects such as individuals and personalities, the incompatibility or non-existence of local market structures, and the need for external funding. With regard to stakeholder reception, most of the stakeholders, with the exception of NMBM and Saaimanshoek, responded positively to the idea of the enterprise. Overall, based on participant perceptions, the tourism market was found to be the most feasible the carbon market uncertain and a long-term possibility, and the water market the least feasible...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a vehicle autonomous localization method in local area of coal mine <b>tunnel</b> based on <b>vision</b> sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Barcode tags are deployed in pairs {{on both sides}} of the tunnel walls at certain intervals as artificial landmarks. The barcode coding is designed based on UPC-A code. The global coordinates of the upper left inner corner point of the feature frame of each barcode tag deployed in the tunnel are uniquely represented by the barcode. Two on-board vision sensors are used to recognize each pair of barcode tags {{on both sides of}} the tunnel walls. The distance between the upper left inner corner point of the feature frame of each barcode tag and the vehicle center point can be determined by using a visual distance projection model. The on-board ultrasonic sensors are used to measure the distance from the vehicle center point to the left side of the tunnel walls. Once the spatial geometric relationship between the barcode tags and the vehicle center point is established, the 3 D coordinates of the vehicle center point in the tunnel's global coordinate system can be calculated. Experiments on a straight corridor and an underground tunnel have shown that the proposed vehicle autonomous localization method is not only able to quickly recognize the barcode tags affixed to the tunnel walls, but also has relatively small average localization errors in the vehicle center point's plane and vertical coordinates to meet autonomous unmanned vehicle positioning requirements in local area of coal mine tunnel...|$|R
