The militia insurgentsthat were {{fighting}} were behind our compound, I don’t know if they were Al-Shaabab or Hawiye fighters. They were firing mortars and then running away. They were firing the mortars at the TFG and <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopians,</b> at <b>the</b> Presidential Palace and at the Ministry of Defense where <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopians</b> were based.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ethiopians</b> {{advanced}} in three columns of 3,000 men each. In the first attacks, <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopians</b> hurled {{themselves at the}} Italian positions in waves. The fury of the attack and surprisingly accurate mortar fire carried <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopians</b> well into <b>the</b> defensive lines of the [...] "Pusteria" [...] Division. But the mountain troops struck back and soon the front lines were stabilized.|$|R
50|$|The Italian {{mechanized}} columns {{responded with}} a series of out-flanking maneuvers which quickly compelled <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopians</b> to withdraw and leave the field of battle. Unfortunately the weary army could not withdraw fast enough as it was again assaulted from <b>the</b> air. <b>The</b> <b>Ethiopians</b> could find no relief and their withdrawal quickly became a disorganized retreat. In this unequal chase, <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopians</b> were on foot and the Italians were generally in motor vehicles. The Italians blocked the few wells that lay along the way and closely pursued <b>the</b> parched <b>Ethiopians.</b> Ras Desta's army soon disintegrated under these assaults.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> hare is {{endemic to}} Africa, and {{is found in}} the Afromontane Biozone of Ethiopia, and in the borders of the Sudanian Savanna Biozone; it also occurs west of the Rift Valley, in <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> Highlands, and abundantly found around the Lake Tana in Ethiopia. It has also been {{possibly}} recorded in southeastern Sudan and in extreme northwestern Kenya.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> {{highland}} hare is a herbivore, {{and mostly}} feeds on moorland grasses such as bentgrass (Agrostis), goosegrass (Eleusine), Festuca, fountaingrass (Pennisetum) and bluegrass (Poa). At such altitudes in which <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> highland hare lives, {{it is expected}} to reproduce in dry seasons. The female produces one offspring per breeding season. Not much has been recorded about its reproduction and behavior.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> {{highland}} hare {{is similar}} to the Abyssinian hare (Lepus habessinicus) which has grizzled, silvery gray dorsal pelage and has a narrow,black rim {{at the tip of the}} ears. It is also similar to the African savannah hare (Lepus victoriae) which has brown dorsal pelage grizzled with black, and ears having lesser black on tip. Its nuchal patch is brownish-orange to orange, and it has not been observed to occur in <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> plateau.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> {{highland}} hare {{was first}} {{described by the}} French zoologist Francis Petter in 1963. It was originally described as a subspecies of the cape hare (Lepus capensis), but was later given a species status by Renate Angermann in 1983. In 1987, Maria Luisa Azzaroli-Puccetti also listed <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> highland hare as a separate species, although she suggested {{it to be a}} primitive form of the European hare (Lepus europaeus), and is closely related to it, due to the similarity of their skulls. She mentioned that after an interglacial period, the retraction of glaciers Might have isolated the populations of the European hare on <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> plateau, which evolved as a different subspecies. Thus, the scientific name she suggested was L. europaeus starcki.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of General Abdullah Mohamed Fadil, Abdullahi Ahmed Irro and other senior Somali military officials formulated a plan of attack for {{what was to become}} the Ogaden War in Ethiopia. This was part of a broader effort to unite all of the Somali-inhabited territories in the Horn region into a Greater Somalia (Soomaaliweyn). At the start of the offensive, the SNA consisted of 35,000 soldiers, and was vastly outnumbered by <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> forces. Somali national army troops seized the Godey Front on 24 July 1977, after the 60th Division defeated <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> 4th Infantry Division. Godey's capture allowed the Somali side to consolidate its hold on the Ogaden, concentrate its forces, and advance further to other regions of Ethiopia. The invasion reached an abrupt end with the Soviet Union's sudden shift of support to Ethiopia, followed by almost the entire communist world siding with the latter. The Soviets halted supplies to Barre's regime and instead increased the distribution of aid, weapons, and training to Ethiopia's newly communist Derg regime. General Vasily Ivanovich Petrov was assigned to restructure <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> Army. The Soviets also brought in around 15,000 Cuban troops to assist <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> military. By 1978, the Somali forces were pushed out of most of the Ogaden, although it would take nearly three more years for <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> Army to gain full control of Godey.|$|E

50|$|In early February, the Italians {{captured}} Amba Aradam {{and destroyed}} Ras Mulugetas {{army in the}} Battle of Enderta.

5|$|By the 16th century Ethiopian works {{began to}} discuss the {{profound}} impact of foreign peoples in their own regional history. The chronicle of Gelawdewos explained the friction between <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> Orthodox Church and the Catholic missionaries from Spain and Portugal, after {{the arrival of the}} Jesuits in 1555. With the persuasion of Jesuits in his realm, emperor Susenyos I (r. 1607–1632) became the only Ethiopian ruler to convert from Orthodox Christianity to Catholicism, perhaps earlier than the accepted date of 1625, after which his attempts to convert his subjects and undermine the Orthodox church led to internal revolts. In 1593 <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> monk, historian, and ethnographer Bahrey published a work of ethnography that provided reasoning for the military success of the polytheistic Oromo people who fought against <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> Empire. Ethiopian histories of this period also included details of foreign Muslims, Jews, Christians (including those from Western Europe), Safavid Iranians, and even figures of the fallen Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> biographical {{tradition}} became {{far more}} complex, intertextual, and broader in {{its view of}} the world given Ethiopia's direct involvement in the conflicts between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires in the Red Sea region. The annals of Dawit II (r. 1508–1540) describe the defensive war he waged against the Adal sultan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (r. 1527–1543), in an episodic format quite different from the earlier chronicling tradition. The chronicle of Gelawdewos, perhaps written by <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> Orthodox Church abbot Enbaqom (1470–1560), is far more detailed than any previous Ethiopian work of history. It explains <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> emperor's military alliance with Cristóvão da Gama (1516–1542), son of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, against the Adal Sultan al-Ghazi and his Ottoman allies, and later against the Ottoman governor of Yemen, Özdemir Pasha (d. 1560).|$|E

Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force <b>the</b> <b>Ethiopian</b> troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E
