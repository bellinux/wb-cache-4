5|$|The Knight's Cross of <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross and its higher {{grades were}} based on four {{separate}} enactments. The first enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573 of 1 September 1939 instituted <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross (Eisernes Kreuz) and the Knight's Cross of <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross. As the war progressed, some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross of <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross, was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, {{were based on}} the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten), based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11 of 29 December 1944, concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.|$|E

5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, <b>the</b> <b>iron</b> must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air.

The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E
