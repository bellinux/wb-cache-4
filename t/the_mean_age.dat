5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males.

Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{death rates}} due to {{alcoholism}} in Japan were analysed {{for the period}} 1950 - 1978. The alcoholism death rates for both sexes increased each year. The alcoholism death rates were {{closely related to the}} levels of alcohol consumption.

Geographical variations in the alcoholism death rates were analysed; they were also correlated with alcohol consumption levels. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> at death for alcoholics were 50 for men and 48 for women; <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> remained constant during the period of study...|$|R

5|$|In Panama, it breeds year-round without {{apparent}} seasonal variability. According to Omar Linares's Mamíferos de Venezuela (Mammals of Venezuela), reproductive {{activity is}} highest in June–July and December. In the laboratory, the gestation period is 28days; Linares reports {{that it is}} 20 to 30days in the wild. Females produce an average of six litters per year {{and there are two}} to five (average 3.92) young per litter, so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year. Larger females may have larger litters. Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old; in Fleming's study, some females in juvenile fur, probably less than 50days old, were already pregnant.

40|$|Risk taking (RT) and self-harm (SH) are clinically, conceptually, and empiricallyrelated, yet {{separate}} constructs, which occur {{most frequently}} during adolescence. The current study utilized retrospective reports {{of college students}} to determine reported ages of engagement in RT and SH behaviors. Reported ages were compared with predictions for ages of high frequency engagement in RT based on the Dual Systems Model of Adolescent Risk Taking (DSMART; Steinberg, 2010). The sample consisted of 228 college students, {{ranging in age from}} 18 to 48 years (mean 22. 8), who completed a survey of commonly investigated RT (12 items) and SH (18 items) behaviors. A positive correlation between the RT and SH scales supported a relationship between RT and SH, as predicted. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> of engagement reported for both RT and SH behaviors were significantly higher than the ages predicted by the DSMART.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} study the ages of peak performance in Olympic sport disciplines, and to distinguish age groups among them. The ages (in decimal years) of athletes with the best performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics were considered (n = 3548). A total of forty sport disciplines were included; the athletics events were classified in six disciplines: Sprint, Middle-distance, Long-distance, Combined, Jumping and Throwing. A full statistical summary was produced. A regression tree was proposed for each gender to discriminate groups of sport disciplines according to age. The ages ranged from 14. 0 to 52. 8 years. The 72 % of the athletes aged between 20 and 30 years, and the 99 % aged below 40 years. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>ages</b> {{for men and women}} were 27. 0 and 26. 2 years, respectively.
