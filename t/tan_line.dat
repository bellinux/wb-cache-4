[...] The Belo Amigo series seems to be a thematic midpoint between the 18 Today line and the Black and <b>Tan</b> <b>line</b> and uses actors from both.|$|E
2500|$|A {{rapid transit}} network to serve Ho Chi Minh City was first {{proposed}} in 2001 {{as part of}} a comprehensive public transport network plan including Ho Chi Minh City and neighbouring provinces. The project is managed by the city's Management Authority for Urban Railways (MAUR), a government unit working directly under the Chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City. The city's plan envisages developing three monorail or light rail lines with a total length of [...] and six underground metro routes with a total length of [...] The network's first line, connecting Bến Thành Market and Suoi Tien Park in District 9, is scheduled for completion in 2015, and a second line between Bến Thành Market and Tham Luong in District 12 is due to begin construction in August 2010, scheduled for completion in 2016. Other proposed lines include: a Bến Thành Market–Bình <b>Tân</b> <b>line</b> via Cholon; a line running from Lang Cha Ca in Tân Bình District to Van Thanh Park in Bình Thạnh District; a line connecting Thu Thiem in District 2 with Can Giuoc in District 8; and a line stretching from Ba Queo in Tân Bình District to Phu Lam in District 6.|$|E

2500|$|Small {{changes were}} made to the {{cylinder}} head for the 1995 model year. In 1996, the engine block was redesigned for greater strength. The new block had more webbing and a stud girdle for added rigidity of the crankshaft main bearings. Engines installed in 1999 Grand Cherokees carried the [...] "PowerTech" [...] name that had been used intermittently in prior years and on other Chrysler truck and SUV engines. The name was subsequently passed on to 4.0s in the other Jeep models that used the engine, the Cherokee and Wrangler. The cylinder head was again changed for the 2000 model year to a more emissions-friendly design. This head was designated as [...] "0331" [...] in the casting number. Early 0331 heads are prone to cracking, causing coolant to contaminate the oil, which can lead to catastrophic engine failure. The head cracks in the center between #3 and #4 cylinders. The crack is usually discernible with the valve cover removed as a [...] "milky" [...] <b>tan</b> <b>line.</b> This condition is usually discovered before catastrophic engine failure, but can lead there if not corrected in a timely manner. The casting was fixed in mid to late 2001, but the same casting number was retained. The [...] "fixed" [...] heads have [...] "TUPY" [...] cast in the center where the cracks used to occur. Also new for the 2000 model year, was the distributorless, coil on plug ignition system. Option code: ERH.|$|E

50|$|When it {{came time}} to remove his pants and underwear, it was soon {{revealed}} that Warren had a sharp <b>tan</b> <b>line</b> in the shape of his shorts that caused his buttocks and penis to be pale white in strong contrast to his otherwise bronzed complexion. Ryp's <b>tan</b> <b>line,</b> while present, was less noticeable due to his naturally darker complexion. Consequently, {{on the first day of}} shooting their nude scenes, both Warren and Ryp suffered severe sunburn to the genitals and buttocks, as these sensitive areas were not accustomed to long term exposure to the sun. As a result, filming had to be postponed briefly while the actors recovered. By the time filming ended, however, both boys had developed dark, full body tans.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the common}} uses for tanning beds is the option of tanning {{completely}} nude to reduce the appearance of tan lines. In contrast, some people prefer to have tan lines, and will wear undergarments or swimwear with the deliberate purpose of creating a sharply defined <b>tan</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
40|$|Mutations in LMNA, which encodes A-type lamins, {{result in}} {{disparate}} diseases, known collectively as laminopathies, that affect distinct tissues, including striated muscle and adipose tissue. Lamins provide structural {{support for the}} nucleus and sites of attachment for chromatin, and defects in these functions may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that A-type lamins may facilitate connections between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton mediated by nuclear envelope nesprin and SUN proteins. In mammalian cells, however, interfering with A-type lamins {{does not affect the}} localization of these proteins. Here, we used centrosome orientation in fibroblasts, which requires separate nuclear and centrosome positioning pathways, as a model system to understand how LMNA mutations affect nucleus-cytoskeletal connections. We find that LMNA mutations causing striated muscle diseases block actin-dependent nuclear movement, whereas most that affect adipose tissue inhibit microtubule-dependent centrosome positioning. Genetic deletion or transient depletion of A-type lamins also blocked nuclear movement, showing that mutations affecting muscle exhibit the null phenotype. Lack of A-type lamins, or expression of variants that cause striated muscle disease, did not affect assembly of nesprin- 2 G and SUN 2 into transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (<b>TAN)</b> <b>lines</b> that attach the nucleus to retrogradely moving actin cables. Nesprin- 2 G <b>TAN</b> <b>lines</b> were less stable, however, and slipped over the nucleus rather than moving with it, indicating that they were not anchored. Nesprin- 2 G <b>TAN</b> <b>lines</b> also slipped in SUN 2 -depleted cells. Our results establish A-type lamins as anchors for nesprin- 2 G–SUN 2 <b>TAN</b> <b>lines</b> to allow productive movement and proper positioning of the nucleus by actin...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Tân</b> <b>line</b> (chi Tân; chi {{can also}} be {{translated}} to as branch) was the sixteenth dynasty of Hùng kings of the Hồng Bàng period of Văn Lang (now Viet Nam). Starting approximately 660 B.C., the line refers {{to the rule of}} Đức Quân Lang and his successors.|$|E

5000|$|Wearing {{a bikini}} {{in the sun}} results in the {{uncovered}} skin becoming suntanned and creates a [...] "bikini tan". These tan lines separate pale breasts, crotch, and buttocks from otherwise tanned skin.

5|$|The <b>tan</b> <b>lines</b> {{created by}} the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan.

50|$|A <b>tan</b> <b>line</b> is a {{visually}} clear {{division on}} the human skin between an area of pronounced comparative paleness relative to other areas that have been suntanned by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The source of the radiation may be the sun, or artificial UV sources such as tanning lamps. Tan lines are usually an inadvertent result of a work environment or of recreational activities, but are sometimes intentional. Many people regard visible tan lines as un-aesthetic, and seek to avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn.|$|E

25|$|Many people regard visible <b>tan</b> <b>lines</b> as un-aesthetic, {{and seek}} to avoid <b>tan</b> <b>lines</b> that will be visible when regular clothes are worn. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to {{maximize}} their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan {{in the privacy of}} their backyard where they can at times tan without clothes, and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong.|$|R
