When the boats, loaded with the first wave lof British troops, were {{challenge}}d, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders, was able to answer the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E

25|$|In ancient Greek mythology, King Sisyphus {{was sentenced}} to roll an enchanted boulder up a hill, only to stand just before the peak and watch it roll itself back down, and to repeat this action forever.

25|$|With {{losses to}} the Spanish navy increasing, and the {{eventual}} fall in profits from slave selling, raiding became less {{appealing to the}} Iranuns and their Islamic supporters. Uneconomical patriotism simply did not make quite an appeal. Thus, it came <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> the Moro pirates faded from Mindoro's history. The pirate fort in Mamburao was abandoned, and the Moros retreated to Mindanao to consolidate their forces and continue the Moslem resistance at the homefront. Mindoro Island then became a Spanish possession in a truer sense for the first time. But not for long.|$|E

25|$|With the {{legislature}} closely {{divided on the}} issue, additional projects were proposed for the southern areas {{of the state to}} gain the support of their representatives. All the projects were bundled into one bill and passed as the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act in 1836. The act caused a great deal of celebration in the state and Noble considered the act his greatest achievement at the time. To pay for the act, which was projected to cost $10 million, Noble had also recommended a 50% increase in all state taxes. However, {{the legislature}} failed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> measure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} when Herod was king of Judea, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee to {{announce}} to a virgin named Mary, who was betrothed to a man named Joseph, that a child would be born {{to her and she}} was to name him Jesus, for he would be the son of God and rule over Israel forever. When the time of the birth drew near the Roman Emperor commanded a census of all the world, and Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem, the city of David, as he was of the House of David. So it came <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and as there was no room in the town the infant was laid in a manger while angels announced his birth and shepherds worshiped him as Messiah and Lord.|$|E
25|$|Notably {{absent from}} toleration of drugs is its production, {{particularly}} {{the cultivation of}} weed. This {{has led to a}} seemingly paradoxical system where coffee shops are allowed to buy and sell soft drugs but where production is nearly always punished. Because coffee shops have to get their goods from somewhere, criticism has been raised over the years against continued prosecution of soft drug producers. It was first challenged in court in 2014 when a judge found two people guilty of producing weed in large quantities but refused to punish them. A breakthrough occurred in early 2017, when a slight majority in the House of Representatives allowed for a law <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> would partly legalize production of weed. In late 2017, the newly formed coalition announced that they would seek to implement an experimental new system in certain cities where coffee shops could legally acquire weed from a state-appointed producer.|$|E

25|$|The strict {{adherence}} to cadency, or {{the need for}} cadets to difference their arms from {{the chief of the}} family, is due to the permanence of the old families. From an early period the leading families of England were extinguished in the male line. Some continue to exist in the male line, but are comparatively obscure, having sprung from untitled cadets of the ancient families. On the other hand, the Scoto-Norman barons were remarkable for their numerous progeny. Sub-infeudation, which had been prohibited in England since the time of the Plantagenet kings, was largely practiced in Scotland. Whole districts of Scotland have their predominant names, which are generally those of the old feudal families. Surnames were {{for a long time after}} their introduction, used only by the gentry; and when they began to be assumed by the lower orders, the clansman almost invariably took the name of his chief, considering himself a member of his family, at least by adoption, if not by blood. In England new men emerged, and founded new families; it was easier to adopt new arms rather than trace a connection with those who had died. Hence it came <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> while in England the multitude of entirely distinct coats of arms is enormous, in Scotland the number of original coats is small.|$|E

500|$|In 1848, Jones Quain {{described}} the nerve as the [...] "spinal nerve accessory to the vagus", recognizing that while a minor {{component of the}} nerve joins with the larger vagus nerve, the majority of accessory nerve fibres originate in the spinal cord. In 1893 it was recognised that the heretofore named nerve fibres [...] "accessory" [...] to the vagus originated from the same nucleus in the medulla oblongata, and it came <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> these fibres were increasingly viewed {{as part of the}} vagus nerve itself. Consequently, the term [...] "accessory nerve" [...] was and is increasingly used to denote only fibres from the spinal cord; the fact that only the spinal portion could be tested clinically lent weight to this opinion.|$|E
500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from our youth. We grew up with revolutionary spirit and we want <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>that</b> on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E

The pair were found guilty and executed on the same day, 30April 1650. Writing in 1834 John William Parker, publisher of The Saturday Magazine, suggested that the gibbet might have remained in use for longer in Halifax had the bailiff not been warned that if he used it again he would be [...] "called to public account for it". Midgley comments that the final executions [...] "were by some persons in that age, judged to be too severe; thence came it <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> <b>that</b> the gibbet, and the customary law, for the forest of Hardwick, got its suspension".|$|E
