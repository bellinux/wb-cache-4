5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> team were now able to deliver.|$|E

5|$|One {{advantage}} of this design was that the diodes created light around the same frequency as <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> glass' output, {{as compared to the}} white light flashtubes where most of the energy in the flash was wasted as it was not near the active frequency of <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> glass. This change increased the energy efficiency to about 10%, a dramatic improvement.|$|E

In doing so, <b>the</b> <b>Lasers</b> left John Isner unprotected. He was chosen by the Empire with the first pick in the second round.

5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E
