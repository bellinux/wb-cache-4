25|$|The {{application}} of the fusible core process is not limited just to the injection of thermoplastics, but with corresponding core alloys also to <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastic</b> molding materials (duroplast). The fusible core process finds application, for example, for injection molded passenger car engine intake manifolds.

2500|$|Baekeland {{then began}} experimenting to {{strengthen}} wood by impregnating {{it with a}} synthetic resin, rather than coating it. [...] By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to phenol and formaldehyde, Baekeland produced a hard moldable material which he named [...] "Bakelite". It was the first synthetic <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastic</b> ever produced, and Baekeland speculated on [...] "the thousand and one ... articles" [...] {{that it could be}} used to make. Baekeland considered the possibilities of using a wide variety of filling materials, including cotton, powdered bronze, and slate dust, but was most successful with wood and asbestos fibers.|$|E
2500|$|The first plastic {{based on}} a {{synthetic}} polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, a Belgian-born American living in New York state. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C6H5OH) and formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant [...] "composite" [...] materials. The new material tended to foam during synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in {{a meeting of the}} American Chemical Society. Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s. [...] Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived from living matter. It was also an early <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastic.</b>|$|E

50|$|Spin casting, {{also known}} as {{centrifugal}} rubber mold casting (CRMC), is a method of utilizing centrifugal force to produce castings from a rubber mold. Typically, a disc-shaped mold is spun along its central axis at a set speed. The casting material, usually molten metal or liquid <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic,</b> is then poured in through an opening at the top-center of the mold. The filled mold then continues to spin as the metal solidifies or the <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> sets.|$|R

50|$|Melamine is {{commonly}} produced from urea, mainly by either catalyzed gas-phase production or high pressure liquid-phase production, and is soluble in water. Melamine is used combined with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a very durable <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastic,</b> and melamine foam, a polymeric cleaning product.

5000|$|Synthetic resins are {{of several}} classes. Some are {{manufactured}} by esterification or soaping of organic compounds. Some are <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> {{in which the}} term [...] "resin" [...] is loosely applied to the reactant or product, or both. [...] "Resin" [...] may be applied {{to one of two}} monomers in a copolymer, the other being called a [...] "hardener", as in epoxy resins. For <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> that require only one monomer, the monomer compound is the [...] "resin". For example, liquid methyl methacrylate is often called the [...] "resin" [...] or [...] "casting resin" [...] while in the liquid state, before it polymerizes and [...] "sets".

50|$|Cyanamid {{developed}} many chemicals {{based on}} cyanamide chemistry, or more broadly nitrogen-based chemicals. Perhaps {{the most important}} was melamine, an extraordinarily strong and durable <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastic</b> material. It is now among the most widely produced industrial chemicals in the world. Cyanamid also was a major producer of acrylonitrile, and its derivative, acrylamide.

The MP-445 model has fully adjustable sights zeroed for both elevation and windage, while MP-445C has fixed, iron sights. It holds 15 rounds and readily accepts tactical flashlights and laser aiming devices.

5000|$|Formerly, fillers {{were used}} {{predominantly}} to cheapen end products, {{in which case}} they are called extenders. Among the 21 most important fillers, calcium carbonate holds the largest market volume and is mainly used in the plastics sector.

Wood flour and saw dust are used as filler in <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Dalquist {{designed}} the Bundt cake pan. Bundt cakes became very popular after the Tunnel of Fudge cake recipe took second {{place at the}} 1966 Pillsbury Bake-off.

50|$|<b>Thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> {{polymers}} characterised by rigid, three-dimensional {{structures and}} high molecular weight, {{stay out of}} shape when deformed and undergo permanent or plastic deformation under load, and normally decompose before melting. Thermoset elastomers, which are soft and springy or rubbery and can be deformed and revert to their original shape on loading release, also decompose before melting. Conventional <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastics</b> or elastomers therefore cannot be melted and re-shaped after they are cured which implies that thermosets cannot be recycled for the same purpose, except as filler material. There are developments however involving thermoset epoxy resins which on controlled and contained heating form crosslinked networks that can be repeatedly reshaped like silica glass by reversible covalent bond exchange reactions on reheating above the glass transition temperature. There are also thermoset polyurethanes shown to have transient properties and which can thus be reprocessed or recycled.|$|R
40|$|Compounds {{containing}} crumb tire {{rubber and}} 40 - 60 % carpet scrap have been developed.
