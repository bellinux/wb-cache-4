5|$|Ryder {{appeared}} in David Wain's comedy The Ten. The film centers around ten stories, each inspired {{by one of}} the Ten Commandments. The film debuted at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival on January 10, 2007, with a theatrical release on August 3, 2007. Ryder played the female lead opposite Wes Bentley and Ray Romano in Geoffrey Haley's 2008 offbeat romantic drama <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Word.</b> <b>In</b> 2009, she starred as a newscaster in the movie version of The Informers.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of the Soviets to turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E

25|$|Laguna had {{problems}} with the Inquisition, just like Michel de Villeneuve, for both were jewish-converso, a fact that could have made them limit their commentaries to avoid risks. Nevertheless, he was the physician of Charles V and the Pope Julius III, and that helped to establish his work as <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> Materia Medica, and {{as the basis of}} Spanish botany.|$|E
25|$|The new Elector, George William, who {{resided in}} Prussia, was appalled {{when he heard}} of his mother's {{independent}} action. He wrote to Gustavus Adolphus to refuse his consent to the marriage until Sweden and Poland had settled their differences. It was the Electress Dowager, however, who, in accordance with Hohenzollern family custom, had <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> bestowing her daughter's hand in marriage. She sent Maria Eleonora to territory outside of George William's reach and concluded the marriage negotiations herself.|$|E

500|$|It was, however, {{difficult}} for the Air Force to do otherwise. Observation of the trail from the air was difficult at best. Human intelligence was provided by CIA-backed Laotian irregulars and Thai volunteers operating from {{the western side of}} the system while the eastern side was covered by SOG. [...] The depth of penetration by these reconnaissance efforts was hampered by the same man who had <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the bombing effort, Ambassador William H. Sullivan in Vientiane. The ambassador (with the full backing of the State Department and the CIA) maintained a firm hold over all military operations conducted within the supposedly [...] "neutral" [...] Kingdom of Laos. All targets had to be pre-approved either by Sullivan himself or by the air attach√© within Project 404, the understaffed U.S. military operations center within the embassy.|$|E

[...] In The Tip Sheet, Jonathan King labelled it a [...] "glorious, splendid album," [...] celebrating Meat Loaf's [...] "operatically gorgeous" [...] voice and Steinman's [...] "superb" [...] songs, arrangements and production. [...] "You'll be blown away. Better still you'll catch yourself openly laughing out loud at times with delight. You know what to expect yet it's constantly better, fresher and brighter than you hope.

500|$|Later in life, when Cibber {{himself had}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> casting at Drury Lane, he wrote, or patched together, several tragedies that were {{tailored}} to fit his continuing hankering after playing [...] "a Hero". However, his performances of such parts never pleased audiences, which {{wanted to see}} him typecast as an affected fop, a kind of character that fitted both his private reputation as a vain man, his exaggerated, mannered style of acting, and his habit of ad libbing. His most famous part {{for the rest of his}} career remained that of Lord Foppington in The Relapse, a sequel to Cibber's own Love's Last Shift but written by John Vanbrugh, first performed in 1696 with Cibber reprising his performance as Sir Novelty Fashion in the newly ennobled guise of Lord Foppington. Pope mentions the audience jubilation that greeted the small-framed Cibber donning Lord Foppington's enormous wig, which would be ceremoniously carried on stage in its own sedan chair. Vanbrugh reputedly wrote the part of Lord Foppington deliberately [...] "to suit the eccentricities of Cibber's acting style".|$|E

2500|$|In {{software}} development projects, a [...] "mistake" [...] or [...] "fault" [...] may be introduced at any stage.

For example, a relatively simple program to alphabetize a list of words, the design might fail to consider what should happen when a word contains a hyphen. Or when converting an abstract design into code, the coder might inadvertently create an off-by-one error and fail to sort <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> a list.

2500|$|There are no case declensions in Danish nouns.
