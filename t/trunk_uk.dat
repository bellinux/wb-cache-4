50|$|A {{centreboard}} or centerboard (US) is a retractable keel which pivots {{out of a}} slot in {{the hull}} of a sailboat, known as a centreboard <b>trunk</b> (<b>UK)</b> or centerboard case (US). The retractability allows the centreboard to be raised to operate in shallow waters, to move the centre of lateral resistance (offsetting changes to the sailplan that move the centre of effort aft), to reduce drag when the full area of the centreboard is not needed, or when removing the boat from the water, as when trailering. A centreboard which consists of just a pivoting metal plate is called a centerplate. A daggerboard is similar but slides vertically rather than pivoting.|$|E
50|$|Insulated wires may be run in one {{of several}} forms between {{electrical}} devices. This may be a specialised bendable pipe, called a conduit, or one of several varieties of metal (rigid steel or aluminium) or non-metallic (PVC or HDPE) tubing. Rectangular cross-section metal or PVC wire troughs (North America) or <b>trunking</b> (<b>UK)</b> may be used if many circuits are required. Wires run underground may be run in plastic tubing encased in concrete, but metal elbows {{may be used in}} severe pulls. Wiring in exposed areas, for example factory floors, may be run in cable trays or rectangular raceways having lids.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic Alternative Routing (DAR) is {{a simple}} but highly {{efficient}} decentralised routing scheme developed for the <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> network. This paper examines how to dimension the UK network given known multiple traffic patterns together with unpredictable variations in traffic. Previous methods are first examined. We then present {{the results of a}} cost comparison of DAR and AAR using simple sizing techniques. Finally, more powerful techniques are examined based on the implied cost method of Kelly. 1. DYNAMIC ALTERNATIVE ROUTING (DAR) DAR was developed for application to the <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> network [1]. The development and motivation for it are described fully by Stacey and Songhurst [2]. The <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> network comprises a top tier of 55 fully-interconnected Digital Main Switching Units (DMSUs), and a lower tier of local exchanges, each of which is connected to two DMSUs. Fig 1 illustrates part of the network available to connect two local exchanges L 1 and · L 2. local networ...|$|R
5000|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the 03 {{numbering}} range was originally used for calls to Great Britain, with the Irish prefix 030 replacing the <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> code 0. Calls to British cities using the Director telephone system were also possible using shorter codes: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gateway to}} the northbound tunnel was Grade II listed in 1973, while the ventilation towers were listed in 2000. In April 1986, the tunnel {{became part of the}} <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> road network. It was detrunked and control handed to TfL in September 1999.|$|R
5000|$|BEA {{operated}} {{their large}} fleet of Vikings on many European and <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> routes for eight years. From 1951, the remaining fleet was modified with 36, instead of 27 seats, and named the [...] "Admiral Class". BEA operated the Viking until late 1954, {{when the last}} was displaced by the more modern and pressurised Airspeed Ambassador and Vickers Viscount.|$|R
50|$|The first System X unit {{to enter}} public service was in September 1980 and was {{installed}} in Baynard House, London and was a tandem junction unit which switched telephone calls amongst around 40 local exchanges. The first local digital exchange started operation in 1981 in Woodbridge, Suffolk (near BT's Research HQ at Martlesham Heath). The last electromechanical trunk exchange (in Thurso, Scotland) was closed in July 1990 - completing the <b>UK's</b> <b>trunk</b> network transition to purely digital operation and becoming the first national telephone system to achieve this. The last electromechanical local exchanges, Crawford, Crawfordjohn and Elvanfoot, all in Scotland, were changed over to digital on 23 June 1995 and the last electronic analogue exchanges, Selby, Yorkshire and Leigh on Sea, Essex were changed to digital on 11 March 1998.|$|R
5000|$|Trunk Funk Classics 1991-2000 was {{released}} October 17, 2000 in the US by Delicious Vinyl Records. This collection has {{an entirely different}} track listing than the above release. Where the <b>UK</b> <b>Trunk</b> Funk release highlighted dance and pop-oriented Heavies singles, this release focuses on 70's soul influenced cuts like [...] "Brother Sister," [...] the J. Dilla remix of [...] "Sometimes" [...] featuring rapper Q-Tip, and [...] "Put the Funk Back in It." [...] The US Trunk Funk also includes two tracks from Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1, the band's collaboration {{with a host of}} hip-hop artists. Among the previously unreleased tracks are the video edit of [...] "Dream Come True '92" [...] and the new track [...] "Finish What You Started" [...] marking lead singer N'Dea Davenport's much-desired return to the band.|$|R
40|$|Roundabouts {{have been}} a key form of {{junction}} in the UK for many years. They are used on all classes of road in both {{urban and rural areas}} for the efficient and safe control of traffic, particularly where side road flows are high. Roundabouts are {{the most common type of}} control used at motorway intersections, and are heavily used throughout the <b>UK’s</b> <b>trunk</b> and principal road network, as well as on local authority roads. Following a state-of-the-art review of international roundabout design, this paper reviews the research into accidents at roundabouts in the light of issues for the revised UK Geometric Design Standard. In order to meet the needs of modern roads, the revised Standard is likely to adopt a hierarchical approach, with different designs for roundabouts on rural and urban roads, the intention being to place much greater emphasis on the interests of vulnerable road users...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a series of}} tests conducted on a <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> road in which the dynamic tyre forces generated by over 1500 heavy goods vehicles (HGV's) were measured using a load measuring mat containing 144 capacitive strip sensors. This data was used to investigate the relative road damaging potential of the various classes of vehicles, and the degree of spatial repeatability of tyre forces present in a typical highway fleet. It was found that fatigue damage was strongly influenced by the magnitude of the dynamic tyre forces, whereas rutting damage was primarily dependent on the gross vehicle weight. On average, air suspended vehicles were found to generate smaller dynamic loads and hence less road damage than steel suspended vehicles. However, some air suspensions were found to generate very high dynamic loads and consequently very high levels of road damage, {{due to a lack of}} suspension damping. Approximately half the vehicles tested were found to contribute to a spatially repeata [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic tyre forces {{generated}} by heavy goods vehicles are {{measured with a}} portable load measuring mat and used to investigate `spatial repeatability'. The mat is 56 m long, 13 mm thick, and has 141 capacitative strip sensors, spaced at 0. 4 m intervals. Two sets of experiments are described. In the phase I experiments the measured dynamic tyre forces {{generated by}} fourteen articulated vehicle combinations (3 tractors and 5 trailers) are used to confirm previous theoretical predictions of spatial repeatability. In the phase II experiments the dynamic tyre forces generated by over 1500 heavy goods vehicles travelling on a <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> road are used to estimate the degree of repeatability exhibited by a typical highway fleet. Spatial repeatability is assessed using the `spatial repeatability index' (SRI), and a method is developed to correct the SRI for sensor noise. Approximately half the vehicles tested were found {{to contribute to a}} spatially repeatable pattern of road loading. 1. INTRODUC [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|The Vanguard entered {{service with}} BEA and TCA in late 1960. BEA {{operated}} their first Vanguard schedule on 17 December from Heathrow to Paris. Following delivery of their full fleet of six V951 and 14 V953 aircraft by 30 March 1962, the type took over many of BEA's busier European and <b>UK</b> <b>trunk</b> routes. The aircraft received names of famous Royal Navy warships; the first G-APEA was named [...] "Vanguard", however {{by the time}} that the aircraft were delivered, BEA had adopted its new [...] "red square" [...] livery, which saw the end of naming and none of the Vanguards actually carried a name. Initial seating was 18 first-class at the rear and 108 tourist, but this was changed to 139 all-tourist, in which configuration, the Vanguard had very low operating costs per seat/mile. On flights up to , such as from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, the type could match the block times of the pure jets which were being introduced in the early 1960s. The remaining BEA fleet passed to British Airways on 1 April 1974 and the last BA passenger flight with the type was on 16 June 1974.|$|R
