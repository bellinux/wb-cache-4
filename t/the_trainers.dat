5|$|After visiting Tiny's gym and {{intervening}} in a spar to defend him, Diana asks <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> {{to let her}} box, too. She is told she can train there, but not compete in actual fights. When she learns that she cannot afford coaching from Tiny's trainer, Hector Soto, she asks her father for an allowance but he tells her to get a job. She resorts to stealing his money instead {{and returns to the}} gym, where Hector begins to teach her the basics of boxing.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} years with WWE, she {{wrestled}} only sporadically. Moretti did, however, co-host WWE Experience, {{and served as}} one of <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> on WWE Tough Enough. After Moretti left WWE in 2005, she wrestled for Women Superstars Uncensored, winning two other titles, and was also inducted into the WSU Hall of Fame. Moretti also began working in the landscaping industry, and volunteered at her local animal shelter. In addition, Moretti opened an animal care and grooming facility named Downtown Dog, in her hometown in 2007.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training <b>the</b> <b>trainers.</b> This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E
40|$|New {{training}} methods which {{rely on the}} ethological {{characteristics of}} the horse are spreading in the horse world. Some of them highlight the importance of trainer-horse eye contact during training in the round pen. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effects of eye contact with <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> on <b>the</b> behaviour of saddle horses during training. Ten horses, aged 4 to 17 years, were subjected to two training sessions in the round pen, one in which <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> was wearing very dark sunglasses, the other in which <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> was wearing normal transparent glasses. The latency of some behaviour patterns which are deemed to be representative of the horse?s attention towards <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> and acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> as a social leader, were measured. The results show that horses oriented the inner ear towards <b>the</b> <b>trainer,</b> sham-chewed, lowered <b>the</b> head, stopped, approached and followed <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> sooner (p< 0. 01) when <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> was wearing transparent rather than dark glasses...|$|R

5|$|When {{both men}} were arrested on 18 January, Carty said he was {{innocent}} of the allegations and claimed {{he had been in}} a pub in Kilburn with relatives and friends, and stayed the night at a relative's house. When police searched his home, they found a pair of trainers that forensic tests showed had a drop of ap Rhys Pryce's blood on one toe. DNA from several people, including Brown, were found on <b>the</b> <b>trainers.</b> Officers also found a top with traces of Brown's DNA, and fibres found on Pryce's overcoat were microscopically indistinguishable from the material of that top. Brown also said he had been in Kilburn {{the night of the murder}} and initially claimed that he had nothing to do with either the robbery of the other man or the robbery and murder of Pryce. When the mobile phone of the other victim (Ali) was discovered at his home, he claimed he had bought it from two men. Detectives also found that Brown had hoarded press cuttings of Pryce.|$|E

25|$|Alex's {{training}} used a model/rival technique, {{where the}} student (Alex) observes trainers interacting.

25|$|In addition, the Vampire T.33, T.34 and T.35 {{were used}} by the RAAF and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) (known as Mk33 through to Mk35W in RAAF service) and many were {{manufactured}} or assembled at de Havilland Australia's facilities in Sydney. The Mk35W was a Mk35 fitted with spare Mk33 wings following overstress or achievement of fatigue life. Vampire trainer production in Australia amounted to 110 aircraft, and the initial order was filled by 35 T.33s for the RAAF, deliveries being made in 1952 with five T.34s for the RAN delivered in 1954. <b>The</b> <b>trainers</b> remained in service in the RAAF until 1970 while RAN Vampires were retired in 1971.|$|E
25|$|La Luz {{has never}} worked for, nor has {{he held a}} staff {{position}} with Latinos for Barack Obama.

He also became one of <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> in a political boot camp called Latino Camp Obama for Hispanic activists and volunteers who were trained in the political skills and the basics of organizing at the grassroots level.|$|E
25|$|When ecology {{emerged as}} a matter of public {{interest}} in the 1970s, a few zoos began to consider making conservation their central role, with Gerald Durrell of the Jersey Zoo, George Rabb of Brookfield Zoo, and William Conway of the Bronx Zoo (Wildlife Conservation Society) leading the discussion. From then on, zoo professionals became increasingly aware of the need to engage themselves in conservation programs, and the American Zoo Association soon said that conservation was its highest priority. Because they wanted to stress conservation issues, many large zoos stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. The Detroit Zoo, for example, stopped its elephant show in 1969, and its chimpanzee show in 1983, acknowledging that <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> had probably abused the animals to get them to perform.|$|E

25|$|The 1943 Surprise Hurricane, which struck Houston during World War II, {{marked the}} first {{intentional}} meteorological flight into a hurricane. That summer, British pilots being trained as instrument instructor pilots at Bryan Army Airfield heard that the school was evacuating its AT-6 Texan trainers {{in the face of}} the oncoming hurricane, and began teasing their instructors about the airworthiness of the aircraft. Instrument flying school commander USAAF Lt. Col. Joseph B. Duckworth, a former airline pilot with Eastern Airlines who had developed instrument procedures for the carrier, bet his RAF students that he could safely fly into the storm and return. On 27 July 1943 he took out one of <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> with 2nd Lt Ralph M. O'Hair navigating and flew it straight into the eye of the storm. After he returned safely, the base's only weather officer, 1st Lt William H. Jones-Burdick, took over the navigator's seat and Duckworth flew into the storm (now over land) a second time, this time recording their observations and measuring temperatures within the storm. The flights demonstrated that hurricane reconnaissance flights were feasible.|$|E

500|$|While <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> of the {{rhinoceros}} {{may have}} trembled in fear at the fate that awaited them if their animal failed to perform, and another trainer was savaged by his lion, some were more successful. One trainer was noted for his tigress which, though tame enough to lick his hand, had torn a lion to pieces, [...] "a novelty unknown in any times". It also {{appears that the}} crowd was pleased when a bull (perhaps ridden by a bestarius) was hoisted aloft in the arena, but Martial gives little clue as {{to the nature of}} this entertainment.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} section of Fenwick's book, she recounts the est {{training}} process and the methods used during the course. Fenwick details the rules or [...] "agreements" [...] laid out by <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> to the attendees, which include not talking to others or leaving the session {{to go to the bathroom}} unless during an announced break period. The second section is analytic: Fenwick analyzes the methods used by the est trainers, evaluates the course's potential effects, and discusses Erhard's background. Fenwick concludes that the program's long-term effects are unknown, the est training may not be appropriate for certain groups of people, and that the large proportion of participants experience positive effects.|$|E
