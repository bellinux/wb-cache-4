When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it.

Vainio began <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

[...] Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of The Nation, B. H. Haggin, while admitting that Monteux was generally {{regarded as one of the}} giants of conducting, wrote of his [...] "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity". [...] Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 Carleton Smith wrote, [...] "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three'– the Boston, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic orchestras." [...] In his 1967 book The Great Conductors, Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Monteux, [...] " [...] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world.

500|$|His father Antonio {{received}} guitar {{lessons from}} {{the hand of a}} cousin of Melchor de Marchena: Manuel Fernández (aka Titi de Marchena), a guitarist who arrived in Algeciras in the 1920s and established a school there. Antonio introduced Paco to the guitar at a young age and was extremely strict in his upbringing from the age of 5, forcing him to practice up to 12 hours a day, every day, to ensure that he could find success as a professional musician. At one point, his father took him out of school to concentrate solely on his guitar development. In a 2012 interview de Lucía stated that, [...] "I learned the guitar like a child learns to speak." [...] Flamenco guitarist and biographer Donn Pohren and record producer [...] José Torregrosa compared Paco's relationship with his father to the relationship of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Leopold Mozart in the way both fathers [...] "moulded their sons" [...] into becoming world-class musicians, and both continued to dictate even after the latter became famous. Paco's brother Ramón idolized Niño Ricardo, and taught his complex falsetas to his young brother, who would learn them with relative ease and change them to his own liking and embellish them. This initially angered Ramón, who considered Ricardo's works to be sacred and thought his brother was showing off; but he soon began to respect his brother immensely, and came <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a prodigious talent, fuera de serie (out of the ordinary). As also with Ramón, Ricardo was Paco's most important influence, and his first guitar hero; Paco said [...] "all of us youngsters would look up to him, trying to learn from him and copy him." [...] In 1958, at age 11, Paco made his first public appearance on Radio Algeciras. That year, he met Sabicas {{for the first time in}} Málaga. A year later, he was awarded a special prize at the Festival Concurso International Flamenco de Jerez de la Frontera flamenco competition.|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the novel, Le Guin stated [...] "the hero of the book, the protagonist, he has a different gift, it isn’t magic at all, in fact, it’s another kind of talent. And his problem is <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doesn’t have the kind he’s supposed to have, he has this other one. Which is a problem, actually, {{a lot of young people}} face: What is my gift?" [...] Reviewers have described Orrec's search for his own identity, in contrast to the identity that has been thrust upon him, as one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is related to the other major theme of the novel, that of power and responsibility. As he comes to terms with his identity, Orrec questions whether he is betraying his power by refusing to try to use it. Gry, too, is unwilling to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and wonders whether [...] "all the gifts are backward.... They could have been healing, to begin with." [...] The novel ends with the two protagonists realizing that they are unwilling to remain in the cycle of violence and retribution in the Uplands, and leaving to keep their integrity; but they are also running toward a place where they can use their gifts as they please, rather than simply running away. A part of Orrec and Gry's process of growing up is to see beyond the binary choices they are presented with by society. Orrec is faced with a choice of whether to use his power, or to be blindfolded; Gry has to use her power to hunt, or not. Gry realizes that all of the upland powers can be used in two ways: for control and dominion, or for healing and nurturing. This recognition allows them to take a third choice, and leave. This wrestling with choice has been compared to the choices the characters are forced to make in Le Guin's novella The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.|$|E
