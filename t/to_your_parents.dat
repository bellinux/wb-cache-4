500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer {{us away from}} the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> and all the people, to authority... 'I'm {{going to do it}} my way.' That's what rock 'n' roll is all about. That's what I liked about her, this energy. [...] was special and had this mystical quality." ...|$|E
500|$|People who {{criticized the}} song's message {{included}} Ellen Goodman, a national syndicated columnist, {{who called the}} video [...] "a commercial for teenage pregnancy". Feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, the spokeswoman of the National Organization for Women (NOW), angrily called for Madonna to make a public statement or another record supporting the opposite point of view. Alfred Moran, {{the executive director of}} Planned Parenthood of New York City, also criticized the song, fearing that it would undermine efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it would encourage teenage pregnancy. Recalling how his agency's clinics were filled in 1985 with girls wearing clothes that were an imitation of Madonna's style, Moran said that the song's message is [...] "that getting pregnant is cool and having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and don't listen <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents,</b> the school, anybody who tells you otherwise—don't preach to me, Papa. The reality is that what Madonna is suggesting to teenagers is a path to permanent poverty." ...|$|E
500|$|Attendance at Gay Pride marches {{during the}} summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents,</b> your relatives.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Perkins {{told her}} agent, Debi Allen, {{about the idea}} and a meeting with a BBC comedy {{commissioner}} followed shortly after. Perkins was advised to work her idea into a six-part sitcom, which she initially resisted doing as she saw it more as a comedy drama instead. A sitcom required [...] "a 'sit' or precinct" [...] and Perkins eventually decided to locate the show in a veterinary surgery, as it features {{people from all walks}} of life. After the first episode was commissioned, a table-read was organised for December 2011. In April 2012, Perkins was filming World's Most Dangerous Roads in Laos, when she was told her sitcom had been commissioned for a full series. From April to July, Perkins wrote the remaining episodes. Perkins later called Heading Out [...] "a midlife crises sitcom", explaining [...] "It's more about how awkward it is to tell your parents anything, as opposed to just the gay issue. Essentially, when you come out <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents,</b> you have to tell them, 'I'm having sex!'. And no one wants to say that." ...|$|E
