50|$|X-rays beams are {{produced}} when an electron is accelerated or decelerated. (This is why {{young children are}} warned to keep their distance from old televisions). Tungsten is a good source for producing this kind of radiation. The high-energy electrons can interact with the nuclei of the <b>tungsten</b> and produce <b>white</b> radiation or general radiation.|$|R
50|$|The {{developed}} {{glass master}} {{is placed in}} a vapour deposition metaliser which uses a combination of mechanical vacuum pumps and cryopumps to lower the total vapour pressure inside a chamber to a hard vacuum. A piece of nickel wire is then heated in a <b>tungsten</b> boat to <b>white</b> hot temperature and the nickel vapour deposited onto the rotating glass master. The glass master is coated with the nickel vapour up to a typical thickness of around 400 nm.|$|R
50|$|The Suburban {{will have}} eight color {{palettes}} {{to choose from}} for the 2015 model year: Champagne Silver Metallic, Silver Ice Metallic, White Diamond Tricoat, Sable Metallic, Crystal Red Tricoat, Summit <b>White,</b> <b>Tungsten</b> Metallic, and Black. The GMC Yukon XL palettes {{will be available in}} nine colors: Onyx Black, Summit White, Quicksilver Metallic, Champagne Silver Metallic, Iridium Metallic, Bronze Alloy Metallic, Crystal Red Tintcoat, White Diamond Tricoat, and Midnight Amethyst Metallic. The latter three will be the most expensive color trim options.|$|R
25|$|Filters on {{a camera}} lens, or color gels over the light source(s) {{may be used}} to correct color balance. When {{shooting}} with a bluish light (high color temperature) source such as on an overcast day, in the shade, in window light, or if using <b>tungsten</b> film with <b>white</b> or blue light, a yellowish-orange filter will correct this. For shooting with daylight film (calibrated to 5600K) under warmer (low color temperature) light sources such as sunsets, candlelight or tungsten lighting, a bluish (e.g. #80A) filter may be used. More-subtle filters are needed to correct for the difference between, say 3200K and 3400K tungsten lamps or to correct for the slightly blue cast of some flash tubes, which may be 6000K.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{implementation}} of an optical fiber sensor to measure the refractive index in aqueous media based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). We have used a novel technique known as photodeposition to immobilize silver nanoparticles on the optical fiber end. This technique has a simple instrumentation, involves laser light via an optical fiber and silver nanoparticles suspended in an aqueous medium. The optical sensor was assembled using a <b>tungsten</b> lamp as <b>white</b> light, a spectrometer, and an optical fiber with silver nanoparticles. The response of this sensor is such that the LSPR peak wavelength is linearly shifted to longer wavelengths as the refractive index is increased, showing a sensitivity of 67. 6 nm/RIU. Experimental results are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{important}} {{quality of}} color film stock {{in particular is}} its color balance, which {{is defined by the}} color temperature at which it accurately records <b>white.</b> <b>Tungsten</b> lighting is defined at 3200 K, which is considered [...] "warmer" [...] in tone and shifted towards orange; daylight is defined at 5600 K, which is considered [...] "colder" [...] and shifted towards blue. This means that unfiltered tungsten stock will look normal shot under tungsten lights, but blue if shot during daylight. Conversely, daylight stock shot in daylight will look normal, but orange if shot under tungsten lights. Color temperature issues such as these can be compensated for by other factors such as lens filters and color gels placed in front of the lights. The color temperature of a film stock is generally indicated next to the film speed number — e.g. 500T stock is color film stock with an ASA of 500 and balanced for tungsten light; 250D would have an ASA of 250 and be balanced for daylight. While black-and-white film has no color temperature itself, the silver halide grains themselves tend to be slightly more responsive to blue light, and therefore will have daylight and tungsten speeds — e.g. Kodak's Double-X stock is rated 250D/200T, since the tungsten light will give slightly less exposure than an equivalent amount of daylight.|$|R
5000|$|After {{retaining}} Adrian Sutil for the team's first season, Force India conducted winter {{tests for}} the second driver and testing roles. Ex-Renault driver Giancarlo Fisichella was chosen for the race seat, and Vitantonio Liuzzi secured the reserve role; they were to drive {{an updated version of}} the Spyker F8-VIIB chassis with Ferrari engines, christened the Force India VJM01. Testing of the car begun in February, after the gold, <b>tungsten</b> and <b>white</b> liveried car was launched at the Gateway of India in Mumbai. With an increased budget and wind tunnels from defence company EADS, the team set itself the target of beating Super Aguri, a squad which spent the previous seasons contesting at the back with Force India's predecessors.Melbourne was the scene of Force India's first race, and although the [...] gave the team a poor start with both drivers retiring in the first few laps, the following race in Malaysia saw Fisichella's twelfth place earn the team's first finish. After disappointing results in the opening races, Sutil gave the team the chance to score its first points in the wet , but {{towards the end of the}} race Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari lost control and hit Sutil's car causing immediate retirement. Although a furious Gascoyne called for Räikkönen to be penalised, overtakes under yellow flag conditions would have meant Sutil receiving a time penalty post-race, dropping him out of points. Continuous updates to improve reliability and performance allowed the team to close the gap to the fastest teams during the mid-season, despite Super Aguri's withdrawal meaning the two cars started from the rear of the grid for the majority of races. A seamless-shift transmission introduced at Valencia marked the end of development for the car; team owner Mallya had realised underinvestment and continued changes of ownership had led the team to fall behind. Force India had been focusing on [...] since Mallya brought the team, believing that the new regulations would yield better results. Despite halting work on the VJM01, Fisichella put his car to a season-best 12th on the grid at the [...] during an extremely wet qualifying session; he was however to crash out during the race. Fisichella continued his good form by reaching second during the Singapore round and fifth at the season-ending a safety car before his pit stop prevented points in Singapore, while transmission issues in Brazil left him 18th and two laps down. Force India finished the season tenth place in the Constructors' Championship, and Fisichella achieved the best finish of tenth at the [...]|$|R
