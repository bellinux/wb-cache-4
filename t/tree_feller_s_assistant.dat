40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{clinical}} characteristics of hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) {{in a group of}} <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> in a tropical environment. We examined all <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> and se-lected control subjects in a logging camp of central Sarawak for vibration exposure and presence of HAVS symptoms utilizing vibrotactile perception threshold test (VPT) and cold water provocation test (CWP). None of the subjects reported white finger. The <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> reported significantly higher prevalence of finger coldness as compared to the control subjects (OR= 10. 32, 95 %CI= 1. 21 – 87. 94). A lower finger skin temperature, longer fingernail capillary return time and higher VPT were ob-served among the <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> as compared to the control subjects in all fingers (effect size> 0. 5). The VPT following CWP of the <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> was significantly higher (repeated measures ANOVA p= 0. 002, partial η 2 = 0. 196) than the control subject. The A (8) level was associated with finger tingling, numb-ness and dullness (effect size= 0. 983) and finger coldness (effect size= 0. 524) among the <b>tree</b> <b>fellers.</b> Finger coldness and finger tingling, numbness and dullness are important symptoms for HAVS in tropical environment that may indicate vascular and neurological damage due to hand-transmitte...|$|R

40|$|The {{evidence}} on {{hand-arm vibration syndrome}} (HAVS) in tropical environments is limited. The legislation for the control of occupational vibration exposure {{has yet to be}} established in Malaysia. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the clinical characteristics of HAVS in a tropical environment in comparison with a temperate environment. Methods: We conducted a series medical examinations among the forestry, construction and automobile industry workers in Malaysia adopting the compulsory medical examination procedure used by Wakayama Medical University for Japanese vibratory tools workers. We matched the duration of vibration exposure and compared our results against the Japanese workers. We also compared the results of the Malaysian <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> against a group of symptomatic Japanese <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> diagnosed with HAVS. Results: Malaysian subjects reported a similar prevalence of finger tingling, numbness and dullness (Malaysian= 25. 0, Japanese= 21. 5, p= 0. 444) but had a lower finger skin temperature (FST) and higher vibrotactile perception threshold (VPT) values as compared with the Japanese workers. No white finger was reported in Malaysian subjects. The FST and VPT of the Malaysian <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> were at least as bad as the Japanese <b>tree</b> <b>fellers</b> despite a shorter duration (mean difference= 20. 12 years, 95 Cl= 14. 50, 25. 40) of vibration exposure. Conclusions: Although the vascular disorder does not manifest clinically in the tropical environment, the severity of HAVS can be as bad as in the temperate environment with predominantly neurological disorder. Hence, it is essential to formulate national legislation for the control of the occupational vibration exposure...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 s Assistants’ views about their {{emerging}} new role in contemporary nursing practice in Australia. Background: Internationally advanced practice nursing has led to a range of specialist roles aimed at delivering higher quality, efficient nursing care. In 2005 an Australian university developed the Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> graduate education and training program to provide nurses with an opportunity to gain advanced practice knowledge and extended skills specifically in the perioperative setting. Design: This study was a qualitative research design that used online surveys and in-depth interviews to explore the issues and challenges associated with the introduction of the (currently non-accredited) Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> role in Australia. Methods: Experienced Australia perioperative nurses who had undertaken graduate education and training in this field were recruited for this study. Data were collected between August and October 2011. An inductive thematic analysis was used to interpret the findings. Results: Eighteen nurses completed the online survey and six were interviewed (n = 24). Nurses cited their commitment to professional development and the delivery of high quality patient care, along with surgeons’ encouragement for them to complete specialist clinical training, as key reasons for undertaking Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> education and training. Conclusions: The Perioperative Nurse Surgeon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Assistant</b> role led to greater job satisfaction and autonomy, and assisted nurses to better meet the needs of patients, surgeons and clinical perioperative teams.

50|$|It {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in written sources in 1153. Most {{of the inhabitants}} were wine growers and <b>tree</b> <b>fellers.</b> Throughout the history Gyarmat had changed its face.

During the Rákóczi's War of Independence between 1703 and 1711 the village sustained a great tragedy when an imperial general burned down the village with all its people.Therefore Gyarmat was destroyed again. In 1720 German catholic settlers came from Rhineland-Palatinate. As a consequence, till today a lot of surnames are not Hungarian. During the First World War {{the majority of the}} people were part of the infantry regiment.Between the years 1920 and 1930 about 380 people emigrated to America. World War II hit twice.

5000|$|Knubel {{became an}} {{official}} mountain guide in 1904 upon receiving his guide's licence, {{while continuing to}} work as a stonemason and <b>tree</b> <b>feller.</b> His mountaineering skills were noticed by British climber Geoffrey Winthrop Young, who hired Knubel as his guide. From 1906 to 1914, Young and Knubel climbed together each summer, making a number of first ascents together, including the Täschhorn's south face, the Weisshorn's southeast and northeast faces, the Rimpfischhorn and Zinalrothorn's east faces, the Gspaltenhorn's west face, Grandes Jorasses' west ridge, and Mont Brouillard. The route the two mapped out to reach the summit of Aiguille du Plan in 1907 is still the route used by most alpine climbers today. On Young's first ascent of the east face of the Aiguille du Grépon with several other climbers and Knubel and Henri Brocherel as guides in 1911, Knubel used an ice axe instead of a piton to clear an overhang; the spot was thereafter known as [...] "The Knubel Crack".|$|R

This involves a conversion factor, a, which has the maximum value of two for low modifier content, but decays exponentially above a limiting composition, which occurs when there is a network of alternating BO 3 and BO 4 units. Above this composition the creation of BO 4 units is not favoured because this brings centres of negative charge into close proximity.
