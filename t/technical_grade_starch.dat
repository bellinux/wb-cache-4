40|$|An organic {{solar cell}} based on a bulk {{heterojunction}} (BHJ) of a polymer and a methanofullerene ([60]PCBM or [70]PCBM) exhibits a complex morphology that controls both its photovoltaic and mechanical compliance (robustness, flexibility, and stretchability). Methanofullerenes are excellent electron acceptors; however, they have relatively high cost and production energy (in the purest samples) compared to other small-molecule semiconductors. Moreover, [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM-typical of van der Waals solids-can be stiff and brittle. Stiffness and brittleness may lower the yield of working modules in roll-to-roll manufacturing, shorten the lifetime against mechanical failure in outdoor conditions, and jeopardize wearable and portable applications that demand stretchability or extreme flexibility. This paper tests the hypothesis that <b>technical</b> <b>grade</b> PCBM (incompletely separated but otherwise pure blends containing >= 90 % [60]PCBM or [70]PCBM) could {{lower the cost of}} manufacturing {{organic solar cell}}s while simultaneously increasing their mechanical stability. Measurements of the tensile modulus of five methanofullerene samples, <b>technical</b> <b>grades</b> and 99 % grades of both [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM, and a 1 : 1 mixture [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM, along with their blends with regioregular poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT), lead to two important conclusions: (1) films of pure [70]PCBM are approximately five times more compliant than films of pure [60]PCBM; BHJ films with [70]PCBM are also more compliant than those with [60]PCBM. (2) BHJ films comprising <b>technical</b> <b>grades</b> of [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM are approximately two to four times more compliant than are films made using 99 % grades. Tensile modulus is found to be an excellent predictor of brittleness: BHJs produced with <b>technical</b> <b>grade</b> methanofullerene accommodate strains 1. 4 - 2. 2 times greater than those produced with 99 % grades. The smallest range of stretchability was found for BHJs with 99 % [60]PCBM (fracture at 3. 5 % strain), while the greatest was found for <b>technical</b> <b>grade</b> [70]PCBM (11. 5 % strain). Mechanical properties are correlated to the microstructures of the blended films informed from analyses of UV-vis spectra using the weakly interacting H-aggregate model.
