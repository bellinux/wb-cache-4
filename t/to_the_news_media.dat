25|$|Aware {{that the}} Brookings Institution had played an {{influential}} role for decades in promoting liberal ideas, the Heritage Foundation {{was designed as}} a counterpart on the right. Meanwhile, older conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute grew rapidly as a result of major increases in conservative philanthropy. Both think tanks became more oriented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>media,</b> more aggressively ideological, and more focused on rapid-response production and shorter publications. At the same time, they generally eschewed long-term research in favor of projects with immediate policy implications and produced synthetic materials rather than long-term research.|$|E

The injuries described by Collins were consistent with those inflicted upon the victims which had not been disclosed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>media,</b> and David Leik would inform investigators that he had not disclosed any information regarding the Michigan Murders to his nephew.|$|E

In a post-junta Chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses at last began to tell their stories <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>media</b> and to human rights researchers.

It stated that it was not their task to sit in judgment of the Pope and his advisors but to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the papacy during the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|Photojournalism is a {{particular}} form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, {{but in some cases}} the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, street photography or celebrity photography) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>media,</b> and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.|$|E

Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, {{but it could have been}} so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>media</b> today.

The Kuomintang party was officially anti-feudal, and the Kuomintang itself claimed to be a revolutionary party of the people, so being accused of feudalism was a serious insult. Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Kuomintang, spoke out publicly against feudalism and feudal warlords.

2500|$|By the 1960s, {{the policy}} of {{excluding}} people based on nationality yielded a population overwhelmingly European in origin. By the mid-1960s, a desire for cheap unskilled labour led to ethnic diversification. In the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand encouraged migrants from the South Pacific. The country had a large demand for unskilled labour in the manufacturing sector. As long as this demand continued, migration was accepted from the South Pacific, and many temporary workers overstayed their visas. From 1974 to 1979 dawn raids were carried out by police to remove overstayers, {{most of whom were}} Pacific Islanders.

[...] This is not to say, of course, that Labour ignored the press. [...] However, it became reluctant to talk to it. [...] Kinnock refused to talk to the press on the flight back from his visit to the US President Ronald Reagan after British journalists had continually sought a story that would represent the trip in a negative light.
