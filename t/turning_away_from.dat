5|$|The poem {{uses the}} {{combined}} image {{of fire and}} Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation. According to the poet, humanity's flawed understanding of life and <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> God leads to a cycle of warfare, but this can be overcome by recognising {{the lessons of the}} past. Within the poem, the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures. Little Gidding focuses on the unity of past, present, and future, and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation.|$|E
5|$|The testimonies of the {{boatswain}} Cole, {{the carpenter}} Purcell, and the sailing master John Fryer were not unfavourable towards Heywood. However, Thomas Hayward's declared belief that Heywood {{was with the}} mutineers was damaging, as was the evidence of John Hallett concerning Heywood's alleged insolence in laughing and <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the captive Bligh—though Hallett had previously written to Nessy Heywood professing total ignorance of the part Heywood had played in the mutiny.|$|E

5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. <b>Turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul was a {{hurricane}} that ultimately struck Mexico as a tropical depression in October 2006. It developed {{from an area}} of disturbed weather on October21, and slowly intensified as it moved into an area of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear. Paul attained hurricane status on October23, and later that day it reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a strong Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. A strong trough turned the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast into an area of strong vertical shear, and Paul weakened to a tropical storm on October24. It accelerated northeastward, and after passing a short distance south of Baja California Sur the low level circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of the}} convection. Paul weakened to a tropical depression on October25 a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and after briefly <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the coast it made landfall on northwestern Sinaloa on October26.|$|E
5|$|Shepard pursues Saren {{through the}} Conduit, {{arriving}} at the Citadel as it comes under attack by Sovereign and geth forces. Confronting Saren, Shepard can kill him or convince him to rebel, which results in Saren committing suicide. As a human Systems Alliance fleet masses to counterattack, Shepard must either save the Council and risk heavy casualties or abandon them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, humanity prevails, and Saren's corpse is destroyed while Sovereign is dispatched by the Normandy. Humanity will then join the Council, either as a member if it was saved or as its new leader if {{it was left to}} perish. Regardless, Shepard nominates either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.|$|E

5|$|The {{developments}} {{spread to}} Anglo-Norman possessions in Ireland where this English style of castles dominated throughout the 13th century, although the deteriorating Irish {{economy of the}} 14th century brought this wave of building to an end. In Scotland Alexander II and Alexander III undertook a number of castle building projects in the modern style, although Alexander III's early death sparked conflict in Scotland and English intervention under Edward I in 1296. In the ensuing wars of Scottish Independence castle building in Scotland altered path, <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> building larger, more conventional castles with curtain walls. The Scots instead adopted the policy of slighting, or deliberately destroying, castles captured in Scotland from the English to prevent their re-use in subsequent invasions – {{most of the new}} Scottish castles built by nobles were of the tower house design; the few larger castles built in Scotland were typically royal castles, built by the Scottish kings.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{launched}} a counterattack, Miller taking the lead. He hoisted off spinner Laker's first ball over the square leg fence for six. Miller shielded Harvey from Laker, as his younger partner was struggling against the off breaks that were <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him, {{including one that}} spun and bounced sharply to beating the outside edge. Miller drilled one off-drive off Laker for four, and after mis-hitting the next, much to the amusement of the crowd, hit the off spinner flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined the fightback in the next over, hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He struck another boundary to reach 44, while Miller's score stayed on 42. After {{half an hour of}} play, the early morning life in the pitch appeared to have died out.|$|E
5|$|With the {{cessation}} of official missions to China and a general trend of <b>turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Chinese-derived institutions and behavioral patterns {{in the latter part}} of the 9th century, the compilation of such national histories patterned on formal Chinese dynastic histories was abandoned. With the development of kana script, new styles of uniquely Japanese literature such as the monogatari appeared around that time. The newer style of historic writing that emerged during the Fujiwara regency, at the turning point of ancient imperial rule and the classical era, was called historic tale (rekishi monogatari) and became influenced by the fictional tale, especially by the Tale of Genji, with which it shared the scene-by-scene construction as fundamental difference to earlier historic writings. The oldest historical tale is the Eiga Monogatari ("A Tale of Flowering Fortunes"), giving a eulogistic chronological account of the Fujiwara from 946 to 1027, focusing particularly on Fujiwara no Michinaga. It was largely written by Akazome Emon, probably shortly after the death of Michinaga in 1027.|$|E

5|$|Willaumez {{had planned}} to {{resupply}} his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. <b>Turning</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag {{in the hope that}} enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries. On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity. Hopelessly outnumbered, Captain Bretel {{had no choice but to}} surrender, the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers in the hold, captured by Willaumez from Redmill's convoy.|$|E

25|$|It was in 1758 that Conyers {{experienced}} an evangelical conversion.
