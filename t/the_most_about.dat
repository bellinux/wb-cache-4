5|$|The Thousand-Year Door {{contains}} several characters, {{the majority}} of whom are not playable. Progression in the game is sometimes dependent on interaction with non-player characters, although many {{are used in the}} game's various subquests. In particular, the Goomba Professor Frankly, who knows <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>about</b> the mysteries relating to Rogueport, must be visited every time Mario retrieves a Crystal Star. The game continues the tradition of Paper Mario, in which Mario can be accompanied by one assistant character at a set time. There are seven party members in total: Goombella the Goomba, Koops the Koopa, Madame Flurrie the wind spirit, a Yoshi (named by the player), Vivian the Shadow Siren, Admiral Bobbery the Bob-omb, and Ms. Mowz, who is available as an optional character.|$|E

Two ranchers tagged a {{specific}} calf, then continued tagging other animals in the same pasture. The ranchers were, at <b>the</b> <b>most,</b> <b>about</b> 300 yards from the calf. Less than an hour later, the first calf was discovered completely eviscerated—most muscle and all internal organs were missing. There was no blood, entrails, or apparent disturbance at the scene. Independent analysts both uncovered marks on the calf's remains consistent with {{two different types of}} tools: a large, machete-type blade, and smaller, more delicate scissors.|$|E

25|$|Charles Halloway is the {{character}} who learns <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>about</b> this; he initially views death as unpleasant and it thus becomes a sinister force {{to him that}} the Mirror Maze magnifies. However, Will's words of love help him to see that age does not matter if one focuses instead on the knowledge and affections gained with it, and as his fear vanishes, so does the Mirror Maze. He also is able to defeat the Dust Witch once he realizes that she does not have ultimate control over him. With his belief in her powers gone, he turns the tables on the Witch by instilling the same fear in her of his smile that he used to have of her magic.|$|E
25|$|The 2000–01 season {{featured}} {{a drop of}} two points for the Centennials, but an improvement in the standings to second in the Interior Division. The Cents {{wound up with a}} record of 30–21–9 and 69 points. However, it wouldn't be the regular season that fans in Merritt would remember <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>about</b> the year, rather an improbable run to the Fred Page Cup Final. The Cents faced off against Prince George in the Interior Division opening round and promptly swept the Spruce Kings in four straight. They then met up in the Interior Conference final with the Penticton Panthers, who had finished the season first in the division, 29 points ahead of the Centennials. The first place Panthers proved to be no match for Merritt, as the Cents outscored Penticton 16 to 7 in a four-game sweep. Next up, it was the franchise's first appearance in the Fred Page Cup final, and it would be against the Victoria Salsa. Despite a thrilling seven game series, the Salsa took the BCHL championship on home ice. Forward Mike Ouelette provided a bright spot individually as he won BCHL Rookie of the Year for the Interior Conference.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} written in second person, {{a message from the}} singer to her ex-boyfriend {{detailing}} the hurt he caused her while they were dating.

Ben Ratliff of The New York Times noted that the list actually [...] "runs to 8 to 11 things, depending on how you parse it". Henry Freedland of Paste magazine compared it to a similar list featured as a poem in the 1999 film 10 Things I Hate About You. In one verse, Cyrus asks for a sincere apology and states, [...] "If you text it, I'll delete it", which Molly Lambert of The New York Times said [...] "perfectly captur our confusing age of technologically mediated courtship."

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the first two, Season 3 of the series was met with mostly negative reception. After the eventual cancellation of the show, Schwartz admitted that [...] "the whole {{first half of the}} third season was a total mess." [...] IGN faulted a season which, in their opinion, had [...] "far too much time and too many episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny." [...] IGN also noted that [...] "Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories," [...] and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake [...] "as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens." [...] In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show [...] "went down the wrong road" [...] with Johnny. The season did, however, receive some praise. The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being [...] "played to perfection by Autumn Reeser" [...] and her character was described as [...] "one of the greatest elements of The O.C." [...] Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as [...] "very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor to keep your interest." [...] While looking back on the series in an interview for the complete series box-set, Schwartz explained that [...] "somewhere around Season 3, for reasons too numerous to discuss, I lost focus. The network wasn't really supporting the show." [...] Schwartz {{went on to say that}} Season 3 was probably [...] "the most important season, because it's where I learned <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>About</b> television, about myself as a writer, about discipline and trying to hold onto your focus even if you're hearing a lot of opinions or being forced to add things creatively that you don't agree with.
