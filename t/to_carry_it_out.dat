Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} was particularly keen {{to secure the}} release of Major Andy Harrison—the last British UNMO being held by the RUF. Harrison's contingent of UNMOs was protected by an Indian Army detachment. The Indian Army Gurkhas—attached to UNAMSIL—were under siege by the RUF at their base in Kailahun. The British and Indian commands in Sierra Leone had devised a plan to extract the UNMOs. British special forces remained in the country, ready <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but the UN and the British command feared that the RUF would retaliate against other UNAMSIL forces they had besieged if the UNMOs were extracted. Thus, Major General Vijay Kumar Jetley, Commander of UNAMSIL, was allowed to continue negotiations {{for the release of}} the other besieged UNAMSIL contingents.|$|E

The coup was successful and overthrew the three-member regency: Prince Paul, Dr. Radenko Stanković and Dr. Ivo Perović, as well as the government of Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković. Two days before the coup, the Cvetković government had signed the Vienna Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the Tripartite Pact (Axis).

The JNA devised Operation Shield (Štit), aimed at disarming the Croatian forces and the arrest and trial of the Croatian leadership, in response. Although the operation was prepared by December 1990, federal Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijević never sought authorisation <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> from the Yugoslav Presidency. Instead, he ordered the KOS to stand down on the morning the operation was scheduled to begin.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} plan—drafted {{under the}} direction of the Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Toyoda Soemu—called for Yamato and her escorts to attack the U.S. fleet supporting the U.S. troops landing on the west of the island. Yamato and her escorts were to fight their way to Okinawa and then beach themselves between Higashi and Yomitan and fight as shore batteries until they were destroyed. Once the ships were destroyed, their surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon ship and fight U.S. forces on land. Very little, if any, air cover could be provided for the ships, which would render them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from US carrier-based aircraft. In preparation for executing the plan, the assigned ships left Kure for Tokuyama, Yamaguchi, off Mitajiri, Japan, on 29 March. However, despite obeying orders to prepare for the mission, Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō—commander of the Ten-Go force—still refused to actually order his ships <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> believing the plan to be futile and wasteful.|$|E
5|$|Castelli also {{abolished}} the mita in Upper Peru, a mandatory form {{of public service}} that bordered on slavery. Mariano Moreno has also wished to end the mita, but Moreno had resigned from the Junta by this point. Without Castelli being in Buenos Aires to mediate between them, the disputes between Moreno and Saavedra had worsened. The Junta requested that Castelli should moderate his actions, but he went ahead with the positions he shared with Moreno. Several Saavedrist officers, such as José María Echaurri, José León Domínguez, Matías Balbastro, chaplain Manuel Antonio Azcurra, and sergeant major Toribio de Luzuriaga, planned to kidnap Castelli, deliver him to Buenos Aires for trial, and give command of the Army of the North to Juan Jose Viamonte. However, Viamonte did not accept the plan when he was informed by the conspirators, and did not attempt <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> When Castelli knew about Moreno's resignation, {{he wrote a letter}} to Vieytes, Rodriguez Peña, Larrea, and Azcuénaga, asking them to move to Upper Peru. If they defeated Goyeneche, they planned to march back to Buenos Aires. However, the letter was sent via the common postal service, and the postmaster of Córdoba, Jose de Paz, decided to send it instead to Cornelio Saavedra. The Morenist members of the Junta had already been ousted and exiled by that point.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Background : In {{the field}} of speech-language pathology, there is an {{increasing}} focus on participation-focused interventions. This term refers to evaluating clients and establishing therapy programs that emphasize helping clients achieve optimal participation in their life activities such as work, household management, social relationships, and community activities. Purpose : To investigate whether and how speech language pathologists (SLPs) in the United States are addressing participation in their current therapy programs, {{as well as their}} attitudes toward this type of intervention, including barriers and facilitators <b>to</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Methods : An online questionnaire for SLPs who work with adults and have worked in an outpatient setting. Results : SLPs address a wide range of goals in therapy, and a majority of SLPs address participation in their rationales for choosing therapy goals. However, there is frequently a mismatch between SLPs' stated goals and the activities and outcomes measures they use to make and measure progress toward those goals. While many SLPs believe participation-focused intervention is important, they identify a number of barriers <b>to</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> including time and productivity constraints, the limits of clinical settings, and the challenges of documentation. Clinical implications : Results suggest {{that there is a need}} to bridge the gap between clinicians stated intents in therapy and actual therapy practices through the development of clinical tools and resources related to participation...|$|R

There he met his successor-designate Sir John Jellicoe who had received orders from First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill to relieve the ageing Callaghan of command of his fleet. Jellicoe had resisted the order, believing it would cause tension in the fleet, but the order was confirmed by the Admiralty and Jellicoe was instructed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Callaghan was bitterly disappointed not to command his fleet in the war he had completely readied it for.|$|E

In addition, an animosity had already been brewing between Kâmil Pasha and the CUP since the 1908 Young Turk Revolution that had started the Second Constitutional Era. During the {{more than four years}} since, Kâmil Pasha had made a series of efforts to keep CUP members far from government and keep the army, which had many CUP members among its ranks, out of politics. By January 1913, the CUP was thoroughly frustrated with Kâmil Pasha and Freedom and Accord.

500|$|Douglas Rankine of Wired UK and McKinley Noble of GamePro thought {{previously}} existing Nintendo DS {{games were}} revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL's larger screens; games like Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text, respectively. CVG's Mike Jackson {{argued that the}} bigger screens, which made its unchanged resolution blockier, would probably be less noticeable to the older demographic for which the XL is undoubtedly designed. However, Jackson and IGN's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution. Carol Mangis of PC Magazine thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL, but the larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade. Lowe, Burke, Jackson, and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade; Jackson explained [...] "if you tend not <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with you, and only ever tend to use it at home, then the DSi XL is the better choice".|$|E

[...] Dong's task was difficult, as Liu {{was one of the most}} prominent figures in the first row, standing to the left of Madame Song. [...] Officials wanted Liu replaced with Lin Biao, much in Mao's favor at the time. [...] Dong was unwilling to give Lin prominence he had not then had, and though he could not refuse outright at the dangerous time of the Cultural Revolution, he eventually got permission to merely remove Liu. [...] The figure was too large to simply delete, so Liu was repainted as Dong Biwu, and made to appear as if in the second row. [...] According to Andrews, the attempt was a failure: [...] "the new Dong Biwu does not recede into the second row as intended. [...] Instead, he appears as a leering, glowing figure, a strangely malevolent character in the midst of an otherwise stately group". [...] Officials deemed the revised work unexhibitable. [...] Andrews speculated that Dong may have been trying to sabotage the change, or may have been affected by the stress of the years of the Cultural Revolution.|$|E
