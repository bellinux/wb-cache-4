5|$|Another type of {{mounting}} that became fashionable around the mid-Heian period is the kenukigata, or hair-tweezer style, {{named for the}} characteristically shaped hilt, which is pierced along <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> <b>In</b> this style, the hilt is fitted with an ornamental border and did not contain any wooden covering. Like kazari-tachi, swords with this mounting were used for ceremonial purposes but also in warfare, as an example held at Ise Grand Shrine shows.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{after the}} {{transfer}} of the Ukrainian capital from Kharkov to Kiev, a decision was made to demolish the cathedral and build administrative buildings in its place. For this purpose, in 1934 soviet authorities have decided to hold a competition for the project of the Governmental Center with a place for parades. In all of the projects submitted for the location in the area of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Square, the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral was demolished, except for one. The project of Joseph Karakis {{was the only one of}} four projects submitted for the competition with the location of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>in</b> this place, in which the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral and the monument to Bogdan Khmelnitsky were preserved. However, at the end of the first round, the project of architect Peter Yurchenko was selected by the authorities as the most appropriate.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton derived this theorem in Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, first {{published}} in 1687. In Proposition 43, he showed that the added force must be a central force, one whose magnitude depends only upon the distance r between the particle and a point fixed in space (<b>the</b> <b>center).</b> <b>In</b> Proposition 44, he derived a formula for the force, showing {{that it was an}} inverse-cube force, one that varies as the inverse cube of r. In Proposition 45 Newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that the particle moved in nearly circular orbit.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 1967, Wayzata Bay Center was {{constructed}} in two phases; the first phase was completed in 1964 while the second phase was completed in 1967. The mall initially featured several regional retailers, along with small businesses, but eventually made way for various national chains, including The Original Pancake House and True Value. After increasing vacancies throughout <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>in</b> the 2000s, a Minnesota construction firm purchased the center from United Properties for $16 million in 2009.

5|$|Set in 2090, {{the game}} is centred on a fictional extreme racing sport known as Ballistics, a {{descendant}} of Formula One. The player takes {{the role of a}} Ballistic's pilot, racing hoverbikes called speeders through the inside of tubes which form the courses. The speeders are magnetically attached to the race surface, allowing the player 360 degrees of movement along the left/right axis. The player can detach the speeder from the track and navigate down <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid track obstacles and to acquire the power-ups exclusively located there. Players must try to follow the outside of each curve, as hitting the inside of a curve at speed could lead to an involuntary detachment, leading to a loss of control and seconds dropped in securing reattachment.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the northwest, and intensified into Tropical Storm Grace six hours after forming. Despite the increase in winds the center of circulation remained very broad, with Reconnaissance Aircraft having difficulty pinpointing <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> <b>In</b> addition, an upper level low located over Brownsville, Texas produced shear over the western portion of the system, which limited outflow to the east side. Forecasters predicted the upper level low to weaken, allowing {{for the possibility of}} Grace to intensify to a 65mph (100km/h) tropical storm over warm waters. However, the upper level low remained in place and continued to produce shear across the system. A new center of circulation reformed 115miles (185km) north of the original center, and made landfall near San Luis Pass on the southwestern portion of Galveston Island on August 31 as a minimal tropical storm. Grace quickly weakened to a tropical depression over land, and after turning northeastward into Oklahoma the depression was absorbed by a cold front.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> <b>In</b> a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E
5|$|While passing to {{the south}} of Bermuda, the {{subtropical}} storm maintained winds of 70mph (110km/h), with wind gusts on the island surpassing 100mph (160km/h). After becoming dissociated from the Westerlies, the system turned northward, and began to develop convection over <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the frontal characteristics of the subtropical storm continually weakened. On October 13, based on an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit observation that stated that a warm core was present throughout the system, the National Hurricane Center designated the system as a tropical storm, and gave it the name Karen. At this point, Karen was located 200miles (320km) north of Bermuda. Karen slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, and the storm intensified to a hurricane later on October 13. Convection continued to develop, and organized into a ring around the eye as Karen reached its peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h) on October 14 while located about 400miles (640km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> <b>In</b> a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
5|$|Late on July17, Ma-on {{underwent}} another eyewall replacement {{cycle and}} weakened, despite developing improved outflow and convection {{in the northern}} quadrant. The typhoon's large size prevented re-intensification– gale force winds extended 370km (200mi) east of <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the intrusion of dry air diminished thunderstorms in the western periphery. By July18, Ma-on reached the western extent of the ridge and began a motion to the north toward Japan. The next day, it turned to the northeast as it paralleled the Japan coastline just offshore. At around 1400UTC on July19, Ma-on made landfall on Shikoku as a minimal typhoon. Turning to the east, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before moving over {{the southern tip of}} the Kii Peninsula early on July20. After emerging from the country, Ma-on turned to the southeast. Increased wind shear displaced the convection to the east, although slight re-intensification was expected. However, the JTWC downgraded Ma-on to a tropical depression on July21 after the storm lost much of its convection. The circulation became ill-defined, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July22, noting the system {{was in the process of}} dissipation. However, the JMA maintained Ma-on as a severe tropical storm until July23, by which time the storm had turned to the northeast. The storm became extratropical on July24 near the Kuril Islands, lasting another seven days before dissipating east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ground}} {{hardening}} {{due to the}} cold weather, The Germans resumed the attack on Moscow on 15 November. Although the troops themselves were now able to advance again, {{there had been no}} improvement in the supply situation. Facing the Germans were the 5th, 16th, 30th, 43rd, 49th, and 50th Soviet Armies. The Germans intended to move the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies across the Moscow Canal and envelop Moscow from the northeast. The 2nd Panzer Group would attack Tula and then close on Moscow from the south. As the Soviets reacted to their flanks, the 4th Army would attack <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> <b>In</b> two weeks of fighting, lacking sufficient fuel and ammunition, the Germans slowly crept towards Moscow. In the south, the 2nd Panzer Group was being blocked. On 22 November, Soviet Siberian units, augmented by the 49th and 50th Soviet Armies, attacked the 2nd Panzer Group and inflicted a defeat on the Germans. The 4th Panzer Group pushed the Soviet 16th Army back, however, and succeeded in crossing the Moscow Canal in an attempt to encircle Moscow.|$|E
