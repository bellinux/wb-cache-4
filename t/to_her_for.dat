5|$|Fellini secured {{financing}} {{through the}} producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, {{who wanted to}} cast Silvana Mangano (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampanò, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been {{the inspiration for the}} entire project, so Fellini was determined never to accept an alternative <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>For</b> Zampanò, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the right person for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, {{who was a member of}} Fellini's social circle and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was eager to take the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume.|$|E
