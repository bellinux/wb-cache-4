40|$|A {{promising}} {{technique to}} enhance fuel efficiency of large capacity S. I. engines is the de-activation of some cylinders at partial load, through <b>the</b> <b>cut-out</b> <b>of</b> fuel metering and a specific {{control of the}} airflow. Thanks to the ensuing reduction of throttling losses (the active cylinders operate {{at a much higher}} load), fuel consumption can be reduced, without any negative perception from the driver. Such a technique has been already applied successfully on some production engines, at the cost of some additional complication on the valve-train system. The application analyzed in this study is a little bit different, being aimed to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions, with a minimum impact on engine design. Larger fuel savings may be obtained by coupling the cylinder de-activation with VVT. However, the most important advantage of the modular engine concept proposed in this paper is in terms of emissions: this study demonstrates that the light-off time of the catalysts may be strongly reduced, and a further improvement is obtained by doubling the effective surface of the catalytic bed. The study has been carried out on a conventional SI 4. 2 L V 8 engine. The first step of the analysis has been the experimental validation of a 1 D-CFD model of the engine, achieved with a very good accuracy at both full and partial load. Then, the engine has been simulated on a grid of 15 operating points, representing the usage in the New European Driving cycle. The following configurations have been analyzed and compared to the base engine: 4 active cylinders, 3 active cylinders; 4 active cylinders and optimization of valve timings; 3 active cylinders and optimization of valve timings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{most common}} {{mechanical}} {{failure in the}} internal fixation of trochanteric hip fractures is <b>the</b> <b>cut-out</b> <b>of</b> the sliding screw through the femoral head. Several factors that influence this complication have been suggested, {{but there is no}} consensus as to the relative importance of each factor. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyse the cut-out complication with respect to the following variables: patients’ age, fracture type, fracture reduction, implant positioning and implant design. Methods 3066 consecutive patients were treated for trochanteric fractures with Gamma Nails between 1990 and 2002 at the Centre de Traumatologie et de l`Orthopedie (CTO), Strasbourg, France. Cut-out complications were identified by reviewing all available case notes and radiographs. Subsequently, the data were analysed by a single reviewer (AJB) with focus on the studied factors. Results Seventy-one cut-out complications were found (2. 3 %) of the 3066 trochanteric fractures. Cut-out failure associated with avascular head necrosis, pathologic fracture, deep infection or secondary to prior failure of other implants were excluded from the study (14 cases). The remaining 57 cases (1. 85 %, median age 82. 6, 79 % females) were believed to have a biomechanical explanation for the cut-out failure. 41 patients had a basicervical or complex fracture type. A majority of cut-outs (43 hips, 75 %) had a combination of the critical factors studied; non-anatomical reduction, non-optimal lag screw position and the characteristic fracture pattern found. Conclusions The primary cut-out rate of 1. 85 % was low compared with the literature. A typical cut-out complication in our study is represented by an unstable fracture involving the trochanteric and cervical regions or the combination of both, non-anatomical reduction and non-optimal screw position. Surgeons confronted with proximal femoral fractures should carefully scrutinize preoperative radiographs to assess the primary fracture geometry and fracture classification. To reduce the risk of a cut-out it is important to achieve both anatomical reduction and optimal lag screw position as these are the only two factors that can be controlled by the surgeon. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> <b>cut-out</b> <b>of</b> {{the sliding}} screw {{is one of}} the most common {{complications}} in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. The reasons for the cut-out are: a suboptimal position of the hip-screw in the femoral head, the type of fracture and poor bone quality. The aim of this study was to reproduce the cut-out event biomechanically and to evaluate the possible prevention of this event by the use of a biopolymer augmentation of the hip screw. Concerning the density and compression force of osteoporotic femoral bone polyurethane foam according to the terms of the Association for Standard Testing Material (ASTMF 1839 - 97) was used as test material. The polyurethane foam Lumoltan 200 with a compression force of 3. 3 Mpa and a density of 0. 192 g/cm 3 was used to reproduce the osteoporotic bone of the femoral fragment (density 12 lbm/ft 3). A cylinder of 50 mm of length and 50 mm of width was produced by a rotary splint raising procedure with planar contact. The axial load of the system was performed by a hydraulic force cylinder of a universal test machine type Zwick 1455, Ulm, Germany. The CCD-angle of the used TGN-System was preset at 130 degrees. The migration pattern of the hip screw in the polyurethane foam was measured and expressed as a curve of the distance in millimeter [mm] against the applied load in Newton [N] up to the cut-out point. During the tests the implants reached a critical changing point from stable to unstable with an increased load progression of steps of 50 Newton. This unstable point was characterized by an increased migration speed in millimeters and higher descending gradient in the migration curve. This peak of the migration curve served as an indicator for the change of the hip screw position in the simulated bone material. The applied load in the non-augmented implant showed that in this group for a density degree of 12 (0, 192 g/cm 3) the mean force at the failure point was 1431 Newton (± 52 Newton). In the augmented implant we found that the mean force at the failure point was 1987 Newton (± 84 Newton). This difference was statistically significant. In conclusion, the bone density is a significant factor for the stability of the hip screw implant. The osteosynthesis with screws in material with low density increases the chance for cut-out. A biopolymer augmented hip screw could significantly improve the stability of the fixation. The use of augmentation with a fast hardening bone replacement material containing polymer-ceramic changes the point of failure under axial load in the osteoporotic bone model and could significantly improve the failure point. Our study results indicate, that a decrease of failure in terms of cut-out can be achieved with polymer augmentation of hip screws in osteoporotic bones. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>cut-out</b> risk <b>of</b> Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) was {{investigated}} in nine different positions of the lag screw for two fracture types by using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Methods. Two types of fractures (31 -A 1. 1 and A 2. 1 in AO classification) were generated in the femur model obtained from Computerized Tomography images. The DHS model was placed into the fractured femur model in nine different positions. Tip-Apex Distances were measured using SolidWorks. In FEA, the force applied to the femoral head was determined according to the maximum value being observed during walking. Results. The highest volume percentage exceeding the yield strength of trabecular bone was obtained in posterior-inferior region in both fracture types. The best placement region for the lag screw {{was found in the}} middle of both fracture types. There are compatible results between Tip-Apex Distances and <b>the</b> <b>cut-out</b> risk except for posterior-superior and superior region of 31 -A 2. 1 fracture type. Conclusion. The position of the lag screw affects <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>cut-out</b> significantly. Also, Tip-Apex Distance is a good predictor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut-out</b> risk.
