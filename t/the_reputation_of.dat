On her marriage to Elector Johann Wilhelm II, she became Electress of the Palatinate, and, by patronising musicians, she earned for the contemporary Palatine court <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> an important music centre.

5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> being a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly {{as much attention as}} Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E

5|$|David Margoliouth (professor 1889–1937) {{taught the}} {{syllabus}} {{for the final}} examinations in lectures over two years, forcing some students to tackle the more difficult texts {{in their first year}} of study. Successive professors had few students until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> the then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war. Julia Bray, the Laudian Professor , was appointed in 2012 and is the first woman to hold the position. She is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, several {{properties}} on Park Lane {{were hit}} by bombs. Dudley House, at No.100, suffered major structural damage, including {{the destruction of the}} ballroom and gallery, though the building was partially restored.

The same year she and her brother, John Aikin, jointly published Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose, which was also well received. The essays in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to Samuel Johnson's.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years at Croydon, girls tended to be {{enrolled}} at an older age, typically over fourteen.

By 1900 <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> the school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area, including New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Its {{mixture of}} genres makes The General in His Labyrinth {{difficult}} to classify, and commentators disagree over where it {{lies on the}} scale between novel and historical account. García Márquez's insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements—some dealing with Bolívar's most intimate moments—caused outrage in parts of Latin America when the book was released. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel damaged <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> one of the region's most important historic figures and portrayed a negative image to the outside world. Others saw The General in His Labyrinth as a tonic for Latin American culture and {{a challenge to the}} region to deal with its problems.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} the impact of events on <b>the</b> Web <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> a city. <b>The</b> marketing and tourism literature indicates that events represent an important lever to strengthen the brand of travel destinations. However, the impact of events on <b>the</b> Web <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> a city is largely unexplored. This paper takes a first step in this direction by measuring the impact of two events on <b>the</b> Web <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> Milan city: <b>the</b> September 2011 fashion week and the May 2011 arrival of the bike racing tour of Italy (Giro d’Italia). Impact is measured in terms of both growth of volumes and sentiment of Web conversations on Milan city. Findings seem to indicate that events can have a varying impact on <b>the</b> Web <b>reputation</b> <b>of</b> a city depending on their consistency with the city brand strengths...|$|R

5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims.
