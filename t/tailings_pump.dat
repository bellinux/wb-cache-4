40|$|Lowering the {{processing}} cost of liquid-liquid extraction {{by eliminating the}} clarification process, requires {{an understanding of the}} hydrodynamics and the operating regions of pulsed column when treating unclarified solutions. In order to achieve such an objective, an investigation has been carried out to measure and compare the total hold-up of clarified solutions and solvent in pulp operation for two potential commercial operations, uranium and gold tailings. Preliminary bench scale separation tests were carried out in order to evaluate phase separation characteristics and assist in the selection of the extractant phase with a minimum of emulsion formation. The results of these tests indicated good phase separation for the uranium aqueous tailings system. However, for the gold tailings system slight crud formation was noticed for the system chosen. Based on these bench scale tests, total hold-up measurements were made for eight systems using a pulsed sieve plate extraction column. The systems included both clarified solution (five) and solvent in pulp processing (three). Results of the clarified solutions test showed that, the hold-up increased with an increase in the amplitude of pulsing, dispersed phase flow rate and pH of the aqueous phase; while, hold-up is unaffected by the variation in the continuous phase flow rate. An increase in the pulse frequency decreased the hold-up in the mixer-settler region till it reached a minimum at the dispersion region. Then, in the emulsion region the hold-up increased with a further increase in pulse frequency. These results were in agreement with results obtained by Koren, Sehmel and Babb. Maintaining the operating conditions the same as in the clarified solution test; when spent uranium tailings were added to the aqueous phase, the column operated in the transition region between the mixer-settler and the emulsion region. The column remained in this region of operation till the pulse frequency or the pulse amplitude or both were increased. Stable emulsions obtained in gold tailings system prevented reliable hold-up measurements and suggested that this system can not be studied unless the crud formation is eliminated. A fractional factorial design was carried out during the experiments in order to minimize the number of runs and avoid erosion to the <b>tailings</b> <b>pump.</b> The experimental data of each system were fitted to a second order model as proposed by Bell and Babb in order to correlate the hold-up data. No common form of these equation models for predicting hold-up was noticed, each model had its unique identity. Different equations obtained from literature were used to predict the hold-up. In the case of uranium tailings system, The models suggested by Sato et al was found to be the best when uranium concentration was 10 % by weight, while, Arthayukti's model gave better agreement for 25 % uranium tailings...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 125 The cost of high {{pressure}} gland water and increasing environmental concerns {{have made the}} use of flushless mechanical seals attractive in many slurry applications. One such application exists at Syncrude Canada Lts (SCL). SCL is a large scale mining operation that extracts crude oil from tar sand. The by product of the process, 150 degrees F sand and water <b>tailings,</b> is <b>pumped</b> to remove storage sites. <b>Tailings</b> <b>pumps</b> are staged in series {{to reduce the number}} of pump stations. As a result, tailing line pressures can reach 300 psig. Recently, SCL expanded their tailings storage by adding a new remote site. Due to the high cost of installing and maintaining a gland water line, the decision was made to use flushless mechanical seals in place of packing. At the time of the expansion a large slurry seal capable of handling the {{high pressure}} tailings was not available; however, one seal manufacturer had a prototype seal design that had potential. This seal was chosen with the thought that it could be developed and refined to provide consistent 200 hr life. Having made the decision to use mechanical seals, the pipeline system was designed with the mechanical seal requirements in mind. Shortly after startup of the new tailing lines, seals began to fail. With the line now in operation, it was necessary to quickly resolve the problems. An intensive effort was launched to determine why seals were failing. Initial investigation showed the process, controls, and new equipment were working properly. The failures appeared to be seal relation. Over the next months, joint work conducted by SCL and the seal manufacturer identified a range of seal problems and interim measures were implemented to increase seal life. As a result of this work, an improved seal design was achieved. Extensive lab and field testing of the improved seal has proved its performance in this aggressive service. Active seals now average 3000 hr, with some seals having a life of over 6000 hr...|$|R

25|$|Among {{the impacts}} of deep sea mining, {{sediment}} plumes could have the greatest impact. Plumes are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles floating in the water. Two types of plumes occur: near-bottom plumes and surface plumes. Near-bottom plumes occur when the <b>tailings</b> are <b>pumped</b> {{back down to the}} mining site. The floating particles increase the turbidity, or cloudiness, of the water, clogging filter-feeding apparatuses used by benthic organisms. Surface plumes cause a more serious problem. Depending {{on the size of the}} particles and water currents the plumes could spread over vast areas. The plumes could impact zooplankton and light penetration, in turn affecting the food web of the area.|$|R

40|$|Outukumpu Zinc-Tara Mines Ireland, located {{approximately}} 50 km {{north of}} Dublin, is Europe's largest producer of {{lead and zinc}} ores. Water used during extraction and purification of these ores is enriched with sulfate and heavy metals. Presently, this water together with suspended <b>tailings,</b> is <b>pumped</b> from the mine and stored in a large tailings settling pond. Two experimental artificial wetlands were built beside this settling pond to treat seepage. The primary strategy employed for treatment of the water is the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. The wetlands are maintained anaerobic to provide optimum conditions conducive to reduction reactions. This process is mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria, which are indigenous in the bedding substrate (spent mushroom compost) used. The alkaline nature of the mine tailings water (due to the strong buffering capacity of the prevailing limestone geology) facilitates the subsequent precipitation of metal sulfide complexes which form following reduction of sulfate. The constructed wetlands have been in operation for two years but have exhibited consistent removal of sulfate from water. Recent results suggest that algae, having spontaneously invaded the wetland ecosystems, also play a substantial role in the removal of heavy metals from the tailings water. To-date, this decontamination approach is showing to be efficacious and cost-effective...|$|R

This largely extended the area around the wharves close to the heart of the city, but did not extend any further south until 1912, when a causeway was built along the head of the harbour. As part of an Otago Harbour Board scheme to reclaim land for industrial use, dredges started to <b>pump</b> <b>tailings</b> into the area behind the causeway in the 1940s. Reclamation continued for many years, and was not officially completed until the opening of Portsmouth Drive, which runs along the route of the 1912 causeway at the harbour edge, in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Paste {{tailings}} is {{a modification}} {{to the conventional}} methods of disposal of tailings (pond storage). A conventional tailings slurry has a low %solids and a relatively high water content (normally ranging from 20% to 60% solids for most hard rock mining) and when deposited into the tailings pond the solids and liquids separate. In paste tailings the %Solids of the tailings slurry is increased {{through the use of}} paste thickeners to produce a product where the minimal separation of water and solids occurs and the material is deposited into a storage area as a paste (with a consistency somewhat like toothpaste). Paste tailings has the advantage that more water is recycled in the processing plant and therefore the process is more water efficient than conventional tailings and there is a lower potential for seepage. However the cost of the thickening is generally higher than for conventional <b>tailings</b> and the <b>pumping</b> costs for the paste are also normally higher than for conventional tailings as positive displacement pumps are normally required to transport the tailings from the processing plant to the storage area. Paste tailings are used in several locations around the world including Sunrise Dam in Western Australia and Bulyanhulu Gold Mine in Tanzania.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify environmental tracers using water chemistry and stable isotopes in the Moulton Road area adjacent to the Yankee Doodle tailings impoundment north of Butte, Montana. The water level of the tailings lake is being raised as <b>tailings</b> slurry is <b>pumped</b> up to the impoundment, and numerous residential wells are located in close proximity. Although it has an alkaline pH (3 ̆e 9), the water in the tailings lake is much higher in some chemical constituents than the wells and some of these constituents could be used as tracers to determine if lake water is migrating out of the impoundment due to the rising level. Tracers examined in this study include the O- and H-isotopic composition of water and the concentration and S- and Oisotopic compositions of dissolved sulfate. Although water in the tailings lake is partly evaporated, the contrast between the isotopic signature of the lake and the groundwater wells is relatively small, making it a less powerful tracer. On the other hand, sulfate concentrations are more than an order of magnitude higher in the lake than in the groundwater. Whereas the Sisotope compositions of dissolved sulfate in lake and groundwater samples are similar, the Oisotope compositions of sulfate for the two end members are very different (- 2. 8 and - 14. 0 ‰, respectively). A conservative mass balance model was used to predict changes in the concentration and isotopic composition of sulfate in background groundwater as water sourced from the tailings lake is mixed in.
