The {{mechanism}} of <b>thermally</b> transferred optically <b>stimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> in quartz, Journal of Physica D: Applied Physics 41 (13) 135503. In this paper we assess two mechanisms {{for the production}} of the <b>thermally</b> transferred optically <b>stimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> (TT-OSL) signal in quartz when all stimulation is carried out at 125 ?C. One mechanism is based on the double transfer process previously put forward for OSL recuperation following storage at room temperature. In this mechanism, electrons from the trap giving rise to the fast OSL component are released by optical stimulation and some are transferred into a refuge trap via the conduction band; these electrons are then released from the refuge trap by a thermal treatment and some are retrapped in the trap responsible for the fast OSL component. The other mechanism is based on a single transfer process in which electrons are transferred by thermal treatment from a light-sensitive trap via the conduction band to the trap that gives rise to the fast component of the OSL signal, this trap having been emptied by the initial optical stimulation. The analysis of the measured OSL and TT-OSL decay curves suggest that the two signals are derived from the same traps and are dominated by the fast OSL component. The experimental data presented support the hypothesis that the original source of the electrons that are thermally transferred is a trap that is less light sensitive than that giving rise to the fast OSL, but one that has similar thermal stability. Thus, a single transfer mechanism explains the production of the TT-OSL signal observed for stimulation above 120 ?C when the 110 ?C TL trap is kept empty. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The TT-OSL was separated into two components; recuperated OSL (ReOSL) and basic transfer (BT-OSL) by annealing samples at 300 degrees C for 10 s as suggested in an earlier study. Four quartz extracts were studied, two from loess from China and two from coastal sands from South Africa. The equivalent doses of the two recent samples (one sand and one loess) were similar to 15 Gy and this suggests that the signal can be bleached by sunlight but may not be totally zeroed. The sensitivity-corrected ReOSL from the older samples did not reach zero and gave doses of 14 and 52 Gy, respectively, after 7 days bleaching with a solar simulator. A single aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) protocol using ReOSL was proposed and tested. In this protocol, a blue light stimulation at 280 degrees C for 100 s {{at the end of each}} cycle resulted in the recovery of identical sensitivity-corrected ReOSL values, in spite of similar to 20 - 30 % loss in sensitivity for the four samples that were tested. Two dose response curves were constructed using the sensitivity-corrected ReOSL, one for the initial 2 s signal and the other for the fast component obtained by curve fitting. Using the additional high temperature bleach and the separated fast component of the ReOSL, it was possible to recover given doses within 10 %, up to similar to 1000 Gy for the loess and similar to 2000 Gy for the coarse grained quartz. However, the natural dose obtained for the older sand was twice that obtained using the conventional SAR OSL method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

A previously published kinetic {{model for the}} production of luminescence signals in quartz is used to investigate the production of <b>thermally</b> transferred optically <b>stimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> (TT-OSL) signals. This paper provides a mathematical description of the {{thermal transfer}} mechanism for two different phenomena that have been observed in previously published experiments (Aitken and Smith 1988 Quat.

The numerical values of some of the parameters are varied so that they match the experimental data. The effect caused by varying these values is investigated. The first of these phenomena takes place after storing optically bleached samples at room temperature; this involves the traps responsible for the 110 ?C thermoluminescence (TL) peak of quartz acting as a refuge trap. The second phenomenon concerns OSL signals that are induced by heating the samples after the bleaching of the OSL signal and involves a putative TL peak at ~ 230 ?C associated with the refuge trap; specifically, the paper presents a simulation of the temperature dependence of the OSL signal measured by successively heating the quartz samples to higher temperatures up to ~ 400 ?C.

However, the natural and laboratory TT-OSL DRCs deviate from one another at circa 150 Gy resulting in TT-OSL equivalent dose underestimation relative to palaeodoses expected from dose rates and independent age control. The lifetime of the TT-OSL signal at 10 ?C, calculated from values of trap parameters E and s, is compared against the value for lifetime of the TT-OSL signal in nature at average burial temperature as determined from the age underestimation caused by deviation of the natural and laboratory generated DRCs.

Post-infrared-infrared <b>stimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> (pIR-IR) dating of K-feldspars and <b>thermally</b> transferred optically <b>stimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> (TT-OSL) dating of individual quartz grains provide weighted mean ages of 433 � 15 ka (thousands of years) and 416 � 19 ka, respectively, for allochthonous sedimentary horizons overlying the hominin-bearing clay breccia. The six replicate luminescence ages obtained for this deposit are reproducible and provide a combined minimum age estimate of 427 � 12 ka for the underlying hominin fossils. Palaeomagnetic directions for the luminescence dated sediment horizon and underlying fossiliferous clays display exclusively normal polarities. These findings are consistent with the luminescence dating results and confirm that the hominin fossil horizon accumulated during the Brunhes Chron, i. e., within the last 780 ka. The new bracketing age constraint for the Sima hominins is in broad agreement with radiometrically dated Homo heidelbergensis fossil sites, such as Mauer and Arago, and suggests that the split of the H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens lineages took place during the early Middle Pleistocene.

Two possible mechanisms for the production of the TT-OSL signals in this quartz are discussed, namely the double transfer mechanism suggested for the recuperation effect, and a single transfer mechanism in which the TT-OSL signal is due to the thermal transfer of charge from a ?source trap? into the fast OSL trap of quartz. The results of the simulation indicate that the latter mechanism is more likely to be responsible for the observed TT-OSL dose growth in fine-grained quartz extracted from Chinese loess.

When using a single-aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) protocol for luminescence dating of sedimentary quartz grains, the fundamental assumption is that {{the sensitivity of the}} optically <b>stimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> (OSL) produced by the regenerative doses can be monitored by their following test dose OSL response. Using well-bleached coarse quartz grains, OSL {{production in}} a SAR protocol was studied in detail when dose response curves were constructed using both single and multiple aliquot regenerative dose procedures. During application of the SAR protocol, two preheats are applied, each ahead of an OSL measurement that is produced by the regenerative dose and test dose, respectively. It is shown that sensitivity changes caused by heating were well corrected for using the OSL response to the test dose. However, these preheats are shown to result in <b>thermally</b> <b>stimulated</b> OSL signals that contribute both to the OSL response from the regenerative doses used to construct the dose response curve and to the OSL response from the test dose used to monitor OSL sensitivity changes as the quartz grains are repeatedly measured. A simple test is proposed to identify the contribution of the latter signal. Peer reviewe...|$|R
