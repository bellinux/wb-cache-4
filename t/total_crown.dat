50|$|Due to {{the number}} of {{conflicts}} Britain was involved with globally at the time the American Revolution broke out, King George found himself in need of more troops to quell the rebellion. As was the custom of the time period, he signed a treaty with several German Principalities to essentially lease their armies for the duration. These troops, from several German states were commonly referred to as Hessians, because the largest block of troops came from the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. The total number of German troops committed to the conflict eventually reach about 33,000- almost a full third of the <b>total</b> <b>Crown</b> forces. The Hesse Cassel army was based on the Prussian army of the time and was among the most professional in Europe. The 8th infantry regiment came to the American shores as the Regiment von Trümbach and changed names a couple years later when Carl von Bose became the regiment's Chef, or commander. Von Trümbach/Bose participated in many of the major events of the war, including the actions in New York, Stono Ferry, Eutaw Spirings, Savannah, Charleston, Guilford Courthouse and Yorktown. At Guilford Courthouse the regiment received special note for its bravery as they fought back-to-back to battle foes on both sides. The main body of the regiment surrendered with Cornwallis's army at Yorktown. The Grenadier company remained in New York and returned to Hesse Cassel from there. Regiment von Bose was raised as the Regiment von Shöepping and served with distinction in the Seven Years' War as the Regiment von Mansbach. The red neck stocks worn by the regiment signify it is a veteran regiment.|$|E

30|$|Methods 9 – 11 (stratified, unequal) {{are based}} on the idea that the {{distribution}} of crown biomass in different strata depends on the relative position of the branches in the tree. Ishii and McDowell (2001) found that mean branch volume increased from upper- to lower-crown. For a given density, biomass (oven dry weight) is the function of volume. Therefore, the stratified sampling method was modified to incorporate the variability of biomass distribution within a tree. Trees were first divided into three sections having equal number of branches. Then, 4, 3, and 2 branches from the lower, middle, and upper section of the trees were selected respectively. This corresponds that the number of branches selected in each section is proportional to the observed biomass in that section of the tree. Because stratification based on crown length resulted in the biased estimation of crown biomass, the balanced stratification method was applied. The total number of branches selected in each tree (nine) was determined based on the amount of biomass sampled. <b>Total</b> <b>crown</b> biomass in each stratum was computed using the SRS estimation technique in method 9 (Un-STR), PPS in method 10 (Un-PPS), and ratio estimation in method 11 (Un-STRRAT). <b>Total</b> <b>crown</b> biomass in each tree was computed by summing the crown biomass in each stratum.

For this article, literature was analyzed to find information on the agents which trigger dental erosion, the main diagnosis methods, the most common treatments used nowadays and the interrelationship with dental materials. The etiology of dental erosion is multifactorial, including acids, eating disorders and gastro-esophageal reflux. However, biological factors such as saliva or habits also play a part in the establishment of this condition. In order to establish a reliable diagnosis, clinical appearance becomes decisive. The Basic Index Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE), created in 2008, is an auxiliary diagnosis tool for assessing the status and progress of the erosion. Treatment should be linked to the eradication of the causative agent and it can range from simple observational monitoring of slightly affected teeth to the placement of <b>total</b> <b>crowns</b> in the most severe cases, but this will depend entirely on the extent, severity, symptoms and type of dentition. Regarding dental materials used in the treatment of eroded parts, there are glass ionomer and composite; the latter presents the greatest resistance to biodegradation when interacting with acids.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the threeyear clinical results of the installation of 463 zirconia core crowns by a general dental private practice. METHODS: This study followed 142 patients (69 men and 73 women; aged 28 - 82 years) who had received 248 single crowns (202 tooth-supported, 36 implant-supported) and 225 multiple units of up to six elements (81 toothsupported, 144 implant-supported). Clinical events, including fracture and loss of retention, secondary caries, and marginal integrity, were recorded. The overall failure rate was computed for the fractured and lost prostheses. Aesthetic, functional, and biological properties were rated, and patient satisfaction was investigated. RESULTS: During the three-year follow-up period, four patients were lost from the study (18 crowns, 4 % of the <b>total</b> <b>crowns).</b> Three of the zirconia prostheses suffered fractures in more than three units (11 crowns; one- vs. three-year follow-up, p, 0. 05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and the cumulative prosthesis survival rate was 98. 2 %. Twelve units lost retention and were re-cemented, and no secondary caries of the abutment teeth were reported. The aesthetic, functional, and biological properties were generally well-rated, and there were no differences between tooth- and implant-supported crowns.

Each specimen was composed by 3 <b>total</b> <b>crowns</b> at its mesial portion, each one attached to an implant component (abutment), while the distal portion (cantilever) had two crowns. Each specimen was constructed by injecting acrylic resin into a two-part silicone matrix placed on a metallic base. In each specimen, the crowns were fabricated with either acrylic resin (control group) or acrylic resin reinforced by glass (Fibrante, Angelus) or polyaramide (Kevlar 49, Du Pont) fibers. Compression load was applied on the cantilever, in a point located 7, 14 or 21 mm from the distal surface of the nearest crown with abutment, to simulate different extensions. The specimen was fixed on the metallic base and the force was applied until fracture in a universal test machine. Each one of the 9 sub-groups was composed by 10 specimens. Flexural strength means (in kgf) for the distances of 7, 14 and 21 mm were, respectively, 28. 07, 8. 27 and 6. 39 for control group, 31. 89, 9. 18 and 5. 16 for Kevlar 49 and 30. 90, 9. 31 and 6. 86 for Fibrante. Data analysis ANOVA showed statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) only regarding cantilever extension. Tukey's test detected significantly higher flexural strength for the 7 mm-distance, followed by 14 and 21 mm. Fracture was complete only on specimens of non-reinforced groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{evaluate}} the fracture load of composite-based repairs to fractured zirconium oxide (Z) crowns and to ceramic-fused-to-metal (CM) crowns, comparing different mechanical surface preparation methods. A <b>total</b> of 75 <b>crowns</b> were repaired; samples then underwent dynamic loading and thermocycling. Final fracture load values for failure of the repaired crowns were measured and the type of fracture registered. Group I: CM: Surface preparation with a diamond bur + 9. 5...|$|R
