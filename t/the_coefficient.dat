Common examples include cross-country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snow shoeing, and snowmobiling. The design of the equipment used, typically relies on the bearing strength of snow, as with skis or snowboards and contends with <b>the</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction of snow to allow sliding, often enhance by ski waxes.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along {{the three major}} crystallographical axes a, b, and c (see table), producing {{a significant difference between}} the linear (α) and volume thermal expansion coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, <b>the</b> <b>coefficient</b> of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting.|$|E

5|$|How much {{braking force}} {{to apply to}} each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times <b>the</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a rear wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if <b>the</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{used this}} {{equation}} {{to calculate the}} amount of lift that a wing would produce. Over the years {{a wide variety of}} values had been measured for the Smeaton coefficient; Chanute identified up to 50 of them. Wilbur knew that Langley, for example, had used a lower number than the traditional one. Intent on confirming the correct Smeaton value, Wilbur performed his own calculations using measurements collected during kite and free flights of the 1901 glider. His results correctly showed that <b>the</b> <b>coefficient</b> was very close to 0.0033 (similar to the number Langley used), not the traditional 0.0054, which would significantly exaggerate predicted lift.|$|E

The decision to axe the line was made on 1 November 1908. Two strategic errors had been made: wanting a service independent of the CTR's network, and putting its terminus out of town. The railway was officially disbanded by a decree of 14 September 1911, the rails were lifted, the public highway restored; {{no trace of the}} tramway remains.|$|E
