More than half the people surveyed during a 2005–2006 poll declared themselves satisfied (62.3%) or very satisfied (3.3%) with the activity of the county police department. The study found the highest satisfaction with car traffic supervision, the presence of officers in the street, and road education; on <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side,</b> corruption and public transport safety remain concerns.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{say that}} if the {{government}} goes for the top of this range inflation could rise up to 40% through the economy. The International Monetary Fund, however, has predicted a more moderate rise in inflation of just 32 percent. As of January 2010, the official inflation rate stands at 15 percent. The cost of living in Iran, according to the Majlis Research Center, could rise by up to 60 percent. Ahmadinejad's administration contends that <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side</b> effects will be transient and that the projections are based on out-of-date models.|$|E
5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side,</b> democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side,</b> Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E
25|$|The general {{prognosis}} for PNP is poor. It is more hopeful if the tumor is benign, {{but in the}} case of malignant tumors, the mortality rate is roughly 90%. The two most commonly associated types of tumors are non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma; nearly all of these patients die within two years of diagnosis. This is attributed to the effects of the tumor combined with <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side</b> effects of the medication administered to treat PNP.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparator}} circuit compares two voltages and outputs either a 1 (the voltage at the plus side; VDD in the illustration) or a 0 (the voltage at <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side)</b> to indicate which is larger. Comparators are often used, for example, to check whether an input has reached some predetermined value. In most cases a comparator is implemented using a dedicated comparator IC, but op-amps {{may be used}} as an alternative. Comparator diagrams and op-amp diagrams use the same symbols.|$|E
50|$|The Crown is a {{particularly}} interesting addition to the Dalemark series, {{as many of the}} characters from previous books are seen from quite different perspectives, not necessarily favourable.

25|$|Figure 4 shows a {{comparator}} circuit. Note {{first that}} the circuit {{does not use}} feedback. The circuit amplifies the voltage difference between Vin and VREF, and outputs the result at Vout. If Vin is greater than VREF, then voltage at Vout will rise to its positive saturation level; that is, to the voltage at the positive side. If Vin is lower than VREF, then Vout, will fall to its negative saturation level, equal to the voltage at <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Arjun {{features}} a hydro-pneumatic suspension. This {{coupled with the}} Arjun's stabilisation and fire control system allows the tank excellent first-hit probability against moving targets while on the move. Its ride comfort is highly praised. Though on <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side,</b> it is a more maintenance-intensive and expensive system, even if more capable than the simpler and cheaper torsion bar system utilised on many older tanks worldwide. During trials, the Arjun showcased its fording capability, by driving under 1.8 metres of water for 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Taylor, {{representing}} {{the field of}} Humanistic Psychology, presented a balanced review of Transpersonal psychology in the early nineties. On <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side</b> he mentioned Transpersonal Psychology's tendency toward being philosophically naive, poorly financed, almost anti-intellectual, and somewhat overrated as far as its influences. On the positive side he noted the fields integrated approach to understanding the phenomenology of scientific method; the centrality of qualitative research; {{and the importance of}} interdisciplinary communication. In conclusion he suggested that the virtues of Transpersonal psychology may, in the end, outweigh its defects. In a later article Taylor regarded Transpersonal psychology as a visionary American folk-psychology with little historical relation to American academic psychology, except through its association with Humanistic psychology and the categories of transcendence and consciousness.|$|E

The more than 150 scientists at the Stein Institute are investigating predictors and associations of successful cognitive and emotional aging. Understanding these processes requires contributions from basic sciences like neurobiology and genetics, along with the input from clinical medicine and social sciences, such as medical anthropology.|$|R
25|$|On <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side,</b> {{studies show}} that some former {{military}} brats struggle to develop and maintain deep, lasting relationships, and can feel like outsiders to U.S. civilian culture. The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships with people and developing emotional attachments to specific places, as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to a war zone and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents. In some cases {{there is also the}} loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability. A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed). A significant minority of ex-military brats may exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, etc.|$|E
25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side,</b> this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E
25|$|After fermentation, the must is {{normally}} high in malic acid and producers {{will put the}} wine through malolactic fermentation to soften the wine. The process of chaptalization, adding sugar to the grape must to boost alcohol levels, has been a controversial issue for Beaujolais winemakers. Historically, Beaujolais producers would pick grapes at ripeness that were at minimum potential alcohol levels of 10-10.5% and then add sugar in order to artificially boost the alcohol levels to the near the maximum of 13-13.5%. This created wines lacking structure and balance {{to go with the}} high alcohol body and mouthfeel. The recent trend towards higher quality wine production has limited the use of chaptalization in the premium levels of Beaujolais wine. Filtering the wine in order to stabilize it is practiced to varying degrees by Beaujolais winemakers. Some producers who make Beaujolais on a large commercial scale will filter the wine aggressively to avoid any impurity or future chemical reactions. This can have <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>side</b> effect of diminishing some of the wine's unique fruit character and leave a flavor that critics have described as Jell-O-like.|$|E
