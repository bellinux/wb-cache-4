5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the <b>Tevatron</b> and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tevatron</b> ceased {{operations}} on 30 September 2011. By {{the end of}} 2011, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN had achieved a luminosity almost ten times higher than Tevatron's (at 3.65cm−2 s−1) and a beam energy of 3.5TeV each (doing so since March 18, 2010), already ~3.6 times {{the capabilities of the}} <b>Tevatron</b> (at 0.98TeV).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tevatron</b> was a {{circular}} particle accelerator (now inactive, since 2011) in the United States, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), {{just east of}} Batavia, Illinois, and holds {{the title of the}} second highest energy particle collider in the world, after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland. The <b>Tevatron</b> was a synchrotron that accelerated protons and antiprotons in a 6.86km, or 4.26mi, ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The <b>Tevatron</b> was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million and significant upgrade investments were made in 1983–2011.|$|E
25|$|In December 2016, ATLAS {{presented}} a {{measurement of the}} W boson mass, researching the precision of analyses done at the <b>Tevatron.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tevatron</b> can {{accelerate}} the particles from the Main Injector up to 980 GeV. The protons and antiprotons are accelerated in opposite directions, crossing paths in the CDF and DØ detectors to collide at 1.96 TeV. To hold the particles on track the <b>Tevatron</b> uses 774 niobium-titanium superconducting dipole magnets cooled in liquid helium producing 4.2 teslas. The field ramps over about 20 seconds as the particles are accelerated. Another 240 NbTi quadrupole magnets {{are used to}} focus the beam.|$|E
25|$|The initial design {{luminosity}} of the <b>Tevatron</b> was 1030 cm−2 s−1, {{however the}} accelerator has following upgrades {{been able to}} deliver luminosities up to 4cm−2 s−1.|$|E
25|$|File:Fermilab.jpg|Fermilab's {{accelerator}} rings. The main injector (circumference 3319.4m) {{is in the}} foreground, and {{the main}} ring and <b>Tevatron</b> (circumference 6283.2m, inactive since 2011) are in the background.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} is {{production}} of a top–antitop pair via strong interactions. In a collision, a highly energetic gluon is created, which subsequently decays into a top and antitop. This process {{was responsible for the}} majority of the top events at <b>Tevatron</b> and was the process observed when the top was first discovered in 1995. It is also possible to produce pairs of top–antitop through the decay of an intermediate photon or Z-boson. However, these processes are predicted to be much rarer and have a virtually identical experimental signature in a hadron collider like <b>Tevatron.</b>|$|E
25|$|Its initial {{energy of}} 800GeV was {{achieved}} on February 16, 1984. On October 21, 1986 acceleration at the <b>Tevatron</b> was pushed to 900GeV, providing a first proton–antiproton collision at 1.8TeV on November 30, 1986.|$|E
25|$|These motivations {{come out}} without much effort {{and they are}} the primary reasons why the MSSM is the leading {{candidate}} for a new theory to be discovered at collider experiments such as the <b>Tevatron</b> or the LHC.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 2012, {{two days}} before a {{scheduled}} announcement at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), scientists at the <b>Tevatron</b> collider from the CDF and DØ collaborations announced their findings from the analysis of around 500 trillion collisions produced since 2001: They found {{that the existence of}} the Higgs boson was likely with a mass in the region of 115 to 135 GeV. The statistical significance of the observed signs was 2.9 sigma, which meant that there is only a 1-in-550 chance that a signal of that magnitude would have occurred if no particle in fact existed with those properties. The final analysis of data from the <b>Tevatron</b> did however not settle {{the question of whether the}} Higgs particle exists. Only when the scientists from the Large Hadron Collider announced the more precise LHC results on July 4, 2012, with a mass of 125.3 ± 0.4 GeV (CMS) or 126 ± 0.4 GeV (ATLAS) respectively, was there strong evidence through consistent measurements by the LHC and the <b>Tevatron</b> for the existence of a Higgs particle at that mass range.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} year before the {{completion}} of the Main Ring, Wilson testified to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on March 9, 1971 that it was feasible to achieve a higher energy by using superconducting magnets. He also suggested that it could be done by using the same tunnel as the main ring and the new magnets would be installed in the same locations to be operated in parallel to the existing magnets of the Main Ring. That was the starting point of the <b>Tevatron</b> project. The <b>Tevatron</b> was in research and development phase between 1973 and 1979 while the acceleration at the Main Ring continued to be enhanced.|$|E
25|$|The main {{achievement}} of the <b>Tevatron</b> was the discovery in 1995 of the top quark—the last fundamental fermion predicted by the standard model of particle physics. On July 2, 2012, scientists of the CDF and DØ collider experiment teams at Fermilab announced {{the findings from the}} analysis of around 500 trillion collisions produced from the <b>Tevatron</b> collider since 2001, and found that the existence of the suspected Higgs boson was highly likely with only a 1-in-550 chance that the signs were due to a statistical fluctuation. The findings were confirmed two days later as being correct with a likelihood of error less than 1 in a million by data from the LHC experiments.|$|E
25|$|Higgs Strahlung. If an {{elementary}} fermion collides with an anti-fermion—e.g., a quark with an anti-quark or an electron with a positron—the two can merge {{to form a}} virtual W or Z boson which, if it carries sufficient energy, can then emit a Higgs boson. This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson, {{and it was the}} second largest contribution for Higgs production at the <b>Tevatron.</b> At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the <b>Tevatron.</b> Higgs Strahlung is also known as associated production.|$|E
25|$|The first physics {{results from}} the LHC, {{involving}} 284 collisions {{which took place in}} the ALICE detector, were reported on 15 December 2009. The results of the first proton–proton collisions at energies higher than Fermilab's <b>Tevatron</b> proton–antiproton collisions were published by the CMS collaboration in early February 2010, yielding greater-than-predicted charged-hadron production.|$|E
25|$|The Main Injector, which {{replaced}} the Main Ring, {{was the most}} substantial addition, built over six years from 1993 {{at a cost of}} $290 million. <b>Tevatron</b> collider Run II begun on March 1, 2001 after successful completion of that facility upgrade. From then, the beam had been capable of delivering an energy of 980GeV.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} magnet Main Ring {{was shut}} down in 1981 for installation of superconducting magnets underneath it. The Main Ring continued {{to serve as an}} injector for the <b>Tevatron</b> until the Main Injector was completed west of the Main Ring in 2000. The 'Energy Doubler', as it was known then, produced its first accelerated beam—512 GeV—on July 3, 1983.|$|E
25|$|The National Accelerator Laboratory, {{was renamed}} the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in 1974, was {{established}} in Batavia, Illinois in 1967. Like Brookhaven, it was run by a consortium of universities. Robert R. Wilson was appointed its first director, with Livingston as his associate director They initiated the design of what became the <b>Tevatron,</b> a 1 TeV particle accelerator.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 2004 the <b>Tevatron</b> {{achieved}} a new peak luminosity, breaking the record previously {{held by the}} old European Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) at CERN. That very Fermilab record was doubled on September 9, 2006, then {{a bit more than}} tripled on March 17, 2008 and ultimately multiplied by a factor of 4 over the previous 2004 record on April 16, 2010 (up to 4cm−2 s−1).|$|E
25|$|After Wilson {{stepped down}} in 1978 {{to protest the}} lack of funding for the lab, Leon M. Lederman took on the job. It was under his {{guidance}} that the original accelerator was replaced with the <b>Tevatron,</b> an accelerator capable of colliding protons and antiprotons at a combined energy of 1.96 TeV. Lederman stepped down in 1989 and remains Director Emeritus. The science education center at the site was named in his honor.|$|E
25|$|On September 27, 1993 the {{cryogenic}} cooling {{system of the}} <b>Tevatron</b> Accelerator was named an International Historic Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The system, which provides cryogenic liquid helium to the Tevatron's superconducting magnets, was the largest low-temperature system in existence upon its completion in 1978. It keeps the coils of the magnets, which bend and focus the particle beam, in a superconducting state so that they consume only ⅓ of the power they would require at normal temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Because top quarks {{are very}} massive, {{large amounts of}} energy are needed to create one. The only way to achieve such high {{energies}} is through high energy collisions. These occur naturally in the Earth's upper atmosphere as cosmic rays collide with particles in the air, or can be created in a particle accelerator. In 2011, after the <b>Tevatron</b> ceased operations, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN became the only accelerator that generates a beam of sufficient energy to produce top quarks, with a center-of-mass energy of 7TeV. There are multiple processes {{that can lead to}} the production of top quarks, but they can be conceptually divided in two categories.|$|E
25|$|Earthquakes, even if {{they were}} {{thousands}} of miles away, did cause strong enough movements in the magnets to negatively affect the beam quality and even disrupt it. Therefore, tiltmeters were installed on Tevatron's magnets to monitor minute movements and to help identify the cause of problems quickly. The first known earthquake to disrupt the beam was the 2002 Denali earthquake, with another collider shutdown caused by a moderate local quake on June 28, 2004. Since then, the minute seismic vibrations emanating from over 20 earthquakes were detected at the <b>Tevatron</b> without a shutdown, like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, New Zealand's 2007 Gisborne earthquake, the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2010 Chile earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Gluon fusion. If the {{collided}} {{particles are}} hadrons {{such as the}} proton or antiproton—as {{is the case in}} the LHC and Tevatron—then it is most likely that two of the gluons binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of virtual quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual top and bottom quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and <b>Tevatron</b> being about ten times more likely {{than any of the other}} processes.|$|E
25|$|Within physics, the Department of Theoretical Physics {{was set up}} by Bhabha, who {{conducted}} research in high energy physics and Condensed Matter Physics. The department worked on the major advances in this period such as gauge theories, string theory, renormalisation and superconductivity. The Department of Astrophysics works in areas like stellar binaries, gravitational waves and cosmology. TIFR is involved in building India's first gravity wave detector. The High Energy Physics Department, TIFR has been involved in major accelerator projects like the KEK, <b>Tevatron,</b> LEP and the LHC. TIFR also runs the Pelletron particle accelerator facility. Bhabha's motivation resulted in the development of an NMR spectrometer for solid state studies. The Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Material Sciences also conducts experimental research in high-temperature superconductivity, nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.|$|E
500|$|Thanks to Wilson's talented leadership, a {{management}} style very much adopted from Lawrence, the facility was completed {{on time and}} under budget. According to Wilson, he gave Atomic Energy Commission chairman Glenn T. Seaborg his assurance [...] "signed in blood" [...] {{that he would not}} exceed the authorized $250 million budget and [...] "would rot in Hell" [...] if he did. The facility centered on a four-mile circumference, 400 GeV accelerator. Wilson subsequently initiated the design of the <b>Tevatron,</b> a 1 TeV [...] particle accelerator.

2500|$|The <b>Tevatron</b> ceased {{operations}} on 30 September 2011, due to budget cuts {{and because of}} the completion of the LHC, [...] which began operations in early 2010 and is far more powerful (planned energies were two 7 TeV beams at the LHC compared to 1 TeV at the <b>Tevatron).</b> The main ring of the <b>Tevatron</b> will probably be reused in future experiments, and its components may be transferred to other particle accelerators.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the final}} <b>Tevatron</b> energy of 1.96TeV, top–antitop pairs were {{produced}} with {{a cross section}} of about 7picobarns (pb). The Standard Model prediction (at next-to-leading order with [...] ) is 6.7–7.5pb.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Tevatron</b> and LHC have active {{experimental}} programs {{searching for}} supersymmetric particles.

[...] Since the MSSM has R-parity, the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and after the squarks and gluinos decay each decay chain will contain one LSP that will leave the detector unseen. This leads to the generic prediction that the MSSM will produce a 'missing energy' signal from these particles leaving the detector.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Tevatron</b> {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} several subatomic particles that were predicted by theoretical particle physics, or gave suggestions to their existence. In 1995, the CDF experiment and DØ experiment collaborations announced {{the discovery of the}} top quark, and by 2007 they measured its mass (172 GeV) to a precision of nearly 1%.|$|E
2500|$|The search {{continued}} at Fermilab in the United States, where the Tevatron—the collider that discovered the top quark in 1995—had been upgraded for this purpose.
