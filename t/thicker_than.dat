5|$|Silicon nitride {{deposited}} by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile stress, {{which may}} crack films <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> 200nm. However, it has higher resistivity and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (1016 Ω·cm and 10MV/cm, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Because the Von der Tann was {{designed}} {{to fight in the}} battle line, her armor was much <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> that of the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann weighed over 2,000tonnes more than the , and used 10% more of her weight for armor than the battlecruisers she faced at the Battle of Jutland.|$|E

5|$|Cairanoolithus dughii is {{the type}} oospecies. At , its eggshell is {{slightly}} <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> that of C. roussetensis. It has slender, partially fused columnar eggshell units. Their outer surface is almost without ornamentation, and the inner surface is covered with hollows once filled by organic cores. C. dughiis eggshell exhibits an angusticanaliculate pore system, i.e. its pores are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{is composed of}} 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere is relatively small compared {{to the amount of}} carbon dioxide, but because the atmosphere is so much <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Calico (in British usage since 1505) is a {{plain-woven}} textile {{made from}} unbleached and often not fully processed cotton. It may contain unseparated husk parts, for example. The fabric {{is far less}} fine than muslin, but less coarse and <b>thick</b> <b>than</b> canvas or denim, {{but it is still}} very cheap owing to its unfinished and undyed appearance.|$|R

5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E

5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
5|$|In {{the upper}} incisors, the chewing edges are located behind the {{vertical}} {{plane of the}} incisors; thus, they are opisthodont. The microstructure of the enamel of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of Hunter-Schreger bands, which are uniserial (consisting of a single enamel prism), as in all myomorph rodents. The PE consists of radial enamel, with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the dentine. The microstructure {{is similar to that}} of Holochilus brasiliensis and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha.|$|E
5|$|The fur, {{which is}} soft, dense, and thick, is dark brown to gray on the upperparts, grading to black on the midback and {{yellowish}} brown on the sides. The underparts are sharply different in color. There, the hairs are dark gray at their bases and white at the tips, {{so that the}} fur appears grayish white. The fur is shorter and darker than in T.talamancae and softer and <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> in H.alfaroi. Young animals have darker, finer, and softer fur. Pine separated the subspecies alleni and orinus {{on the basis of}} their darker fur, but Musser and colleagues could not confirm this pattern and found paler and darker specimens within the same geographical regions.|$|E
50|$|Ventricles have <b>thicker</b> walls <b>than</b> atria and {{generate}} higher blood pressures. The physiological {{load on the}} ventricles requiring pumping of blood throughout the body and lungs {{is much greater than}} the pressure generated by the atria to fill the ventricles. Further, the left ventricle has <b>thicker</b> walls <b>than</b> the right because it needs to pump blood to most of the body while the right ventricle fills only the lungs.|$|R

5|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers: the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin and waxy water {{resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and a lower layer called the procuticle. The procuticle is chitinous and much <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E
5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few hundred}} feet. Because the ice over the valleys would be <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> the ice over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys. The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{skeletal}} features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from pigeons {{have been attributed}} to their flightlessness. The pelvic elements were <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic, meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, meaning that they changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded skull roof, and smaller orbits. The dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire's wrists.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} shared traits {{with the}} dodo, its closest relative, such as size and {{features in the}} skull, pelvis and sternum. It differed in other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof and larger orbits. Its neck and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their pelvic elements were <b>thicker</b> <b>than</b> those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). However, the skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity.|$|E
