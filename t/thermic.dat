5|$|The design {{incorporated}} many novel features, {{such as the}} use of <b>thermic</b> siphons, bogies and cabs at {{each end}} of the locomotive, resulting in its unique—for a steam locomotive—modern diesel-like appearance. Several of its innovations proved to be unsuccessful however, partly accounting for the project's cancellation in the early 1950s. Five Leader locomotives were begun, although only one was completed. The operational locomotive was trialled on the former Southern Railway network around Brighton. Problems with the design, indifferent reports on performance and political pressure surrounding spiralling development costs, led to all locomotives of the class being scrapped by 1951.|$|E

5000|$|The Cinebulle {{is a hot}} air balloon, {{which implies}} a number of prerequisites: it cannot fly if the wind is too strong and flights require air {{stability}} and no <b>thermics,</b> i.e. in mornings or evenings, which {{has the advantage of}} being the times when light is most suitable for filming.|$|R
30|$|To {{study the}} effect of the {{different}} couplings on the thermal state, simulations have been carried out after canceling them. Figure 10 shows the temperature–depth profiles and the associated maps of temperatures for these simulations. We can observe that the cancellation of the dependence of the <b>thermics</b> on the mechanical and hydraulic processes (HM) or of the hydraulics on the mechanics and <b>thermics</b> (TM) leads both to a large-scale diffusive case. The deactivation of the mechanical effect on the thermal and hydraulic processes (TH) highlights a convection system, but different from the full THM model. It includes only two convective cells larger than the ones from the THM model and the reservoir temperature is slightly higher than in the previous model. To conclude, cancelling the mechanical or hydraulic parts of the THM model does have a clear impact on the thermal regime and the hydrothermal circulation.|$|R
25|$|This rule is {{also well}} known as the Arrhenius rule. It characterizes the change of <b>thermic</b> {{reaction}} speed. For every 10°C lower temperature, evaporation halves. That means for every 10°C lower temperature the lifetime of capacitors doubles.|$|E
25|$|The boilers were {{modified}} to {{a design that}} incorporated a combustion chamber, arch tubes and <b>thermic</b> siphons. However, unlike its close relative the X class Mikado, the Sclass was not modified with Belpaire fireboxes and retained its round-top boiler shape.|$|E

25|$|This rule is {{also known}} as Arrhenius rule. It characterizes the change of <b>thermic</b> {{reaction}} speed. For every 10°C lower temperature the evaporation is reduced by half. That means for every 10°C lower temperature the lifetime of capacitors doubles. If a lifetime specification of an electrolytic capacitor is, for example, 2000 h/105°C, the capacitor's lifetime at 45°C can be ”calculated” as 128,000 hours—that is roughly 15 years—by using the 10-degrees-rule.|$|E

25|$|The {{leakage current}} {{includes}} all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes and mechanical damage {{and is the}} DC current that can pass through the dielectric after applying a voltage in correct polarity. It depends on the capacitance value, on applied voltage and temperature of the capacitor, on measuring time, {{on the kind of}} electrolyte, and on preconditions like previous storage time without voltage applied or <b>thermic</b> stress from soldering. (All non-solid electrolytic capacitors needs a recovery time of some hours after soldering before measuring the leakage current. Non-solid chip capacitors need a recovery time after reflow soldering of about 24 hours.) Leakage current is reduced by applying operational voltage by self-healing processes.|$|E
25|$|Gürsel, 40 {{years after}} the {{foundation}} of the Republic, launched the first radio broadcasting station of Eastern Anatolia within the centrally located province of Erzurum, where Ankara and Istanbul radios’ transmissions were not received. He brought the Microwave Telecommunications Network into operation increasing telephone and teletype capacity along with a High-Frequency Radio Link connecting London and Ankara with Rawalpindi, Karachi, Tehran and Istanbul. He laid the foundations of the new agricultural and structural development plans for the south-eastern Anatolian regions in early 1960s for the first time. With his directive, The Holy Relics from the Prophets Abraham, Moses, Joseph, David and Muhammad, including the oldest Qur'an in existence from the 7th Century were put on display from their storage rooms within the Topkapi Palace for public viewing {{for the first time on}} 31 August 1962. Gürsel added the first Ministry of Culture and Tourism to the cabinet. In a parallel effort of promoting the country's touristic popularity in the West, Topkapi), the movie version of the book by Eric Ambler that had been commissioned for the same purpose, was shot in Paris and Istanbul and was introduced with success. Similarly, one of the favorite books of John F. Kennedy, Ian Fleming's From Russia with Love was shot in Istanbul as the second James Bond movie, to promote the touristic popularity of Turkey, with his keen interest. The Directorate of Religious Affairs network of the country was founded with his directive and became operational on 22 June 1965. He started the new procedure of returning the law proposals presented for the President's approval back to the Parliamentary re-discussions in 1963. Cemal Gürsel founded The National Security Council (MGK) as well as the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) in 1963, appointing Professor Cahit Arf as its first director, officially charging TUBITAK primarily with governmental advisory duty by legislation. In addition to {{the foundation of the}} Turkish Radio and Television (TRT) organization as a government agency in 1964 that brought television broadcasting to Turkey for the first time under his administration, the opening of The School of Press and Broadcasting at the College of Political Sciences in Ankara followed in November 1965. The country's new initiative of Planning of Population Growth Control was put in effect in 1965. The production of the first domestic Turkish automobile, the Devrim (Revolution), took place with Cemal Gürsel's directive which sparked the initiation of an automotive industry in the republic in the following few years. The first use of a computer in the country, iron and steel mass production growth, the <b>thermic</b> power plant and a petrol pipeline structuring took place during his presidency. Cemal Gürsel refused remuneration for his Head of State and subsequent Presidential positions and made his and his family's living with his retired general's salary, meeting their own expenses during their life in the Presidential Palace in Çankaya, Ankara.|$|E

40|$|A thermal {{differential}} {{operational amplifier}} was developed through an experimentally verified analysis of design parameters. In general, an operational amplifier (or Op-Amp) is a device which ampli-fies a signal by a constant factor, called the amplifier's gain.

Conceived as the building block for linear thermal logic, or <b>thermics,</b> the amplifier is an active control element operating totally in the thermal-energy domain, using temperatures for input and output, and heat for power.

30|$|Several {{models have}} been {{developed}} in literature to reproduce field measurements or to predict the value of physical properties in reservoirs. The most simplified approaches are unidimensional. They couple hydraulic with <b>thermics</b> as in (Pasquale et al. [2011 b]), but more complex geometries have been considered in two dimensions as in ([Guillou-Frottier et al. 2013]; [Kohl et al. 2000]; [Cerminara and Fasano 2012]; [Magri et al. 2010]) or in three dimensions ([Bächler et al. 2003]; [Kohl and Mégel 2007]). Most of these models aim at reproducing or predicting the temperature profile measured in wells and/or hydraulic data obtained during injection and production phases (water flow, water pressure and temperature vs. time). Some numerical models have also been developed to account for mechanical, thermal and hydraulic couplings at the same time, with a simplified geometry of the fault network, see, e.g. [Kohl et al. (1995]) or [Gelet et al. (2012]). In addition, other thermodynamical aspects have been addressed like chemical couplings in [Bächler and Kohl (2005]).|$|R
500|$|The boiler was the {{culmination}} of lessons learned with the Pacifics and was a prolific steam-raiser. All Leader boilers were constructed at Eastleigh, and proved to be the least problematic area of the entire design. The boiler pressure was set at [...] and each was fitted with four <b>thermic</b> siphons within the firebox, both to increase the rate of evaporation and improve water circulation. These had been used previously to great effect on Bulleid's Merchant Navy and West Country and Battle of Britain class designs.|$|E
500|$|Incorporating {{a number}} of new {{developments}} in British steam locomotive technology, the design of the Merchant Navy class {{was among the first to}} use welding in the construction process; this enabled easier fabrication of components during the austerity of the war and post-war economies. In addition the locomotives featured <b>thermic</b> syphons in their boilers and the controversial Bulleid chain-driven valve gear.

500|$|The two {{air sports}} {{that are most}} closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are {{significant}} differences which are listed in detail in [...] The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however <b>thermic</b> aeromodelling craft are also used.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{improve the}} {{modeling}} of fiber reinforced composites, we present {{in this work}} numerical methods able to compute both fiber-reinforced composites deformation in squeeze flow and thermal-kinetic evolution. The rheology is given by an homogeneous orthotropic model for fiber composites which describes the anisotropy of the in-plane fiber. The <b>thermics</b> is then extended accounting for the reaction here formulated by the Bailleul's model. Both physics are related since the kinetic evolution {{as well as the}} temperature profile modify the rheology of the composites, giving raise to the thermo-rheological-kinetical coupling by means of the viscosity temperature dependence. A study case is presented, where the mold temperature is set to 150 • C with a composite sample at 40 • C. Thermal transfer begins as well as sample compression at constant speed. We present the evolution of the reaction, temperature and viscosity at the core and the surface. Reaction in the core of the material is much quicker than in the surface. Which means that a mapping of viscosity values is presented during the reaction modifying the mechanical response...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA fast {{numerical}} {{method is}} proposed to solve thermomechanical problems over periodic microstructures whose geometries {{are provided by}} experimental techniques, like X-ray micro tomography images. In such configuration, the phase properties are defined over regular grids of voxels. To overcome the limitations of calculations on such fine models, an iterative scheme is proposed, avoiding the construction and storage of finite element matrices. Equilibrium equations are written {{in the form of}} a Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation, which can be solved iteratively. Unlike previous algorithms based on the Fourier transform, the present scheme strictly operates in the real space domain and removes the numerical Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms at each iteration. For this purpose, the linear operator related to the Lippmann-Schwinger equation is constructed numerically by means of transformation tensors in the real space domain. The convergence and accuracy of the method are evaluated through examples in both steady-state <b>thermics</b> and linear elasticity problems. Computational times are found to scale linearly with the number of degrees of freedom and parallel computations can be carried out straightforwardly. The method is also illustrated on many examples involving complex microstructures, including a problem defined by a micro tomography image...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMaterials and {{structures}} exhibiting coupled behaviors between mechanics and other physics (especially magnetics, electrics and <b>thermics</b> – phase transformation –) and submitted to multiaxial stress are considered. The most practical applications concern sensors and actuators. The multiaxial stress is usually inherited from forming process or appears in use. In {{the area of}} coupling between mechanics and magnetics, one can mention: inertial stresses in high rotating speed systems or new technologies of flywheel, stresses due to binding process (encapsulation), residual stress associated to plastic straining (forming) or cutting process. On the other hand, since the works of Mateucci and Villari, mechanical stress is known to change significantly the magnetic behavior of materials {{as well as their}} magnetostrictive behavior. The design of electromagnetic systems consequently requires coupled models taking account of multiaxial stress. One way is to use energy-based models written at an appropriate scale. Indeed the development of fully multiaxial magneto-elastic models following micromagnetics is a promising issue, but still leads to dissuasive computation times for engineering design applications. The few available and practically implemented models describing the effect of stress on the magnetic behavior are restricted to uniaxial (tensile or compressive) stress. Jiles–Atherton type models [8 – 9] and Preisach type models are the most popular. Indeed the relevant way seems to implement multiaxial stress directly in a uniaxial model. This way supposes to define and calculate a “fictive” uniaxial stress, the equivalent stress that would change the magnetic behavior in a similar manner than the multiaxial one. Such equivalent stress has been proposed recently. It is based on equivalence in magnetization and uses an analytical discretization of bulk in so-called magnetic domains. The free energy of each domain is written allowing calculate their volume fraction thanks to a stochastic approach (calculation thanks to Boltzmann function). Macroscopic magnetization is the average magnetization over the volume. Since an equilibrium of phases is involved, the approach proposed for magneto-elastic coupling can be extended to ferroelectric media, and other couplings where a form of phase transformation occurs. Application to the modeling of thermo-mechanical behavior of shape memory alloys is finally made. The talk will be illustrated by experimental results carried out on magnetic materials and shape memory alloys submitted to uniaxial and multiaxial stresses...|$|R
500|$|The {{basic design}} of the [...] "Britannias" [...] owed much to LMS {{building}} practices, especially when considering Riddles' previous career with the said railway. [...] However, {{in keeping with the}} necessity to follow best practice in creating standardised steam locomotives, they utilised a variation of both boiler and trailing wheel of the Merchant Navy Class, while weight was kept within the margins laid down by the Light Pacifics, all of which were designed by Oliver Bulleid. [...] The firebox was also similar in having a rocking grate, which allowed the fire to be rebuilt without stopping the locomotive, removing both ash and clinker on the move; but unlike the SR Pacifics, the inner firebox was constructed of copper instead of steel, and lacked <b>thermic</b> syphons. A self-cleaning smokebox was used, which enabled ash to flow into the atmosphere, reducing the workload of the engine cleaner {{at the end of a}} working day.
