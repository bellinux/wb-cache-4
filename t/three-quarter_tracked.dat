50|$|In 1943 the Ministry of Supply asked Vauxhall Motors to {{construct}} a <b>three-quarter</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicle using a similar track and rear suspension system {{to that of the}} Sd.Kfz.7 medium artillery tractors. To this end a number of captured half-tracks were shipped back to Britain from Libya. Morris put them through a trials and evaluation programme with a view to developing a similar machine for British use. Six prototypes were built for trials in 1944 but the war in Europe ended before mass production could be considered.|$|E
50|$|Roper {{heard about}} the first race at a <b>three-quarter</b> mile dirt <b>track</b> in Charlotte, NC by reading a note about it in Zack Mosley's The Adventures of Smilin' Jack comic strip in his local newspaper. Roper {{convinced}} local car dealer Millard Clothier to drive two of Clothier's Lincoln cars more than 1000 miles to Charlotte to compete on June 19, 1949. Roper finished in second to winner Glenn Dunaway, completing 197 of 200 laps. Chief NASCAR inspector Al Crisler disqualified Dunnaway's car because car owner Hubert Westmoreland had shored up the chassis by spreading the rear springs, a favorite bootlegger trick to improve traction and handling http://www.dailypress.com/sports/motorracing/dp-68984sy0mar17,0,4238057.story?coll=dp-auto-utility. Roper was credited with the win in NASCAR's first Strictly Stock race. Westmoreland sued NASCAR, and the judge threw out the case. NASCAR tore down Roper's motor after the race, {{so he had to}} get a replacement motor to drive back to Kansas. Clothier kept the winner's trophy.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{race of the}} 1950 {{season was}} run on April 2 at Charlotte Speedway in Charlotte, North Carolina. Red Byron won the pole.Tim Flock, {{wheeling}} the same Lincoln that carried Harold Kite to victory at Daytona, drove around Red Byron in the 48th lap and stormed to victory in the 150-mile Grand National race at Charlotte Speedway. It was Flock's first win on the NASCAR major league tour. Bob Flock finished second, a half lap behind his younger brother. Clyde Minter wound up third, Byron came in fourth and Bill Snowden was fifth. Byron's fourth-place effort, coupled with his runner-up finish at Daytona, enabled him {{to move to the}} top of the Grand National point standings, 2.5 points ahead of Tim Flock. A crowd of 13,000 was on hand to watch Bob Flock lead the opening laps in his Oldsmobile. Pole sitter Byron then charged past and led for 42 laps on the <b>three-quarter</b> mile dirt <b>track.</b> Tim surged past Byron in the 48th lap and led the rest of the way. Lash LaRue, Western movie star, greeted Flock in victory lane. [...] "This is my biggest win," [...] said the happy Flock. [...] "To win a Grand National race is a dream come true." [...] June Cleveland was running in the top five when he flipped his Buick in the 85th lap. The roof was pancaked, and Cleveland was transported to a Charlotte hospital with cuts. He was reported not to be seriously injured. His crash occurred in the exact spot where Virginia driver Jesse Elmo [...] "Hank" [...] Stanley was killed a few weeks earlier in a Modified Sportsman race. Curtis Turner, Lee Petty, Buck Baker, Fonty Flock and Bill Blair—all rated as pre-race threats—failed to finish the 200-lap grind.|$|R
