5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism {{was very quiet}} after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside {{the members of this}} body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures, during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired {{the rights to the}} novel after three years of the project's stagnant development. Melissa Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to the novel's storyline. Principal photography took 44 days and completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In Sorceria, {{the party}} learns {{that this is}} Ashlynn's home. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is {{watching}} her and give her the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him. The party also learns {{that the only way}} to get to the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver's Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks 'Y-You. Y-You're m-m-me!', and says that he must prove himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver had done.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
5|$|Oh Aij Tjeng {{is a young}} ethnic Chinese man {{who runs}} a {{plantation}} in West Java. He lives there with his njai (concubine), a Sundanese woman named Marsiti. The two are deeply in love and promise <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> forever. However, not long afterwards Aij Tjeng's father Oh Pin Loh comes to tell Aij Tjeng {{that he has been}} betrothed to Gwat Nio, the daughter of the plantation's owner Liok Keng Djim. Marsiti is sent away by the elder Oh and, after Aij Tjeng orders his manservant Tirta to find her, Tirta disappears as well. After the marriage, Aij Tjeng finds in Gwat Nio all of the same traits which made him fall in love with Marsiti, but even more polished owing to her better education. He falls in love with her and begins to forget Marsiti, and the couple have a daughter, Lily.|$|E

25|$|Malachi also criticizes his {{audience}} for questioning God's justice. He reminds them that God is just, exhorting them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> as they await that justice. Malachi quickly {{goes on to}} point out that the people have not been faithful. In fact, the people are not giving God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so the people have been neglecting to offer their full tithe to Elohim. The result of these shortcomings is that the people come to believe that no good comes out of serving God.|$|E
25|$|Van Stipriaan further {{reports that}} other tales {{describe}} river travellers (usually men) chancing upon the spirit. She is inevitably grooming herself, combing her hair, and peering {{at herself in}} a mirror. Upon noticing the intruder, she flees {{into the water and}} leaves her possessions behind. The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her things. Should he agree, she further demands a promise from him to be sexually faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> brings the man ill fortune.|$|E

25|$|From 1952 until 1962 Dijkstra {{worked at}} the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam, where he worked closely with Bram Jan Loopstra and Carel S. Scholten, who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of {{interaction}} was disciplined: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} when Zhang Liang was born. He was from Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan), and {{it was said that}} his family was not of a noble lineage. Early in his life, Zhang was a farmer, but was said to have great expectations. He was also said to be {{appearing}} to be honest and meek outwardly, but instead was treacherous inside. At the end of the Sui dynasty, the rebel ruler Li Mi conquered Zhang's home region, and Zhang followed him. Initially, he was not regarded highly by Li Mi, but after he revealed a treasonous plot to Li Mi, Li Mi believed him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful,</b> and so made him a general and had him serve under the general Xu Shiji.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{judiciary}} {{has used its}} power to adjudge executive actions and Acts of Parliament unconstitutional and void rather sparingly. To date, the only instance where the High Court struck down a statutory provision was in Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998). It was short-lived, as the decision was later overturned by the Court of Appeal. Delivering the Court's judgment, Chief Justice Yong Pung How emphasized the limits of judicial review, stating {{that it is not}} for the courts to dictate the scope and ambit of a section or rule on its propriety. This is a matter which only Parliament can decide, and the courts can only interpret what is enacted. This results in a conflict between the court's responsibility <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to the Constitution, and its apparently restricted role in reviewing legislation.|$|E

25|$|So far as {{politics}} was concerned, Lilburne {{for the next}} two years remained quiet. He was elected on 21 December 1649 a common councilman for the city of London, but on the 26th his election was declared void by Parliament, although he had taken the required oath <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to the commonwealth. No disposition, however, was shown to persecute him. On 22 December 1648 he had obtained an ordinance granting him £3,000, in compensation for his sufferings, from the Star Chamber, the money being made payable from the forfeited estates of various Royalists in the county of Durham. As this source had proved insufficient, Lilburne, by the aid of Marten and Cromwell, obtained another ordinance (30 July 1650), charging the remainder of the sum on confiscated chapter-lands, and thus became owner of some of the lands of the Durham chapter.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} person, as if quoting himself, William speaks {{about how his}} {{disagreement}} with his king troubles him; he tries <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to his king, but he is above all faithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch people. Therefore, the last two lines of the first stanza, indicate that {{the leader of the}} Dutch civil war against the Spanish Empire of which they were part, had no specific quarrel with king Philip II of Spain, but rather with his emissaries in the Low Countries, like Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. This may have been because at the time (late 16th century) it was uncommon to publicly doubt the Divine Right of Kings, who was accountable to God alone. In 1581 the Netherlands nevertheless rejected the legitimacy of the king of Spain's rule over it in the Act of Abjuration.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} of Worcester (September 1651) Hollinworth {{was one of the}} Lancashire ministers who were arrested on a charge of being engaged in Christopher Love's plot against the government: others were Heyrick and John Angier. He was {{released}} after a short imprisonment, having been held in Liverpool with Angier, John Harrison and William Meek; and returned to Manchester. Hollinworth was a prominent figure at a meeting held at Warrington to consider the question of taking the oath called the Engagement, requiring the people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>faithful</b> to the Commonwealth. In the Manchester classis he generally acted as moderator during Heyrick's absence. He was named in the parliamentary ordinance of 29 August 1654 as a commissioner for ejecting scandalous and ignorant ministers and schoolmasters in Lancashire. When Humphrey Chetham drew up his will for the foundation of what now is Chetham's Library, he nominated Hollinworth one of his feoffees.|$|E
