25|$|After {{the great}} fire of 1601 (Keichō 6), the shogunate {{mandated}} that <b>thatched</b> <b>roofs</b> be modified into shingle roofs. Later, tiled roofs became fashionable among buildings inside luxurious daimyo residences and were also adopted in some chōnin residences. However, after the Great Fire of Meireki, a policy change banned {{the use of}} tiled roofs because the fire-resistant tiles fell from roofs and caused many injuries. Instead, flammable <b>thatched</b> <b>roofs</b> were required to be covered with earth to prevent fire from spreading. In 1661 (Kanbun 1), the use of <b>thatched</b> <b>roofs</b> in new buildings was also banned, making shingle roofs the only permitted choice.|$|R
