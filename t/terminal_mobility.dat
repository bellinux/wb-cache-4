40|$|Abstract. All IP {{mobility}} protocols currently {{proposed by}} the IETF assume that the mobile nodes always have a mobility-aware IP stack, which is still a scenario that can seldom be found nowadays. Most terminals, including the laptops and PDAs which would most benefit of the mobility support, still use legacy IP stacks, limiting their use to layer 2 mobility within a single IP subnet. The deployment of a <b>terminal</b> independent <b>mobility</b> solution, which efficiently supports handover, while providing resource optimisation, will increase mobile services offer, {{as it may be}} easily deployed by changing the network infrastructure, while using the existing terminals.

40|$|Abstract — We propose an {{enhanced}} physical-layer authenti-cation scheme for multi-carrier wireless systems, where trans-mission bursts consist of multiple frames. More specifically, {{it is based}} on the spatial variability characteristic of wireless channels, and able to work with moderate <b>terminal</b> <b>mobility.</b> For the authentication of the first frame in each data burst, the legal transmitter uses the saved channel response from the previous burst as the key for authentication of the first frame in the next burst. The key is obtained either via feedback from the receiver, or using the symmetric channel property of a TDD system. Then the authentication of the following frames in the burst is performed either by a Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test, or a least-squares adaptive channel estimator. Simulations in a typical indoor building show that the scheme based on the Neyman-Pearson test is more robust against <b>terminal</b> <b>mobility,</b> and is able to detect spoofing attacks efficiently with small system overhead when the terminal moves with a typical pedestrian speed.

For real-time mobile multimedia communication, we use SIP for signaling protocol {{as well as}} for supporting <b>terminal</b> <b>mobility.</b> While performance study for real-time mobile communication refers to several factors and their measurements, we analyze here only the handoff delay due to a node mobility. In particular, we are interested to examine the delay incurred when a mobile node moves to a new link and perform the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) and router selection, and analyze the delay in each case. We notice that the IPv 6 Linux implementation provides substantial amount of delay during node movement which severely affects the performance of real-time applications. Therefore, we modify the Linux kernel and compare with the unaltered one. Finally, we conclude that a faster handoff is achievable in SIP based <b>terminal</b> <b>mobility</b> with intelligent modifications to unaltered Linux kernel. I...|$|E
40|$|Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a solution to}} increase accuracy of spectrum sensing in a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), but with a few exceptions the design and performance evaluation of CSS schemes has focused so far on static networks, neglecting the role and potential impact of <b>terminals</b> <b>mobility,</b> in conjunction with channel spatio-temporal correlation. This work addresses such issues by proposing a CSS scheme with a correlation-based nodes selection and by evaluating its performance in a realistic simulation environment using accurate models for signal propagation, degree of correlation among sensing measurements and mobility behaviour. The proposed scheme adopts the well known Moran's I statistical index, defined in 1950 by P. A. P. Moran, as the metric for determining the degree of correlation between Secondary Users (SUs), and selects a subset of SUs characterized by low correlation and high expected sensing performance in order to achieve satisfactory network sensing performance while reducing the overhead related to sensing in terms of bandwidth utilization and energy consumption. The proposed scheme is compared with an alternative solution, where all SUs participate in the sensing process, by means of computer simulations considering both static and mobile SUs under accurate models for channel correlation and mobility. Simulation results, while confirming that the proposed scheme achieves a {{reduction in the number of}} devices involved in sensing without significant performance loss, hint that the advantage guaranteed by SU mobility might be lower than what estimated by previous studies under simpler assumptions. © VDE Verlag GMBH...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a new mechanism with proxy mobile IPv 4, as a mobility solution in networks. In this mechanism during mobile node access authentication, MPA exchanges registration messages with the HA (Home Agent) {{to set up a}} suitable routing and tunneling for packets from/to the MN. In this method, the authentication request of the mobile node is passed through the NAS or AP of visiting network, this is then passed to the AAA (Authentication Authorization and Accounting) server, and the authentication server checks the realm and does start authentication procedure at the time of initialing authorizing module of the mobile terminal. It also initiates the mobility extension module, where the AAA server initiates MPA of the access network, which also informs the AAA server of the home network with information on the mobility extensions and request of the mobility parameters of the user terminal. The home AAA server interacts with the HA and collects mobile node parameters, as well as sending back details as a reply request to the visiting AAA server. After the mobility context transfer, the MPA conducts a mobility registration to the HA for that particular mobile node.
