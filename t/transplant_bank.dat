40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether Notch- 1, a ligand-activated transmembrane receptor known to maintain cells in an undifferentiated state, primarily progenitor cells in other systems, {{could be used}} as a stem cell marker in human limbal epithelium. Methods: Human corneoscleral tissues obtained from the Doheny Eye & Tissue <b>Transplant</b> <b>Bank</b> were prepared for cross section and whole mount analysis. Tissue for whole mount was incubated in dispase; the epithelial sheet was removed and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde. Sections and whole mount were stained with antibodies against Notch- 1, Notch- 2, β- 1 integrin, α- 6, and the G 2 subtype member of the ATP binding cassette transporter (ABCG 2). Specificity of the Notch- 1 antibody was determined by western blot analysis with Cos- 7 cells transfected with Notch- 1. Explant culture was performed and only primary cultures were used in this experiment. Results: Notch- 1 was found to be expressed in the limbal basal region where stem cells reside. Notch- 1 antigenicity was more pronounced in cell clusters, mainly in the palisades of Vogt. The central cornea was almost devoid of Notch- 1. The intensity of Notch- 1 staining in cultured cells from the limbal explants was high in only a few cells. The Notch- 1 signal was diminished in dividing cells. Expression in cultured cells was more cytoplasmic; few cells showed additional nuclear staining. The Notch- 1 -stained whole mount showed only a few cells in the limbal region. A 300 kDa and a 110 kDa band confirmed the specificity of the antibody in Cos- 7 cells transfected with Notch- 1. Double staining for ABCG 2 and Notch- 1 showed some ABCG 2 -positive cells co-expressing Notch- 1 in the limbal basal epithelium, indicating that Notch- 1 expressin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the multi-motor system, a novel method for this {{system based on}} CAN bus and embedded control terminal is presented in this paper. A controller of the electric vehicle with multi-brushless-DC-motor system is designed, and the strategy with the function of synchronous control is also completed. According {{to the requirements of}} this system, a distributed control structure which based on Hierarchical Approach is chosen. The hardware platform of this structure is composed of embedded control terminal, master controller and sub-controllers, on this platform every in-wheel motor could be driven independently via the CAN bus. The control terminal is used to control the moving status of the EV. The control terminal chooses open-coded, occupies the hard real-time inner- core colonC/OS-II, <b>transplants</b> open-coded graph <b>bank</b> colonC/GUI and uses touch panel as the input device. At the end of this paper, the experiment results verified that the multi-motor system is reliable, the control strategy is rational, and the electric vehicle applied this multi-motor system has better dynamic response and higher reliability...|$|R
40|$|This study reports corneal graft survival, {{endothelial cell}} changes, and visual outcome in 20 {{patients}} who received {{some of the first}} corneas stored by organ culture in the Corneal <b>Transplant</b> Service Eye <b>Bank</b> in Bristol. Mean donor age was 48 years (SD 15, n = 20) and corneas were stored for an average of 21 days (SD 7, n = 20). Preoperative endothelial cell density was 2334 cells/mm 2 (SD 235, n = 18) and this fell by 8 % (SD 12) to 2158 cells/mm 2 (SD 372) within the first 2 months following transplantation. In 13 patients, endothelial cell density thereafter declined exponentially with a half-life of 41 months (SD 17, n = 12; one patient excluded as an outlier). Corneas that suffered rejection episodes showed the highest rates of loss of endothelial cells. Endothelial cell loss 4 years after transplantation was 46 % (SD 16, n = 12), which was similar to the postoperative decline in cell density reported for corneas stored for far shorter periods in McCarey-Kaufman medium at 4 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|Cholinergic {{human brain}} {{currents}} {{were recorded in}} Xenopus laevis oocytes transplanted with human cerebral membranes from two different zones, the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. The recorded currents were supported by the nicotinic or the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. We tested {{the effects of a}} number of several nicotinic agonists acetylcholine, nicotine and 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP), and the nicotinic receptor antagonists a-bungarotoxin and d-tubocurarine on the transplanted oocytes. We detected four kinds of nicotinic current kinetics. The differences in the amplitude and in the total electric charge of the currents elicited by various agonists at a range of holding potentials were not significant, except in the case of DMPP at a holding potential of- 90 mV. Our results indicate that α 4 β 2, α 3 β 4 and α 7 are the main nicotinic receptors in human brain.

40|$|Regarding {{anamnesis}} and serologic {{criteria for}} donor selection the Bank follows the dedicated {{guidelines of the}} Italian National <b>Transplant</b> Centre. The <b>Bank</b> selects the range of age (18 - 50 years) for ligament allograft and the evaluation protocol for detection of microbic contaminations (following international guidelines). In our protocol, each allograft has bacteriologic test for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria immediately {{at the moment of}} retrieval. When a careful review of the medical social history, and serologic tests shows eligibility of the tissue for transplant, the allograft is processed in a clean room at the appropriate size and x-ray are taken for future matching. After processing, but before antibiotic immersion allografts are again tested for microbiologic contamination, then packaged and taken in quarantine (- 80 °C) freezer, waiting the results of bacteriologic tests: only if negative again, the allografts are released for transplantation. All the data concerning the donor and processing are kipped in an informatic database and subsequently are added all the information regarding the recipient, for traceability. We may dispose of supplementary processing techniques for an easier storage-room temperature (as freeze drying or sterilization program for contaminated allografts) ...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{copy number}} of {{complement}} component C 4, which varies among individuals, may determine the intrinsic {{strength of the}} classical complement pathway. Presuming a major role of complement as an effector in transplant rejection, we hypothesized that C 4 genetic diversity may partially explain the variation in allograft outcomes. This retrospective study included 1969 deceased-donor kidney transplants randomly selected from the Collaborative <b>Transplant</b> Study DNA <b>bank.</b> We determined recipient and donor gene copy number of total C 4, C 4 isotypes (C 4 A and C 4 B), and C 4 gene length variants (C 4 L and C 4 S) by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Groups defined according to recipient C 4 gene copy number (low, intermediate, and high) had similar 10 -year allograft survival. Genotypic groups showed comparable rates of graft dysfunction, treatment for rejection, immunological graft loss, hospitalization for infection, malignant disease, and death. Similarly, separate analyses of C 4 A, C 4 B, C 4 L, and C 4 S; combined evaluation of donor and recipient C 4 genotype; or analysis of recipients with higher risk for rejection did not reveal considerable outcome effects. In conclusion, we did not demonstrate that C 4 gene copy number associates with transplant outcome, and we {{found no evidence that}} the resulting variation in the strength of classical complement activation influences susceptibility to rejection...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnrelated-donor {{umbilical}} cord blood (CB) {{is a useful}} alternative hematopoietic stem cell source for patients without suitably matched and readily available related or unrelated stem cell donors. Expectant parents today may {{have the option of}} either donating the CB to a public CB bank or keeping and storing the CB in a private bank for potential use in the future. The alternatives are often referred to as public banking and private banking. On behalf of the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT), we have reviewed the currently available data and opinions and offer the following recommendations: 1. Public donation of CB is encouraged where possible. 2. The probability of using one's own CB is very small—difficult to quantify but probably as low as 0. 04 % (1 : 2500) to 0. 0005 % (1 : 200, 000) in the first 20 years of life—and therefore, storage of CB for personal use is not recommended. 3. Family member banking (collecting and storing CB for a family member) is recommended when there is a sibling with a disease that may be treated successfully with allogeneic <b>transplant.</b> Family member <b>banking</b> on behalf of a parent with a disease that may be treated successfully with allogeneic transplant is only recommended when there are shared HLA-antigens between the parents. The committee acknowledges the expanding potential of indications for CB in the future, and suggests review of these recommendations at regular intervals...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the biogeochemical processes of involved in the relocation of dredged channel sediments in the Venice Lagoon, Italy, the SIOSED (Scripps Institution of Oceanography SEDiment research group) has carried out a research program from March 2005 to November 2007. Sediments were cored at various locations in the Venice Lagoon. In addition sediments were dredged from a navigation channel and <b>transplanted</b> directly into <b>banks</b> at two shallow sites. The monitoring program was essential since sediment in the Venice Lagoon is often contaminated with various metals and organic pollutants in different concentrations; consequently, most of the sediment in the lagoon has been evaluated as potentially hazardous. The sediment classification of the lagoon is organized into three categories based on the concentration range of various contaminants. Concentrations of the categories are based on total concentration values and on potential toxicity of each single contaminant; therefore, the occurrence of only one contaminant above the range characteristic of a specific category associates the sediment to the next more contaminated category. As part of this multi-disciplinary program, potential changes in the geochemistry of sediments were studied in relation to their dredging and reuse, including both the chemistry of solid phases and of interstitial fluids of the sediments. The present program of studies has emphasized the study of both major elements and trace metals in the sediments. Results of SIOSED sponsored studies on the distribution of Hg and the processes involving the generation of pollutants such as methyl-mercury have been already been publishe...|$|R
40|$|Correlative species {{distribution}} models (SDMs) {{are often used}} to quantify the potential ranges of alien species. Despite rising popularity, there is ongoing debate surrounding whether SDMs can predict non-equilibrium species, how well they capture underlying biological mechanisms versus drawing spurious correlations, and how realistic the ensuing projections are. There have been numerous calls to integrate SDMs with real-world performance data to validate and improve projections, but such studies remain rare. In this thesis, I investigated the potential distributions of three alien plant species, Aeonium arboreum, A. haworthii and Cotyledon orbiculata, in their introduced ranges of New Zealand. I used a combination of SDMs, observational and experimental approaches. I firstly developed correlative SDMs for the three species. Secondly, I quantified the species’ climatic limits in the study region of Banks Peninsula, New Zealand, using field transplant experiments and surveys. Finally, I combined the aforementioned plant performance data into a single climate-driven population model, which I used to test and enhance the original SDM projections. I found that the New Zealand distributions of all three species are climatically novel relative to their distributions elsewhere, and constitute shifts in their realized niches. Although SDMs indicated that much of New Zealand is climatically suitable, <b>transplant</b> experiments on <b>Banks</b> Peninsula confirmed that the climate of Banks Peninsula is limiting. In all three species, low growth rates, low germination, and high mortality at high elevations will limit spread. In contrast, surveys found little evidence of direct climatic limitation to fecundity within the species’ current distributions on Banks Peninsula. The final step of validating SDM projections against the population model revealed that the SDM performed better than k-folds cross-validation against occurrence data would suggest. However, the SDMs over-predicted suitable climate in the region. I therefore adjusted SDM thresholds of modelled suitability to optimise parsimony with field data and provide more robust projections for Banks Peninsula. This is the first thorough study of climatic limitation of the target species. It {{is also one of}} few to experimentally test SDMs and use field performance data to enhance projections. Although I found support for the usefulness of SDMs, the results emphasise the need for scepticism and rigorous testing of outputs. Validating SDMs against field data was highly effective, and was a better test of model performance than conventional methods using occurrence data. Uptake of similar methods as outlined in this thesis would improve understanding of uncertainty in distribution modelling. I encourage the use of such techniques not only for improving confidence in model projections, but also in recognizing the relative impact of sources of error in our models. At a time when generating projections of species’ potential distributions has never been easier, the need for considered judgements in SDM building and cautious interpretation of outputs is emphasised by my findings...|$|R
