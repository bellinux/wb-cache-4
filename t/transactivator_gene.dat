50|$|Artificial transactivation {{of a gene}} is {{achieved}} by inserting it into the genome at the appropriate area as <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> adjoined to special promoter regions of DNA. The <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> expresses a transcription factor that binds to specific promoter region of DNA. By binding to the promoter region of a gene, the transcription factor causes that gene to be expressed. The expression of one <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> can activate multiple genes, {{as long as they}} have the same, specific promoter region attached. Because the expression of the <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> can be controlled, transactivation can be used to turn genes on and off. If this specific promoter region is also attached to a reporter gene, we can measure when the transactivator is being expressed.|$|E
50|$|The Tet-On Advanced transactivator (also {{known as}} rtTA2S-M2) is an {{alternative}} version of Tet-On that shows reduced basal expression, and functions at a 10-fold lower Dox concentration than Tet-Off. In addition, its expression {{is considered to be}} more stable in eukaryotic cells due to being human codon optimized and utilizing 3 minimal transcriptional activation domains. It was discovered in 2000 as one of two improved mutants by H. Bujard and his colleagues after random mutagenesis of the Tet Repressor part of the <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene.</b> Tet-On 3G (also known as rtTA-V16needed) is similar to Tet-On Advanced but was derived from rtTA2S-S2 rather than rtTA2S-M2. It is also human codon optimized and composed of 3 minimal VP16 activation domains. However, the Tet-On 3G protein has 5 amino acid differences compared to Tet-On Advanced which appear to increase its sensitivity to Dox even further. Tet-On 3G is sensitive to 100-fold less Dox and is 7-fold more active than the original Tet-On.|$|E
50|$|Fisher’s {{discoveries in}} HIV were {{extensive}} and critical {{for future research}} of the virus’s characteristics. She produced the first functional copies of HIV, allowing her and other scientists to access biologically active material for future research of the virus’s genes. She determined the roles {{of several of the}} genes in HIV. These findings have been significant in studying and understanding different characteristics of HIV and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Whilst at the NIH, Fisher developed approaches that allowed the successful introduction of exogenous DNA onto human blood cells. Two methods, protoplast fusion and electroporation, proved successful and allowed Fisher to test whether molecular clones isolated from HIV-infected cultures could generate infectious retrovirus upon transfection. Fisher showed in 1985 that molecular clones of HIV, contained within approximately 18kb of contiguous proviral DNA, were biologically active and generated cytopathic virus when introduced into primary human T-cells. This discovery was important s it established that products of the viral genome itself, rather than a cofactor or contaminant, were capable of killing human T cells and were therefore potentially capable of mediating the immunosuppressive effect of HIV. it also provided the basis for dissecting the molecular function of each of the viral genes and for developing DNA-based diagnostic tests for HIV infection. In the following 4 years, Fisher showed that the <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> tat was essential for virus replication, that truncation of the 3' open reading frame disrupts virus cytopathogenicity, and that sor (now called vif) is required for efficient cell to cell transmission of HIV virus. With clinical collaborators from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Redfield and Looney), Fisher showed that patient antisera displayed type-specific neutralising properties and that multiple HIV isolates derived from a single patient were biologically diverse and contained replication-competent as well as replication-incompetent cytopathic variants. These studies performed more than 20 years ago, gave some of the first hints that a successful HIV vaccine might prove difficult to engineer.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe porcine {{lymphotropic}} herpesviruses (PLHV) {{are discussed}} as possible risk factors in xenotransplantation {{because of the}} high prevalence of PLHV- 1, PLHV- 2 and PLHV- 3 in pig populations world-wide and the fact that PLHV- 1 {{has been found to be}} associated with porcine post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. To provide structural and functional knowledge on the PLHV immediate-early (IE) <b>transactivator</b> <b>genes,</b> the central regions of the PLHV genomes were characterized by genome walking, sequence and splicing analysis. Three spliced genes were identified (ORF 50, ORFA 6 /BZLF 1 h, ORF 57) encoding putative IE transactivators, homologous to (i) ORF 50 and BRLF 1 /Rta, (ii) K 8 /K-bZIP and BZLF 1 /Zta and (iii) ORF 57 and BMLF 1 of HHV- 8 and EBV, respectively. Expressed as myc-tag or HA-tag fusion proteins, they were located to the cellular nucleus. In reporter gene assays, several PLHV-promoters were mainly activated by PLHV- 1 ORF 50, to a lower level by PLHV- 1 ORFA 6 /BZLF 1 h and not by PLHV- 1 ORF 57. However, the ORF 57 -encoded protein acted synergistically on ORF 50 -mediated activation...|$|R
40|$|Papillomaviruses induce benign {{squamous}} epithelial lesions that infrequently {{are associated}} with uncontrolled growth or malignant conversion. The virus-encoded oncogenes are clearly under negative regulation since papillomaviruses can latently infect cells and since different levels of viral oncogene expression are seen within the layers of differentiating infected epitheliomas. We used bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV- 1) to investigate the mechanisms involved in the negative regulation of transformation. We found that the following two distinct and interacting mechanisms negatively regulate BPV- 1 transformation effected by virally encoded trans-acting factors: (i) E 2 repressors suppress transformation by the E 6 and E 7 oncogenes, and (ii) E 1 and the E 2 transactivator suppress transformation by the E 6, E 7, and E 5 oncogenes. These systems interact in that the E 2 repressors function to relieve the transformation suppression effected by the E 1 and E 2 <b>transactivator</b> <b>genes.</b> A BPV- 1 mutant that lacked E 2 repressors and E 1 had greatly augmented transformation capacity. Analysis of this mutant revealed that the enhanced transformation was due to expression of the E 6 and E 7 genes {{in the absence of}} E 5, revealing a previously unappreciated potency and synergy for the BPV- 1 E 6 and E 7 oncogenes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several plasmid DNA-based {{mammalian}} expression {{systems have}} recently been developed which {{make it possible to}} manipulate gene expression via the administration of exogenous agents. In order to extend the application of these systems, we have developed retroviral vectors which allow for the controlled expression of inserted genes both in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two vector strategies which make use of the tetracycline-regulated gene expression system described by Gossen and Bujard were evaluated. In a first strategy, one virus was generated which encoded the tTA or rtTA <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> product, and a second virus was generated in which expression of the gene of interest was dependent upon tetracycline-responsive transcriptional control elements placed either within the viral LTR or within the proviral transcriptional unit. In a second vector strategy, both components of the tet-regulatable system were incorporated into a single proviral genome {{in such a way that}} expression of both the transgene and the <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> product were under control of tet-regulatable control elements. RESULTS: Both vector strategies resulted in the ability to regulate the expression of inserted genes. In one single virus configuration, gene expression could be regulated over 100 X and the level of gene expression in the induced state was comparable to or greater than that achieved with standard LTR-based vectors. The use of different deletions in the viral LTR made it possible to generate a number of vectors which provide for a four-fold range of levels of expression of inserted genes in the induced state. Studies in mice with transduced cells demonstrated that gene expression could be induced in vivo by manipulation of tetracycline for at least 48 days. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of highly transmissible, regulatable retroviral vectors should greatly facilitate studies in which it is of interest to manipulate the expression of specific genes in vitro or in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{highly complex}} pattern of {{expression}} of {{major histocompatibility complex}} class II (MHC-II) molecules determines both the immune repertoire during development and subsequently the triggering and the control of immune responses. These distinct functions result from cell type-restricted expression, developmental control and either constitutive or inducible expression of MHC-II genes. Yet, in these various situations, MHC-II gene expression is always {{under the control of}} a unique transactivator, CIITA. Here we show that the CIITA gene is controlled by several distinct promoters, two of which direct specific constitutive expression in dendritic cells and B lymphocytes respectively, while another mediates gamma-interferon-induced expression. Thus the cellular, temporal and functional diversity of MHC-II expression is ultimately controlled by differential activation of different promoters of a single <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene.</b> This provides novel experimental tools to dissect compartment-specific gain or loss of MHC-II function in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that a 26 -kDa protein encoded by the vaccinia virus A 2 L open reading frame, originally {{shown to be}} one of three intermediate-stage genes that together can transactivate late-stage gene expression in transfection assays (J. G. Keck, C. J. Baldick, and B. Moss, Cell 61 : 801 - 809, 1990), is required for in vitro transcription of a template with a late promoter. The critical step in this analysis was the preparation of an extract containing all the required factors except for the A 2 L protein. This extract was prepared from cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase {{in the presence of the}} DNA synthesis inhibitor cytosine arabinoside and transfected with plasmids containing the two other known <b>transactivator</b> <b>genes,</b> A 1 L and G 8 R, under T 7 promoter control. Reaction mixtures made with extracts of these cells had background levels of late transcription activity, unless they were supplemented with extracts of cells transfected with the A 2 L gene. Active transcription mixtures were also made by mixing extracts from three sets of cells, each transfected with a gene (A 1 L, A 2 L, or G 8 R) encoding a separate factor, indicating the absence of any requirement for their coexpression. To minimize the possibility that the A 2 L protein functions indirectly by activating another viral or cellular protein, this gene was expressed in insect cells by using a baculovirus vector. The partially purified recombinant protein complemented the activity of A 2 L-deficient cell extracts. Recombinant A 1 L, A 2 L, and G 8 R proteins, all produced in insect cells, together complemented extracts from mammalian cells containing only viral early proteins, concordant with previous in vivo transfection data...|$|R

40|$|The DNA-dependent {{protein kinase}} (DNA-PK) is {{involved}} in several fundamental nuclear processes, including DNA double-strand break repair, V(D) J recombination, and transcription by RNA polymerases I and II.

The half-life of the p 350 /DNA-PKcs protein decreases from greater than 24 h to less than 4 h following infection. The depletion of DNA-PK activity and p 350 /DNA-PKcs abundance is dependent on expression of the viral immediate-early protein ICP 0.

The documented cytotoxicity of the transposase, when constitutively expressed by an integrating retroviral vector (iRV), has been circumvented by the transient delivery of SB 100 X using retroviral mRNA transfer.

Based on these properties, the regulated transposase-IDLV vectors may represent a valuable tool for genetic engineering and therapeutic gene transfer...|$|E

A single retroviral vector can transduce both the <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> and the gene of interest controlled by the tTA-inducible promoter into mammalian cells. We show that cell lines expressing the transactivator can readily be established and that expression of the gene of interest depends on the removal of tetracycline and the addition of estrogen. By using this system, cell lines with inducible expression of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, a potentially toxic gene product, were established.

We found that the antiviral activity of tat shRNA was abolished due to the emergence of viral quasispecies harboring a point mutation in the shRNA target region. Our results suggest that, in order for RNAi to durably suppress HIV- 1 replication, it may be necessary to target highly conserved regions of the viral genome. Alternatively, similar to present antiviral drug therapy paradigms, DNA constructs expressing multiple siRNAs need to be developed that target different regions of the viral genome, thereby reducing the probability of generating escape mutants...|$|R

We have previously shown that Vmw 110 binds to a 135 -kDa cellular protein. In this paper we define a short region towards the C-terminal end of Vmw 110 that is required for the 135 -kDa protein interaction in virus-infected cells and in vitro. We also confirm that the C-terminal region of Vmw 110 contains residues that are responsible for the multimerisation of the protein; these sequences are at least partially distinct from those involved in 135 -kDa binding. Both multimerisation and 135 -kDa protein interaction are required for full viral infectivity, and elimination of these functions affects the normal interactions between Vmw 110 and cellular nuclear structures that contain the PML protein...|$|R
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that the immediate-early (IE) gene products of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the transactivator (TAT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) regulate HIV- 1 gene expression through mechanisms involving host cell factors. By using transient transfection assays with the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under the transcriptional control of the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we examined transactivation of the LTR by plasmids that express either the HIV- 1 gene for TAT or human CMV IE. The ratio {{of the level of}} transactivation by CMV IE to the level of transactivation by TAT varied up to 1, 000 -fold between cell types. The difference in the activities of these transactivators in various cell types was not a consequence of differential expression of the <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene.</b> Analysis of RNA species initiated in the HIV- 1 LTR supports the conclusion that cellular factors regulate the level of elongation of the transcription complex on the LTR.

In this study, we found that a constitutive, low level of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA was expressed in the EBV-infected gastric tissue-derived GT 38 and GT 39 cell lines, by analysis with the reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) and Southern blotting. Treatment of these cells with a specific NOS inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), induced the immediate-early, EBV <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> BZLF 1 protein ZEBRA, suggesting {{a significant increase in}} EBV reactivation by l-NMMA. Northern blotting demonstrated that BZLF 1 and BRLF 1 transcripts were also induced by 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 acetate (TPA). Meanwhile, constitutive expression of iNOS mRNA was inhibited by TPA. l-NMMA also enhanced TPA-induced expression of the BZLF 1 gene. On the other hand, a NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), which releases NO in an aqueous solution, inhibited the TPA-induced BZLF 1 gene expression in a dose-dependent manner at both mRNA and protein levels.

Transfection experiments showed growth stimulation of NIH 3 T 3 cells [...] growing beyond the saturation density and growing in soft agar. Since the pX sequence is known to encode three proteins, Tax, Rex, and p 21 x, the biological activity of each pX gene was examined separately. The growth-stimulating activity was induced only by the tax gene in NIH 3 T 3 cells and Rat- 1 cells. Furthermore, the tax gene induced tumorigenicity in nude mice when introduced into Rat- 1 cells. Thus, a transcriptional <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> of HTLV-I, tax, is clearly identified as a viral oncogene without a cellular homolog.

Transgenic mice expressing the reverse tetracycline-responsive <b>transactivator</b> (rtTA) <b>gene</b> {{under the control}} of the rat elastase promoter were generated to mediate acinar cell–specific expression of IKK 2 alleles.

Notably, expression of constitutively active IKK 2 was sufficient to induce acute pancreatitis. This acinar cell–specific phenotype included edema, cellular infiltrates, necrosis, and elevation of serum lipase levels as well as pancreatic fibrosis. IKK 2 activation caused increased expression of known NF-κB target genes, including mediators of the inflammatory response such as TNF-α and ICAM- 1. Indeed, inhibition of TNF-α activity identified this cytokine as an important effector of IKK 2 -induced pancreatitis.

CIITA was recently identified as an MHC class II transactivator that is essential for MHC class II expression in B lymphocytes. We show here that inactivation of MHC class II genes in plasmocytes is associated with silencing of the CIITA gene. Moreover, experimentally induced expression of CIITA in plasmocytes leads to reexpression of MHC class II molecules to the same level as that observed on B lymphocytes. We therefore conclude that the loss of MHC class II expression observed upon terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasmocytes results from silencing of the <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene</b> CIITA.

40|$|The narrow species tropisms of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and the Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) {{have made}} Murid Herpesvirus- 4 (MuHV- 4) an {{important}} tool for understanding how gammaherpesviruses colonize their hosts. However, while MuHV- 4 pathogenesis studies can assign a quantitative importance to individual genes, the complexity of in vivo infection can make the underlying mechanisms hard to discern. Furthermore, the lack of good in vitro MuHV- 4 latency/ reactivation systems with which to dissect mechanisms at the cellular level has made some parallels with EBV and KSHV hard to draw. Here we achieved control of the MuHV- 4 lytic/latent switch in vitro by modifying the 59 untranslated region of its major lytic <b>transactivator</b> <b>gene,</b> ORF 50. We terminated normal ORF 50 transcripts by inserting a polyadenylation signal and transcribed ORF 50 instead from a down-stream, doxycycline-inducible promoter. In this way we could establish fibroblast clones that maintained latent MuHV- 4 episomes without detectable lytic replication. Productive virus reactivation was then induced with doxycycline. We used this system {{to show that the}} MuHV- 4 K 3 gene plays a significant role in protecting reactivating cells against CD 8 + T cell recognition...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an immunotherapy in which tumor cells transfected with syngeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes are cell-based vaccines {{for the treatment of}} established tumor and metastatic disease. If this strategy is to be used clinically, convenient methods for generating class II+ tumor cells are necessary. Interferon-γ treatment or transduction of the class II <b>transactivator</b> (CIITA) <b>gene</b> induces class II expression but also up-regulates the class II-associated accessory molecules, invariant chain (Ii) and DM. To determine if interferon-γ treatment and CIITA transduction are potential immunotherapies, we assessed the tumorigenicity of sarcoma cells expressing combinations of class II, Ii, and DM. Since we hypothesized that class II-transfected tumor cells not coexpressing Ii and DM present endogenously encoded tumor peptides, we have assessed the transfectants for antigen presentation activity to MHC class II-restricted antigen-specific CD 4 + T cells. Tumor challenge studies demonstrate that tumor cells expressing class II without coexpression of Ii or Ii plus DM are highly immunogenic and preferentially present endogenous antigens, while tumors coexpressing class II with Ii or Ii plus DM are not effective immunogens. Because tumor rejection correlates with expression of class II without coexpression of Ii and DM, the most efficacious vaccines will express MHC class II without coexpression of Ii and DM and will preferentially present endogenous antigen...|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{factors of}} the acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) /polyoma enhancer-binding protein (PEBP 2 alpha) /core-binding factor alpha (CBFA) class are key <b>transactivators</b> of tissue-specific <b>genes</b> of the hematopoietic and bone lineages. AML- 1 /PEBP 2 alphaB/CBFA 2 {{proteins}} participating in transcription {{are associated with}} the nuclear matrix. This association is solely dependent on a highly conserved C-terminal protein segment, designated the nuclear matrix targeting signal (NMTS). The NMTS of AML- 1 is physically distinct from the nuclear localization signal, operates autonomously, and supports transactivation. Our data indicate that the related AML- 3 and AML- 2 proteins are also targeted to the nuclear matrix in situ by analogous C-terminal domains. Here we report the first crystal structure of an NMTS in an AML- 1 segment fused to glutathione S-transferase. The model of the NMTS consists of two loops connected by a flexible U-shaped peptide chain...|$|R
2500|$|HSVs may {{persist in}} a {{quiescent}} but persistent form known as latent infection, notably in neural ganglia. HSV-1 tends {{to reside in}} the trigeminal ganglia, while HSV-2 tends to reside in the sacral ganglia, but these are tendencies only, not fixed behavior. During latent infection of a cell, HSVs express latency associated transcript (LAT) RNA. LAT regulates the host cell genome and interferes with natural cell death mechanisms. By maintaining the host cells, LAT expression preserves a reservoir of the virus, which allows subsequent, usually symptomatic, periodic recurrences or [...] "outbreaks" [...] characteristic of non-latency. Whether or not recurrences are symptomatic, viral shedding occurs to infect a new host. A protein found in neurons may bind to herpes virus DNA and regulate latency. Herpes virus DNA contains a gene for a protein called ICP4, which is an important <b>transactivator</b> of <b>genes</b> associated with lytic infection in HSV-1. Elements surrounding the gene for ICP4 bind a protein known as the human neuronal protein Neuronal Restrictive Silencing Factor (NRSF) or human Repressor Element Silencing Transcription Factor (REST). When bound to the viral DNA elements, histone deacetylation occurs atop the ICP4 gene sequence to prevent initiation of transcription from this gene, thereby preventing transcription of other viral genes involved in the lytic cycle. Another HSV protein reverses the inhibition of ICP4 protein synthesis. ICP0 dissociates NRSF from the ICP4 gene and thus prevents silencing of the viral DNA.|$|R
