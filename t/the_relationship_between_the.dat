50|$|In {{their book}} Discourses in Place: Language in the {{material}} world, Ron Scollon and Suzie Wong Scollon note that visual semiotics {{has to do with}} turning “from the spoken, face-to-face discourses to the representations of that interaction order in images and signs” (82). Interaction order involves the various social interactions that takes place in any setting, such as being alone, being with a companion, at a meeting, watching a show etc., and it “is almost always complex,” with various interactions occurring at once (83). When it comes to images, says Scollon and Wong, there are also multiple <b>relationships.</b> These include <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> components of a visual image, <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> producers of <b>the</b> visual image, <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> producers and the components, as well as <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> components of an image and those who are viewing it.

5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research.

This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E
