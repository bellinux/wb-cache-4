The German officers were still reluctant to surrender. Timmermann, through Busch, finally had a German officer come out of the tunnel and a peaceful surrender was arranged. Some 200 soldiers and over 100 civilians, along with young Busch's mother, surrendered and were escorted over the bridge to safety. It was now a little after 1715 hours (5:15 PM), less than two hours had passed. The only German killed in the railroad tunnel that afternoon was young Willi Felten.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach {{drove to}} the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore at 11105 Superior Avenue to see Evans. Not finding him there, they {{drove to the}} Evans' {{apartment}} at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were {{surprised to discover that}} the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern {{that he was going to}} be harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E

500|$|During Parry's lifetime, many of {{his works}} {{remained}} unpublished; the shelves of his study held stacks of manuscripts. A friend of Parry's <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{about the possibility of}} losing all of his manuscripts if there was a fire and suggested Parry needed a safe to store his manuscripts in. [...] When Parry said he could not afford to buy a safe, the friend gave him one as a gift. Over 100 years after his death, one of his unknown works, Te Deum, was discovered by accident in the National Library of Wales archives.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Mikhail Vinogradov, one of {{the leading}} staff members of the Serbsky Center, {{strongly}} degraded the human rights movement of the Soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill. In his opinion, [...] "now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people." [...] In 2012, Vinogradov said the same, [...] "Do you talk about human rights activists? Most of them are just unhealthy people, I talked with them. As for the dissident General Grigorenko, I too saw him, kept him under observation, and noted oddities of his thinking. But he was eventually allowed to go abroad, as you know... Who? Bukovsky? I <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and he is a completely crazy character. But he too was allowed to go abroad! You see, human rights activists are people who, due to their mental pathology, are unable to restrain themselves within the standards of society, and the West encourages their inability to do so." [...] In the same year, he offered to restore Soviet mental health law and said it [...] "has never been used for political persecution." [...] Human rights activists who claim it did, in Vinogradov's words, [...] "are not very mentally healthy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joseph told his {{brothers}} {{that it was}} not they who sent him to Egypt, but God, who had made him ruler over all Egypt. Joseph thus directed them to go quickly to his father and convey that God had made him lord of all Egypt and his father should come down to live in the land of Goshen and Joseph would sustain him for the five years of famine. And Joseph and his brother Benjamin wept on each other's necks, Joseph kissed all his brothers and wept upon them, and after that, his brothers <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> The report went through Pharaoh's house that Joseph's brothers had come, and it pleased Pharaoh. Pharaoh directed Joseph to tell his brothers to go to Canaan and bring their father and their households back to Egypt. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was during}} the last {{struggle}} of his people, {{at the time of}} the Messiah craze in 1890-1891 that American Horse demonstrated as never before the real greatness of the man. While many of his friends were carried away by the new thought, he held aloof from it and cautioned his band to do the same. When it developed into an extensive upheaval among the nations he took his positive stand against it. Presently all Indians who did not dance the Ghost Dance were ordered to come into camp at Pine Ridge Agency. [...] American Horse was the first to bring in his people. [...] I was there at the time and <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> daily. When Little was arrested, it had been agreed among the disaffected to have him resist, which meant that he would be roughly handled. This was to be their excuse to attack the Indian police, which would probably lead to a general massacre or outbreak. I know that this desperate move was opposed from the beginning by American Horse, and it was believed that his life was threatened.” ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{they found}} the empty tomb, the gospels {{indicate}} that Jesus {{made a series of}} appearances to the disciples. He was not immediately recognizable, according to Luke. E. P. Sanders concluded that although he could appear and disappear, he was not a ghost. Writing that Luke was very insistent about that, Sanders pointed out that [...] "the risen Lord could be touched, and he could eat". He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, but she did not recognize him at first. The first two disciples to whom he appeared, walked and <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for quite a while without knowing who he was, (the road to Emmaus appearance). He was made known [...] "in the breaking of the bread". When he first appeared to the disciples in the upper room, Thomas was not present and wouldn't believe until a later appearance where he was invited to put his finger into the holes in Jesus' hands and side. Beside the Sea of Galilee he encouraged Peter to serve his followers. [...] His final appearance is reported as being forty days after the resurrection when he was [...] "carried up" [...] into heaven where he sits on the right hand of God.|$|E
2500|$|Li Mi {{came from}} a line {{that was part of}} the nobility during {{successive}} dynasties Western Wei, Northern Zhou, and Sui Dynasty. [...] By the time of his father Li Kuan (李寬), who carried the Sui-created title of Duke of Pushan, the clan, although not originally from there, lived at the Sui capital Chang'an. [...] Due to his father's position, Li Mi became a guard of Emperor Yang of Sui, and he was said to view money lightly, using it to instead gather friends around him. [...] One day, however, when Emperor Yang saw him, Emperor Yang was apprehensive of his appearance, and told his associate Yuwen Shu the Duke of Xu to have Li Mi removed. [...] Thereafter, Yuwen persuaded Li Mi to resign from the imperial guard corps, and Li instead often traveled around the capital, riding a bull and reading while doing so—particularly the Book of Han. [...] When the prime minister Yang Su the Duke of Yue saw him, he was surprised by Li Mi's studiousness, and as Li knew it was the prime minister, he respectfully bowed and stated his name. [...] Yang Su took Li to his mansion and <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Impressed, he told his son Yang Xuangan, [...] "Li Mi's intelligence and capability is far beyond yours." [...] Thereafter, Yang Xuangan and Li Mi became friends. [...] Sometimes, Yang Xuangan would bully Li, and Li responded: ...|$|E
