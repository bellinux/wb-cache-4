5|$|While {{opening up}} the attic door, Kyle is seized by an {{attacker}} and killed. They {{find out that the}} killer is Billy Lenz's sister Agnes, who has also set up the corpses of the sorority sisters around a Christmas tree. After Leigh falls through the floor of the attic, Kelli is attacked by both Agnes and Billy. While fighting, the Christmas tree catches fire while she and Agnes fall down into one of the holes in the wall. Managing to escape with Leigh's help, they set the house on fire and reach the hospital. At the hospital, Agnes, who had survived the fire, kills Leigh but Kelli manages to kill her using a defibrillator. When Billy chases her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> Kelli manages to knock him over, impaling him on the finial of a Christmas tree and finally killing him. She is last seen staring at Billy's corpse.|$|E
25|$|In a {{multi-story}} building, {{an internal}} stairway (away from broken windows) often {{acts as a}} safe haven, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> reinforcing the walls and blocking any major debris falling from above. If a stairway is lined with windows, {{then there would be}} the danger of flying glass, so an interior stairway, or small inner room, would be preferable.|$|E

30|$|Merging {{streams of}} {{evacuees}} in the floor-stair interface {{is another important}} factor during stairwell evacuations in high-rise buildings. The impact of merging behaviours can dictate {{the speed of the}} agents and consequently affect the total evacuation time. Galea et al. (2008 c) suggested that in high-rise buildings, floors should be linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landing on <b>the</b> opposite side <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>stair</b> in order <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> efficiency of the flows. Boyce et al. (2009) discussed the merging ratios, performing experiments that show that despite differences in the geometric location of the door in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> <b>the</b> merging ratio was always approximately 50 : 50.|$|R
25|$|Ropes {{had been}} {{suspended}} between {{the legs of}} the tower by the police at Reichelt's request to prevent the crowds from spilling onto the landing zone, and he spent some time discussing the arrangements with the marshals and ensuring that there was sufficient space for his landing before going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to climb to the first platform.|$|E
25|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stairs</b> Expedition's doctor Joseph Moloney {{and third}} officer Christian de Bonchamps, with {{negotiations}} at stalemate, Msiri reacted to an ultimatum and to Stairs flying the CFS flag without his consent, by departing {{in the night}} to a fortified village at Munema {{on the outskirts of}} Bunkeya. The next day, 20 December 1891, Stairs sent his second-in-command, Belgian Lieutenant Omer Bodson with de Bonchamps and 100 askaris to arrest Msiri. Despite de Bonchamps' concerns about the danger, Bodson went into Munema with a dozen men and confronted Msiri in front of about 300 of his warriors. Msiri said nothing but in anger started to draw the sword which had been a gift from Stairs. Bodson drew his revolver and shot Msiri three times, killing him. A fight erupted, and Bodson was shot and mortally wounded by one of Msiri's men, dying later.|$|E
500|$|Although Brownlee's {{public image}} {{was of a}} severe and humourless technocrat, in private he allowed himself some levity. [...] Christmas morning 1923, the Brownlee boys awoke to find {{footprints}} of coal dust leading from the fireplace <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and a handwritten note from Santa Claus apologizing for the mess and explaining {{that he had been}} searching for one of his reindeer. [...] It transpired that he had mistaken one of Florence's feet, emerging from the covers at the foot of her bed, for an antler. [...] On another occasion, Brownlee reacted to his sons' displeasure at leaving his parents' cat in Ontario by acquiring a large bloodhound, which he himself came to enjoy.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1847 Captain John Bush, of the Kirkcaldy and London Shipping Company, married Margaret Greig, {{daughter}} of a shipmaster, at the pier. In 1849 a lifebuoy and rope were provided at the pier head for swimmers who got into difficulty. A ladder leading into the sea was provided for swimmers, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> which were for use by steamboat passengers. By the 1850s the pier was falling into disrepair, {{but it was still}} popular with bathers, and early-morning trains were advertised allowing for a swim before work. There was a gymnasium {{at the head of the}} pier, and the Forth Swimming Club was based there from its inception in 1850. They organised swimming competitions, including [...] "fast swimming" [...] and [...] "long diving" [...] which were, respectively, a [...] race and an underwater endurance contest. [...] "Deep diving" [...] involved retrieving objects from the bottom in [...] of water then surfacing through a floating lifebuoy. A longer race was from Newhaven harbour to the Chain Pier, a distance of [...] In 1864 the winning time was 11 minutes and 35 seconds. Two floating platforms were moored east of the pier; the closer one was about [...] out. In July 1858 an attempt was made to restart ferry services from the pier; this caused annoyance to swimmers.|$|E
2500|$|The reconfigured {{platforms}} and new station building, platform awnings and subway at Graceville Railway Station, built between [...] and 1959, demonstrate the principal {{characteristics of a}} suburban railway station embodying Modernist post-World War Two architectural ideas. As part of what was a large suite of similar but individually-designed station structures, Graceville stands out as a significant example of the type, being the first constructed and described {{at the time as}} the most modern in Australia. The Graceville and Chelmer railway stations are the most aesthetically successful examples of the butterfly-roof typology adopted for station building and awning design at that time, utilising new materials and technologies to perform the tasks of sheltering passengers, selling tickets and outfitting rail staff. Through a high degree of intactness, the Graceville station complex maintains the integrity of its original design, and is greatly complemented by the standardised butterfly-roofed platform awnings, also largely intact, that accompany it. Significant elements include the platforms, station building, platform awnings, and subway, and fabric of particular note includes: terrazzo tiles to the waiting room and ticket hall floors, the painted steel balustrade <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> leading from the subway, the terrazzo windows sills and the early aluminium double-hung window sets, the tiles to the subway walls, the timber and concrete seating throughout, the cast iron drinking fountain adjacent to the northern facade of the building, and the lettering on the southern and western facades of the building.|$|E

40|$|Stair prompts can {{encourage}} stair use in {{both public and}} private settings and thereby increase overall physical activity. Stair visibility in multilevel buildings increases stair use. For this study, an intervention using a modified New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene stair prompt was implemented to encourage stair use in an academic setting. The modification included a time management theme, chosen because individuals in this setting may find taking <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> be faster than taking <b>the</b> elevator. <b>To</b> evaluate <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>the</b> modified <b>stair</b> prompt, two buildings [...] one with hidden stairs and one with visible stairs [...] were selected for observing subjects 2 ̆ 7 responses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> modified prompt. This 13 -week observational study used a multiple-baseline design that included a baseline phase (no exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> prompt) followed by an intervention phase (exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> prompt). Overall, <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> prompts had no measurable effect on ascending stair use. Men, as compared to women, were more likely to walk up hidden stairs; however, men and women were equally likely to walk up visible stairs. Thus, having visible stairs in multilevel buildings, rather than <b>the</b> presence of <b>stair</b> prompts, may be an alternative and perhaps more effective approach toward promoting stair use for physical activity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, the {{representation}} of the merging process at <b>the</b> floor– <b>stair</b> interface is examined within a comprehensive evacuation model and trends found in experimental data are compared with model predictions. The analysis suggests that {{the representation}} of floor–stair merging within the comprehensive model appears to be consistent with trends observed within several published experiments of the merging process. In particular: (a) The floor flow rate onto <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> decreases as <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> population density increases. (b) For a given <b>stair</b> population density, <b>the</b> floor population’s flow rate onto <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> can be maximized by connecting <b>the</b> floor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landing adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>stair.</b> (c) In situations where the floor is connected adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>stair,</b> <b>the</b> merging process appears to be biased in favor of the floor population. It is further conjectured that when the floor is connected opposite <b>the</b> incoming <b>stair,</b> <b>the</b> merging process between <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> and floor streams is almost in balance for high stair population densities, with a slight bias in favor of the floor stream at low population densities. A key practical finding of this analysis is that the speed at which a floor can be emptied onto a stair can be enhanced simply by connecting <b>the</b> floor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landing at a location adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>stair</b> rather than opposite <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> Configuring <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> in this way, while reducing the floor emptying time, results in a corresponding decrease in the descent flow rate of those already on <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> While this is expected to have a negligible impact on <b>the</b> overall time <b>to</b> evacuate <b>the</b> building, the evacuation time for those higher up in the building is extended while those on the lower flows is reduced. It is thus suggested that in high-rise buildings, floors should be connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landing on <b>the</b> opposite side <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>stair.</b> Information of this type will allow engineers to better design stair–floor interfaces to meet specific design objectives...|$|R
