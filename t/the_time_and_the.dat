5|$|By 1927, a few roadways {{that are}} now part of M-64 were built and open to traffic. The road south of Marenisco was a county road at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> highway between Silver City and Ontonagon {{was a part of the}} western segment of M-35. By the {{beginning}} of 1930, a highway called M-129 was designated south of US2 to the Wisconsin state line and north along Lake Gogebic. By the end of the year, this road was renumbered as the southern section of M-64; the northern section of M-64 was the highway previously designated as the westernmost segment of M-35. The gap between the two sections was filled in by 1932. Some curves in the roadway south of Marenisco were realigned, smoothing out the routing of the highway in late 1961. As this project was completed, the last segments of M-64 were fully paved, making the highway one of the last in the state to be fully hard-surfaced.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{disagreements}} {{in management}} and poor communication, construction began on both routes. It was soon {{obvious that the}} southern route was unfeasible given the remote area, technology available at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rough terrain of the San Rafael Swell. The D spent $217,470 (1883, equivalent to $4.6million in 2007) on the project before declaring it a failure. One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad fired the lead surveyor, even though the workers had graded a path past the San Rafael Reef. This route today is a jeep trail. According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), had the southern route succeeded {{it would have been}} the shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished. The Toronto–Barrie Highway was {{the primary focus of}} the Department of Highways at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> onset of the Korean War in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design. Work on the most important link, the Toronto Bypass, began in 1951, but it would not open with that name.|$|E

5|$|In this {{situation}} one Ivaylo, {{a native of}} north-eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near Provadia, began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name Bardokva (lettuce) or Lakhanas (vegetable) and his real name is known only from a note, attached to the Svarlig gospel. The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated {{that he was a}} swineherd who took care of pigs for money. However, the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock product at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> possessor of a large herd could {{have been part of the}} elite of the local community. Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints. In fact, his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers. He came to be seen by many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour.|$|E

5|$|The Adelaide leak was {{the revelation}} {{to the press}} of a dressing-room {{incident}} during the third Test, a cricket match played during the 1932–33 Ashes series between Australia and England, more {{commonly known as the}} Bodyline series. During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by the managers of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. He said {{he did not want to}} speak to the Englishman owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter became public knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> players were horrified that the confrontation became public knowledge.|$|E

On the night of 4 February 1899, {{when most of the}} Filipino generals were at a ball in Malolos to celebrate the success of the American anti-imperialists delaying the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the Americans staged an incident along the concrete blockhouses in Santa Mesa near the Balsahan Bridge. An American patrol fired on Filipino troops, claiming afterwards that the Filipinos had started shooting first. The whole Filipino line from Pasay to Caloocan returned fire and the first battle of the Filipino-American War ensued. Two days later, in response to the incident, the US Senate voted for annexation. In doing so, the conflict became the war of conquest, occupation and annexation that Luna, Mabini, and others had predicted and about which they had warned Aguinaldo and his generals previously.|$|E
