5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|With Western Europe neutralised, the OKL and OKW {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Britain, which was now home to the Allied base of operations in Europe. Hitler hoped Britain would negotiate for an armistice, for which he was prepared to offer generous terms. The tentative offers made by Hitler were rejected by the Churchill coalition government. Hitler now ordered the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to prepare for an amphibious assault of Britain, codenamed Operation Sealion. The Luftwaffe was to eliminate enemy air power and the Kriegsmarine was ordered <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> necessary preparations for transporting the Heer (Army) across the English Channel. The Luftwaffe's task came first. Once the RAF had been rendered impotent, Göring and Hitler hoped that an invasion would be unnecessary. If this proved not to be the case, the Luftwaffe would then support the army and prevent the Royal Navy interdicting German sea traffic. Göring named the offensive against the RAF as Operation Eagle Attack (Adlerangriff).|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does {{not return to the}} origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E

25|$|In {{the series}} opener, Joe Kelly was rocked for 7 earned runs in 3 innings, leaving the Red Sox {{in a big}} hole due to Josh Donaldson's grand slam, but Brock Holt would hit a grand slam {{of his own and}} the Sox would win the game after a furious {{comeback}} effort. The next day, the Red Sox tagged knuckleballer R.A. Dickey for 7 runs to improve to 3-1. However, the Sox lost the third game of the series as two runs given up by Steven Wright in the first inning proved <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> difference as the Red Sox failed to score 6+ runs in a game {{for the first time this}} season.|$|E
25|$|The ruling junta led by Prayuth Chan-o-cha {{promised to}} hold new elections, but wants {{to enact a}} new {{constitution}} before the elections are held.

There was a 55% turnout of which around 61% voted in favour of the constitution. Under the new constitution an unelected person other than a member of parliament can be appointed as Prime Minister, which would open the post to a military official.

Two days later, when the Imperial army paraded for the archduke's inspection, Mélac believed that a relief army under Catinat was at hand and he made preparations to defend against an assault. When the French commander finally realized what was going on, the frustrated Mélac sent a message asking where Joseph's headquarters was located so he could bombard it. Joseph, whose headquarters was out of range anyway, replied that the Frenchman must do his duty. The archduke visited the siege lines and even aimed some of the cannon.

25|$|In United's next match, {{home cooking}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> difference, {{as the team}} won 3–2 on their return to RFK for United's first home match in 5 weeks. Playing at home in front of over 19,000 fans was {{probably}} a boost to the team, but an even bigger boost {{might have been the}} sight of the team's new striker tandem of Espindola and Saborio. The game started horribly for the home side as the Philadelphia Union scored in the first and fourth minute to take what might have seemed a commanding 2–0 lead. United began to claw their way back into the game as Saborio scored on his United debut, with a 37th minute volley of a Korb cross. The game was tied midway through the second half when Nick DeLeon finished a rebound of an Espindola shot. D.C. United finally went ahead on an Espindola header, with Chris Korb getting his second assist of the match. DeLeon's goal was his first in over a year in a regular season match.|$|E
25|$|Large {{public service}} rate increases, added to weak {{regulatory}} frameworks and constant renegotiation of concession contracts, brought outsized profits to the privatized companies. Between 1993 and 2000, the 200 largest companies in Argentina accumulated US$28.4 billion in profits, 56.8% {{of which were}} earned by privatized companies, and 26.3% by firms that had ties to those companies. Prices and wages were virtually frozen in Argentina from 1995 to 2001; but utility fees rose {{in line with the}} U.S. inflation rate, constituting an additional source of earnings for the newly privatized companies. The linking of public services fees charged in Argentina to the U.S. inflation rate enabled privatized companies to pocket US$9 billion by 2000. Additionally, privatized firms sent 70% of their earnings abroad while failing to pay the annual concession fees or <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> investments stipulated by the contracts. The companies also imported large quantities of inputs and goods produced by associated firms, contracting heavy trade debts in dollars while violating a law that required them to prioritize Argentine products when making purchases.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the critics}} of McCarthy's {{approach}} were his colleagues across the country at MIT.

In order to use ordinary concepts like [...] "chair" [...] or [...] "restaurant" [...] they had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> same illogical assumptions that people normally made.

500|$|The design effort {{produced}} {{a number of}} wooden models. A 24-inch long model, made of balsa wood, demonstrated placement of internal structure and access doors.

Engineers later encountered the same difficulty fabricating the prototype on the factory floor." [...] For early tests of the design, two ⅓-scale wooden mock-ups were constructed. One model, coated in metal foil, was used to verify ECHO 1's RCS calculations, while the other was earmarked for wind tunnel tests. Afterwards, a model {{was moved to the}} Grey Butte Range radar-testing facility in the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, which allowed more accurate tests of the aircraft's RCS. In the event, the aircraft's RCS level confirmed ECHO 1's predictions. This meant Ben Rich won a quarter from Johnson, who previously insisted that the D-21 had less RCS than Have Blue.|$|E
