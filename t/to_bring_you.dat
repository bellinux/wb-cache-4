Rolling Stone awarded her 1992's Best New Artist and Best Singer Songwriter and 1995's Artist of the Year, and listed Rid of Me, <b>To</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love (1995) and Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. In 2011, she was awarded for Outstanding Contribution To Music at the NME Awards. In June 2013, she was awarded an MBE for services to music.|$|E
500|$|As Harvey {{embarked}} on her solo career, she explored collaborations with other musicians. In 1995 she released her third studio album, <b>To</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love, featuring former bandmate John Parish, Bad Seeds multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and French drummer Jean-Marc Butty, {{all of whom}} would continue to perform and record with Harvey throughout her career. The album was also her first material to be produced by Flood. Simultaneously a more blues-influenced and more futuristic record than its predecessors, <b>To</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love showcased Harvey broadening her musical style to include strings, organs and synthesisers. Rolling Stone said in its review that [...] "Harvey sings the blues like Nick Cave sings gospel: with more distortion, sex and murder than you remember. <b>To</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love was a towering goth version of grunge." [...] During the successive tours for the album, Harvey also experimented with her image and stage persona.|$|E

It also ranked sixth on the Village Voices Pazz & Jop poll, and 20th on Spins list.|$|E

500|$|She is {{also known}} for {{changing}} her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to {{all aspects of the}} album, from the album art to the live performances. She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of <b>To</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed [...] "Joan Crawford on acid" [...] in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that [...] "it's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty." [...] However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, [...] "that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I had no sense of self left at all", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the <b>To</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love tour.|$|E

[...] The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, [...] "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. [...] She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God." ...|$|E

Shepherd, a former Navy SEAL, said during the change over ceremony: [...] "May the good will, spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure. Sail her well." [...] The commander of Discovery, Jim Wetherbee, said [...] ""For Captain Shepherd and his crew, we hold you in admiration as we prepare <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> home.

500|$|In 1996, {{following}} the international success of <b>To</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love and other collaborations, Harvey began composing material {{that would end}} up on her fourth studio album, during what she referred to as [...] "an incredibly low patch." [...] The material diverged significantly from her former work and introduced electronica elements into her song-writing. During recording sessions in 1997 original PJ Harvey Trio drummer Rob Ellis rejoined Harvey's band, and Flood was hired again as producer. The sessions, which continued into April the following year, resulted in Is This Desire? (1998). Though originally released to mixed reviews in September 1998, the album was a success and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance. The album's lead single, [...] "A Perfect Day Elise," [...] was moderately successful in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart, her most successful single to date.|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 1947, {{serialisation}} of {{the story}} paused after Hergé disappeared. Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a mental breakdown {{as a result of}} overwork, and to recover he spent time in retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. In a letter to his wife Germaine, Hergé wrote, [...] "Life has spoilt me... I no longer draw like I breathe, as I used to not so long ago. Tintin is no longer me... my Boy Scout spirit has been badly damaged." [...] He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of Tintin magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that [...] "Our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don't worry, he's fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> a new episode of The Temple of the Sun each week, our friend is a little over-worked." [...] He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to biographer Pierre Assouline he was accompanied by a young, married woman, with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.|$|E
