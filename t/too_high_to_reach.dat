50|$|The {{popularity}} of the Metroidvania genre is stated to be tied to {{the ease with which}} platformer games can be learned and mastered, while giving the player a character that they can grow {{over the course of the}} game. Many developers of independent Metroidvania titles cited the exploration as a core element of the genre that draws in players, working off the natural human instincts to explore, and giving the players the sense of discovery and self-control during the game. Donald Mustard of Chair Entertainment, the creators of Shadow Complex, stated that a good Metroidvania helps the player come to epiphanies that enables them to progress in the game, describing an example of a ledge that initially <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach,</b> and as the player acquires abilities, will discover how they can reach that ledge on their own.|$|E

However, nobody thought to lower the ladder to re-board the ship, and so everyone (except the baby) is trapped in the water with only two masks, a dive knife, and a toy dolphin float. Despite their efforts, the side of the yacht is too smooth to climb and the deck is <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach.</b> They see a boat of teenagers heading towards them. The group try to grab their attention, but the teenagers think that they are just greeting them, and sail off.

The phone accidentally gets knocked in the water.|$|E
50|$|The game's {{main focus}} is on {{exploration}} and classic adventure game object interaction: examining and collecting objects and using them to solve puzzles. These mostly involve finding keys or other objects that can either be used by themselves or in combination {{with each other to}} solve certain problems. In addition to these standard inventory based puzzles, Overture also offers several physics based puzzles where certain objects must be moved or manipulated in real time. Environmental objects such as doors, desk drawers, and switches on machinery must be opened or manipulated using realistic movements mirroring their use in the real world, and certain obstructions can only be cleared by utilizing certain objects in a specific way; for example, in order to solve one of the game's puzzles a player may choose to stack boxes and barrels in such a manner as to allow for the player to be able to leap past an obstacle, such as an electrical fence, or to reach a certain area normally <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach.</b>|$|E

30|$|In summary, a {{successful}} hydrodeoxygenation was achieved, {{in terms of}} yield of deoxygenated oil phase and deoxygenation degree. However, the expansion with CO 2 did not improve the deoxygenation degree. Despite the rheological and volumetric properties changed at lower temperatures, no significant GXL effect on the HDO reaction could be observed. Classical GXL catalysis is usually performed under milder conditions. We suspect that the chosen temperature was <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> a significant physical enhancement. Therefore these pioneer experiments were a useful contribution to find the limits in the process conditions for an effective gas expansion. We suspect the GXL effect to more intense at lower temperatures. Further studies will check this theory. However, no negative effect could be observed, except an indirect decrease of the hydrogenation reactions due to the lower partial pressure of hydrogen.|$|E

Namely, computation time in robotic applications is often <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> good solution, for parts of the kinematic chain; the problem of inverse kinematics is not linear, as rotations are involved.

40|$|I {{am going}} to talk about pulsed {{high-power}} rf generation for normal-conducting electron and positron linacs suitable for application to high-energy physics in the Next Linear Collider, or NLC. The talk will cover some basic rf system design issues, klystrons and other microwave power sources, rf pulse-compression devices, and test facilities for system-integration studies. NLC RF SYSTEM DESIGN ISSUES The NLC, as envisioned at SLAC, KEK, IHEP, DESY, and CERN, is a phased-development for electron-positron colliding-beam linacs starting at 250 GeV per beam (five times SLC), which is <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> with a circular machine. The ultimate goal is to reach 500 to 750 GeV per: * beam (10 to 15 times SLC) after upgrades to the rf system. The rf power required to achieve even the phase-one goal-exceeds the capabilities of presently available accelerator rf systems. The magnitude of the rf requirement is illustrated by Table 1 for the existing SLAC Linear Collider (SLC), and for the NLC prpposals being discussed by the DESY-_-.

40|$|Thirteen {{years of}} Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface albedo {{data for the}} Northern Hemisphere during the spring months (March–May) were {{analyzed}} to determine temporal and spatial changes over snow-covered land surfaces. Tendencies in land surface albedo change north of 50 ° N were analyzed using data on snow cover fraction, air temperature, vegetation index and precipitation. To this end, the study domain was divided into six smaller areas, based on their geographical position and climate similarity. Strong differences were observed between these areas. As expected, snow cover fraction (SCF) has a strong influence on the albedo {{in the study area}} and can explain 56 % of variation of albedo in March, 76 % in April and 92 % in May. Therefore the effects of other parameters were investigated only for areas with 100 % SCF. The second largest driver for snow-covered land surface albedo changes is the air temperature when it exceeds a value between − 15 and − 10 °C, depending on the region. At monthly mean air temperatures below this value no albedo changes are observed. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and precipitation amount and frequency were independently examined as possible candidates to explain observed changes in albedo for areas with 100 % SCF. Amount and frequency of precipitation were identified to influence the albedo over some areas in Eurasia and North America, but no clear effects were observed in other areas. EVI is positively correlated with albedo in Chukotka Peninsula and negatively in eastern Siberia. For other regions the spatial variability of the correlation fields is <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> any conclusions...|$|E

At Vicksburg, Mississippi he found that the bluffs were <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reached</b> by the guns of his fleet, so he ordered Porter to bring his mortar flotilla up. The mortars suppressed the Rebel artillery well enough that Farragut's ships could pass the batteries at Vicksburg and link up with a Union flotilla coming down from the north. The city could not be taken, however, without active participation by the army, which did not happen. On July 8, the bombardment ceased when Porter was ordered to Hampton Roads to assist in Major General George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign. A few days later, Farragut followed, and the first attempt to take Vicksburg was over.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} phase {{transition}} from dense baryonic matter to dense quark matter within the large-N_c limit. By using simple constant {{speed of sound}} equations of state for the two phases, we derive the scaling with N_c of the critical quark chemical potential μ_c^crit for this phase transition. While quark matter is strongly suppressed at large N_c, the phase transition at a large but finite density could nevertheless be important to determine the maximum mass of compact stars. In particular, in the range 3 ≤ N_c≲ 5. 5 the quark phase would take place in compact stars and {{would lead to the}} formation of an unstable branch of hybrid stars. As a consequence, the maximum mass is restricted to the range 2. 1 M_<M_max< 3 M_. For larger value of N_c, the phase transition would occur at densities <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reached</b> in the core of compact stars. However, the very requirement that it occurs (although at a very large density) translates into interesting constraints on the stiffness of the baryonic phase: its speed of sound must exceed √(1 / 3).

40|$|International audience[1] More {{than four}} years of VLF {{electric}} field data recorded by DEMETER have been analyzed, in order to monitor the first cutoff frequency (QTM 1) of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, at around 1. 6 – 1. 8 kHz. Since losses in a waveguide are maximized right at the cutoff frequency, DEMETER ($ 700 km orbit) can detect the minimum of energy of the leaking fields coming from the waveguide. This measurement permits to draw a global map of its value (f 1), which {{is directly related to}} the effective height of the ionosphere (h) by the relation f 1 = c/ 2 h (c is the speed of light). It enables the remote sensing of the D region, which is one of the less known layers of the ionosphere, because it is too low for satellites to orbit inside it and <b>too</b> <b>high</b> for balloons <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> it. The effective height depends mainly on the electron density (N e) and neutral density (N n) profiles, which determine the plasma frequency and the electron mobility. The effective height shifts downward 5 – 10 km in southern warm season in the South Pacific Ocean. Another effect is observed in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans; the effective height decreases its value twice a year, in the area of roughly AE 15 from the geomagnetic equator. The main causes for the changes on the effective reflection height are the solar radiation and the thunderstorm activity. However, the observed shifts are more prominent over the oceans, and a possible explanation for this difference could be attributed to i) less polluted conditions above the oceans (aerosols change the atmospheric conductivity and then the global atmospheric electric circuit), ii) the effect of the current associated to the thunderclouds on the bottom of the ionosphere because thunderstorms are much more numerous above land, or iii) ionization by elves because their occurrence is larger above oceans...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to gain deeper {{understanding}} of how older patrons (65 years of age and above) experien- ce the Stockholm Public Library: how the older patrons use the library, experience information about events and programs; experiences in contact with librarians; how user-friendly they find the library and what might attract or detract visits. The study consists of qualitative interviews with five older patrons of the Stockholm Public Lib- rary who were approached during a library visit. The study also contains interviews with two librarians from the library. The interviews have been transcribed and the results are organized into six areas: using the library and its services; digital aspects of the library; contact with librarians; the library space in a user-friendly context; the cultural value of the library building; library programmes; events and programs. The theoretical framework of the study is that of sociologist and philosopher Zygmunt Bauman and his ide- as about the individualised society and consumerism. Bauman's thoughts on the individualised society where on- ly the desired consumers are welcome even in public spaces have also been included. These theories are combi- ned with research on how society views aging and older people, international studies and studies on older pa- trons and libraries in Sweden. This study finds that a main issue in accessing the library's services and material is how they are placed: shelves that are <b>too</b> <b>high</b> or low <b>to</b> <b>reach,</b> and problems with finding material without help. The patrons are drawn to places where books are exposed, whether on purpose or not. The study concludes with the suggestion of crea- ting national guidelines for how libraries can make their spaces more welcoming to older patrons, such as ex- isting guidelines in the U. S. And Australia. Previous research shows the mere existance of guidelines may high- light the issue in itself and create a helpful start for libraries wanting to accommodate older patrons better...|$|R
