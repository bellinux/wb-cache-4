5|$|The {{immediate}} {{response of the}} British was a two-hour cannon barrage at <b>the</b> <b>heights,</b> which had no effect because the British guns could not reach the American guns at such height. After {{the failure of the}} barrage, Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must be removed from <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> if they were to hold Boston. They planned an assault on the heights; however, due to a storm the attack never took place, and the British elected instead to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders on top of <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> were stunned {{to see so many}} French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of <b>the</b> <b>heights.</b> To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E
5|$|After {{scattering}} the Americans at Kip's Bay, Howe landed 9,000 more troops, but did {{not immediately}} cut off the American retreat from New York Town {{in the south of}} the island. Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the westside of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4:00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on <b>the</b> <b>Heights</b> by nightfall.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> maximum <b>height</b> of <b>the</b> caving zone was 9.0  m, {{which was}} 7.5 times of <b>the</b> mining <b>height.</b> <b>The</b> rock {{blocks in the}} caving zone were irregularly shaped. <b>The</b> <b>height</b> of mining-induced {{fractures}} was from 8.0 to 30  m, 7.5 – 25 times of <b>the</b> mining <b>height.</b> <b>The</b> bed separation fractures in the lower fracture zone were obvious. The fracture zone was about 65 ° upward from the face to goaf direction. <b>The</b> <b>height</b> of <b>the</b> longitudinal fractures was 4 – 20 times of <b>the</b> mining <b>height.</b> <b>The</b> <b>height</b> of <b>the</b> lateral fractures was 20 – 25 times of <b>the</b> mining <b>height.</b> <b>The</b> bending zone was above the fracture zone. <b>The</b> <b>height</b> of <b>the</b> bending zone was more than 25 times of <b>the</b> mining <b>height.</b> <b>The</b> rock strata movement in bending zone was observed to be continuous. Generally, the stress-relieved coal seam was usually dominated by transverse fractures and swelled longitudinally. There was no longitudinal fracture between bending zone and fracture zone.|$|R
5|$|Both Burgoyne and Arnold {{understood}} {{the importance of}} the American left, and the need to control <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> there. After the morning fog lifted around 10 am, Burgoyne ordered the army to advance in three columns. Baron Riedesel led the left column, consisting of the German troops and the 47th Foot, on the river road, bringing the main artillery and guarding supplies and the boats on the river. General James Inglis Hamilton commanded the center column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd regiments, which would attack <b>the</b> <b>heights,</b> and General Simon Fraser led the right wing with the 24th Regiment and the light infantry and grenadier companies, to turn the American left flank by negotiating the heavily wooded high ground north and west of Bemis Heights.|$|E
5|$|Buxton was {{developed}} by the Dukes of Devonshire as a genteel health resort in the 18th century. It has an opera house and theatre, museum and art gallery. Poole's Cavern is a show cave.

5|$|During almost {{continuous}} rain on 8 December, Jerusalem {{ceased to}} be protected by the Ottoman Empire. Chetwode (commander of XX Corps), who had relieved Bulfin (commander of XXI Corps), launched the final advance taking <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> {{to the west of}} Jerusalem on 8 December. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated during the evening and the city surrendered the following day.|$|E
5000|$|Hanging pot racks come {{in various}} heights. There are three {{measurements}} {{needed in order}} to install a hanging pot rack. First is <b>the</b> reaching <b>height,</b> or <b>the</b> <b>height</b> where it is comfortable for a person to reach. Most people want to hang a pot rack at a comfortable reaching height. This height is usually about one foot above <b>the</b> <b>height</b> of a person's head and this is where the pots should be located. The second measurement needed is <b>the</b> <b>height</b> of <b>the</b> ceiling. The third measurement is <b>the</b> <b>height</b> of <b>the</b> pot rack with <b>the</b> hooks. <b>The</b> <b>height</b> of <b>the</b> ceiling minus <b>the</b> reaching <b>height</b> is <b>the</b> required <b>height</b> of <b>the</b> pot rack and chains.|$|R

50|$|Algorithm: Let the {{numerator}} equals to <b>the</b> <b>height</b> of pole {{multiplied by}} the separation of poles, let denominator be the difference of ofsets, add the quotient to <b>the</b> <b>height</b> of pole to obtain <b>the</b> <b>height</b> of island.|$|R
5|$|Highrise {{development}} has slowed since the 1970s and mainly {{in recent years}} because of enforcements imposed by the Civil Aviation Authority on <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> of buildings as they could affect aircraft from the Airport (e.g. Beetham Tower).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to legislative reform, the breaching of coastal flood defense systems during Vera prompted a redesign of such mechanisms. In Nagoya, regulation {{was created for}} coastal construction and their heights. Development of flood defenses in Ise, Osaka, and Tokyo bays was also set into motion. <b>The</b> <b>heights</b> of such defense systems were based on worst-case scenarios and maximum storm surge heights caused by the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{an attack on the}} undefended Maryland side of the Potomac, Brigadier General John G. Barnard, chief {{engineer}} of the Department of Washington, directed that several forts be constructed on the Congress Heights {{in order to protect the}} Navy Yard and Washington Arsenal from bombardment. At the crucial western end of <b>the</b> <b>Heights</b> would be the then-unnamed Fort Greble.|$|E
5000|$|Undulation of the geoid is the {{mathematical}} process of determining <b>the</b> <b>height</b> in metres above the geoid (relative to the {{mean sea level}}) from <b>the</b> <b>height</b> provided by <b>the</b> GPS system which uses the (WGS84) ellipsoid as reference. In maps and common use <b>the</b> <b>height</b> over <b>the</b> mean sea level is used to indicate <b>the</b> <b>height</b> of elevations while <b>the</b> ellipsoidal <b>height</b> results from <b>the</b> restrictions that apply for the GPS system.|$|R

5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with {{an abundance of}} deer. Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer would be when they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in <b>the</b> <b>heights.</b> Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French {{communication}} line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite <b>the</b> <b>Heights.</b> According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from <b>the</b> <b>Heights</b> they would launch a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February Mendizabal withdrew {{most of his}} {{men from}} Badajoz, leaving behind a 7,000-strong garrison. The field army's 9,000 {{infantry}} settled on <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> of San Cristóbal while the 3,000 horse encamped behind them on the plains of the Caya. The Spanish commander again ignored Wellington's plan, failing to dig entrenchments on <b>the</b> <b>heights,</b> nor did he send out a cavalry screen to protect his front and monitor the French movements. Soult, however, largely ignored the Spanish army {{for the next few}} days, concentrating instead on building up his siege lines and battering Badajoz. Heavy rains also flooded both the Guadiana and Gebora rivers, rendering them impassable, so that between 11–18 February the French were only able to shell {{the southern end of the}} Spanish line, pushing the Spaniards further away from Badajoz and the protection of the San Cristóbal fort.|$|E

5|$|The 22nd {{spent the}} next day, December 15, {{in the city of}} Fredericksburg, hearing rumors that Burnside {{intended}} to personally lead another assault on <b>the</b> <b>heights.</b> But no attack materialized, night came, and the V Corps crossed the pontoon bridges back to Falmouth, with the 22nd acting as rear guard. During the battle of Frederickburg, the 22nd lost 12 killed and 42 wounded, roughly 28 percent casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Anzacs {{were confronted}} by a treacherous, {{confusing}} tangle of ravines and spurs that descended from <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> of the Sarı Baır range to the sea. The landing was only lightly opposed by scattered Turkish units until Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division and perceiving {{the threat posed by}} the landings, rushed reinforcements to the area in what became a race for the high ground. The contest for <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> was decided on the second ridge line where the Anzacs and Turks fought over a knoll called Baby 700. The position changed hands a number of times on the first day before the Turks, having the advantage of the higher ground on Battleship Hill, took final possession of it. Once the Anzac advance was checked, the Turks counter-attacked, trying to force the invaders back to the shore, but failed to dislodge them from the foothold they had gained. A trench perimeter quickly developed and a bloody stalemate ensued until August.|$|E
5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} the North Korean {{line and}} forced {{them back on}} all fronts. On 16 September, however, 25th Infantry Division was still fighting North Korean forces behind its lines, and North Korean strong points existed on <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> of Battle Mountain, P'il-bong, and Sobuk-san. Kean felt that the division could advance along the roads toward Chinju only when the mountainous center of the division front was clear. He therefore believed {{that the key to}} the advance of the 25th Division lay in its center where the North Koreans held <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> and kept the 24th Infantry Regiment under daily attack. The 27th Infantry on the left and the 35th Infantry on the right, astride the roads between Chinju and Masan held their positions and could not advance until the situation in front of the 24th Infantry improved.|$|E
