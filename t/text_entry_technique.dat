40|$|This {{thesis is}} dealing with the design and {{evaluation}} of a novel <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> that is accessible to visually impaired users. The technique is specifically designed for touchscreen interaction on smart small mobile devices that are becoming very widespread. Already developed techniques cannot offer a comprehensive and fast solution for blind text entry, because they cannot overcome the speed-accuracy trade-off. The developed blind <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> described here, named Gesture Driven Software Button (GDSB) has two built-in modes that allow both concurrent and sequential text entry. The concurrent mode allows a typing speed in the range of 16 - 20 wpm after two hours of training, in the blind condition. The sequential mode used an adaptive dwell time interaction that accesses the three layers of the character layout with the use of waiting time. This mode also allows single-hand manipulation that enhances the universal appeal of the GDSB. Core characteristics of the technique are: its constricted size, robustness, structuredness and simplicity of interaction. The GDSB uses simple tap and slide interaction, and it is transparent, meaning that it does not occupy any display area because it is not needed to be visible. To determine the usability and the performance of the developed technique, three tests were carried out, with the participation of 44 subjects in total. The finger interaction with desktop touchscreen monitor was investigated in the pilot test and the results have been used when designing the advanced version of <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> for stylus-based interaction in smart mobile devices. Because of the positive results received after the first test, a second test was arranged for stylus-based interaction on a PDA. Results of the first test were reconfirmed by the second, and a series of new findings was revealed. The overall results of the testing showed that the technique is indeed having real interaction advantages and with its comfortable typing speed it can be an all around text entry solution for mobile devices for both sighted and blind users.

40|$|With the {{increased}} use of mobile phones, interest in text entry with them has also amplified. Many new mobile phones are equipped with a QWERTY keypad; new methods to surpass the QWERTY performance are also being developed. This thesis compares user performance of virtual QWERTY keypad to MessagEase. MessagEase uses 9 keys and can therefore be used even on very small touch displays. 9 characters are entered with tapping and the rest with a tap-and-slide gesture. An experiment was conducted with 10 participants transcribing text with both text entry techniques. The experiment consisted of three sessions. In each session, the participants transcribed 30 phrases in total - 15 phrases using each <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>technique.</b> Responses to the System Usability Scale (SUS) for each <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> and informal interview data were also collected. From a Repeated-measures analysis of variance a significant effect of the text entry method on text entry rate was seen (F 1, 19 = 47. 140, p < 0. 0001). The effect of the session (i. e. learning) was also statistically significant (F 2, 18 = 3. 631, p = 0. 047). The interaction of the session and method was also statistically significant (F 2, 18 = 10. 286, p = 0. 001) indicating different learning rates.

40|$|Mobile {{information}} technologies are theoretically {{well suited to}} digitally accommodate the informal note taking task wherewith the notes often recorded quickly and under less than ideal circumstances. Unfortunately, user adoption of mobile support for informal note taking has been hindered {{in large part by}} slow <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>techniques.</b> Building on research confirming people's ability to read erroneous text and effectively use incomplete external retrieval cues, this dissertation investigated the effects of two modifications to Graffiti-based <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> with the goal of overcoming the barriers associated with current <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> solutions: disabling <b>text</b> correction and disabling visual feedback. As expected, both modifications improved <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> speed but also resulted in more errors in the resulting text which hindered the users' ability to recognize the words they had recorded. To address this decrease in recognizability, a multi-approach note enhancement mechanism was introduced. When this algorithm was applied to a set of particularly challenging erroneous notes, study participants were able to correctly recognize 56 % more of the words in the notes. In a formal evaluation study with 75 participants, the proposed approach of discouraging user-initiated error correction during note taking, enhancing the resulting erroneous notes, and facilitating recall with enhanced alternative lists, was confirmed to increase the note taking speed by 47 % without any negative impact on the participants' ability to recall important details about the scenarios which prompted the note taking activities. This research highlighted the importance of shifting the focus from accuracy to recallability when examining the overall efficacy of informal notes. With some easily implemented modifications to existing <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>techniques,</b> combined with a note enhancement algorithm which leverages information about the errors users make and the types of errors users are more likely to overcome, a significant improvement in user performance was achieved.

40|$|<b>Text</b> <b>entry</b> is a {{vital part}} of {{operating}} a mobile device, and is often done using a virtual keyboard such as QWERTY. <b>Text</b> <b>entry</b> using the virtual keyboard often faces difficulties, as the size of a single button is small and intangible, which can lead to high error rates and low <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> speed. This thesis reports a user experiment of two novel tilting-based <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>techniques</b> with and without button press for key selection. The experiment focused on two main issues: 1) the performance of the tilting-based methods in comparison to the current commonly used reference method, the virtual QWERTY keyboard; and 2) evaluation of subjective satisfaction of the novel methods. The experiment was conducted using TEMA software running on an Android smartphone with a relativity small screen size. All writing was done with one hand only. The participants were able to comprehend and learn to use the new methods without any major problems. The development of <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> skill with the new methods was clear, as the mean <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> rates improved by 63 - 80 percent. The reference method QWERTY remained fastest of the three throughout the experiment. The tilting-based technique with key press for selection had the lowest total error rate {{at the end of the}} experiment, closely followed by QWERTY.

The popularity of mobile devices with large screens is making single-handed interaction difficult. We propose and evaluate a novel design point around a tilt-based <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> which supports single handed usage. Our technique is based on the gesture keyboard (shape writing). However, instead of drawing gestures with a finger or stylus, users articulate a gesture by tilting the device.

A pilot longitudinal study reveals that a single participant achieved an entry rate of 32 wpm after approximate 90 minutes of practice. Our data indicate that tilt-based gesture keyboard entry enables walk-up use and provides a suitable text entry rate for occasional use and can act as a promising alternative to single-handed typing in certain situations.

3000|$|Tilt-based <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>techniques,</b> {{which are}} of {{particular}} importance in this work, were firstly addressed by Unigesture[4], TiltType[5], and TiltText[6] prototypes. The Unigesture system relies on specially developed hardware, and uses a zone-based keyboard layout with characters grouped into eight input zones, hence abandoning the QWERTY outline. Each zone, containing 4 characters at most, corresponds to a distinct tilt direction. When using the Unigesture approach, individual letters are not inputted directly, but a word is predicted by an inference engine, basing on zones been [...] "visited" [...] in the tilting sequence. TiltType was designed for small watch-like devices and requires a two-hand interaction. Its interface is multimodal, since character selection requires both button pressing (for letter group selection) and device tilting (for the desired letter pick). Just like in the Unigesture prototype, zone-based keyboard layout and tilts with eight compass directions are used. The TiltText system is a tilt-to-write solution with multimodal interaction that augments <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> on the standard 12 -button keypads with multiple letters mapped to a particular key. The MultiTap technique, regularly used for character disambiguation in such designs, is replaced with tilt support: selection of a character is achieved by pressing a key followed by tilting the phone {{in one of the}} four directions.|$|R
