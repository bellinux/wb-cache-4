50|$|Assume two biased coins, {{the first}} with {{probability}} p of <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> heads {{and the second}} with probability q > p of <b>turning</b> <b>up</b> heads. Intuitively, if both coins are tossed {{the same number of}} times, the first coin should <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> fewer heads than the second one. More specifically, for any fixed k, the probability that the first coin produces at least k heads should be less than the probability that the second coin produces at least k heads. However proving such a fact can be difficult with a standard counting argument. Coupling easily circumvents this problem.|$|R
