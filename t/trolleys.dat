5|$|As {{the city}} became {{increasingly}} congested further {{means of transportation}} were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn <b>trolleys.</b> These, in turn, were replaced by electric <b>trolleys</b> that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse The trolley cars {{did not last long}} as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.|$|E
5|$|The third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was {{completed}} in 1886. In 1890, <b>trolleys</b> began operations. In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which {{is now known as}} the North Shore.|$|E
5|$|After the war trains faced {{competition}} from aviation and automobiles, and serving <b>trolleys</b> were installed on Norwegian trains. In 1965 cart service on trains was centralised and standardised; food service was faster, and prices were lowered. During the 1970s cafeteria cars were used, where passengers could serve themselves.|$|E

50|$|A Rail push <b>trolley</b> {{or simply}} a push-trolley is a hand-pushed <b>trolley</b> used to inspect the rails and other {{track-side}} railway infrastructure. It is a simple <b>trolley,</b> pushed by two or four persons (called trolleymen), with hand brakes to stop the <b>trolley.</b> When the <b>trolley</b> slows down, two trolleymen jump off the <b>trolley,</b> and push it till it picks up speed. Then they jump into the <b>trolley</b> again, and the cycle continues. The trolleymen take turns in pushing the <b>trolley</b> so that the speed is maintained and two persons do not get tired. Four persons are also required to safely lift the <b>trolley</b> off the rail tracks when a train approaches.|$|R
5|$|At 4:00a.m. on August 1, 1944 most <b>trolleys,</b> {{buses and}} subways in Philadelphia stopped running. Strike {{agitators}} blocked access to PTC depos with vehicles and advised the arriving workers of a sickout strike. By noon of August 1 the entire PTC transportation system was paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were moved}} {{on a system}} of wheeled <b>trolleys</b> running on Décauville rails that extended throughout each half-hangar to the quarterdeck {{at the rear of}} the ship. The torpedo bombers would be moved to the quarterdeck where their wings would be extended and then they would be lowered into the water by the large crane at the very stern of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Norsk Spisevognselskap A/S, often {{abbreviated}} NSS or shortened to Spisevognselskapet, was a Norwegian {{state enterprise}} which operated restaurant carriages on Norwegian trains and restaurants at railway stations and railway hotels. The company {{was established in}} December 1918, and started a catering service in 1919. Originally owned by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, it was acquired by the state in 1926. Meals served in the restaurant carriages were relatively expensive, although they were available to all passengers. In the 1950s, the company began using serving <b>trolleys</b> on trains.|$|E

50|$|The Williamsburg Bridge <b>Trolley</b> Terminal, {{also called}} the Essex Street <b>Trolley</b> Terminal or Delancey Street <b>Trolley</b> Terminal, is a former <b>trolley</b> {{terminal}} located underground adjacent to the Essex Street subway station in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Passenger <b>trolley</b> service operated through the terminal from 1908 until 1948 when <b>trolley</b> service over the Williamsburg Bridge ended. The station was constructed with balloon loops for turning around streetcars after they crossed over the Williamsburg Bridge to send them back to Brooklyn.|$|R
5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means of communication with his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. Fortunately for the British, Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle the radar equipment, placing the pieces on specially designed <b>trolleys.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{the mid-19th}} century, the Washington area had been {{served by a}} variety of private bus lines and {{streetcar}} services, including extensions of Northern Virginia <b>trolleys.</b> Over time, most were absorbed into the Capital Transit Company, formed on December 1, 1933, by the amalgamation of the Washington Railway, Capital Traction, and Washington Rapid Transit. Financier Louis Wolfson acquired the company in 1949 but had his franchise revoked in 1955 amidst a crippling strike. Congress then awarded a 20-year concession to O. Roy Chalk on the condition that he replace the city's remaining streetcars with buses by 1963. The company was thereafter known as DC Transit.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} manned, from 07:00 to 22:00 on weekdays, with reduced opening hours on weekends. The {{platform}} (but {{not necessarily the}} trains) are wheelchair accessible, and an escort service for disabled persons can be prebooked. Baggage <b>trolleys</b> are available, and {{a wide selection of}} services, including cafes, kiosks, banks and police, are available at the airport terminal, as are taxis. A single local bus route, Ruter no. 855, also serves the airport from Kløfta, Jessheim and Maura. There are many coaches {{from all parts of the}} country that also serve the airport, as well as coach services to Oslo operated by Flybussekspressen and SAS Ground Services.|$|E
50|$|The Shore Line <b>Trolley</b> Museum {{was founded}} in 1945 as the Branford Electric Railway Association (BERA). The Branford Electric Railway Association was founded to {{preserve}} the heritage of the <b>trolley</b> car, as well as artifacts and documents from the <b>trolley</b> era. The museum holds nearly one hundred <b>trolley</b> vehicles. The Shore Line <b>Trolley</b> Museum, just past the East Haven Green, operates the Branford Electric Railway, a National Historic Site. The railway is the oldest continuously operating suburban <b>trolley</b> line in the United States.|$|R
5|$|There was a {{transfer}} from the Coney Island Terminal to the Norton's Point <b>Trolley</b> to Sea Gate, via an elevated footbridge across Stillwell Avenue to the elevated <b>trolley</b> station. In 1948, the <b>trolley</b> was discontinued because it duplicated another <b>trolley</b> along a similar route (namely the McDonald Avenue Line). The <b>trolley</b> ramp spanning Stillwell Avenue and West 15th Street was torn down around this time.|$|R
5000|$|The Seashore <b>Trolley</b> Museum, {{located in}} Kennebunkport, Maine, United States, is the world's {{oldest and largest}} museum of mass transit vehicles. While {{the main focus of}} the {{collection}} is <b>trolley</b> cars (trams), it also includes rapid transit trains, <b>trolley</b> buses, and motor buses. The Seashore <b>Trolley</b> Museum is owned and operated by the New England Electric Railway Historical Society (NEERHS). [...] Of the museum's collection of more than 250 vehicles, ten <b>trolley</b> and railroad cars that historically operated in Maine were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, as Maine <b>Trolley</b> Cars.|$|R
5|$|Far Rockaway station {{itself was}} {{originally}} {{built by the}} Far Rockaway Branch Railroad, {{a subsidiary of the}} South Side Railroad of Long Island. Construction on the line began in September 1868, and the station was opened on July 29, 1869. The station was later converted into a freight house, when a second station was moved from Ocean Point Station (a.k.a. Cedarhurst Station), remodeled, and opened on October 1, 1881. The third depot opened on July 15, 1890, while the second depot was sold and moved to a private location in October 1890. The surface station featured a large plaza and depot, serving horse-drawn carriages, taxis, and surface <b>trolleys.</b> The Ocean Electric Railway terminated at the station between 1897 and September 2, 1926, and the station served as the headquarters for the Ocean Electric Railway.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{automotive}} industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city <b>trolleys</b> had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued {{that this was a}} deliberate destruction of streetcars {{as part of a larger}} strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy Plaza, in {{downtown}} Providence, {{serves as a}} transportation hub for local public transit {{as well as a}} departure point for Peter Pan and Greyhound bus lines. Public transit is managed by Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). Through RIPTA alone Kennedy Plaza serves over 71,000 people a day. The majority of the area covered by RIPTA is served by traditional buses. Of particular note is the East Side Trolley Tunnel running under College Hill, the use of which is reserved for RIPTA buses. RIPTA also operates the Providence LINK, a system of tourist <b>trolleys</b> {{in downtown}} Providence. From 2000 to 2008, RIPTA operated a seasonal ferry to Newport between May and October. In 2016 SeaStreak began operating the Providence – Newport ferry route. RIPTA began a rapid bus service called the R Line in June 2014.|$|E
25|$|Electric <b>trolley</b> buses {{operate on}} major routes {{in the city}} of Vancouver, with one route {{extending}} to neighbouring Burnaby. Most <b>trolley</b> bus routes operate in a north–south direction. <b>Trolley</b> buses receive electricity from a network of overhead wires. In the fall of 2006, TransLink introduced a new generation of electric <b>trolley</b> buses, replacing the old models built in the early 1980s. The new <b>trolley</b> buses have low floors and are fully wheelchair accessible.|$|R

5|$|When {{conceived}} {{in the nineteenth}} century, the electric fire engine was proposed to replace the steam fire engine in use at the time. It was to be constructed {{in such a way}} that it would use a supply of electrical power that came from a central station whereby electricity could be distributed to various covered stations and city supply points. This would require underground or overhead wiring similar to that used for electric light, <b>trolleys,</b> and other power users of the time. It was thought that the wiring could supply electricity to various outlet posts at strategic places throughout a city or fire protected district. These outlets would supply the necessary current to the fire-engine's electric motor. The vehicle itself was to be hauled by horses and would consist of a carriage wagon with an electric motor-powered water pump permanently mounted atop. There would be cables from the motor that would connect to the outlet post to obtain the required supply of electrical current.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Culver Line {{was opened}} by the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad {{and was named}} after the railroad's builder, Andrew N. Culver. The line ran along the surface of McDonald Avenue (then Gravesend Avenue) from Greenwood Cemetery (where it connected with horse car lines including the Vanderbilt Avenue Line, operated by the PP until 1886) to the Culver Depot in Coney Island, on June 25, 1875. The PP began serving the Union Depot at 36th Street, where transfer {{could be made to}} the Fifth Avenue Elevated, on June 7, 1890, by using the Prospect Park and South Brooklyn Railroad from a junction at Parkville. During a period of Long Island Rail Road control, from 1893 to 1899, a ramp at 36th Street was opened in 1895, allowing Brooklyn Elevated Railroad trains to operate over the Culver Line to Coney Island. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), by then the owner of the Brooklyn Elevated, leased the Culver Line (to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad) on June 18, 1899, and began using it to take not only elevated trains but also <b>trolleys</b> to Coney Island.|$|E
5|$|As part of Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, {{between the}} city and the BRT, a three-track {{elevated}} railway was built above the Culver Line from the Fifth Avenue Elevated southeast and south to Coney Island. At Ninth Avenue, the elevated replacements for the Culver Line and West End Line met, with access from both lines to the Fifth Avenue Elevated and Fourth Avenue Subway to the northwest. At 3:00a.m. on March 16, 1919, the first portion of the new elevated structure opened from Ninth Avenue southeast and south to Kings Highway. Except for the omission of a station at 15th Avenue, all of the station locations from the surface line were preserved as elevated stations. The Culver Line was operated as a branch of the Fifth Avenue Elevated, with a free transfer at Ninth Avenue to the West End Line into the Fourth Avenue Subway. An extension to Avenue X was opened at noon on May 10, 1919. The line, the last of the four to Coney Island, was completed on May 1, 1920, at which time the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) was forced to cut the fare from ten to five cents. This construction tied into the existing lower level of the BMT Brighton Line east of West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium. Some Culver Line (5) trains began using the Fourth Avenue Subway to the Nassau Street Loop in Lower Manhattan when that line opened on May 30, 1931; the Fifth Avenue Elevated was closed on May 31, 1940, in conjunction with the unification of the transit system under city operations. <b>Trolleys</b> continued to use the surface tracks on McDonald Avenue until October 30, 1956.|$|E

50|$|A few retired Philadelphia <b>trolley</b> buses {{have been}} saved for {{historical}} preservation, including at public museums. 1947-built ACF-Brills 205 and 210 were acquired by the Shore Line <b>Trolley</b> Museum in 1981, when withdrawn from service in Philadelphia. Number 205 is in operating condition, and in 2009 it became the first <b>trolley</b> bus ever to operate at the museum (powered normally, from overhead wires), when it tested {{the first section of}} a short <b>trolley</b> bus line that is under construction there. The Seashore <b>Trolley</b> Museum's collection includes ex-Philadelphia <b>trolley</b> bus 336, a 1955 Marmon-Herrington TC49; it is not currently in operating condition. A few other ex-Philadelphia ACF-Brill and Marmon-Herrington <b>trolley</b> buses {{have been saved}} by private individuals, including one Marmon TC46. No other types of Philadelphia <b>trolley</b> buses, such as AM Generals or earlier types of Brill vehicles, have been preserved.|$|R
