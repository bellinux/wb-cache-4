A clear seasonal pattern was observed: density was highest between late autumn and spring with two migration peaks, and lowest during summer. Short-term (inter-month) changes in glass eel density were partially driven by local environmental variables, such as estuarine turbidity, local rainfall and water temperature. Long-term (inter-annual) changes were positively correlated with oceanic factors related to recruitment success (NAO index and primary production at the spawning area) {{as well as local}} environmental factors (westerly and southerly wind mixing indices and rainfall). Spatial changes in glass eel density within the estuary depended on <b>tidal</b> and <b>light</b> situations although maximum densities were mainly observed at diurnal and/or nocturnal flood tides.

40|$|San Francisco Bay (SFB) {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as a nutrient-enriched estuary (Jassby and Cloern, 2012). However, phytoplankton biomass and dissolved oxygen remain much lower and higher, respectively, in SFB than would be expected in an estuary having such high nutrient loads and ambient nutrient concentrations. Studies over the past 40 years in SFB have demonstrated that phytoplankton primary production and biomass accumulation are limited {{by a combination of}} factors, including strong <b>tidal</b> mixing, <b>light</b> limitation due to high turbidity, and grazing pressure by clams. More recent observations, though, suggest that SFB’s resistance to the harmful effects of nutrient overenrichment is weakening. Since the late 1990 's, some regions of the Bay have experienced substantial increases in phytoplankton biomass (Cloern et al., 2007, 2010) and modest but statistically significant declines in DO concentrations (Cloern, 2011). An unprecedented red tide bloom in September 2004 (Cloern et al, 2005), and increased frequency of cyanobacteria blooms (Lehman et al., 2008) in the northern estuary also signal changes. Other recent studies have argued that the chemical forms of nutrients and their relative abundances (NH 4 :NO 3, N:P) can influence phytoplankton productivity (Dugdale et al., 2007; Parker et al., 2012 a,b; Dugdale et al., 2012) and community composition (Glibert et al., 2012).

40|$|We use {{a simple}} {{framework}} {{to calculate the}} time evolution of {{the composition of the}} fallback material onto a supermassive black hole arising from the tidal disruption of main sequence stars. We study stars with masses between 0. 8 and 3. 0 M_, at evolutionary stages from zero-age main sequence to terminal-age main sequence, built using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code. We show that most stars develop enhancements in nitrogen (^ 14 N) and depletions in carbon (^ 12 C) and oxygen (^ 16 O) over their lifetimes, and that these features are more pronounced for higher mass stars. We find that, in an accretion-powered tidal disruption flare, these features become prominent only after the time of peak of the fallback rate and appear at earlier times for stars of increasing mass. We postulate that no severe compositional changes resulting from the fallback material should be expected near peak {{for a wide range of}} stellar masses and, as such, are unable to explain the extreme helium-to-hydrogen line ratios observed in some TDEs. On the other hand, the resulting compositional changes could help explain the presence of nitrogen-rich features, which are currently only detected after peak. When combined with the shape of the light curve, the time evolution of the composition of the fallback material provides a clear method to help constrain the nature of the disrupted star. This will enable a better characterization of the event by helping break the degeneracy between the mass of the star and the mass of the black hole when fitting <b>tidal</b> disruption <b>light</b> curves.

40|$|The {{collection}} of high quality, long term data from diverse environments is required if {{the interplay of}} the complex factors affecting phytoplankton bloom development is to be investigated. With this in mind the English Channel and Bay of Biscay between Portsmouth and Bilbao has been intensively monitored starting in 2002. In 2005 the ‘FerryBox’ suite of sensors measured temperature, salinity, fluorescence, oxygen and turbidity. The data are merged with position and can be viewed in real time at [URL] The ferry travels between Portsmouth and Bilbao completing a round trip every 3 days; measurements in water pumped in from 5 metres depth provide data which are collected every second. In 2005 the ‘FerryBox’ methods were improved to reduce the affects of bio fouling on the sensors; the sensors were systematically cleaned weekly and sensor calibrations made from samples collected during monthly ferry crossings. These showed that the fluorescence and oxygen sensors were stable and a high quality dataset was produced. Calibration of the fluorescence sensor was monitored using extracted chlorophyll suspended in solid Perspex blocks. The ‘FerryBox’ dataset has been mapped against time and latitude to show the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms, using fluorescence, along with calculations of oxygen anomaly. Such continuous monitoring allows us to pinpoint the timings of phytoplankton bloom initiation and duration.

Only the evening upward flow seems primarily controlled by the tide, while the evening downward flow, which ends at twilight, seems to be related to the timing of the evening upward migration, to the tide and again to light levels.

No significant differences were found in theseedling density, height or coverage of S. caseolaris among different mangrove communities. However, the density, height and coverage of S. caseolaris seedlings were significantly higher on the mudflats without canopy than under the mangrove canopies, indicating that higher light intensity in on the mudflats without canopy promoted the dispersal and vertical growth of S. caseolaris seedlings. Although the optimal tidal elevation for S. caseolaris seedlings in Shenzhen Bay was between 1. 40 m and 1. 60 m, an area that falls within the mid-to-high intertidal zones, seedling density and tidal elevation were weakly correlated. The seedling density under the native mangrove canopies was negatively related to dispersal distance. However seedling density were positively correlated with light intensity(P< 0. 05), and the correlation coefficients for the introduced S. caseolaris forest increased through time with successive surveys. In contrast, there was no significant correlation founded between seedling density and light intensity under native mangrove canopies.

40|$|Coastal ecosystems, {{including}} estuaries, {{provide a}} range of services to humans, mediated by the species within these ecosystems. Microphytobenthos (MPB) {{play a vital role}} in many key processes within estuarine ecosystems, and provide a food source for higher trophic levels. Anthropogenic activity is already causing changes to ecosystems, through pollution, overexploitation and, more recently, climate change. Increasing temperature and carbon dioxide levels, and altered biodiversity, are likely to affect species, and their interactions, within these ecosystems. Much ecological research has focused on the effects of a single stressor on specific species or ecosystems, with relatively little work examining the effects of multiple stressors. The research in this thesis investigates the effects of altered environmental variables (<b>light,</b> <b>tidal</b> regime, temperature and carbon dioxide) and different macrofaunal diversity on primary production (MPB biomass) through a series of manipulative lab-based mesocosm experiments. This work also examines the temporal variability of environmental stressors on species across two trophic levels. Results demonstrate how multiple environmental stressors interact in a complex and non-additive way to determine an ecosystem response (MPB biomass, nutrient concentration), and the effects of altered biodiversity were underpinned by strong species effects. Temporal variation of stressors had a strong effect on ecosystem response. In marine coastal ecosystems, environmental changes through ocean acidification will have economic and social repercussions, directly impacting the human services and livelihoods that these systems provide. As such, future research should be focused on identifying and mitigating the inevitable multiple effects that future global change may have on coastal ecosystems...|$|R

Studies into microphytobenthic ecology have previously been limited by scale but the advent of fine scale analysis techniques (gm) as well as non-destructive sampling has enabled the system to be examined at a level not previously possible. This study examined the formation, structure and function of microphytobenthic biofilms using non-destructive (remote sensing by PAM fluorescence; fibreoptic light microprofiling) and destructive (cryo-freezing and Low temperature scanning electron microscopy) sampling. Many microphytobenthic organisms are motile and have evolved complex migratory strategies. Microphytobenthic migratory patterns are widely described but much remains to be elucidated about the controlling factors. The fluorescence parameter F 015 (minimum fluorescence yield after 15 minutes dark adaptation) was used to monitor short-term changes in biomass at the sediment surface. <b>Light,</b> <b>tidal</b> state, endogeny and combinations thereof were all shown to control migration, demonstrating that predictable migratory rhythms cannot be assumed. Microscale sectioning showed that chlorophyll a was always concentrated in the top 400 gm (the photosynthetically active biomass).

Diurnal patterns of gamete release that lasted for 2 - 3 d, as in natural populations, were found in receptacles cultured in a 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod under calm conditions or in a simulated <b>tidal</b> regime. Constant <b>light</b> disrupted the diurnal component of release, however, suggesting that an endogenous circadian periodicity was absent. The effects of increased [DIC] on cultured receptacles under calm conditions were similar to the inhibitory effects of high water motion; both conditions reduced release in several species from both tide pool and intertidal habitats. Bicarbonate concentration, rather than carbon dioxide, or carbonate, was shown to be the component of the DIC system most closely correlated (inversely) with gamete release in the intertidal fucoid Pelvetia compressa. The hypothesis that gamete release is triggered by DIC depletion in the unstirred boundary layer during periods of low water motion in the light was further supported by experiments with P. compressa. These showed that gamete release was not inhibited by high water motion when DIC was absent. In the same experiments, high water motion inhibited release at 2 and 20 mmol/L DIC, confirming that the sensitivity of gamete release to water motion is DIC dependent. The ability of fucoid algae to couple physiological processes (e. g., photosynthesis) with life history events (gamete release) allows external fertilization to occur under favorable hydrodynamic conditions, and may contribute greatly to reproductive success in organisms inhabiting periodically turbulent environments...|$|R
