5|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> {{been used}} in unusual ways by at least two authors of {{historical}} importance.|$|E
5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E
5|$|The Old Norse {{feminine}} proper noun Hel {{is identical}} to the name of the location over which she rules, Old Norse Hel. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English hell (and thus Modern English hell), Old Frisian helle, Old Saxon hellia, Old High German hella, and Gothic halja. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *xaljō or *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.|$|E
50|$|Headwords {{also have}} {{translation}} equivalents in various national languages. Over 70 {{percent of the}} headwords have French, Russian, Hungarian and/or German translations; over half <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>have</b> Dutch, Belarusian and/or English translations; and {{over a third of}} <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>have</b> Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and/or Catalan translations.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> been {{borrowed}} {{into other}} languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan cantautor, French chantauteur, Maltese kantawtur, Romanian cantautor, and Slovenian kantavtor.|$|E
25|$|According to Persian {{historian}} and archaeologist Arthur Pope, the supreme Iranian art, {{in the proper}} meaning of <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> <b>has</b> always been its architecture. The supremacy of architecture applies to both pre- and post-Islamic periods.|$|E
50|$|The {{etymology}} of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is {{not entirely}} clear. Several different senses of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>have</b> different histories or origins.|$|R

25|$|In modern scholarship, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> {{sometimes}} been re-interpreted {{from the traditional}} meaning of carpenter and has {{sometimes been}} translated as craftsman, as the meaning of builder is implied, but {{can be applied to}} both wood-work and stone masonry.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{combined}} NATO rank scale, the modern-day rank of Gefreiter is usually {{equivalent to the}} NATO-standard rank scale OR-2. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> also been lent into the Russian language, and is in use in several Russian and post-Soviet militaries.|$|E
25|$|In Scrabble, {{an exclamation}} mark written after a word {{is used to}} {{indicate}} its presence in the Official Tournament and Club Word List but its absence from the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, usually because <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> been judged offensive.|$|E

25|$|While slang {{terms are}} usually {{short-lived}} coinages and figures of speech, cool {{is an especially}} ubiquitous slang word, most notably among young people. As well as being understood throughout the English-speaking world, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> even entered the vocabulary of several languages other than English.|$|E
25|$|By association, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> {{also been}} used to mean any sort of {{recurring}} theme, (whether or not subject to developmental transformation) in literature, or (metaphorically) {{the life of a}} fictional character or a real person. It is sometimes also used in discussion of other musical genres, such as instrumental pieces, cinema, and video game music, sometimes interchangeably with the more general category of theme.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> come to {{describe}} a trend of dress and culture modeled after African-Americans, it is inherently problematic because of its origins. The soundtrack of Wild Style was marketed in Japan as a cassette with a book of photos-scenes from the film, neighborhoods, breakers, graffiti, etc. Japan's hip hop contributions have been perceived {{by many to be}} based more on appearances than anything else.|$|E

25|$|Yamaka {{is a kind}} of pun in Sanskrit and Prakrit {{where the}} same word occurs more than once and each {{occurrence}} of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> a unique meaning. The following verse (3.26) from the third canto of the epic has the same four feet, but the same syllables stand for four different meanings, one meaning in each foot. Such use of quadruple Yamaka spanning the entire verse is also called Mahāyamaka.|$|E
25|$|In modern usage, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> taken a {{different}} meaning: despotism {{is a form}} of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power. The semantic shift undergone by the term is mirrored by tyrant, an ancient Greek word that originally bore no negative connotation, and the Latin dictator, a constitutionally sanctioned office of the Roman Republic. In colloquial Modern Greek, the word is often used to refer to a bishop.|$|E
25|$|A precise {{definition}} for <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> proved elusive. Brochs {{are the most}} spectacular of a complex class of roundhouse buildings found throughout Atlantic Scotland. The Shetland Amenity Trust lists about 120 sites in Shetland as candidate brochs, while the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) identifies a total of 571 candidate broch sites throughout the country. Researcher Euan MacKie has proposed a much smaller total for Scotland of 104.|$|E

25|$|Some specialists say {{the word}} may have {{originated}} during the Great Portuguese Discoveries, giving meaning to the sadness felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in shipwrecks, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> been found in earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The Reconquista also offers a plausible explanation.|$|E
25|$|When Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara {{referred}} to Chinese and Koreans as sangokujin (三国人) in 2000 {{in the context}} of foreigners being a potential source of unrest in the aftermath of an earthquake, the foreign community complained. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> often been used pejoratively and Ishihara's statement brought images of the massacre of Koreans by civilians and police alike after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake to mind. Therefore, {{the use of the term}} in context of potential rioting by foreigners is considered by many as provocative, if not explicitly racist.|$|E
25|$|Cavalier was not {{understood}} {{at the time}} as primarily a term describing a style of dress, but a whole political and social attitude. However, in modern times <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>has</b> become more particularly associated with the court fashions of the period, which included long flowing hair in ringlets, brightly coloured clothing with elaborate trimmings and lace collars and cuffs, and plumed hats. This contrasted with the dress of at least the most extreme Roundhead supporters of Parliament, with their preference for shorter hair and plainer dress, although neither side conformed to the stereotypical images entirely.|$|E
