50|$|Klutter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> segment {{that ran}} on Eek! Stravaganza's fourth season from 1995 to 1996 on the Fox Kids block. It {{was created by}} David Silverman and Savage Steve Holland. The segment was {{animated}} {{by the same people}} who used to work for Fox's The Critic, which was canceled that year. The executive producers were David Silverman, Savage Steve Holland, and Phil Roman. Unlike the Eek and Thunderlizard segments, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Fox</b> Children's Productions and Savage Studios co-production in association with Film Roman for animation. It lasted a year with 8 episodes.|$|R

5000|$|The story {{uses the}} {{literary}} rule of three, {{expressed in this}} case as a [...] "contrasting three", as the third pig's brick house {{turns out to be}} the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.Variations of the tale appeared in Uncle Remus: His Songs and Sayings in 1881. The story also made an appearance in Nights with Uncle Remus in 1883, both by Joel Chandler Harris, in which the pigs were replaced by Brer Rabbit. Andrew Lang included it in The Green Fairy Book, published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing interaction between them. The antagonist of <b>this</b> version <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>fox,</b> not <b>a</b> wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.|$|R
40|$|Facing strong {{opposition}} from the Mexican Congress, President Vicente Fox Quesada withdrew the nominations of four corporate executives to the governing board of the state-run oil company PEMEX {{and replaced them with}} four government officials.

In the meantime, Fox must deal with a new congressional commission, formed to investigate allegations of continued safety and environmental violations at the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant in Veracruz state...|$|R
50|$|The {{archipelago}} {{had only}} one terrestrial mammal upon the arrival of Europeans, the Falkland Islands wolf (also known as warrah). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kind of <b>fox,</b> and was found on both major islands. It was traditionally thought that Patagonian Indians once brought the warrah to the islands as a hunting dog. However, a 2009 DNA study by scientists at UCLA suggested that the warrah arrived on the islands long before humans migrated to the New World, possibly {{during one of the}} particularly intense cold intervals 340,000 years ago, 150,000 years ago or 25,000 years ago. Its nearest relative was the maned wolf, an extant South American canid. It became extinct in the mid-19th century as human settlement spread. 14 species of marine mammals including killer whales, Peale's dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, leopard seals, southern elephant seals, and southern sea lions frequent the surrounding waters. The elephant seal, the fur seal, and the sea lions all breed on the islands, and the largest elephant seal breeding site has over 500 animals in it. Other species, especially cetaceans, are also sometimes seen. Populations of large whales, drastically reduced by illegal whaling carried out by the Soviet Union until the late 1970s, are now recovering. These include southern right whales, humpback whales, blue whales, fin whales, sei whales, and sperm whales.|$|R
