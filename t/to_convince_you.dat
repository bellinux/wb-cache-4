[...] The paper called the episode [...] "deftly directed by" [...] McG, who kept [...] "things from becoming too silly or far-fetched." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the episode an overwhelmingly positive review, writing, [...] "Everyday superheroes are, of course, a recurring TV fantasy, but seldom has the genre shown as much pluck as Chuck, and seldom has it found a more agreeable hero than Zachary Levi...

A group of critics from PopMatters reviewed the recording in their [...] "Singles Going Steady" [...] column, with the site's consensus reading: [...] "'Misery' isn't a total misfire, but it's formulaic diva-pop effervescence does little <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>you</b> that music's mainstream was missing Stefani." [...] Chris Conaton from the publication enjoyed the single and its [...] "big ass chorus [...] a strong hook", but Chris Ingalls disliked that it was [...] "not breaking any new ground". Ingalls, however, congratulated it for being a [...] "well-produced pop/dance song". Adam Kivel of Consequence of Sound found the track to [...] "lack an identifiable tone or feeling", but felt its overall sound was [...] "effortless". At the end of the year, Entertainment Weekly placed [...] "Misery" [...] at number 36 on their 100 Best Songs of 2016 list.|$|E

[...] Finally he defended the women, [...] "Instead of painting their faces ... they were brave {{enough to go to}} Chattanooga and look for honest work." [...] Bailey attacked the defense case.They say this is a frame-up! They have been yelling frame-up ever since this case started! Who framed them? Did Ory Dobbins frame them?

2500|$|However, {{there are}} those among them who, giving up the attempt <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>you</b> with arguments, seek your pardon by {{pleading}} their liturgies: [...] Nothing makes me angrier, on this account, than the idea that expenses they sought for their own glory, should become a claim to public favor. [...] No-one earns a right to your gratitude, simply for having fed the horses, or paid for lavish choregies, or other largesse of this kind; on such occasions, one obtains the crown of victory for himself alone, without the least benefit to others. [...] But [...] {{to perform the duties}} of a trierarchy with flair, [...] or build walls to protect the city, or spend one's fortune for the city's well-being: those are actions for the public good, and in the interest of all. [...] These are the gifts that reveal the dedication of a citizen; the others only prove the wealth of those who made them. However, I do not think anyone ever has performed services to the State great enough, to demand in return that traitors be permitted to avoid punishment.|$|E

2500|$|He appeared, from 1984 until 1989, {{with the}} New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players (NYGASP), earning warm reviews for his [...] "subtle facial gesture and small comic touch" [...] and clear diction. [...] Of his 1986 Bunthorne with the company, The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Reed does not overdo. He sings and {{speaks in a}} {{moderate}} tone of voice, never moves more than fairly quickly, and never hits the audience {{over the head with}} a joke. As a result, when he strikes a pose of even mild ridiculousness, the result is hilarity. He makes Bunthorne a good-natured poseur, and admits his dependency on adulation with endearing simplicity." [...] At a NYGASP gala at Symphony Space in 1987, Reed proposed on stage to noted sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer. [...] He also performed in concerts in North America and Britain, including at The Berkshire Choral Institute as The Duke of Plaza Toro (with Kenneth Sandford as Don Alhambra) in The Gondoliers (1985). [...] In reviewing a 1988 concert, The Boston Globe wrote that Reed [...] "is near to perfect in his chosen field. Reed's acting, his command of patter and everything he does (which is a lot) <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>you</b> that what he's emitting could really be mellifluous, all-out singing – all these are freshly and tirelessly amusing".|$|E
2500|$|King {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 18 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". About.com gave it {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "with his swagger-jacking charm on the microphone, and enough charisma <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>you</b> that he's really running things in his department, he just might be the Jay-Z of the south. King is not only T.I.'s most captivating album so far, it's probably the best thing {{to come out of the}} [...] "A-Town" [...] lately. And, as Pimp C explains on one of the album's many skits, a [...] "king" [...] is anyone that handles his business appropriately on the lyrical side of things, and many kings abound in southern rap. With such foraying display of bravado, T.I. has rightfully earned his membership to hip-hop's elite. Royal salute!" [...] Allmusic writer Andy Kellman gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 praising the album's lead single [...] "What You Know", and stating [...] "T.I.'s fourth album isn't the leap forward he's been threatening to make, but it does carry the best set of productions he has been given to work with, and it guarantees that he won't be leaving the singles charts any time soon." [...] Blender Magazine noted on T.I.'s status saying [...] "Before his album sold a surprise half a million copies in its first week of release, T.I. was a Southern star who didn’t quite feel like one: He made up with irresistible hooks what he lacked in personality. Now he’s a national star who doesn’t quite feel like one. A breezily charismatic drug rapper, he’s like Jay-Z without the worldview, Young Jeezy without the gravitas; he still hasn’t distinguished himself as an artist worth exploring past the singles. Thankfully, he’s packed album No. 4 full of singles, which might be just as good. His sonorous, self-assured drawl adds an air of unflustered authority to his alpha brags, and he pours it into unexpected patterns. What he’s best at is craft—woozy refrains and hypnotic rhyme schemes—and his fleet of beats is impeccable, highlighted by the four-minute epic “What You Know,” which laces imperious synths with an intriguing wistfulness. Throughout, producers Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz and DJ Toomp back T.I.’s self-deifying spiels with wild bombast: he’d seem a lot less kingly if it weren’t for his court." ...|$|E
