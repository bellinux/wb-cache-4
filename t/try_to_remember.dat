The show aired on Thursday, June 23. <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>Remember</b> did not get picked up as a regular series.|$|E

500|$|On Tuesday morning, November 5, Mary Celeste left Pier 50 {{and moved}} into New York Harbor. The weather was uncertain, and Briggs decided to wait for better conditions. He {{anchored}} the ship just off Staten Island, where Sarah used the delay to send a final letter to her mother-in-law, in which she wrote: [...] "Tell Arthur I make great dependence on the letters I shall get from him, and will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> anything that happens on the voyage which he would be pleased to hear."

500|$|Since he {{was working}} with a largely non-professional cast, Forman's {{operating}} procedure was never to share the script with any of the performers, because if he had given them the screenplay, [...] "they’ll take it home to read, and their wives will end up directing your movie". [...] Instead, he chose to explain each scene in great detail just before starting to shoot takes, reciting the dialog from memory only one time, so that when the camera was rolling the actors had to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{as much as they could}} of what he had told them and then improvise to the best of their ability what they had forgotten or only half-understood. His cameraman was later to say that, as a result, all the performers were playing Miloš Forman playing their roles.|$|E
500|$|Many of the Topolino Snow White comics {{were the}} works of Romano Scarpa. His 1986 comic [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and King Arbor's Crystal" [...] (I Sette Nani e il cristallo di Re Arbor) {{provides}} explanation how the Queen would have survived her apparent death in the film (as some branches and bushes eased the fall and she was rescued by her loyal guards) and why she could not change back to her normal self (as her castle was burned down by the Huntsman and her book of magic is gone). In this story, Grimhilde (Grimilde) enlists the aid of her great admirer and past suitor, the evil King Arbor of Vegetalia, in a plot to use a magic crystal device to swap her old body with Snow White's. The intrigue is foiled by the dwarves who destroy the crystal, and the resigned Arbor allows the Witch to live with her, saying he will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> she was [...] "the most beautiful among queens". The uneasy relationship between Grimhilde and Abor continued in the comic [...] "The Seven Dwarfs and the Fountainhead" [...] (I Sette nani e la fonte meravigliosa), in which she desperately attempts to regain her youth, but instead only turns into a childlike version of her Witch form for a short time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, Wood {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the exploitation film The Sinister Urge (originally titled Racket Queen), starring Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore and Carl Anthony. Filmed in five days, {{this is the last}} mainstream film Wood directed, although it has grindhouse elements. The movie contains an [...] "eerily prescient" [...] scene, in which Carl Anthony's character states, [...] "I look at this slush, and I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> at one time, I made good movies." [...] Ironically, Wood's own career would soon spiral downward into a blur of [...] "smut racket" [...] nudie flicks, softcore pornography and end with X-rated novels and films.|$|E
2500|$|Her use of basic, {{everyday}} {{language is}} a point of contention. At first it can come across as simple, but that simplicity of language allows for a greater range of emotion to come out in her work. She explains this in her introduction to Bone Dance: “I never felt that it was enough to display agility with words or clever turns of phrase. I believe that inaccessible poetry does not work. If the listener must take a special class in how to appreciate it, then the poem has failed. I hold myself to that standard and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that 'ordinary' language contains all of the imagery and beauty needed by the poem.” ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his first}} {{summer in the}} Sierra as a shepherd, Muir wrote field notes that {{emphasized}} {{the role that the}} senses play in human perceptions of the environment. According to Williams, he speculated that the world was an unchanging entity that was interpreted by the brain through the senses, and, writes Muir, [...] "If the creator were to bestow a new set of senses upon us [...] [...] [...] we would never doubt that we were in another world[...] [...] [...] " [...] While doing his studies of nature, he would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> everything he observed as if his senses were recording the impressions, until he could write them in his journal. As a result of his intense desire to remember facts, he filled his field journals with notes on precipitation, temperature, and even cloud formations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul R. McHugh, {{professor}} of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University discusses in his book <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>Remember</b> the developments that {{led to the creation of}} false memories in the SRA moral panic and the formation of the FMSF as an effort to bring contemporary scientific research and political action to the polarizing struggle about false memories within the mental health disciplines. According to McHugh, there is no coherent scientific basis for the core belief of one side of the struggle, that sexual abuse can cause massive systemic repression of memories that can only be accessed through hypnosis, coercive interviews and other dubious techniques. The group of psychiatrists who promoted these ideas, whom McHugh terms [...] "Mannerist Freudians", consistently followed a deductive approach to diagnosis in which the theory and causal explanation of symptoms was assumed to be childhood sexual abuse leading to dissociation, followed by a set of unproven and unreliable treatments with a strong confirmation bias that inevitably produced the allegations and causes that were assumed to be there. The treatment approach involved isolation of the patient from friends and family within psychiatric wards dedicated to the treatment of dissociation, filled with other patients who were treated by the same doctors with the same flawed methods and staff members who also coherently and universally ascribed to the same set of beliefs. These methods began in the 1980s and continued for several years until a series of court cases and medical malpractice lawsuits resulted in hospitals failing to support the approach. In cases where the dissociative symptoms were ignored, the coercive treatment approach ceased and the patients were removed from dedicated wards, allegations of satanic rape and abuse normally ceased, [...] "recovered" [...] memories were identified as fabrications and conventional treatments for presenting symptoms were generally successful.|$|E
