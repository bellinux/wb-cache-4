2500|$|On Thursday, October 11, 2007 Texas A {{officials}} {{issued a}} [...] "letter of admonishment" [...] and ordered that the website CoachFran.com be shut down. Additionally, Franchione {{was instructed to}} no longer employ [...] "any staff members that {{could be construed as}} representing Texas A or providing information or reports relative to his position as head coach at Texas A". Consequently, the university fired McKenzie. Byrne has been quoted as saying [...] "The Aggies are embarrassed right now. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> unfortunate incident {{we do not want to}} experience again." [...] Byrne also stated that the incident would be included in Franchione's performance evaluation at the end of the season. The discovery of the newsletter led CBS Sports columnist Gregg Doyel to call for Franchione to be fired. Doyel wrote that many of Franchione's columns announced firings of assistant coaches before that assistant was told himself and reported injuries that weren't disclosed to the press. [...] More seriously, Doyel said, his disclosures of injury information violated federal health privacy law, and the entire venture would have also violated federal tax law if Franchione hadn't told the IRS about it. He also suggested that Franchione may have known the newsletter's recipients were using the information to make better-informed bets on Aggie games.|$|E

6000|$|I {{went on to}} Grasmere. [1] I {{was not at all}} unwell, when I arrived there, though wet {{of course}} to the skin. My right eye had nothing the matter with it, either to the sight of others, or to my own feelings, but I had a bad night, with {{distressful}} dreams, chiefly about my eye; and waking often in the dark I thought it was the effect of mere recollection, but it appeared in the morning that my right eye was blood-shot, and the lid swollen. That morning however I walked home, and before I reached Keswick, my eye was quite well, but [...] "I felt unwell all over". Yesterday I continued unusually unwell all over me till eight o'clock in the evening. I took no [...] "laudanum or opium", but at eight o'clock, unable to bear the stomach uneasiness and achings of my limbs, I took two large tea-spoons full of Ether in a wine glass of camphorated gum-water, and a third teaspoon full at ten o'clock, and I received complete relief; my body calmed; my sleep placid; but when I awoke in the morning, my right hand, with three of the fingers, was swollen and inflamed. The swelling in the hand is gone down, and of two of the fingers somewhat abated, but the middle finger is still twice its natural size, so that I write with difficulty. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rough attack, but though I am much weakened by it, and look sickly and haggard, yet I am not out of heart. Such a 'bout'; such a [...] "periless buffetting," [...] was enough to have hurt the health of a strong man. Few constitutions can bear to be long wet through in intense cold.

6000|$|Dear General Hoskyns,--I {{have the}} honour to report as usual. Your giddy mother having gone {{planting}} a flower-garden, I am obliged to write {{with my own}} hand, and, of course, nobody {{will be able to}} read it. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> mean kind of a month. Aunt Maggie left with the influenza. We have heard of her from Sydney, and she is all right again; but we have inherited her influenza, and it made a poor place of Vailima. We had Talolo, Mitaele, Sosimo, Iopu, Sina, Misifolo, and myself, all sick in bed at the same time; and was not that a pretty dish to set before the king! The big hall of the new house having no furniture, the sick pitched their tents in it,--I mean their mosquito-nets,--like a military camp. The Tamaitai and your mother went about looking after them, and managed to get us something to eat. Henry, the good boy! though he was getting it himself, did housework, and went round at night from one mosquito-net to another, praying with the sick. Sina, too, was as good as gold, and helped us greatly. We shall always like her better. All the time--I do not know how they managed--your mother found the time to come and write for me; and for three days, as I had my old trouble on, and had to play dumb man, I dictated a novel in the deaf-and-dumb alphabet. But now we are all recovered, and getting to feel quite fit. A new paddock has been made; the wires come right {{up to the top of}} the hill, pass within twenty yards of the big clump of flowers (if you remember that) and by the end of the pineapple patch. The Tamaitai and your mother and I all sleep in the upper story of the new house; Uncle Lloyd is alone in the workman's cottage; and there is nobody at all at night in the old house, but ants and cats and mosquitoes. The whole inside of the new house is varnished. It is a beautiful golden-brown by day, and in lamplight all black and sparkle. In the corner of the hall the new safe is built in, and looks as if it had millions of pounds in it; but I do not think there is much more than twenty dollars and a spoon or two; so the man that opens it will have a great deal of trouble for nothing. Our great fear is lest we should forget how to open it; but it will look just as well if we can't. Poor Misifolo--you remember the thin boy, do you not?--had a desperate attack of influenza; and he was in a great taking. You would not like to be very sick in some savage place in the islands, and have only the savages to doctor you? Well, that was just the way he felt. [...] "It is all very well," [...] he thought, [...] "to let these childish white people doctor a sore foot or a toothache, but this is serious--I might die of this! For goodness' sake let me get away into a draughty native house, where I can lie in cold gravel, eat green bananas, and have a real grown-up, tattooed man to raise spirits and say charms over me." [...] A day or two we kept him quiet, and got him much better. Then he said he must go. He had had his back broken in his own islands, he said; it had come broken again, and he must go away to a native house and have it mended. [...] "Confound your back!" [...] said we; [...] "lie down in your bed." [...] At last, one day, his fever was quite gone, and he could give his mind to the broken back entirely. He lay in the hall; I was in the room alone; all morning and noon I heard him roaring like a bull calf, so that the floor shook with it. It was plainly humbug; it had the humbugging sound of a bad child crying; and about two of the afternoon we were worn out, and told him he might go. Off he set. He was in some kind of a white wrapping, with a great white turban on his head, as pale as clay, and walked leaning on a stick. But, O, he was a glad boy to get away from these foolish, savage, childish white people, and get his broken back put right by somebody with some sense. He nearly died that night, and little wonder! but he has now got better again, and long may it last! All the others were quite good, trusted us wholly, and stayed to be cured where they were. But then he was quite right, if you look at it from his point of view; for, though we may be very clever, we do not set up to cure broken backs. If a man has his back broken we white people can do nothing at all but bury him. And was he not wise, since that was his complaint, to go to folks who could do more? ...|$|E
