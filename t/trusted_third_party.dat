40|$|How can Agnes trust a {{computation}} C {{occurring at}} Boris’s computer? In particular, how can Agnes can trust that C is occurring without Boris even {{being able to}} observe its internal state? One way is for Agnes to house C in a strong tamper-protected secure coprocessor at Boris’s site. However, this approach is not scalable: neither in terms of computation—once C gets larger than the coprocessor, it becomes vulnerable to Boris again—nor in terms of cost. In this paper, we report on our Faerieplay project: rather than worrying about the limited size of a secure coprocessor, {{we try to make}} it as small as possible, with limited RAM and CPU. We start with the Fairplay work of Malkhi et al on implementing Yao’s blinded-circuit solution to secure multiparty computation with software—this permits Agnes to trust C, but is too inefficient for all but small C.
