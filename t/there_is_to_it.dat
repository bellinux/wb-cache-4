2500|$|According to Sondheim, he {{was asked}} to {{translate}} Mahagonny-Songspiel: [...] "But, I'm not a Brecht/Weill fan and that's really all <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I'm an apostate: I like Weill's music when he came to America better than I do his stuff before... I love The Threepenny Opera but, outside of The Threepenny Opera, the music of his I like is the stuff he wrote in America – when he was not writing with Brecht, when he was writing for Broadway." [...] He turned down an offer to musicalize Nathanael West's A Cool Million with James Lapine around 1982.|$|E

He announced the diagnosis a week later at The Amaz!ng Meeting 7, as well as {{the fact that he was}} scheduled to begin chemotherapy in the following weeks. He also said at the conference: [...] "One day, I'm gonna die. That's all <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Hey, it's too bad, but I've got to make room. I'm using a lot of oxygen and such— I think it's good use of oxygen myself, but of course, I'm a little prejudiced on the matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Attenborough {{starts the}} second {{programme}} {{by looking at}} potential future events, before warning that what happens {{over the next few}} years is crucial. A BBC weather forecast for the year 2050 shows that summer temperatures of 38°C for the UK are [...] "par for the course". The probable range by which the planet will warm over the next century is between 1.4°C and 5.8°C. Or, says Attenborough, [...] "to put it another way, the impact of global warming will be somewhere between severe and catastrophic." [...] The naturalist is invited to watch a film that illustrates regional change over the next 100 years. A 2°C rise for the south of England, for example, may not seem to be much but that is not all <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Rainfall is also predicted to be more intense and storms could be five times more frequent than they are at the moment. This makes extreme events, such as the 2004 Boscastle flood, much more likely. Current defences for severe wind or rain will shortly become inadequate. Even Hurricane Katrina, with the devastation it caused, is described as [...] "not particularly powerful". In Australia, a new approach is needed to combat brush fires after the hottest year on record. If the Amazon tropical rainforest were to disappear, not only would an entire ecosystem vanish, but a valuable way of cooling the planet would go as well. Meanwhile, the glaciers continue to melt: one scientist reveals that an area the size of Texas has been lost over the last 20 years. Attenborough is told that a warming of 2°C is inevitable, as a consequence of our actions over the last 25 years, but whether or not we end up at 6°C is still very much within our control.|$|E

[...] The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> more <b>to</b> <b>it</b> than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers <b>to</b> the next. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> more <b>to</b> <b>it</b> than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.|$|R
