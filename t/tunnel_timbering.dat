25|$|The place {{contains}} the {{largest collection of}} late nineteenth century <b>tunnels</b> and <b>timber</b> and metal span bridges of any other section of railway in Queensland of comparable length.|$|R
5000|$|This rail-trail {{is open to}} hikers, horse riders, and bicyclists. It has a gravel/dirt {{surface and}} has many stream {{crossings}} where the railroad bridges were removed during {{the dismantling of the}} track. Work to restore the many bridges {{in order to make the}} entire stretch passable is underway. The trail features two tunnels: the Moonville Tunnel, a masonry tunnel in Vinton County that is reputed to be haunted, and the King Switch <b>Tunnel,</b> a <b>timber</b> <b>tunnel</b> in Athens County.|$|R
5000|$|Waterloo Township {{includes}} {{the entirety of}} the Waterloo Wildlife Research Station, the Waterloo State Forest, and {{a significant portion of the}} Zaleski State Forest. The Moonville Rail-Trail originates in Mineral within the township. Points of interest in the township include [...] "Devils Tea-Table", a geological pillar formation on private land; the King Switch <b>Tunnel,</b> a <b>timber</b> <b>tunnel</b> on the Moonville Rail-Trail; a small natural bridge on Biddyville Road; and the county's largest beaver pond, also on Biddyville Road.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of workers}} {{drilling}} inside the Santa Ana Tin Mine in Orange County, March 20, 1903. Three men operate a drill {{working on the}} face of a <b>tunnel.</b> Thick <b>timbers</b> shore up the tunnel. A piece of corrugated metal forms part of the roof shoring. The owner of the mine was Gail Borden, III, Trabuco Canyon, south of Mojeska reservoir...|$|R
50|$|A {{particular}} use of tunneling was in mining, where <b>tunnels,</b> braced with <b>timber</b> supports, were dug {{under the}} fortifications of besieged castles or towns, which when fired would collapse, {{bringing down the}} overlying wall.|$|R
25|$|As {{the fire}} raged outside the mine, the heat caused {{the cold air}} in the tunnel to rush out, {{replacing}} it with hot air and smoke. Pulaski ordered the men to {{lie down on the}} floor of the mine where there was still some breathable air. As the fire closed in around the <b>tunnel</b> entrance, <b>timber</b> beams at the mouth of the tunnel began to burn. Pulaski carried water in his hat from pools on the mine floor to the entrance, trying to douse the flames. In the process, he was badly burned. Eventually, Pulaski fell unconscious, as did all his men.|$|R
50|$|The Crimean War was in {{progress}} at the time, {{and the start}} of construction was delayed until September 1856. The Engineer, A H Bampton, died {{a few months after the}} start of work, and the services of Isambard Kingdom Brunel were called in. The works were heavy, with three <b>tunnels</b> and six <b>timber</b> viaducts on stone piers.|$|R
25|$|The Redlynch to the Crooked Creek Bridge {{portion of}} the Cairns-to-Kuranda railway {{constitutes}} most of the second section (Redlynch to Myola) of a planned railway line to Herberton. It ascends the coastal range and travels around Stoney Creek Gorge and through the Barron Gorge, to a height of 327.7m at Barron Falls railway station. It proceeds through Kuranda railway station 21.7km from Redlynch, to Crooked Creek Bridge 23.2km from Redlynch. Built between April 1887 and June 1891 through a steep and slip-prone landscape, the section is a feat of engineering which in 2011 included 15 concrete-lined <b>tunnels</b> and 39 <b>timber</b> or steel bridges (from Redlynch {{up to and including}} Crooked Creek Bridge).|$|R
500|$|The {{site was}} {{identified}} by a fortification expert, Major Bock of the Festungs-Pionier-Stab 27 of the Fifteenth Army LVII Corps {{based in the}} Dieppe area. A limestone hill near the hamlet of Mimoyecques, [...] high and [...] from London, was chosen to house the gun. It had been selected with care; the hill in which the facility was built is primarily chalk with very little topsoil cover, and the chalk layer extends several hundred metres below the surface, providing a deep but easily tunnelled rock layer. The chalk is easy to excavate and strong enough to dig <b>tunnels</b> without using <b>timber</b> supports. Although the site's road links were poor, {{it was only a}} few kilometres west of the main railway line between Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer.|$|R
