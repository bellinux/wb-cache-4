5|$|Interest in {{attracting}} the capital grew as people realized the commercial benefits and prestige {{that were at}} stake. New York City and Philadelphia each built houses for the president. State officials in New York offered <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> Kingston, while Maryland officials offered <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> either Annapolis or Baltimore. Also, as had {{been the case in}} earlier debates during the 1780s, regional biases, state pride and local loyalties were potent forces and figured into the contest. There was much maneuvering by northern and southern factions in favor of certain sites, and by interstate coalitions that were formed and dissolved almost daily, as Congress debated the matter during the spring of 1790. More than 20 sites were proposed publicly as candidates for the capital city.|$|E
5|$|Pressure from Starr King and Olmsted, {{photographs}} by Carleton Watkins, and geological {{data from the}} 1863 Geological Survey of California prompted legislators to take action.

Emperor Lucius Verus and general Gaius Avidius Cassius were sent in 162 AD {{to counter the}} resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was {{burned to the ground}} by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Parthians made peace but were forced <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> western Mesopotamia to the Romans.|$|E

5|$|As the United States {{expanded}} westward in {{the early}} 19th century, government officials sought to buy as much Native American land as possible. In 1804, territorial governor William Henry Harrison negotiated a treaty in St. Louis in which a group of Sauk and Meskwaki leaders supposedly sold their lands east of the Mississippi for more than $2,200, in goods and annual payments of $1,000 in goods. The treaty became controversial because the Native leaders had not been authorized by their tribal councils <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> lands. Historian Robert Owens argued that the chiefs probably {{did not intend to}} give up ownership of the land, and that they would not have sold so much valuable territory for such a modest price. Historian Patrick Jung concluded that the Sauk and Meskwaki chiefs intended <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> a little land, but that the Americans included more territory in the treaty's language than the Natives realized. According to Jung, the Sauks and Meskwakis did not learn the true extent of the cession until years later.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{appointed}} his son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich Ban of Macsó (Mačva, Serbia) in 1254. Rostislav's {{task was}} the creation of a buffer zone along the southern borders. He occupied Bosnia already in the year of his appointment and forced Tzar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> Belgrade and Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) in 1255. Béla adopted the title of King of Bulgaria, but he only used it occasionally in the subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|During and {{following}} the American Revolutionary War, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the westward thrust of Euro-American settlement led to {{the decline of the}} Overhill towns. The Cherokee were forced <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> most of their lands in this area through a series of unfavorable treaties with the United States, and they migrated to the south and west away from settler pressure for a time.|$|E

5|$|In Chouteau v. Molony (1853), Justice Wayne, for a {{unanimous}} Court, interpreted {{a grant from}} the Fox tribe to be a mere right to mine lead, rather than a grant of land because it was not confirmed by the Spanish authorities as required by Spanish law and because it included a Fox village which the tribe would have been unlikely <b>to</b> <b>cede.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1191 Bohemond {{sailed to}} Limassol along with Guy of Lusignan and Leo of Cilicia to meet Richard I of England, {{who had arrived}} to reconquer the Holy Land from Saladin. He once again met Richard during the siege of Acre in summer 1191, {{but he did not}} provide {{military}} support to the crusaders. Bohemond's relationship with Leo of Cilicia became tense when Leo captured Bagras and refused <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> it to the Knights Templar.|$|E
5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region.

However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E

5|$|When the Natchez {{began to}} protest the seizure of their land for the plantation, Chépart said he would burn down the temple that {{contained}} their ancestors' graves. In response to this threat, the Natchez seemed to promise <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> the land, wrote Dumont de Montigny, {{but only if they}} were given two months to relocate their temple and graves. Chépart agreed to give them the time in exchange for pelts, oil, poultry, and grain—a request the Natchez promised to fulfill later.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> the city of Venice to Italy. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E

5|$|Americans' {{eagerness to}} expand westward {{prompted}} {{a long series}} of American Indian Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was {{compelled}} <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} campaign, Isbul and Malamir {{captured}} the Thracian fortresses of Probaton (near Adrianople, modern Edirne) and Bourdizon (modern Babaeski). After conquering these two fortresses, the Bulgarian troops reached Philippopolis (now Plovdiv). As the defence forces of the city had fled, Isbul and Malamir entered negotiations with the population in order to persuade them <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> the fortress. Pavlov is {{of the opinion that}} the war ended with a continuation of the peace of 815. He believes that Byzantine Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) was forced to make concessions to Bulgaria, which may have included the incorporation of Philippopolis and its close surroundings into the Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Joscelin I of Edessa in 1127, although sources do not reveal the reason behind the enmity of the two Christian rulers. According to Runciman, Joscelin seized former Antiochene territories from Il-Bursuqi, governor of Mosul. Furthermore, Bohemond refused <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> Azaz to Joscelin, {{despite the fact that}} Roger of Salerno promised it to Joscelin as the dowry of his second wife, Maria of Salerno. Taking advantage of Bohemond's absence due to a campaign, Joscelin invaded Antioch with the assistance of Turkish mercenaries, plundering the villages along the frontier.|$|E
5|$|Béla's {{relationship}} with his oldest son and heir, Stephen, became tense in the early 1260s, because the elderly king favored his daughter Anna and his youngest child, Béla, Duke of Slavonia. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>cede</b> the territories of the Kingdom of Hungary east of the river Danube to Stephen, which caused a civil war lasting until 1266. Nevertheless, Béla's family was famed for his piety: he died as a Franciscan tertiary, and the veneration of his three saintly daughtersKunigunda, Yolanda, and Margaretwas confirmed by the Holy See.|$|E
