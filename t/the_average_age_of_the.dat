5|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{there have been}} moves towards greater {{modernisation}} and standardisation, with large purchases of new rolling stock from companies like Alstom and China CNR Corporation, as well as smaller orders of second hand rolling stock, which {{the government of the}} City of Buenos Aires claims are temporary measures while those lines are modernised to be able to incorporate more modern rolling stock. Such stock has been acquired from Tokyo, Nagoya, and Madrid. From 2013 to 2019, 468 new cars are set to arrive while 232 are receiving refurbishment, bringing <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet to 22 years in 2016, down from 34 in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{first period}} usually begins between twelve and {{fifteen years of}} age, {{a point in time}} known as menarche. They may {{occasionally}} start as early as eight, and this onset may still be normal. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first period is generally later in the developing world and earlier in developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and {{the first day of the}} next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 35 days in adults (an average of 28 days).|$|E

5|$|In 1970–71 {{players such}} as Clemence, Hughes, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd and Steve Heighway reduced <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team to 22. 21 year old John Toshack signed in November from Cardiff City for a club record £110,000 to {{spearhead}} the attack. His first Liverpool goal was 11 days later in a 3-2 derby comeback win after being two down to Everton. Liverpool had a second consecutive fifth place league finish. They exited the 1970-71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals to Leeds United. Brian Hall's goal clinched a 1970-71 FA Cup 2-1 comeback semi final over Everton. Heighway put Liverpool ahead in extra time in the final. Arsenal this time came back to win 2–1 for a Gunners League and cup double.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, Malmö FF {{won their}} seventeenth Swedish {{championship}} and 20th Allsvenskan {{title in the}} penultimate round of the league away from home. Similar to 2010, the title {{was the result of}} a young squad. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squad, 23.8 years, was the youngest team to become champions since the beginning of the 21st century. The following year Malmö FF qualified for the group stage of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League by beating Ventspils, Sparta Prague and Red Bull Salzburg in the qualifying rounds. This was the first time the club qualified for the competition proper since the re-branding from the European Cup in the 1992–93 season and the first time since the 2000–01 season that a Swedish club qualified. In the following months Malmö FF defended their league title, winning their eighteenth Swedish championship and 21st Allsvenskan title. This was the first time a club defended the Allsvenskan title since the 2003 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E

30|$|Similar to {{the common}} company car {{arrangement}} in Europe [18], a new car is usually given to an employee {{for a period of}} 3  years; consequently, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> a company car in Israel is 1.5  years. In comparison, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> privately owned passenger cars in Israel over the last decade has been quite constant and, in 2009, stood at 7.1  years [28]. This <b>average</b> <b>age</b> is similar to that in European countries, whose share of company cars is relatively large; e.g., in Germany, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> a car was 8.1  years in 2007 [2].|$|R
50|$|One pair {{composed}} of a single light and a single dark line is considered to represent one calendar year and age estimation is calculated by adding <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> tooth eruption to the line count determined.

5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks {{the top of this}} formation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Politburo's {{members was}} 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar greying also {{took place in}} the Central Committee, the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members {{can be explained by the}} fact that the Central Committee was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} departing {{principals}} the LSO recruited rising young players including Hugh Maguire, Neville Marriner and Simon Streatfeild in the string sections, Gervase de Peyer and William Waterhouse in the woodwinds, and Barry Tuckwell and Denis Wick in the brass. With the new intake the orchestra rapidly advanced in standards and status. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LSO players dropped to about 30. In 1956 the orchestra visited South Africa {{to play at}} the Johannesburg Festival. The players were impressed by the dynamic director of the festival, Ernest Fleischmann, and engaged him as general secretary of the orchestra when the post fell vacant in 1959. He was the LSO's first professional manager; all his predecessors as secretary/managing director had been orchestral players combining the duties with their orchestral playing.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> {{biomedical}} researchers has steadily increased. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> an investigator at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) rose from 39 to 51 between 1980 and 2008. The <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> the biomedical workforce {{was even more}} apparent when looking at first-time NIH grantees. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> a new investigator was 42 in 2008, compared to 36 in 1980. To determine if the rising barriers at NIH for entry in biomedical research might impact innovative ideas and research, we analyzed the research and publications of Nobel Prize winners from 1980 to 2010 to assess {{the age at which}} their pioneering research occurred. We established that in the 30 -year period, 96 scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine or chemistry for work related to biomedicine, and that their groundbreaking research was conducted at an <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 41 —one year younger than <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> a new investigator at NIH. Furthermore, 78 % of the Nobel Prize winners conducted their research before <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 51, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> an NIH principal investigator. This suggested that limited access to NIH might inhibit research potential and novel projects, and could impact biomedicine an...|$|R

25|$|Despite skilled farmers, high technology, {{fertile soil}} and subsidies, farm {{earnings}} are relatively low, mainly due to low {{prices at the}} farm gate.

50|$|So many Englishmen began {{migrating}} {{en masse}} to North America {{that the marriage}} prospects for unmarried Englishwomen dwindled and <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> first marriage rose for Englishwomen. In addition, there was a sharp rise {{in the percentage of}} women who remained unmarried and thus decreased fertility; an Englishwoman marrying at <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 26 years in the late 17th century who survived her childbearing years would bear an average of 5.03 children while an Englishwoman making a comparable marriage in the early 19th century at <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 23.5 years and surviving her childbearing years would bear on average 6.02 children, an increase of about 20 percent.|$|R
