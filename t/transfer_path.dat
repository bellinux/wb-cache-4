It aims to reproduce binaural signals at a listener's ears via inverting acoustic <b>transfer</b> <b>paths.</b> The crosstalk cancellation filter should be updated in real time according to the head position. This demands high computational efficiency for a crosstalk cancellation algorithm. To reduce the computational cost, this paper proposes a stereo crosstalk cancellation system based on common-acoustical pole/zero (CAPZ) models. Because CAPZ models share one set of common poles and process their zeros individually, the computational complexity of crosstalk cancellation is cut down dramatically. In the proposed method, the acoustic <b>transfer</b> <b>paths</b> from loudspeakers to ears are approximated with CAPZ models, then the crosstalk cancellation filter is designed based on the CAPZ transfer functions. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to conventional methods, the proposed method can reduce computational cost with comparable crosstalk cancellation performance.|$|R

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tools in clinical diagnostics. MRI scanners are associated by strong vibration which results in unpleasant and disturbing acoustic noise. The primary source of this vibration is the Lorentz force produced by fast switching of the currents inside the gradient coils of MRI scanners under a strong static magnetic field. During an MR-imaging scan the switching is controlled in order to spatially code the hydrogen nuclei that will generate the signal, which is reconstructed into anatomical images. Faster switching of the currents allows for shorter scan times and/or higher image resolutions. Consequently, the clinical quality has motivated the drive for shorter switching time and higher currents. This development, however, has also caused an undesired increase of MRI vibrations. The overall vibration phenomenon of an installed fully functional MRI scanner system becomes unique because of the installed location and ambiance. This vibration can potentially degrade the image quality and hence the diagnosis. Apart from the vibration produced, the associated annoying acoustic noise may not only affect the patients under examination and the clinical staff, but may also be transmitted to other parts of the building and causing discomfort for the personnel working there. In order to devise an effective isolation plan or improve an existing one both for vibration and acoustic noise it is important to study the noise and vibration <b>transfer</b> <b>paths.</b> This paper concerns an investigation of vibration <b>transfer</b> <b>paths</b> for vibration excited by an installed functional MRI scanner at a medical facility.

In order to derive the service time of an I/O request, each blocking point is analyzed separately, using essentially a classical loss-system model. The advantages of the method are its relative simplicity and applicability to a large number of configurations.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{the original}} purpose of Rodos was to control satellites. It {{was designed as}} the brain of the Avionic system and introduces {{for the first time}} (2001) the NetworkCentric concept. A networkCentric core avionics machine consists of several harmonized components which work together to implement dependable computing in a simple way. In an NetworkCentric system we have a software network of BBs and a hardware Network interconnecting vehicles (radio communication), computers inside of vehicles (buses and point to point links), intelligent devices (attached to buses) and simple devices attached to front end computers. To communicate with (node) external units, including devices and other computing units, each node provides a gateway to the network and around the network's several devices (IO Devs and computing nodes) may be attached to the system. The messages exchange provided by the middleware and gateways is asynchronous, using the publisher-subscriber protocol. No fixed communication paths are established and the system can be reconfigured easily at run-time. For instance, several replicas of the same software can run in different nodes and publish the result using the same topic, without knowing each other. A voter may subscribe to that topic and vote on the correct result. Application can migrate from node to node or even to other vehicles without having to reconfigure the communication system. The core of the middleware distributes messages only locally, but using the integrated gateways to the NetworkCentric network, messages can reach any node and application in the network. The communication in the whole system includes software applications, computing nodes and even IO devices. Publishers make messages public under a given topic. Subscribers (zero, one or more) to a given topic get all messages which are published under this topic. As mentioned before, for this communication there is no difference in which node (computing unit or device) the publisher and subscribers are running and beyond this, they may be any combination of software tasks and hardware devices! To establish a <b>transfer</b> <b>path,</b> both the publisher and the subscriber must share the same topic.
