40|$|Summer {{mastitis}} is {{an acute}} suppurative bacterial {{infection of the}} udder in heifers and dry cows. To ascertain the possible role of flies in the transmission of the disease, experimental exposures of recipient heifers to Hydrotaea irritans previously exposed to bacteria were carried out. Flies were allowed to feed on secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis. The pathogens present were the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Actinomyces pyogenes, Stuart-Schwan cocci, Peptococcus indolicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacterioides species. The teats of eight heifers were exposed to flies with verified pathogen content. Two teats of each animal were deliberately damaged before fly exposure. One <b>teat</b> was <b>cut,</b> another pricked with insect needles to mimic insect bites. Two of the heifers developed summer mastiris in the quarters where <b>teats</b> had been <b>cut.</b> The bacterial species isolated from these quarters corresponded to those {{that had previously been}} fed to the flies. For the first time, it is now demonstrated that H. irritans is capable of transmitting summer mastitis pathogens and so causing summer mastitis in recipient heifers.

40|$|Nowadays space {{missions}} {{rely heavily}} on optical payloads {{to carry out a}} wide range of tasks including earth observation, weather monitoring, astrophysics research and communications. Until recently, the design of such systems was done according to design principles such as rotational symmetry as it simplifies the theory, reduces technological risks, manufacturing costs and <b>cuts</b> down <b>assembly,</b> integration and testing efforts. Nevertheless, the ever-growing need to develop more compact and lightweight payloads with enhanced performance often forces designers to adopt tilted off-axis configurations which break the rotational symmetry of the system. In such circumstances, rotationally symmetric optical surfaces cannot compensate the tilt-induced optical aberrations and thus no longer provide optimum performance over the complete field of view. The solution to this problem is to abandon the conventional approach and adopt a new design paradigmbased on the use of non-rotationally symmetric surfaces, also known as freeform optics. Most of the state-of-the-art methods used for the design of conventional optical payloads are not entirely suitable for freeform optics because: first of all, they were developed on the basis of rotational symmetry (which is no longer applicable) and secondly, because they do not cope well with the large amount of additional degrees of freedom that freeform optics usually entails. Therefore, this Master Thesis was devoted {{to the development of a}} novel methodology for the design and optimization of payloads based on freeform optics. Space Exploratio...|$|R
