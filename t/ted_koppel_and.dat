On July 7, 1983, she flew to Moscow with her parents, and spent two weeks as Andropov's guest. During the trip she visited Moscow and Leningrad and spent time in Artek, the main Soviet pioneer camp, {{in the town of}} Gurzuf on the Crimean Peninsula. Smith wrote in her book that in Leningrad she and her parents were amazed by the {{friendliness}} of the people and by the presents many people made for them. Speaking at a Moscow press conference, she declared that the Russians were [...] "just like us". In Artek, Smith chose to stay with the Soviet children rather than accept the privileged accommodations offered to her. For ease of communication, teachers and children who spoke fluent English were chosen to stay in the building where she was lodged. Smith shared a dormitory with nine other girls, and spent her time there swimming, talking and learning Russian songs and dances. While there, she made many friends, including Natasha Kashirina from Leningrad, a fluent English speaker.|$|E

5000|$|Over the decades, Neuman has {{frequently}} been referenced in outside media, {{and his face}} has often appeared in political cartoons as a shorthand for unquestioning stupidity. During the administration of United States President George W. Bush, Neumans features were frequently merged with those of Bush by editorial cartoonists such as Mike Luckovich and Tom Tomorrow. The image has also appeared on magazine covers, notably The Nation. A large Bush/Neuman poster {{was part of the}} Washington protests that accompanied Bushs 2001 inauguration. The alleged resemblance between the two has been noted more than once by Hillary Clinton. On July 10, 2005, speaking at the Aspen Institutes Ideas Festival, she said, [...] "I sometimes feel that Alfred E. Neuman is in charge in Washington," [...] referring to Bushs purported [...] "What, me worry?" [...] attitude. At the October 2008 Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama joked, [...] "Its often been said that I share the politics of Alfred E. Smith and the ears of Neuman." [...] Neumans features have also been compared to others in the public eye, including Prince Charles, <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> Oliver North <b>and</b> David Letterman.|$|R

50|$|Rohde's capture was not {{initially}} admitted by the Bosnian Serb authorities, who gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} he had been detained and where he was being held. Five days after he was taken prisoner, the Bosnian Serb news agency issued a statement on his capture. The US Government subsequently brought to bear intense diplomatic pressure to release him. A key role was played by Kati Marton, an author and journalist married to the US envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was negotiating with the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević to end the Bosnian War. Marton, who was at the time the chairwoman of the Committee to Protect Journalists, intervened repeatedly during the talks that led to the Dayton Agreement to persuade Milošević to use his influence to secure Rohde's release. The US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was also involved in pressing for Rohde's release at the Dayton talks. A variety of other political and journalistic figures were also involved in campaigning on Rohde's behalf, including Senator Bob Dole, Peter Jennings, <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> <b>and</b> David Frost. Rohde was subsequently pardoned by order of the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić in what Karadžić characterized as a goodwill gesture.|$|E
