5|$|Two free {{practice}} sessions were held before qualifying, running for 45 and 30 minutes respectively. The first session started at 08:15 local time, with Sébastien Buemi topping the <b>timesheets</b> for e.dams-Renault {{in a time}} of 1:23.158. The track got faster as the temperatures rose and more cars drove around the circuit; lap times improved by more than a second in the second session, which started at 10:30. This time, it was championship leader Lucas di Grassi who topped the <b>timesheets</b> with a lap time of 1:22.032.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg topped the <b>timesheets,</b> setting a time of 1m41.983s, {{finishing}} more than {{a tenth of a}} second ahead of Hamilton. Third fastest was Sergio Pérez for Force India, although he was unable to run in the last twenty minutes of the session due to brake issues. The Red Bull drivers Kvyat and Ricciardo were fourth and sixth respectively, while Fernando Alonso came within one second of Rosberg's time in ninth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton topped the <b>timesheets</b> once again, setting {{a time of}} 1:44.352, {{a quarter of a}} second clear of {{teammate}} Rosberg. Hülkenberg was third for Force India ahead of Ricciardo and Vettel. The session saw several incidents: Bottas damaged the floor of his car when he ran over a drain cover on his installation lap and was forced to miss the rest of the session; Felipe Massa made contact with the wall, but was later able to rejoin practice; Räikkönen's track time was limited as well due to a loss of power; and a red flag period occurred right after the chequered flag fell as Pérez crashed at turn 15.|$|E

5|$|Nico Rosberg {{topped the}} <b>timesheets</b> on Friday, {{ahead of the}} two Red Bull cars of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. The session started on a very wet track, but with no more rain falling, it dried out as the {{practice}} progressed, with drivers soon switching to intermediate tyres. Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest, behind Carlos Sainz Jr.. Despite going off the track late in the session, Fernando Alonso was ninth fastest in the McLaren with the new power unit. A gearbox problem meant that Pastor Maldonado was unable {{to take to the}} track, while at Sauber, Raffaele Marciello replaced Felipe Nasr, ending the session three-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Marcus Ericsson.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} <b>timesheets</b> in second {{practice}} on Friday afternoon {{with a time}} of 1:37.583, using the super-soft compound. Earlier in the session, he had suffered a spin in turn four that flat-spotted his tyres and sent him back to the pitlane. Rosberg managed only third fastest as the Mercedes drivers were split by Sebastian Vettel, even though the latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him track time. Rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on the soft-compound tyre due to his super-soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by Romain Grosjean. Behind the top three, Kimi Räikkönen was again fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas. Slowest of the session was Sauber's Marcus Ericsson, with the two Manor drivers Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein slotting in ahead of him. Wehrlein reported a loss of power after crossing the chequered flag {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two usually {{take place on}} Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, in order to minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session on Thursday morning, Lewis Hamilton topped the <b>timesheets</b> {{with a time of}} 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He {{was the only one of}} the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake lockup at the same spot, but was able to get into the run-off area without touching the guardrail. Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A drain cover had come loose around the first corner, puncturing Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.|$|E

Williams was the second team in terms of kilometres covered and showed some reliability, but were off pace from front-runners Red Bull, Ferrari, and McLaren.|$|E
25|$|Brawn GP {{gave the}} BGP 001 its first test at the Circuit de Catalunya on 9 March 2009, topping the <b>timesheets</b> {{early on in}} the first session, {{eventually}} finishing the session in fourth. On day two, Rubens Barrichello took over and completed 111 laps, finishing third in the standings. This was followed by Button topping the <b>timesheets</b> on the third day by over a second clear of Felipe Massa's Ferrari, completing 130 laps. In response, Massa hailed the BGP 001 as the most competitive pre-season car, stating that he does not think anyone can top their times and that Ferrari is currently less competitive than Brawn GP. On {{the final day of the}} test, Barrichello replicated the feat of his team-mate; topping the time sheets by over eight-tenths of a second from Nico Rosberg's Williams, completing 110 laps.|$|E
25|$|With {{the testing}} moving to Circuito de Jerez, Brawn {{continued}} {{to set the}} pace, six-tenths clear of Renault's Fernando Alonso, completing 107 laps. Alonso topped the <b>timesheets</b> on day two, edging Barrichello into second leaving Button third, as the drivers completed 74 laps between them. On the final day, Button topped once again, two-tenths clear of Rosberg with Nelson Piquet, Jr. and Lewis Hamilton further behind.|$|E

25|$|A twenty-minute warm-up {{session was}} held {{on the morning of}} the main race. Mortara again managed to squeeze out Ericsson to top the <b>timesheets,</b> with Coletti also being within a tenth of a second from the fastest time. Ricciardo was fourth ahead of Bottas, van der Zande, Sims, Chilton, Merhi and the {{qualification}} race winner Vernay. Ho and Boyd did not set times during the session, with the Ulsterman's Hitech Racing car looking unlikely to start the race after his accident on Saturday.|$|E
25|$|In Melbourne, Barrichello {{topped the}} <b>timesheets</b> {{in the first}} two {{elements}} of qualifying, but qualified second on the grid behind teammate Button. Despite a poor start caused by his engine slipping into anti-stall, he did well to recover and lost only a couple of positions at the start. However, he sustained damage to the front wing and rear diffuser in the first corner incident when he was bumped from behind by Heikki Kovalainen in his McLaren that saw him hit Mark Webber in the Red Bull damaging Webber's car as well as his hopes of a good finish. Despite this, Barrichello ultimately finished the race in second place after Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica collided with just 2 laps remaining. He started eighth in Malaysia after getting a grid penalty for a gearbox change and finished the race in fifth place after the race was abandoned at Sepang due to heavy rain.|$|E
25|$|The {{final mass}} test session {{before the new}} season {{took place at the}} Circuit de Catalunya in Montmeló, just north of Barcelona over 25 February–27. All the teams, with the {{exception}} of Super Aguri attended this three-day test which was affected by rain on the first day. On day one, Lewis Hamilton of McLaren was fastest having recorded a lap of 1:22.276, followed closely by the Ferraris of Räikkönen and former seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. Hamilton continued to top the charts on the second day, with new teammate, Kovalainen second. Räikkönen was third on a 1:21.722, having been joined at the track by his teammate Felipe Massa. Massa's best lap of 1:22.513 was only good enough for fifth place, with Kazuki Nakajima's Williams splitting the Ferraris. On the final day, the Toyota of Jarno Trulli topped the <b>timesheets</b> with the fastest lap of the test, recording a lap of 1:20.801 during a qualifying run. Second was the Red Bull mount of David Coulthard, having missed the previous day's running due to requiring treatment on a trapped nerve.|$|E

500|$|Comer and Edelen {{released}} {{the report on}} their joint probe on April 30, 2012. It detailed a [...] "toxic culture of entitlement" [...] in the agriculture department under Farmer, charging that he had required state employees to conduct personal errands while on the clock, failed to report gifts in excess of $200 as required by state ethics laws, and signed <b>timesheets</b> authorizing payment to friends in the department [...] including his girlfriend [...] who had performed very little if any work. Edelen confirmed that his investigation indicated that laws had been broken, and the report {{was turned over to}} the state attorney general for investigation. Minutes after the report was released, Farmer's lawyer made a public statement in which he opined, [...] "I don't see anything in this audit report that any law-enforcement agency is going to be excited about." [...] He conceded that Farmer had declined to be interviewed during the investigation but felt it was unfair that Farmer was not given a chance to review or comment on the final report prior to its release.|$|E

However, his stay at the top was also short-lived as 's Maarten Tjallingii went three seconds quicker to move {{to the top of the}} <b>timesheets.</b> [...] sprinter Borut Božič was the next rider to assume the stage lead, as he set a time of 3' 40"; his time was ultimately good enough for a final placing of eighth. Božič's time provided a stiff test for the majority of the field, as his time held on at the top for over half an hour, but Peter Velits (...) ultimately went quicker by less than a second to take the lead.|$|E
500|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race [...] two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. During the first practice session the track was wet following early-morning rain, and shortly after the session started, further precipitation made the track even wetter, although it did begin to dry out as the session progressed. Hamilton was fastest in this session ahead of his teammate Kovalainen. The Ferraris of Massa and Räikkönen came third and fifth respectively, with Renault's Fernando Alonso sandwiched between them in fourth place. Kubica spun off the track and Sébastien Bourdais had a mechanical problem with his flywheel sensor {{towards the end of}} the session. Both ended up at the bottom of the <b>timesheets</b> as a result of these problems. Friday's second session was held in dry conditions. Hamilton again set the fastest time. Massa and Räikkönen improved to second and third positions, pushing Kovalainen down to fourth. Mark Webber set the fifth-fastest time, after earlier having electrical and clutch problems with the car. Alonso, Nico Rosberg, Kubica, Heidfeld and David Coulthard made up the rest of the top ten.|$|E

500|$|On March 18, 2013, the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 state ethics violations, {{the most}} ever {{registered}} against a single individual; the previous high was 16. Most {{of the charges}} against him stemmed from the previous year's auditor's report, but previously unreported charges included conspiring with his sister Rhonda, who was also charged, to falsify records submitted to Rhonda's employer, the Registry of Election Finance. Farmer's girlfriend was also charged for falsifying <b>timesheets.</b> These charges were followed by five indictments by a federal grand jury on April 19, 2013, alleging four counts of converting state funds and property to personal use and one count of soliciting a bribe in exchange for a state grant. U.S. Attorney Kerry B. Harvey said a federal investigation revealed that Farmer had created jobs in the department for his friends and girlfriend, who conducted personal errands for Farmer [...] including [...] "building a basketball court for Farmer, placing flooring in Farmer's attic and organizing Farmer's personal effects" [...] while on the clock. He also said that Farmer had kept some of the gifts ordered in conjunction with the 2008 Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture conference for his own use and allowed his family to stay in hotel rooms reserved for agriculture department employees at the Kentucky State Fair. The indictment did not specify what bribe was sought in exchange for a grant to conduct an all-terrain vehicle safety class, but the charges from the state Ethics Commission mentioned that Farmer had received three all-terrain vehicles in exchange for awarding unspecified state grants. A Lexington Herald-Leader report noted that the indictment only included events from 2008 forward because the statute of limitations had expired for any actions prior to 2008.|$|E
