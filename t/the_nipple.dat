5|$|The areolar glands {{are in the}} areola that {{surrounds}} <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> in the female breast. These glands secrete an oily fluid that lubricates <b>the</b> <b>nipple,</b> and also secrete volatile compounds that are thought {{to serve as an}} olfactory stimulus for the newborn. During pregnancy and lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in <b>the</b> <b>Nipple</b> Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E
50|$|Double {{incision}} {{is usually}} accompanied by free nipple grafts to make male-looking <b>nipples.</b> <b>The</b> areola and <b>nipple</b> {{is removed from}} the breast tissue, cutting away along the circumference and removing the top layer of flesh {{from the rest of the}} tissue. After the chest has been reconstructed, <b>the</b> <b>nipples</b> are grafted on in the appropriate male position. The areolas are often sized down as well as <b>the</b> <b>nipples</b> themselves, as female areolas are often larger in circumference and <b>the</b> <b>nipples</b> protrude farther.|$|R

25|$|Very rarely, nipple {{pain can}} be caused by {{vasospasm}} of <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b> In essence, blood does not flow properly to <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> which causes <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> to blanch. This {{can be caused}} by trauma to <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> through early breastfeeding or candidal infection of <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b> The pain is intense during the latch stage and in between breastfeeding sessions there is a throbbing pain when <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> is blanched. <b>The</b> <b>nipple</b> can be massaged to help blood flow return to reduce pain, as well as avoiding cold. In some instances, heart medication, nifedipine, is used to help the blood flow return to <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b>|$|E
25|$|Grade II: Moderate ptosis — <b>The</b> <b>nipple</b> {{is located}} below the IMF; yet some lower-pole breast tissue hangs lower than <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Breast eczema (also {{known as}} [...] "Nipple eczema") may affect <b>the</b> <b>nipples,</b> areolae, or {{surrounding}} skin, with eczema of <b>the</b> <b>nipples</b> being of <b>the</b> moist type with oozing and crusting, in which painful fissuring is frequently seen, especially in nursing mothers. It will often occur in pregnancy even without breast feeding.|$|R

25|$|The vixen {{has four}} pairs of teats. Each teat has 8 to 20 lactiferous ducts, which connect the mammary gland to <b>the</b> <b>nipple,</b> {{allowing}} for milk {{to be carried}} to <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} reduction mammoplasty {{procedure is}} determined by the volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) to be resected (cut and removed) from each breast, and the degree of breast ptosis present: Pseudoptosis (sagging of the inferior pole of the breast; <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> is at or above the inframammary fold); Grade I: Mild ptosis (<b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> is below the IMF, but above the lower pole of the breast); Grade II: Moderate ptosis (<b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> is below the IMF; yet some lower-pole breast tissue hangs lower than the nipple); Grade III: Severe ptosis (<b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> is far below the IMF; no breast tissue is below <b>the</b> <b>nipple).</b> The full, corrective outcome of the surgical re-establishment of a bodily-proportionate bust becomes evident at 6-months to 1-year post-operative, during which period the reduced and lifted breast tissues settle upon and into the chest. The post-operative convalescence is weeks long, depending upon the corrections performed; and some women might experience painful breast-enlargement during the first post-operative menstruation.|$|E

25|$|Inverted or {{retracted}} nipples {{sometimes make}} {{attachment to the}} breast difficult. These mothers need additional support to feed their babies. Treatment is started {{after the birth of}} the baby. <b>The</b> <b>nipple</b> is manually stretched out several times a day.

25|$|Another {{reported}} symptom {{complex of}} breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema, such as redness, discoloration, or mild flaking of <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b> Approximately half of women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.|$|E

50|$|Check <b>the</b> <b>nipples.</b> <b>The</b> {{sensitivity}} of the skin on <b>the</b> <b>nipples</b> and breasts helps the mother's breasts respond to the baby and helps the mother know how much milk to make. When the baby is latched correctly, the bottom part of the areola is also {{in his or her}} mouth. But a shallow latch, even if it doesn't hurt right away, will start to hurt soon. A poorly latched baby has to work harder to get the milk out.|$|R
50|$|Nipples: <b>The</b> <b>nipples</b> {{are absent}} or rudimentary. The breasts may be small or {{virtually}} absent.|$|R
25|$|Latching on {{refers to}} how the baby fastens onto the breast while breastfeeding. A good latch means that {{the bottom of the}} areola (the area around <b>the</b> <b>nipple)</b> is in the baby's mouth and <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> is back inside his or her mouth. A poor latch happens when the baby does not have enough of the breast in his/her mouth or is too close to the tip. This can cause cracked nipples and a {{reluctance}} to continue to breastfeed.|$|E
25|$|Grade I: Mild ptosis — <b>The</b> <b>nipple</b> {{is located}} below the inframammary fold (IMF), but remains located above the lower pole of the breast.|$|E

25|$|Milk {{ejection}} reflex/Letdown reflex: In lactating (breastfeeding) mothers, oxytocin acts at the mammary glands, causing milk to be 'let down' into subareolar sinuses, {{from where}} it can be excreted via <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b> Suckling by the infant at <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> is relayed by spinal nerves to the hypothalamus. The stimulation causes neurons that make oxytocin to fire action potentials in intermittent bursts; these bursts result in the secretion of pulses of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve terminals of the pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|Morphologically {{the breast}} is tear-shaped. The superﬁcial tissue layer (superficial fascia) is {{separated}} from the skin by 0.5–2.5cm of subcutaneous fat (adipose tissue). The suspensory Cooper's ligaments are fibrous-tissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope. The female adult breast contains 14–18 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge at <b>the</b> <b>nipple.</b> The 2.0–4.5mm milk ducts are immediately surrounded with dense connective tissue that support the glands. Milk exits the breast through <b>the</b> <b>nipple,</b> which {{is surrounded by a}} pigmented area of skin called the areola. The size of the areola can vary widely among women. The areola contains modified sweat glands known as Montgomery's glands. These glands secrete oily fluid that lubricate and protect <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> during breastfeeding. Volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for the newborn's appetite.|$|E
25|$|The {{plastic surgeon}} delineates the mastopexy incision-plan upon the patient’s breasts and torso; the {{principal}} corrective consideration {{is the correct}} level of the nipple-areola complex upon the breast hemisphere. In most women, <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> should be located at, or slightly above, the inframammary fold, because emplacing it too high might later lead to a difficult revision surgery. The proper topographic locale for <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> is determined by transposing the semicircular line of the inframammary fold to {{the face of the}} breast (anterior aspect), thereby configuring a circle, wherein the nipple-areola complex is centred. After determining <b>the</b> <b>nipple</b> locale, the surgeon delineates the remaining skin incisions of the correction, while maintaining the inferior limit of the vertical-incision at a distance above the pre-operative inframammary-fold, which precaution avoids extending the surgical scar to the chest wall after the lifting of the breast and the inframammary fold.|$|E
25|$|The skin of {{children}} becomes darker {{as they go}} through puberty and experience the effects of sex hormones. This darkening is especially noticeable in the skin of <b>the</b> <b>nipples,</b> <b>the</b> areola of <b>the</b> <b>nipples,</b> <b>the</b> labia majora in females, and the scrotum in males. In some people, the armpits become slightly darker during puberty. The interaction of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors on skin coloration with age is still not adequately understood, but {{it is known that}} men are at their darkest baseline skin color around the age of 30, without considering the effects of tanning. Around the same age, women experience darkening of some areas of their skin.|$|R
50|$|Social {{conventions}} requiring {{females to}} cover their breasts in public has been widespread throughout history and across cultures. Contemporary Western cultures usually regard the exposure of <b>the</b> <b>nipples</b> and areolae as immodest and is sometimes prosecuted as indecent exposure. However, the covering of <b>the</b> <b>nipples</b> and areolae in some manner is regarded as sufficient to maintain modesty and decency, at least within the letter if not {{the spirit of the}} censors' guidelines.|$|R
