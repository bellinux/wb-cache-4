5|$|The widowed Vernal {{remarried}} to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, {{remained with}} Margaret. With {{most of his}} time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand gleanings from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl {{to the point where he}} feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was rough handling of one of the children. Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After she eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.|$|E

40|$|How {{people use}} assistive {{technologies}} {{depends on how}} they relate to them. As technologies such as assistive robots are developed - that have a physical presence, some autonomy, {{and the ability to}} adapt and communicate - <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> people have with them will become more complex and may take on some of the characteristics of <b>the</b> social <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> we have with each other. In this paper, we compare <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> people form with assistive devices to the bonds we develop with people, pets, and objects.

25|$|Adele {{began writing}} 21 in April 2009, when still {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying {{herself as the}} musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely {{due to a lack}} of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.|$|E

In the May issue of Alternative Press, former bassist Pete Mosely revealed he was contacted by Parsons about rejoining before the band reconvened, but ultimately decided not to reunite {{with the rest of}} Yellowcard. He stated that his fallout with Ryan Key was a primary reason, saying that he wished to regain <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> they once had.

25|$|The {{strain of}} this period, serving as both ACTU President and Labor Party President, {{took its toll}} on Hawke and in 1979 he {{suffered}} a physical collapse. This shock led Hawke to publicly announce his alcoholism in a television interview, {{and that he would}} make a concerted – and ultimately successful – effort to overcome it. He was helped through this period by <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> he had established with writer Blanche d'Alpuget, who, in 1982, published a biography of Hawke. His popularity with the public was, if anything, enhanced by this period of rehabilitation, and opinion polling suggested that he was a far more popular public figure than either Labor Leader Bill Hayden or Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.|$|E

25|$|Ricasoli choose Sangiovese to be {{the base}} of Chianti because it {{provided}} the most aromatics. Canaiolo brought fruitiness to the wine that soften the tannins of Sangiovese without lessening the aromatics. The addition of the white wine grape Malvasia was to provide further softening. Wine expert Hugh Johnson noted that <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> Ricasoli describes between Sangiovese and Canaiolo has some parallels to how Cabernet Sauvignon is softened by the fruit of Merlot in the traditional Bordeaux style blend. Ricasoli continued with his winemaking endeavors until 1848 when his wife died. Stricken by grief, he had little desire for his vineyards or his wine. During this time the tides of the Risorgimento were growing stronger and Ricasoli {{found himself in the}} political arena which would eventually lead to him becoming the Prime Minister of Italy.|$|E
500|$|Røkke and Gjelsten {{appointed}} a new club chairman, Charles Koppel, in January 2001. According to Stephen Morrow in The People's Game?: Football, Finance and Society (2003), Koppel {{had never been}} to a football match before becoming involved with Wimbledon and [...] "gave the impression of being completely unaware of <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> exists between a football club and its supporters."

In the former, Chomsky argues, the U.S. has allied itself with the capitalist reformers who have advocated privatization and neoliberalism {{at the expense of the}} welfare state, leading to increased poverty and demographic decline across the region. In the latter, he has explored the role that the U.S. has played – through the likes of the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 – in supporting capitalist development, but trying to ensure its own economic hegemony at the same time.|$|E

[...] Clarke also hinted that she expected to [...] "get to play with some more dragons!" [...] in the second season, based on her conversations with book author and executive producer George R.R.

Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice described the song as a spare, suspenseful, violent torch song with a literal title. The Los Angeles Times Todd Martens wrote that although the song's lyrics are vague and find people speculating, they [...] "hint at a situation one probably doesn't {{want to be in}} the middle of". Sasha Resende of The Michigan Daily wrote [...] "the ballad, which employs reckless gunplay as a not-so-subtle metaphor for a troubled relationship, achieves its seemingly morbid intent." ...|$|E

500|$|The synergy between Taylor Street’s Little Italy and the Hull House complex; i.e., the {{settlement}} {{house and its}} summer camp, the Bowen Country Club, is well documented.

[...] A review of the ethnic composition of those who registered for and utilized the services provided by the Hull House complex, during its 74 years as a tenant of the near-west side, suggests an ethnic bias.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Promiscuous" [...] {{describe}} {{the two sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> the song's protagonist deals with. It {{was one of the first}} songs Furtado wrote with labelmate Timothy [...] "Attitude" [...] Clayton. Furtado called their teamwork something she [...] "had never done before" [...] because she saw the writing process as [...] "extremely freeing" [...] because of his different approach and style. Clayton helped Furtado experiment with interpreting the [...] "promiscuous girl" [...] character and the two-sided relationship she is in. Furtado also described that in the process of writing lyrics [...] "we were actually flirting, which is why the song is so playful" [...] and that she and Clayton nicknamed the song 'The BlackBerry Song', because everything we say in the song you could text-message to somebody". Because of the preponderant musical influence of artists such as Talking Heads, Blondie, Madonna, The Police and Eurythmics, whom producers Timbaland and Danja listened to during the writing of the album, [...] "Promiscuous" [...] takes inspiration from pop music of the 1980s. The sexuality was based on the [...] "strong women in control" [...] of the 1990s, such as Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Yo-Yo, Salt-n-Pepa and TLC.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and filmed in Lake Como, Italy. [...] "It was obvious I was gonna ask her to do it", Stefani stated {{in an interview with}} VH1's Box Set.

González and his new girlfriend—played by Tony Kanal's girlfriend, Erin Lokitz—are shown walking up to a villa where Stefani answers the door. The villa featured in the video is the Villa Erba, in the town of Cernobbio, which Stefani said was [...] "so beautiful". The three of them are seen in each other's company, with intercut scenes of Stefani singing on a bed. There are flashbacks to the time when Stefani and her former boyfriend were dating, where she has brunette hair. Flashbacks and present day images are linked with match cut cinematography.
