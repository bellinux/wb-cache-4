After defeating each Robot Master a password is displayed, allowing the player to return <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> point in the game after restarting the system. The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, {{as well as the}} number of accumulated Energy Tanks. Unlike the first game, Mega Man 2 does not feature a score counter, and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed.|$|E

The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows versions of NBA 2K14 featured a mode titled Path to Greatness; similar to the Jordan Challenge mode, it focuses on the career of LeBron James.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{a wave of}} {{seemingly}} noble sounding surnames began to appear among the common population, where {{a significant number of}} the bourgeoisie class, and even the peasantry, began to adopt or bear the noble -ski suffix. The -ski suffix was thus attached to surnames derived from a person's occupation, characteristics, patronymic surnames, or toponymic surnames (from a person's place of residence, birth or family origin). This caused a blur between the -ski bearing territorial toponymic surnames once a characteristic only borne by the nobility. As such, and contrary to a popular modern-day misconception, a person simply bearing the -ski suffix in their family surname or merely sharing the same toponymic surname as members of Poland's nobility, does not in itself denote that person too {{is a member of the}} nobility, of noble origin, or indeed connected <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> family.|$|E

25|$|The Holocaust by bullets (as {{opposed to}} the Holocaust by gas) {{went on in the}} {{territory}} of occupied Poland in conjunction with the ghetto uprisings, irrespective of death camps' quota. In two weeks of July 1942 the Słonim Ghetto revolt crushed with the help of Latvian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian Schutzmannschaft cost the lives of 8,000–13,000 Jews. The second largest mass shooting (<b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> date) took place in late October 1942 when the insurgency was suppressed in the Pińsk Ghetto; over 26,000 men, women and children were shot with the aid of Belarusian Auxiliary Police before the ghetto's closure. During the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (the largest single revolt by Jews during World WarII), 13,000 Jews were killed in action before May 1943. Numerous other uprisings were quelled without impacting the pre-planned Nazi deportations actions.|$|E
25|$|Bozděch elected {{instead to}} carry the dog instead rather than killing {{him as one of}} the others suggested, and after a while they began to take turns {{carrying}} Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E
25|$|Hastings, {{while being}} no great detective himself, serves Poirot in many ways. A former British Army officer in World War I, he is brave. He has courage {{and is often}} used by Poirot for {{physical}} duties such as catching and subduing a criminal. Poirot likes to tease Hastings about being dim-witted at times, but he clearly enjoys the Captain's company. In The Mysterious Affair at Styles and The ABC Murders, Hastings plays {{a prominent role in}} the resolution of the mystery, with a casual observation that leads Poirot to the guilty party: In case of the former, by mentioning that Poirot had to straighten some spill holders and ornaments in Styles, he prompts Poirot to realise that someone had moved them, causing Poirot to discover a crucial piece of evidence. In case of the latter, he suggests that the error in recipient address of a letter by the murderer was deliberate, thus causing Poirot to realise the murderer had attached greater importance <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> murder.|$|E

According to Sheeran, the song [...] "is {{a good way to}} end both that period and that relationship". In [...] "One", Sheeran finds himself bidding farewell to a former love interest. Sheeran takes a minimal approach on this ballad, which is characterised with softly strummed acoustic guitar.|$|E
500|$|While {{a variety}} of {{theories}} have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning [...] "village" [...] or [...] "settlement". In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier {{to the village of}} Stadacona. Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> village, but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the levels}} have {{multiple}} pathways and open areas, which allow players {{to explore and}} find collectibles and secrets throughout the levels. Many of these collectibles {{can be used as}} part of Dooms progression system, including weapon mods, rune powers, and Praetor Suit upgrades. Weapon points come from field drones and allow the player to unlock alternate modes of fire for many weapons, such as explosive shots and different rate and output of firepower. Each of the weapons' firing modes can be further upgraded using weapon tokens, but they can only be maxed out by completing a challenge related <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> firing mode. Runes transport the player to a separate arena to perform a combat challenge that grants different abilities when successfully completed, such as better equipment drops from fallen enemies. Players can also upgrade their [...] "Praetor Suit" [...] by retrieving special tokens from dead marines and using them to improve functionality such as equipment, navigation and resistances. Other pickups include small Doomguy figurines and data files that expand on the characters and story.|$|E

500|$|Single-player mode {{provides}} the player {{with a variety}} of side-scrolling fighting challenges. The applicable modes range from the [...] "Classic mode", which involves the player battling against opponents in multiple acts until he or she reaches the boss character, to the [...] "Home Run Contest", which is a minigame involving the player trying to launch a sandbag as far as possible with a Home Run Bat. Some of these modes are personalized for the character; for example, the [...] "Target Test" [...] sets out a specialized area for a character in which they aim to destroy ten targets in the least amount of time they can. These areas may include references <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> character's past and legacy. The [...] "Board the Platforms" [...] minigame from the prequel was not included in Melee.

500|$|Adopting {{the color}} of their {{favorite}} charioteers was a way fans showed their loyalty <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> racer or faction. Many of the young men in the fan clubs, or factions, adopted extravagant clothing and hairstyles, such as billowing sleeves, [...] "Hunnic" [...] hair-styles, and [...] "Persian" [...] facial hair. There is evidence that these young men were the faction members most prone to violence and extreme factional rivalry. Some scholars have tried to argue that the factional rivalry and violence was a result of opposing religious or political views, but more likely the young men simply identified strongly with their faction for group solidarity. The factional violence was probably engaged in similarly to the violence of modern football or soccer fans. The games themselves were the usual focus of the factional violence, even when it was taken to the streets. Although fans who went to the hippodrome cheered on their favorite charioteers, their loyalty appears to be to the color for which the charioteer drove more than for the individual driver. Charioteers could change faction allegiance and race for different colors during their careers, but the fans didn't change their allegiance to their color.|$|E
500|$|The Constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia [...] "commit Anglicans to {{mainstream}} Christian orthodoxy", but its ruling principles direct it <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> tradition within as [...] "represented by the Church of England". The Australian church {{had to work}} out the meaning of its common heritage [...] "in the context of the different cultures of the separate colonies" [...] but [...] "the way in which that faith pedigree was appealed to and interpreted... has highlighted differences." [...] Peter Carnley, former primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, has described Anglicanism's [...] "unique or essential identity" [...] as having [...] "not so much a body of theological teaching, as a style of theological reflection" [...] that goes back to the Elizabethan theologian Richard Hooker. St James' conforms to this Anglican tradition, part of which is a general dislike {{of what used to be}} referred to as 'Enthusiasm': that is, a dislike of [...] "pious individualism and emotional exuberance". St James' theological position in the liturgy is evidently consistent with Carnley's explanation that incarnational reality [...] "might be experienced with the aid of aesthetic, symbolic or sacramental aids to worship." [...] Such an adherence to the importance of the sacred and the sublime in worship remains in sharp contradistinction to practice in the surrounding mostly evangelical diocese, which typically eschews beauty and holds to an [...] "ultra-low ecclesiastical aesthetic" [...] that is combined with [...] "ultra-conservative social values". Teaching at St James' takes account of both the Biblical and contemporary historical context. In the Sydney diocese, St James's differing view has therefore been controversial since the 19th century as the various rectors led the church towards and away from Anglo-Catholicism. Micklem, for example, renewed Anglo-Catholic churchmanship and Davidson [...] "returned it firmly to a moderate position".|$|E
