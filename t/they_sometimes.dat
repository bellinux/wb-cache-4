5|$|Most are carnivores, {{feeding on}} annelids, clams and crustaceans, and may kill annelids of {{about their own}} size. <b>They</b> <b>sometimes</b> take fish, both living and dead. Insects and myriapods are the only known prey of the two {{terrestrial}} species of Argonemertes.|$|E
50|$|Tugging The Worm, 1987, 10 min, 16mm. original, hand drawn. The {{story of}} {{characters}} that enjoy seeing murders acted out for entertainment. They talk about going places and eating things. They dream of spending their life with someone or {{getting away from}} the one with whom they're spending their life. They are told to be safe they must not touch; yet <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> touch. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> strike. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> dance. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> hold it all in.|$|R

60|$|It's always risky work {{waiting for}} other people to die and leave you money. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> don't die; <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> marry agin; and <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> leave it to other people instead.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of arts {{societies}} within the college. Most notable is Castle Theatre Company, which produces a play each term. These plays are usually performed on the college's grounds, although <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> tour nationally. They have also appeared at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas are {{generally}} encountered in pairs or small groups, though young birds may gather {{in groups of}} 20 or more outside the breeding season. <b>They</b> <b>sometimes</b> share the company of eastern rosellas. They fly in a straight line, making rapid shallow wingbeats and gliding briefly in between.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{died from}} sepsis on 14 June 1922, at the ancestral {{home of his}} wife at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, England. His obituarists {{ascribed}} this to an obscure form of blood poisoning brought on by gassing in the trenches during his war service. However, his ailments, including fatigue, heartdigestiveneurological disorders, appendicitis, cognitive problems, depression, anxiety — are today recognised as differential symptoms of malaria. Left untreated <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> lead to organ failure and death.|$|E

5|$|In the First World War, firing and {{observation}} positions were hand-painted in disruptive patterns by artists known as camoufleurs, and <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> varied their patterns seasonally. Uniforms were largely {{of a single}} colour, such as the British khaki; but snow camouflage clothes came into use in some armies by 1917. For example, Austro-Hungarian troops on the Italian front used skis and wore snow camouflage smocks and overtrousers over their uniforms, and improvised white cloths over their uniform caps.|$|E
5|$|Inari's kitsune are white, a {{color of}} good omen. They possess {{the power to}} ward off evil, and <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> serve as {{guardian}} spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene {{on behalf of the}} locals and particularly to aid against troublesome nogitsune, those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.|$|E
5|$|Sejmiks {{had become}} an {{important}} part of the Commonwealth's parliamentary life, complementing the role of general sejm. <b>They</b> <b>sometimes</b> provided detailed implementations for general proclamations of sejms, or made legislative decisions during periods when the Sejm was not in session, at times communicating directly with the monarch.|$|E
50|$|They {{are also}} said to appear above water, {{and from this}} <b>they</b> are <b>sometimes</b> called a type of funayūrei. In the Nara Prefecture, <b>they</b> are <b>sometimes</b> seen {{to be the same}} as the kaika janjanbi.|$|R

5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater {{is usually}} seen singly, in pairs, {{or in small}} family groups when not migrating. They forage as individuals, as pairs or as small groups of up to ten birds, and during {{migration}} in larger groups. <b>They</b> <b>sometimes</b> feed in large mixed-species foraging flocks composed predominately of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|Yellowhammers of the British and Irish race, E. c. caliginosa were {{introduced}} to New Zealand by local acclimatisation societies in 1862, and soon spread over the main islands. <b>They</b> <b>sometimes</b> visit New Zealand's subantarctic islands, although rarely staying to breed, and have reached Australia's Lord Howe Island {{on a number of}} occasions. At the beginning of the 20th century, this bunting was seen as a serious agricultural pest in its adopted country.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E
60|$|The rate {{of motion}} in waterspouts varies. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>they</b> revolve slowly, <b>sometimes</b> {{with the utmost}} rapidity. They often produce violent noise, as, indeed, might be expected; and they are {{generally}} accompanied by thunder and lightning, though not invariably so, for <b>they</b> are <b>sometimes</b> observed when the heavens are clear and the sea calm.|$|R

5|$|Capybaras are gregarious. While <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> live solitarily, {{they are}} more {{commonly}} found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist {{of as many as}} 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{is home to}} {{only three}} species: D. intermedia, D. anglica, and D. rotundifolia. Where the ranges of the two latter species overlap, <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{hybridize}} to form the sterile D. × obovata. In addition to the three species and the hybrid native to Europe, North America {{is also home to}} four additional species; D. brevifolia is a small annual native to coastal states from Texas to Virginia, while D. capillaris, a slightly larger plant with a similar range, is also found in areas of the Caribbean. The third species, D. linearis, is native to the northern United States and southern Canada. D. filiformis has two subspecies native to the East Coast of North America, the Gulf Coast, and the Florida panhandle.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the time of Antigonus III Doson, the most elite Antigonid-period {{infantry}} were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> served in that capacity. Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected {{to serve in the}} elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The number of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men. They fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into chalkaspides (bronze shield) and leukaspides (white shield) regiments.|$|E

5|$|In third-person {{missions}} and occasionally some other types, a PDA is available. In the PDA the player can view {{their list of}} objectives (which can change {{over the course of}} a mission), maps of the area if available, a help screen and a list of weapons held with information on each. Characters also typically have cell phones which <b>they</b> <b>sometimes</b> receive calls on during missions. Some missions involve sniping using first-person shooter gameplay. These missions resemble the use of a sniper rifle during normal missions but the player cannot switch to a third-person view.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. They mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. <b>They</b> <b>sometimes</b> come into conflict with man when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} {{much more}} vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. <b>They</b> <b>sometimes</b> use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E

5000|$|About {{one quarter}} of the {{soldiers}} serving in the government armed forces during the civil war were under age 18. “Recruitment methods were brutal - sometimes children were abducted, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> were forced to kill members of their own families so as to make them outcasts, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> were drugged, <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> were forced into conscription by threatening family members.” Child soldiers were deliberately overwhelmed with violence “in order to completely desensitize them and make them mindless killing machines.” ...|$|R
