25|$|British railway {{companies}} {{have been reluctant to}} disclose figures for drawbar horsepower and have usually relied on continuous <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> instead.|$|E
25|$|With their {{comparatively}} high <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> (the Walschaerts A2 had {{a higher}} nominal <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> than any other VR locomotive, regardless of type, until {{the introduction of the}} C class 2-8-0 of 1918) they also saw widespread use as a fast goods locomotive, particularly in their later life. It was reported as normal practice as early as the 1920s for A2 class locomotives requiring adjustment to axle boxes (axleboxes) and other moving parts to be swapped from passenger to lower-speed freight service to extract greater work from them between overhauls.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is {{a measure}} of the {{heaviest}} load a locomotive can start or haul at very low speed over the ruling grade in a given territory. However, as the pressure grew to run faster goods and heavier passenger trains, <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> was seen to be an inadequate measure of performance because it did not take into account speed. Therefore, in the 20th century, locomotives began to be rated by power output. A variety of calculations and formulas were applied, but in general railways used dynamometer cars to measure tractive force at speed in actual road testing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} locomotive traction controllers {{based on}} proportional-integral and {{sliding mode control}} with a fuzzy logic creep reference generator; and compares their performance based on <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> under various operation speeds. The effect of change of wheel-rail friction conditions under different controllers is also investigated. In particular, a sliding mode traction controller based on a fuzzy logic creep reference generator is developed to tackle non-linearity and uncertainty due to the contact conditions and operation speeds. It is shown that at high-speed operation, the fuzzy logic based sliding mode controller can achieve higher tractive force with lower creep values...|$|R
50|$|Thomas Hill rebuilt {{nearly a}} dozen Fowler 0-4-0 diesel {{mechanical}} locos as 0-4-0DH, retaining the frame, running gear {{and some of the}} bodywork, fitting new engine and transmission and engine cover. These locos also were allocated works numbers with a 'c' suffix. A batch of 5 were ordered by the MoD - but trials with the first two failed to meet their specified <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> (the original locos were plain bearings whereas TH had calculated assuming roller bearings) and although accepting that they were far superior to the Fowler original, the MoD cancelled the balance of the order.|$|R
40|$|The {{realization}} of maximum adhesive forces for a railway vehicle {{is a very}} difficult process, because it involves using <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> and depends on friction characteristics in the contact zone between wheels and rails. <b>Tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> are realized by means of tractive torques of motors, and their maximum values can provide negative effects such as slip and skid. These situations usually happen when information about friction conditions is lacking. The negative processes have a major influence on wearing of contact bodies and tractive units. Therefore, many existing control systems for vehicles use an effect of a prediction of a friction coefficient between wheels and rails because measuring a friction coefficient at the moment of running vehicle movement is very difficult. One of the ways to solve this task is to use noise spectrum analysis for friction coefficient detection. This noise phenomenon has not been clearly studied and analyzed. In this paper, we propose an adhesion control system of railway vehicles based on an observer, which allows one to determine the maximum tractive torque based on the optimal adhesive force between the wheels (wheel pair) of a railway vehicle and rails (rail track) depending on weight load from a wheel to a rail, friction conditions in the contact zone, a lateral displacement of wheel set and wheel sleep. As a result, it allows a railway vehicle to be driven in a tractive mode by the maximum adhesion force for real friction conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSuspensions are the {{important}} machine element of rail road vehicle which absorb the shocks and vibration during tracking, curving and also protect the axle movement. The helical compression type of spring {{is used to}} allow axial deformation and also provide some lateral deformation at curvature. A freight rail vehicle has the frequent failure of primary suspension with major emphasis on the failure of composite spring of central axle of both frames. The failure investigation starts with the material analysis by experimentation for chemical composition for different failed specimen of springs using spectrometer. It is continued to the stress analysis {{with respect to the}} mechanical properties of material by analytical and finite element analysis at various loading conditions. The material and stress analysis revealed that the failure occurs due to design incompetency by increase of stresses at curvature and at maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> at various speed...|$|R
50|$|This is {{effectively}} an electric locomotive {{with a relatively}} small auxiliary diesel prime mover intended only for low-speed or short-distance operation (e.g. British Rail Class 73). Some of these, such as the British Rail Class 74, were converted from electric locomotives. The Southern Region of British Railways used these locomotives to cross non-electrified gaps and to haul boat trains that used tramways at the ports of Southampton and Weymouth. For economy, the diesel engine and its generator are considerably smaller than the electric capacity. The Southern types were of 1,600 hp or 'Type 3' rating as electrics, but only 600 hp as diesels. Later classes had as much as 2,500 hp on electric power, but still the same diesel engines. Despite this large difference, their comparable <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> were much closer (around three-quarters as diesels) and so they could start and work equally heavy trains as diesels, {{but not to the}} same speeds.|$|R
40|$|During {{a typical}} {{measurement}} campaign, lots of {{temporal and spatial}} data can be gathered regarding {{the condition of the}} rail. This paper proposes two approaches that make use of data analytics techniques to find causes of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damages. The first approach, named ‘bottom-up approach’, determines the influencing factors regarding RCF based on the worst affected areas (hotspots). The second approach, called ‘top-down approach’, determines the influencing factors based on the condition of the whole track. The approaches use correlation analysis, clustering and similarity of parameters. To show the advantage of the approaches, they have been used {{for the study of the}} Dutch High Speed Line (HSL). The results indicates that severe RCF defects occurred only under two very specific conditions. First, in specific curves where one type of train was driving under high <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> and large cant excess through curves. Second, at the entry zones of the HSL where voltage locks are present, the same type of trains’ low driving speeds result in driving without cant excess/deficiency (theoretical cant). The conditions suggest that structurally driving below design speed on a high-speed track can be a cause of rail damages.

25|$|During the 1880s, their boiler {{pressure}} was increased from 130 to 140 psi, and their cylinder bore increased from 16 to 17 inches, with those rebuilt after 1896 being fitted with 17.5 inch cylinders. These changes led to considerably increased <b>tractive</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
25|$|Once the {{locomotive}} has accelerated the driver can adjust the reverser toward the mid-gear position, decreasing cut-off {{to give a}} more economical use of steam. The engine's <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is then less than it was at starting, but its power is greater.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} the new American Type steam {{locomotive}} deliver more horsepower, <b>tractive</b> <b>effort,</b> and reliability it also {{laid the groundwork for}} locomotive engineering in the 19th century with boilers mounted horizontally (instead of vertically), smoke stacks mounted vertically at the front to expel the smoke and cinders away from the crew and passengers.|$|E
40|$|During recent years, {{along with}} other methods of {{determining}} contact parameters in the contact zone, the method of diagnosing noises, which appear at the process of work of a railway vehicle, is beginning to be applied. This paper presents a variant of active steering, which is built upon the application of axle boxes with links inclined to the longitudinal axle of track in the horizontal plane. Based on obtained experimental and theoretical results, the system for active steering of a railway vehicle is proposed. The adjustments of the wheels set position on the track are executed by means of actions from actuators to links to the axle boxes depending on analysis of noise in the wheel-rail contact. In this paper, the Simpack simulation model has been used. The proposed control strategy was modeled in Matlab/Simulink. The Simpack model was linked with the control unit in Matlab/Simulink by means of SIMAT-interface. Based on the software described above the system was investigated using co-simulation. Results from this study are presented {{and the effectiveness of}} this work is discussed. The proposed system allows for the reduction of wear of wheels and rails on the curving parts of track and improving <b>tractive</b> <b>efforts</b> of a railway vehicle...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{some new}} automatic {{procedures for the}} BirthSIM childbirth simulator. BirthSIM is able to simulate the uterine contractions and the mother's voluntary efforts, this enables the operator to synchronize {{these two types of}} efforts during a normal childbirth, or to synchronize these two efforts with the operator's <b>tractive</b> instrumental <b>effort</b> during childbirth using obstetric instruments. One originality of the BirthSIM simulator is to allow the medical team to acquire {{a better understanding of the}} application of these two synchronization concepts. With the aim of implanting various childbirth procedures, four control algorithms and switching algorithms are used to control successively: force, position, force-velocity or force-position. These control algorithms are important to produce the movement of the head, the mother's natural contractions and the mother's pushing action. Different childbirth cases are simulated using an electropneumatic system. The validity of the proposed control method for simulating childbirth modes has been evaluated by an expert obstetricia...|$|R
40|$|During {{operation}} in traction or braking modes, a locomotive's body weight distributes between bogies in different proportions depending on many factors. Each bogie and wheelset thus realises a different traction coefficient. The adhesion coefficient {{is not only}} dependent on the <b>tractive</b> or braking <b>effort,</b> but also on vertical wheel loading. Designs of a Co-Co locomotive equipped with adjustable secondary air suspension to optimise adhesion are studied in this work. The proposed solution is verified during numercal experiments using rail vehicle multibody modelling software.

25|$|The AA {{class was}} {{gradually}} made redundant by {{the delivery of}} large numbers of 4-6-0 locomotives of the new Dd and A2 classes between 1902 and 1922, which eventually totalled 446 locomotives. The A2 offered considerably more power, while the Dd offered similar <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> to the AA but much greater route availability due to its lower axle load.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{loadings}} and the ageing of {{the original}} locomotive fleet led to {{the purchase of a}} powerful six wheel side tank engine with the extraordinary <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 22,403lb. It became WCC no 16 and was delivered from Andrew Barclay in July 1934. Two similar engines, nos 17 and 18 followed in 1935 and 1938, and nos 19 and 20 followed in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Although the J class {{produced}} the same nominal <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> as the K or N class, {{they had a}} slightly higher adhesive weight (and as such a better factor of adhesion) and were permitted to haul heavier loads on gradients. They {{could be found in}} goods service on branch lines across the state, but were also found on mainlines running roadside goods services.|$|E
40|$|The {{realization}} of movement by railway vehicles creates {{a problem that}} {{is connected to the}} wear process for elements of a tribological wheel–rail system. Wheel–rail wear is a complex phenomenon that depends on many factors. One of the main wear zones is the contact area between a wheel flange and a rail gauge. As is well known, wear in this contact zone occurs when a railway vehicle moves on curved parts of track, realizes <b>tractive,</b> braking <b>efforts</b> or moves in a high-speed mode. In this case, the solution of this kind of wear problem can be found by means of lubricant implementation. The choice of a lubricant requires information about contact characteristics at the moment of a vehicle’s movement. This paper focuses on the modeling of the temperature process in the contact between a wheel flange and a rail gauge. Examples of temperature calculation with some experimental data as input for this computation are presented. The obtained values of the temperature allow for making the correct choice of lubricant type...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model of wheeled vehicle tractive or braking performance was developed and verified by experimental data. Then, various center of gravity and height of application force movement effects were analysed by simulation analysis. For a given set of vehicle dimensions and terrain wheel system constants, the simulation calculated effective <b>tractive</b> or braking <b>effort</b> and rear wheel sinkage, slip ratio or skid of a special designed wheeled robotic vehicle running over sloped weak sandy terrain for straight forward motion. For a 5. 88 kN weight vehicle, the optimal eccentricity of center of gravity, the optimal application height and the maximum slope angle of terrain could be determined for rear-wheel drive (RWD), front-wheel drive (FWD), four-wheel drive (4 WD) or rear-wheel brake (RWB), front-wheel brake (FWB), and four-wheel brake (4 WB) travel systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{acceleration}} and deceleration of trains {{are essential for}} satisfactory performance of train services and for effective utilisation of line capacity by railways for a given network. However, it {{increases the risk of}} unbalancing the passengers. Therefore, in this paper, the jerk was analysed in the vehicle in order to examine its effect on safety and comfort to the passengers. For the purpose of this analysis, a rake with 24 ICF coaches fitted with CBC (H type tight lock) and low preload draft gear hauled by WDP 4 locomotive was considered. It was modelled using Universal Mechanism – a multibody dynamic software. Also, in addition, the vehicle is considered to be subjected to external forces such as rolling resistance, longitudinal wheel resistance, and gravitational force. The <b>tractive</b> and braking <b>efforts</b> for the locomotives are also considered with realistic track conditions between Lucknow and Kanpur of India. The presented results suggest that the CBC with balanced type draft gear reduces the jerk in the train...|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{different}} pantographs, electrical systems for DC operation, the F140MS types are identical to the contemporary dual voltage versions. However, under 1.5kV DC, the maximum available power is limited to 4.0MW, although this {{does not affect the}} maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort,</b> which is limited by other factors. As a consequence of the additional equipment required, the locomotives weigh approximately 1 tonne more than their dual voltage relatives.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes research and development. work {{carried out by the}} author into the control of traction and braking systems on rail vehicles. After a review of recent developments, the problem of. driving a train under minimum-energy control subject·to timetable and operational constraints is discussed. This is partitioned into two sections. Firstly, target time and velocities for key pOints on the journey are computed; these are communicated to or stored on the train, together with route and vehicle data. Secondly, an on-board digital system drives the train to each target according to control algorithms which incorporate a predictorcorrector module, whose function is to determine which of two criteria of performance is to be used (minimum-energy when running early or on-time, minimum-time when running late). Most of the thesis is devoted to the analysis and design of the train-borne control system. The general form of the optimal control (of <b>tractive</b> or braking <b>effort)</b> is determined by the application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle over each section of the journey. However, the moments of transition between the various modes of control are calculated by a method which involves a lookahead model in the predictor module, rather than by iterative solution of the state and co-state equations. An important aspect of the design is the dynamic response of the braking SUb-system, which may include a substantial pneumatic transport lag within the control loop. S-plane and z-plane design procedures for the required discrete control algorithms to. achieve a specified transient response are derived. The thesis concludes with a chapter on the instrumentation required for the train-borne control system...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of adhesion forces for a rail vehicle in tangent and curving parts of track {{is a very}} difficult process because it is connected with use of <b>tractive</b> and braking <b>efforts,</b> and also depends on the contact characteristics in the zone between the wheels and rails. For the investigations of the dynamic behavior of a rail vehicle, it is necessary to provide an accurate description of force processes in the contact. The existing methods for the estimationcan be used for the creation traction and braking control systems of running gears of rail vehicles. Recently, some publications describe works on study of adhesion forces. The approaches for the detection of these forces in a real time mode have very much in common. From results of this works, it is possible to see that approaches are based on experimental results and use the short time for calculations of wheel-rail contact forces. In work [1], for the estimationadhesion the fast method developed by Polach [2] is applied, but this approach {{does not take into account}} spin and can be used only for the tangent track. In work [3], the estimation is based on the fast method described in [4], but this fast method was obtained for wheel and rail profiles used in CIS countries. In the present work, based on authors’ previous works in this topic [5 - 8], the algorithm forthe {{estimation of}} adhesion forces in the contact is proposed. This paper describes a theoretical and experimental investigation that considers the possibility to detect adhesion forces by means of model based algorithm adapted for the application in a real time mode. A 1 : 5 scaled roller-rig is used in order to provide an experimental validation of the numerical model...|$|R

The diesel and electric TRAXX locomotives share the same driver cabin and control desk, body, bogies, and drive system. The maximum <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is slight reduced by 30kN to 270kN due to the lower power of the diesel engine.|$|E
25|$|The high <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of the C class {{locomotives}} enabled Victorian Railways {{to operate}} heavier goods trains {{with a single}} locomotive and thus enabled significant savings in operating costs through a reduction in train-miles for the tonnage hauled. Along with the smaller K class branch line 2-8-0, they were credited with playing a major part in the 15% reduction in overall goods and livestock train miles on Victoria Railways between 1920 and 1924, against a reduction of overall tonnage hauled of only 3% for the same years.|$|E
25|$|They {{were used}} to start a heavy train or {{maintain}} low speed under demanding conditions. It could be cut in while moving at speeds under 15 to 20mph (24 to 32km/h). Rated at about 300hp (224kW) at speeds of from 10 to 30 miles per hour (16 to 48km/h). It would automatically cut out from between 20 and 35mph (32 to 56km/h), depending on the model and design. <b>Tractive</b> <b>effort</b> of 10-12,000lbf (44 to 53kN) was common, although ratings of up to around 15,000lbf (66kN) were possible.|$|E

The introduction of X class diesels in 1954, however, ended their long tenure in this position and both P and Pr class locomotives were gradually relegated to goods and shunting duties. Their adequate <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> and economy, however, ensured their survival {{until the very end}} of steam.|$|E
25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
25|$|Train crews favored #2450 {{due to the}} {{superior}} riding qualities of its Blomberg trucks, which ran more smoothly than the original AAR Type-A switcher trucks; being several tons heavier than a typical GP7 imparted a higher <b>tractive</b> <b>effort,</b> which was helpful when switching long cuts of cars. The Beep spent many years in lease service performing switching duties for the Port Terminal Railroad Association in Houston. In August, 1974 the unit was re-designated as #1160 {{as part of a}} general locomotive renumbering scheme. It was again renumbered along with the Santa Fe's few remaining EMD switchers and assigned #1460 in January, 1977.|$|E
