The Islander is a high-wing, <b>twin</b> <b>piston</b> engine, propeller-driven aircraft. It is flown by a single pilot, and there is seating for eight passengers in the passenger cabin. One additional seat usually remains empty next to the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} aircraft, Convair C-131D-CO Samaritan, (c/n 212, company designation: Model 340-79), was a <b>twin</b> <b>piston</b> engined military transport with {{seating for}} 44 passengers. Given the military serial number 55-0291, the aircraft {{was the first}} United States Air Force C-131 to be based in Europe, at RAF Northolt, where it was under command of the 7500th Air Base Group, 3rd Air Force, U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE).|$|E
25|$|The Cessna 401 and 402 are {{series of}} 6 to 10 seat, light <b>twin,</b> <b>piston</b> engine aircraft. This line was {{manufactured}} by Cessna from 1966 to 1985 {{under the name}} Utiliner and Businessliner. All seats are easily removable so that the aircraft {{can be used in}} an all-cargo configuration. Neither the Cessna 401 nor the 402 were pressurized, nor were they particularly fast for the installed horsepower. Instead, Cessna intended them to be inexpensive to purchase and operate.|$|E

25|$|However, the XG-20's {{aircraft}} {{had been}} designed {{to allow for the}} easy installation of powerplants, and Chase modified the two prototypes into powered aircraft, one becoming the XC-123, with <b>twin</b> <b>piston</b> engines. The second XG-20, however, was taken in hand for a more radical reconfiguration, being fitted with two twin-jet engine pods, of the type used by the Convair B-36 and Boeing B-47 bombers, to become the XC-123A. As there was no provision for housing fuel in the former glider's wings, fuel tanks were installed underneath the cabin floor.|$|E
25|$|The German Wehrmacht is {{somewhat}} {{more advanced than}} historically, with a fully mechanized supply train. The Waffen-SS units facing the Draka Citizen Airborne unit the novel centers around are also in possession of numerous 'hybrid' armoured vehicles made from German and captured Soviet parts, {{but they are still}} no match for the Draka army. The Draka citizen soldiers, female as well as male, are honed killing machines, each equal to several of their enemy on the battlefield. The Draka also have superb weaponry, including 14,000 Hond III tanks with armor, engine size and gun caliber approaching those of modern MBTs, and powerful air force which includes high-performance single and <b>twin</b> <b>piston</b> engine fighters, airborne early warning systems mounted on dirigibles and a twin-engine armored ground attack aircraft. By 1944, all sides are widely using nerve gas, jet- and rocket-powered fighter aircraft and ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|The R32 Skyline {{debuted in}} May 1989. It was {{available}} {{as either a}} 2-door coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan, all other bodystyles were dropped. The R32 featured several versions of the RB-series straight-6 engines, which had improved heads (the twelve port inlet was gone) and used the ECCS (Electronically Concentrated Control System) injection system. Also available was an 1,800 cc 4-cylinder GXi model. Most models had HICAS four-wheel steering, with the rear wheels being hydraulically linked to the front steering. The 2.5-litre GTS-25 {{became one of the}} first Japanese production cars to feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The GTS-t came in standard and Type M configurations, with the Type M having larger five-stud 16-inch wheels, four piston front callipers and <b>twin</b> <b>piston</b> rears plus other minor differences. ABS was optional (except for the GT-R and GTS-4), mechanical LSD was standard on the GTR and viscous LSD was standard on all turbo models and optional on all but the GXi. Nissan also produced 100 Australian models of the R32. In addition, there was a 4WD version of the GTS-t Type M, called the GTS-4.|$|E

NATS was deactivated in 1990.|$|R
