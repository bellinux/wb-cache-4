These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stated</b> as solved or not.|$|E
25|$|Where {{criminal}} matters are concerned, the Court only hears appeals from cases {{originating in the}} High Court. Matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the Subordinate Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be submitted to the Court for determination. During a Subordinate Court trial, instead of applying for the trial judge to state a case for the High Court's opinion, {{a party to the}} proceedings may apply to the Court of Appeal for leave for a case <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stated</b> directly to that Court.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} has been convicted by the High Court, the trial judge and the Public Prosecutor may reserve for the Court of Appeal's {{decision}} any questions of law that arose during the trial that would affect its outcome. Any other party to the proceedings may also apply for the trial judge to state a case on a question of law for the Court of Appeal's determination, and if the judge declines to do so the party may apply to the Court of Appeal to direct the trial judge to state a case. During a State Court trial, instead of applying for the trial judge to state a case for the High Court's opinion, {{a party to the}} proceedings may apply to the Court of Appeal for leave for a case <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stated</b> directly to that Court.|$|E

2500|$|Cullen {{mentions}} Mrs. Morell, Mr and Mrs Hullett, Clara Neil Miller and Julia Bradnum as {{cases that}} Hannam regarded as warranting prosecution. However, {{in the cases}} of Mr Hullett, Clara Neil Miller and Julia Bradnum there was no certainty of an unnatural death as there was evidence in the committal hearing that Mr Hullett {{died of a heart attack}} and, at their exhumations, the pathologist concluded Miller had died from pneumonia and the condition of Bradnum’s body did not allow a cause of death <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stated,</b> so none were good cases. Mrs Hullett had died an unnatural death, of a barbiturate overdose, but there was no evidence or admission that Adams had persuaded her to take that overdose and, had Mrs Hullett’s case been brought to trial after Adams’ first acquittal, Devlin believed that a second acquittal was virtually certain In these five cases, Adams may have contributed to the deaths in some way, but this would not have been sufficient for a capital murder conviction ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{criminal}} proceedings, if {{a question}} of law arises as to the interpretation or effect of any provision of the Constitution, a party may apply to the trial court for a case <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stated</b> on the legal question to a [...] "relevant court" [...] for its decision. Where the trial court is a subordinate court the relevant court is the High Court; and where the trial court is the High Court the relevant court is the Court of Appeal. The Public Prosecutor {{has a right to}} be heard at the hearing of the case stated. As there are no corresponding statutory provisions for civil proceedings, when constitutional issues arise in the course of such matters in a subordinate court, they will be dealt with by that court and may then be appealed to the High Court and possibly to the Court of Appeal in the usual manner. Alternatively, a party to the civil proceedings can start a separate action in the High Court for the constitutional issue to be determined.|$|E

2500|$|The early Communist Party {{had little}} {{influence}} in Romania. This {{was due to}} a number of factors: the country's lack of industrial development, which resulted in a relatively small working class (with industry and mining employing fewer than 10% of the active population) and a large peasant population; the minor impact of Marxism among Romanian intellectuals; the success of state repression in driving the party underground and limiting its activities; and finally, the party's [...] "anti-national" [...] policy, as it began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>stated</b> in the 1920s—supervised by the Comintern, this policy called for the breakup of Greater Romania, which was regarded as a colonial entity [...] "illegally occupying" [...] Transylvania, Dobruja, Bessarabia and Bukovina (regions that, the communists argued, had been denied the right of self-determination). In 1924, the Comintern provoked Romanian authorities by encouraging the Tatarbunary Uprising in southern Bessarabia, in an attempt to create a Moldavian republic on Romanian territory; also in that year, a Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, roughly corresponding to Transnistria, was established inside the Soviet Union.|$|E
