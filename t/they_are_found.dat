5|$|Although Kasuya did not {{explicitly}} define {{the mode of}} nutrition for A.coccinea, most Phallaceae species are suspected to be saprobic—decomposers of wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies of A.coccinea, known only from temperate regions of Japan (Tochigi Prefecture), grow solitarily or in groups on rice husks, straw, or dung. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>found</b> from summer to autumn.|$|E
