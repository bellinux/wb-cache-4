2500|$|The {{saxophone}} {{consists of}} an approximately conical tube, usually of thin brass, flared at the tip to form a bell. At intervals along the tube are between 20 and 23 tone holes of varying size and two very small vent holes to assist the playing of the upper register. These holes are covered by keys (also known as pad cups) containing soft leather pads, which are closed to produce an airtight seal. At rest some of the holes stand open and others are closed. The keys are activated by keytouches pressed by the fingers, either directly on the pad cup or connected to it with levers, either directly or with joints called [...] "linkages." [...] The right thumb sits under a <b>thumb</b> <b>rest</b> to stabilize and balance the saxophone, while the weight of most saxophones {{is supported by a}} neckstrap attached to a strap ring on the rear of the body of the instrument. The fingering for the saxophone is a combination of that of the oboe with the Boehm system and is very similar to the flute or upper register of the clarinet. Instruments that play to low A have a left thumb key for that note.|$|E

5000|$|The next {{pistol in}} the lineup is named Competition. It too has a {{stainless}} steel frame and 6.875-inch slab sided bull barrel, and adjustable rear sights; the pistol also has the cocobolo grip with <b>thumb</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E
50|$|On a saxophone, the octave key is {{positioned}} {{next to the}} left-hand <b>thumb</b> <b>rest.</b> Pressing the octave key opens the top tone hole in {{the neck of the}} saxophone. Alternatively, whenever the G key is fingered, the top tone hole closes and a small tone hole is opened {{near the top of the}} body.|$|E
50|$|Electric Bass Guitar - The {{electric}} bass guitar is a 1-stringed, fretless bass {{featuring a}} cereal box body, yard stick neck, comb bridge, soda can <b>thumb</b> <b>rest,</b> and duck tape strap. Occasionally the upright bass {{is used in}} place of the electric bass for songs that require a more jazz-like feel. It is made from a wooden box and a PVC pipe.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the most}} common form of anjali mudra, the hands are held at the heart chakra with <b>thumbs</b> <b>resting</b> lightly against the sternum. [...] The gesture may also be {{performed}} at the Ajna or brow chakra with <b>thumb</b> tips <b>resting</b> against the [...] "third eye" [...] or at the crown chakra (above the head).

50|$|To {{celebrate}} the 50th {{anniversary of the}} Jazz Bass, first introduced in 1960, Fender released in 2010 the 50th Anniversary Limited Edition Jazz Bass. This bass sports a selected alder body finished in a Candy Apple Red nitrocellulose lacquer and incorporates design elements from several periods in the instrument's history, including 1960s-era lacquer finish, headstock logo, chrome bridge and pickup covers, 1970s-era <b>thumb</b> <b>rest</b> and bridge pickup positioning, modern-era high-mass bridge and Posiflex graphite neck support rods.|$|E
5000|$|Designed {{for rapid}} {{production}} using {{a minimum of}} strategic metals and machine processes, the M3 trench knife used a relatively narrow 6.75-inch bayonet-style spear-point blade with a sharpened 3.5-inch secondary edge. [...] The blade was made of carbon steel, and was either blued or parkerized. [...] Production of the grooved leather handle was later simplified by forming the grip of stacked leather washers that were shaped by turning on a lathe, then polished and lacquered. [...] The steel crossguard had an angular bend at one end to facilitate a <b>thumb</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E
50|$|Handguns {{must have}} a one piece metal frame, slide with stirrup cuts and the dust cover (with or without an {{accessory}} rail) can have a maximum length of 75 mm from the leading edge {{to the rear of}} the slide stop pin. Magazine wells cannot exceed a maximum outside width of 35 mm. Permitted modifications are shaped slides (i.e. flat-top or tri-top), shaped trigger guards (i.e. squared or undercut), bob-tail backstraps, bull or coned barrels, external extractors, finger-grooves (machined, add-on, wrap-around etc.), custom magazine release buttons, triggers, hammers, single/ ambidextrous thumb safeties, any iron sights, extended slide lock levers and thumb shields provided they do not act as a <b>thumb</b> <b>rest.</b> Cosmetic modifications are permitted.|$|E
60|$|A vast {{policeman}} had materialized from nowhere. He {{stood beside}} them, a living statue of Vigilant Authority. One <b>thumb</b> <b>rested</b> easily on his broad belt. The {{fingers of the}} other hand caressed lightly a moustache that had caused more heart-burnings among the gentler sex than any other two moustaches in the C-division. The eyes above the moustache were stern and questioning.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{all three}} parts are held at once with both hands. The saucer is held with {{the fingers of}} the right hand while the <b>thumb</b> <b>rests</b> {{on the edge of}} the bowl. The left hand then holds the lid, which is used to brush away the tea leaves before drinking. It can take some {{practice}} to do this, as the liquid tends to be hot.|$|R
2500|$|A throw is {{a simple}} metal grip for the player's finger or thumb, {{attached}} to a valve slide. The general term [...] "throw" [...] can describe a u-hook, a saddle (u-shaped grips), or a ring (ring-shape grip) in which a player's finger or <b>thumb</b> <b>rests.</b> A player extends a finger or thumb to lengthen a slide, and retracts the finger to return the slide to its original position.|$|R
5000|$|There is much mythology {{about the}} insect {{depicted}} on the spring. A legend identifies the design as a bee granted by Emperor Napoleon I (the bee was adopted as a dynastic symbol by Napoleon) {{in recognition of}} the courage of local soldiers. However, the [...] "bee" [...] on the laguiole knives was only introduced after World War II, more than a century after the death of the emperor. Technically, [...] "la mouche" [...] (the fly) {{is the end of the}} backspring, which sits over the rotating part of the blade. The upper section was expanded to form a <b>thumb</b> <b>rest.</b> Older laguiole knives feature many kinds of decorated springs which dont necessarily feature insects.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{additional}} re-modelled Lyricons were engineered later. First the [...] "Wind Synthesizer Driver", {{which had}} control voltage outputs for lip pressure, wind pressure and pitch, {{to control the}} VCA and VCF and pitch of an external analog synthesizer. Then the [...] "Lyricon II" [...] was engineered, which included a two-oscillator synthesizer. All the Lyricons used the same saxophone style fingering system, with two octave keys above the left-hand <b>thumb</b> <b>rest.</b> The Wind Synthesizer Driver and the Lyricon II also had a transposition footswitch feature, where a foot pedal {{could be used to}} transpose the entire range up or down one octave. None of the Lyricons were engineered to use MIDI (which was invented after Computone went out of business in 1980), although external MIDIfication modules were produced by JL Cooper and STEIM.|$|E
50|$|The on/off switch for the LAD {{is located}} on the left handguard; when holding the weapon at ready, the left <b>thumb</b> <b>rests</b> {{naturally}} on it. With sluggish operation due to fouling, the gas regulator setting may be increased by turning it with a coin, screwdriver, or any other thin flat object. Alternatively, the gas regulator can be unlatched and turned by hand with aid of the knurled surface.|$|R
5000|$|A throw is {{a simple}} metal grip for the player's finger or thumb, {{attached}} to a valve slide.

5000|$|With the cello, in the [...] "neck" [...] {{positions}} (which {{use just}} {{less than half}} of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the <b>thumb</b> <b>rests</b> on the back of the neck. However, in thumb position, the <b>thumb</b> usually <b>rests</b> alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes, along with the other left-hand fingers. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.|$|R
5000|$|Particularly for {{intravenous}} administration, self-injection {{in the arm}} can be awkward, {{and some}} people modify a syringe for single-handed operation by removing the plunger and affixing a bulb such as from a large dropper or baby pacifier {{to the end of}} the barrel to in effect make it a large dropper with a needle affixed. This is therefore a variant of the common method of injection with a dropper with the hypodermic needle affixed, using a [...] "collar" [...] made of paper or other material to create a seal between the needle and dropper. Removing part of the plunger assembly by cutting off most of the shaft and <b>thumb</b> <b>rest</b> and affixing the bulb {{to the end of the}} barrel, thereby allowing the bulb to operate the plunger by suction, also does work in many cases.|$|E
5000|$|Type 56 (1956-): Numerous minor tweaks, {{including}} lack of milling on {{the bolt}} carrier, partially or fully stamped (as opposed to milled) receivers, and differing types of <b>thumb</b> <b>rest</b> on the take down lever. The Chinese continually revised the SKS manufacturing process, so variation {{can be seen}} even between two examples from the same factory. All of the Type 56 carbine rifles {{have been removed from}} military service, except a few being used for ceremonial purposes and by local Chinese Militias. Type 56 carbines with serial numbers below 9,000,000 have the Russian-style blade-type folding bayonet, while those 9,000,000 and higher have a [...] "spike" [...] type folding bayonet. Some early examples are known as [...] "Sino-Soviet", meaning they were produced by China, but with cooperation from Russian [...] "advisers" [...] who helped regulate the factories and provided the design specifications and perhaps even Soviet-manufactured parts.|$|E
5000|$|The Silva-Bet, {{body and}} keys, {{is made of}} an alloy {{variously}} known as maillechort, German silver or nickel silver, and is plated with silver. The toneholes, except on the earliest examples, have widened tops to improve the sealing and durability of the pads. First made with a one-piece body with detachable barrel, the Silva-Bet clarinet was later available with a two-piece body plus detachable barrel. The barrel of the Silva-Bet features a telescoping mechanism for tuning the instrument. There {{are at least two}} varieties of tuning barrel, one with a thick head and two slim rotating rings at the top, the other with a thin head with a single rotating sleeve in the middle. [...] There are also at least two varieties of <b>thumb</b> <b>rest,</b> one with the platform and rest a single curved plate attached to the body by a rail, the other with the platform a box attached to the body all around and the rest soldered to that box.|$|E
50|$|A large {{space is}} used for a {{keyboard}}-like section with 14 keyboard keys, numbered 1 through 14, by default used to represent the WASD space on regular keyboards {{in the case of}} first-person shooters, one of the intended target audiences of the n52. These keys can be controlled with the users second to fifth fingers. Below where the <b>thumb</b> <b>rests,</b> there is a slightly wider keyboard-style button, labeled 15, similar in use to the shift key on regular keyboards.|$|R
5000|$|A {{somewhat}} uncommon variant is YGHJ which while {{requiring the}} keyboard {{to be turned}} slightly clockwise, can result in the <b>thumb</b> <b>resting</b> comfortably upon the right [...] key and the little finger resting on [...] This {{can be useful in}} games that utilize both jump and sprint functions as it allows the fingers to rest on smaller keys than [...] and Space. The YGHJ configuration also places the hand closer {{to the center of the}} QWERTY section of the keyboard, potentially opening up the entire board to custom keybindings.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{he becomes}} a scout, a boy must take the scout's oath, thus:On my honour I promise that---# I will do my duty to God and the King.# I will {{do my best to}} help others, {{whatever}} it costs me.# I know the scout law, and will obey it.While taking this oath the scout will stand, holding his right hand raised level with his shoulder, palm to the front, <b>thumb</b> <b>resting</b> on the nail of the digitus minimus (little finger) and the other three fingers upright, pointing upwards:---This is the scout's salute.|$|R

5000|$|With experience, string players become {{accustomed}} to the required shape and position of the left hand. Some positions are located relative to certain touch references, or landmarks on the instrument. For example, fourth position on the cello (used in the example below) has the player's <b>thumb</b> <b>resting</b> in the [...] "saddle" [...] of the neck root. Similarly, higher positions on the violin {{make use of the}} instrument's [...] "shoulder" [...] (treble-side edge of the top's upper bout) as a touch reference. Some electric string instruments, without a traditionally shaped body, still incorporate a reference feature imitating that shoulder's shape.|$|R
50|$|The {{left hand}} {{fingertips}} stop the strings along their length, determining {{the pitch of}} each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the neck positions (which use just {{less than half of}} the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the <b>thumb</b> <b>rests</b> on the back of the neck; in thumb position (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the <b>thumb</b> usually <b>rests</b> alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.|$|R

5000|$|In 1998, {{the frame}} was further {{modified}} with an accessory rail (called the [...] "Universal Glock rail") {{to allow the}} mounting of laser sights, tactical lights, and other accessories. <b>Thumb</b> <b>rests</b> {{on both sides of}} the frame and finger grooves on the front strap were added. Glock pistols with these upgrades are informally referred to as (early) [...] "third-generation" [...] models. Later third-generation models additionally featured a modified extractor that serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the locking block was enlarged, along with the addition of an extra cross pin to aid the distribution of forces exerted by the locking block. This cross pin is known as the locking block pin and is located above the trigger pin.|$|R
