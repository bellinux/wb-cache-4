For the purposes of this study, I situate myself as subject, conducting a close reading and reflective examination of my painting process in order to gain insight into the essential aspects of the artist’s description of experience. The methodology investigates correlations between reflexive self-observation and its inscription in language.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} control methodologies for neuro-robotic systems, i. e. robotic {{systems that are}} {{controlled}} using signals coming from the human Nervous System. Upper limb motion estimation methodologies are proposed, using electromyographic activity of {{the muscles of the}} upper limb. Through these motion estimates, an anthropomorphic robot arm is controller in real-time. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>proposes</b> decoding methodologies for electromyographic activity in motion and force. These estimates can be used for controlling orthotic devices, such as upper limb exoskeletons. The decoding methodologies result to a continuous representation of motion of the upper limb in the three-dimensional space, a characteristic that allows the methodology application for the robust control of robotic systems. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>proposes</b> adaptive decoding algorithms, that incorporate the time variation of the electromyographic signals, which result to an efficient motion estimation, even in experiments with long duration. Finally <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>proposes</b> a decoding methodology of neural signals recorded directly from the brain of non-human primates. These signals, that are recorded from primary motor cortex of the brain, are decoded to hand-finger motion. Using these motion estimates, a 17 -dof robot hand is controlled in reaching and grasping tasks. This issue is an important step towards the development of neuro-motor prosthetic devices like prosthetic hands. ...|$|E
