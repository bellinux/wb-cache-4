25|$|The Breton {{language}} has several dialects which have no precise limits but rather form a continuum. Most of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> similar to each other, with only some phonetic and lexical differences. The three main dialects spoken {{in the western}} end of Brittany, the Cornouillais, around Quimper, the Léonard, around Saint-Pol-de-Léon, and the Trégorrois, around Tréguier, are grouped into the KLT group (Kerne-Leon-Treger), in opposition to the Vannetais, spoken around Vannes, which is the most differentiated Breton dialect.|$|E
25|$|Stability of β-barrel transmembrane {{proteins}} {{is similar}} to stability of water-soluble proteins, based on chemical denaturation studies. Some of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> stable even in chaotropic agents and high temperature. Their folding in vivo is facilitated by water-soluble chaperones, such as protein Skp. It is thought that β-barrel membrane proteins come from one ancestor even having different number of sheets which could be added or doubled during evolution. Some studies show a huge sequence conservation among different organisms and also conserved amino acids which hold the structure and help with folding.|$|E
25|$|Droughts In the Northeast of Brazil {{droughts}} are {{a cyclical}} phenomenon occurring every 10 to 12years, {{and some of}} <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> severe. The region has an annual average rainfall ranging from 400 to 800mm, and an average water availability per person ranging from 1,320 to 1,781m3 (the world's average was 8,209m3 in 2007). The effects of droughts on the local, mostly poor, population are devastating. Droughts are also frequent in the South, home of most of Brazil’s industry, where the latest drought in 2000 culminated in a national energy crisis. (See Electricity sector in Brazil).|$|E

25|$|A popular form of {{textile art}} in Japan is shibori (intricate tie dye), found {{on some of}} the more {{expensive}} kimonos and haori kimono jackets. Patterns are created by minutely binding the fabric and masking off areas, then dying it, usually by hand. When the bindings are removed, an undyed pattern is revealed. Shibori work can be further enhanced with yuzen (hand applied) drawing or painting with textile dyes or with embroidery; it is then known as tsujigahana. Shibori textiles are very time-consuming to produce and require great skill, so the textiles and garments created from <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> expensive and highly prized.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} loci in a {{vertebrate}} species {{has been estimated}} at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at most of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.|$|E

"Blood Ties" [...] {{featured}} the first appearances of Peter Gerety, Jon Seda and Callie Thorne as regular cast members on [...] Thorne portrayed Laura Ballard, a former Seattle homicide unit detective, marking the character's {{first appearance in}} the series. Gerety and Seda each previously played their respective characters in guest appearances on the show; Seda's character Paul Falsone {{first appeared in the}} two-part [...] finale. Stuart Gharty, Gerety's character, is described as a transplant from the department's internal affairs department. Executive producer Tom Fontana said he thought the new cast additions would create drama and tension between the characters: [...] "It's stimulating to add new people, because you're not feeling like you're writing or acting the same scene for the thousandth time, and I think all three of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> different than any other characters we've had on the show." ...|$|E

In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful and some of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{lasted about}} 50 days from December14, 1998, to February 1999. American Beauty was filmed on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, and at Hancock Park and Brentwood in Los Angeles. The aerial {{shots at the}} beginning and end of the film were captured in Sacramento, California, and many of the school scenes were shot at South High School in Torrance, California; several extras in the gym crowd were South High students. The film is set in an upper middle-class neighborhood in an unidentified American town. Production designer Naomi Shohan likened the locale to Evanston, Illinois, but said, [...] "it's not about a place, it's about an archetype. The milieu was pretty much Anywhere, USA—upwardly mobile suburbia." [...] The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters, who are also archetypes. Shohan said, [...] "All of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> strained, and their lives are constructs." [...] The Burnhams' household was designed as the reverse of the Fitts'—the former a pristine ideal, but graceless and lacking in [...] "inner balance", leading to Carolyn's desire to at least give it the appearance of a [...] "perfect all-American household"; the Fitts' home is depicted in [...] "exaggerated darkness [...] symmetry".|$|E
2500|$|The {{forests of}} the {{district}} abound {{in a variety of}} animals and birds and are excellent wildlife habitats. Elephants, bison, monkeys and rare species of reptiles have the place of prominence in them. The Neyyar reservoir and nearby areas abound in wild life. Nestled in the lap of the Western Ghats, a wildlife sanctuary is quickly growing over an area of nearly [...] around this reservoir. The forest under the Kulathupuzha range is the habitat of rare species of snakes and lizards. Mammals are well represented in the district. Nilgiri langur, the lion-tailed macaque, the Nilgiri brown mongoose and the Malabar civet are characteristic to this region. Carnivores include: tiger, wild cat, jackal, leopard and wild dog. Sloth bear, gaur, a few species of deer and elephants are also seen. Reptiles include snakes, lizards, crocodiles and tortoises. There are about 75–80 species of snakes in this area. Some of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> poisonous.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} women who attend school in urban areas vs. rural areas differs drastically. [...] In urban areas, women's {{education}} is increasing every day. The parents of girls who live in urban areas are a lot more accepting of their enrolling in school and even encourage girls to pursue a career as they are also a lot more knowledgeable of their rights. This makes them a lot more motivated to stand up for their education. Parent in urban areas are a lot more modernized or westernized. These urban parents acknowledge the importance of an education. Women who live in urban areas are often enrolled in private schools getting a better education there as they have a lot more educational accessibility. Women in urban areas are also surrounded by people who are educated and are not put down or beaten for going to school. Unlike in urban areas, women in rural areas are discouraged to attend school. Most of them are brought up in conservative families with little to no education. They have to work harder than women in urban areas because they have little support system. If their parents are accepting of education they still cannot go since most of <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> poor and cannot afford the expense. The women also don’t attend school in rural areas of Pakistan because it is not culturally accepted. These conservative families tend to be more traditional expecting women to stay at home and attend the house while men go out to work. They’re also restricted in rural areas because their town may not even have a school, therefore having to travel a long distance to attend one.|$|E
