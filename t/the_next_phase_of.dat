5|$|He {{proposed}} that the population of Milton Keynes should double in the next 20 years. He appointed English Partnerships to do so, taking planning controls away from Milton Keynes Borough Council and making EP the statutory planning authority. In turn, EP established a subsidiary Milton Keynes Partnership to manage the programme locally. Their proposal for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> expansion moves away from grid squares to large scale, mixed use, higher density developments which are more based on assumptions about public transport than private car usage.|$|E

5|$|Pennethorne's gallery was {{demolished}} for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> building, {{a scheme}} by Sir John Taylor extending northwards {{of the main}} entrance. Its glass-domed entrance vestibule had painted ceiling decorations by the Crace family firm, who had also worked on the Barry Rooms. A fresco intended for the south wall was never realised, and that space is now taken up by Frederic, Lord Leighton’s painting of Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the Streets of Florence (1853–55), lent by the Royal Collection in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|At 6 p.m. the {{regiment}} {{was ordered to}} withdraw. It had lost almost all of its tanks and taken 42 casualties killed or wounded. In reserve, {{the regiment}} was issued with new tanks, a hasty mix of Shermans, Grants, and Crusaders (types II and III), mostly salvaged from the battlefield and rapidly repaired. Montgomery had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the 2nd New Zealand Division and wanted them to spearhead the next thrust, but Freyberg was unwilling to do so without reinforcements, as his troops had suffered so many casualties. Montgomery therefore placed 151 (from 50th Division) and 152 Infantry (from 51st Division) brigades under Freyberg's command for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> the battle.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October, the New Zealand Division was {{positioned}} {{to the west of}} the fortified town of Le Quesnoy. On 4 November, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> the Allied advance began with the Battle of the Sambre. The division was tasked with the capture of Le Quesnoy and extending the front line past the town. The Rifle Brigade encircled and, through the achievement of its 4th Battalion in scaling the ramparts that surrounded the town, pushed into Le Quesnoy by the close of the day while the 1st Brigade had established a line to the east. This was the division's most successful day on the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the failed}} landing by the Australians at Porton Plantation, the {{commander}} of the Australian II Corps, Savige, decided to focus the main effort of the Australian campaign upon driving south towards the Japanese garrison at Buin, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were holding out. In order to concentrate enough forces for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> the operation, Savige decided that the 11th Brigade, which had been carrying the advance north, should be relieved so that it could be transferred to the south following a period of rest and reorganisation.|$|E

Blamey charged him with responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> Operation Cartwheel, the capture of Lae. Herring would command I Corps, which would be part of New Guinea Force, under Blamey and later Mackay. Blamey intended to have Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead command the subsequent phase of the operation, the assault on Madang.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, the leaking {{roof was}} repaired. In December 2007, the House {{received}} a $28,500 {{grant from the}} Dr. Scholl Foundation. The grant was used to complete lead-paint abatement, which would make conducting other restoration work safer. By 2010, the Dr. Scholl Foundation granted another $50,000 and a family foundation provided another $50,000 for the restoration. It was reported that other college grants totaling $15,500 were given for preservation planning, {{in part by the}} Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. It was reported in May 2010 that a matching grant of $101,500 was given to Connecticut College from the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, which provided the funding for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> renovations for restoring the House.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} from above that an optimum HRT for the MBBR under the selected operational conditions was 18  h, at which phenol and COD removal efficiencies were above 99 % and no metabolites were detected. Thus, this value {{was selected as}} the optimum retention time for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiment. Accordingly, the optimum surface loading rate based on HRT (at inlet phenol concentration of 800  mg/L) on the MBBR was found to be 4.1  g phenol/m 2.day (8.82  g COD/m 2.day). These results indicate that the MBBR inoculated with the active mixed biomass adapted to phenol and salt can efficiently remove high phenol loading rate and associated COD.|$|R
5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{constituted}} {{the first major}} conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire, and as such represents {{the first phase of}} the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, according to Herodotus, Darius decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> the Greco-Persian Wars, began as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} month all German opposition in the area had ceased and it marked the end of No. 3 Commando's offensive operations. On 7 May, when the Germans surrendered, No. 3 Commando was firmly established in Lübeck, where they began <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> their service history as occupation troops.|$|E
5|$|The key {{geographical}} {{features that}} had influenced the landings also influenced <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, {{were the main}} targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.|$|E

5|$|According to Roberts, it {{is clear}} that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> {{negotiations}} was intended to go beyond prisoner exchanges, as the prisoner of war negotiator Stilinović was not involved. Đilas and Velebit were passed through the German lines to Sarajevo and were then flown to Zagreb on 25 March in a military aircraft. These negotiations were with German representatives supervised by Ott, apparently on all the points discussed at Gornji Vakuf, and the Partisans made it clear to the Germans that their proposals did not amount to an offer of surrender. Velebit met personally with Glaise-Horstenau, as the Austrian had known Velebit's father, a Yugoslav general. After this first visit to Zagreb, Velebit visited Partisan commanders in Slavonia and eastern Bosnia passing on orders for the suspension of attacks on the Germans and their rail communications, and the release of prisoners.|$|E

On March 27, 2012, it was reported that 20th Century Fox had the poster and trailer removed from Florida theaters in response to increasing controversy surrounding the February shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida by neighborhood-watch captain George Zimmerman.
