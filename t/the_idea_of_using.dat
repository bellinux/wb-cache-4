5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|The first volume, Into the Wild, {{was written}} by Kate Cary under the {{pseudonym}} Erin Hunter, and completed in about three months. Holmes continued to act behind the scenes editing and supervising details. Afterwards, Holmes began to like <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> cats since she realized how thoughtful they can be leading private lives without any humans realizing.|$|E

5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, he came up with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a propylene glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery into the bloodstream via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, {{the bank}} robber {{was to have}} jumped into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena. After Fox and the studio argued against <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> Mulder in such a way, the producers agreed to make the change. The opening bank robbery scene was filmed on location in Vancouver, where Jason Schombing's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was a real one.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> {{anthropomorphic}} furry {{animals as}} protagonists {{in a story}} set in the American West pre-dated Popol Out West by several years. In December 1931, Hergé produced Tim-L'Ésureuil, Héros du Far-West ("Tim the Squirrel, Hero of the Far West") for L'Innovation, a large department store in Brussels. Printed in colour, it was serialised in 16 weekly installments, and was aimed to encourage children's interest in the store.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> atomic {{transitions}} to measure time was first suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1879, {{although it was}} only in the 1930s with the development of Magnetic resonance that there was a practical method for doing this. A prototype ammonia maser device was built in 1949 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now NIST). Although it was less accurate than existing quartz clocks, it served to demonstrate the concept.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{went through}} 30 rewrites and four {{separate}} story changes before the BBC {{were satisfied with}} the plot.

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Adventure was first {{announced}} in early 1982. The planned sequel eventually {{evolved into the}} Swordquest series of games. In 2005, a sequel written by Curt Vendel was released by Atari on the Atari Flashback 2 system. In 2007, AtariAge released a self-published sequel called Adventure II for the Atari 5200, which is heavily inspired by the original; its name is used with permission from Atari Interactive. Robinett himself took <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> items from Adventure into his next game, Rocky's Boots, but added the ability to combine them to form new items.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the recent}} grant of an Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} {{the building of the}} Glamorganshire Canal, it was resolved at a meeting at the Ship & Castle public house in Neath on 12 July 1790 to build a canal from Pontneddfechan to Neath, and another from Neath to Giant's Grave. Among those attending was Lord Vernon, who had already built a short canal near Giant's Grave to connect the River Neath to furnaces at Penrhiwtyn. Thomas Dadford was asked to survey a course, and he was assisted by his father and brother. He proposed a route which required 22 locks, part of which was a conventional canal, while other parts used the River Neath. Dadford costed the project at £25,716, but in early 1791 Lord Vernon's agent, Lewis Thomas, proposed two new cuts, and <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the river was dropped soon afterwards.|$|E
40|$|Ad-hoc {{networks}} are {{a group of}} computing devices that network together, typically wirelessly, forming a multihop network with no fixed infrastructure.

5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
5|$|Lord Kelvin {{invented the}} heat pump in 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had {{patented}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> it to draw {{heat from the}} ground in 1912. But {{it was not until}} the late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s economic viability.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Arular, the debut album by M.I.A., {{took place during}} 2003 and 2004, and the album was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} September 2004. Legal issues relating to the use of samples delayed this release, however, first to December and then into 2005. During the recording process, M.I.A. met DJ Diplo, and expressed an interest in working with him on a track for the album. Although their initial recording sessions together proved fruitless, Diplo conceived <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the existing vocal tracks recorded for the album to produce a mixtape which could be used to promote the delayed full-length album. M.I.A. extended her stay in the United States and the two artists produced the mixtape at his home studio.|$|E

50|$|Findlay {{was first}} a follower, {{and then an}} outspoken critic, of Ludwig Wittgenstein. He denounced his three {{theories}} of meaning, arguing against <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Use,</b> prominent in Wittgenstein's later period and in his followers, that it is insufficient for an analysis of meaning without such notions as connotation and denotation, implication, syntax and most originally, pre-existent meanings, in the mind or the external world, that determine linguistic ones, such as Husserl has evoked. Findlay credits Wittgenstein with great formal, aesthetic and literary appeal, and of directing well-deserved attention to Semantics and its difficulties.|$|R

We predict resonance-like features in the frequency shifts when constructive interference among atomic dipoles occur. We theoretically demonstrate that by fine-tuning the coherent dipole-dipole couplings in appropriately designed lattice geometries, the undesirable frequency shifts can be greatly suppressed.

5|$|The ENIAC (1946) was {{the first}} machine that was both {{electronic}} and general purpose. It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and programmable to solve {{a wide range of}} problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patchcords, not in memory, and it could take several days to reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the computer's memory to hold the program as well as the data it was working on, and it was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> {{inclined}} planes was {{an innovation}} that Green had pioneered elsewhere.

He {{was at the time}} the engineer for the Grand Western Canal, which included seven vertical boat lifts and an inclined plane at Wellisford, again to be powered by a descending bucket mechanism. The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was , and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much less water than the alternative of 20 or more locks.|$|E
