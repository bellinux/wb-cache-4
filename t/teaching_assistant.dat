Both of them become particularly suspicious when they disappear, and Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes onshore. However, Veronica later deduces that <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> Tim Foyle (James Jordan) committed the murder to frame Hank.|$|E

40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted with respect to students and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> who participate in and react to university-level general education art appreciation courses. Many instructors and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> have little knowledge of teacher education. Most <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> have had no teaching experience. Through portraiture, this study examines the various types of students and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> who engage in this course. Portraiture is an innovative method of gathering, analyzing, and presenting data. Future research must be conducted to determine if instructors and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> learn about this student population through reading these portraits...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> (TAs) in a town situated in the North-East England between 2010 and 2012. I was motivated {{to carry out the}} research by one fundamental question “How do <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> support <b>teaching</b> and learning and, in doing so help create an inclusive environment?” The aims of this holistic, qualitative study were to investigate and clarify, through the lens of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> how learning was supported and inclusion facilitated. Using a qualitative approach to examine this question, the study includes a theoretical literature review and empirical field work. The fieldwork consists of semi-structured interviews with ten <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> employed in the town. Thematic analysis is used to then analyse and interpret the data collected. The research explores, clarifies, and advances our understanding of how, and to what extent, the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> support learning and inclusion. The findings from this study show that <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> support learning in education. It also illustrates that the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> support an inclusive environment. The original contribution to our knowledge from this research is that, within the town in the North East of England, through the lens of the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> they do support learning, development, inclusive education and social inclusion. The results, inferences and possible implications for managers, training of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> and for future research are discussed. The findings offer support for key arguments around the quality of leadership, how <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> are deployed and the impact their training has on their role. They challenge many of the present views of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> and the study suggests they {{have a positive impact on}} learning and inclusion. They indicate that there is a need for further research that accommodates the “voice” of the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> supporting the social and emotional development and the inclusive learning environment. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the provision {{and impact of}} Foundation degrees for <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> by examining; <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> on Foundation degrees, Foundation degree providers, Head teachers, and local authorities across four {{different areas of the}} Midlands. Findings confirmed that <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> on Foundation degrees gain many personal and professional benefits from their course. These are determined by internal and external factors but include the support received during their Foundation degree course. In their workplace the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> are given additional responsibility but often this is not acknowledged through financial recompense or enhanced status, a consequence of which is that <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> are very discouraged about the lack of recognition for their Foundation degree. This is exacerbated by the fact that whilst Foundation degrees are being promoted as having employer engagement, most head teachers lack knowledge and understanding about Foundation degrees for <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> nor do many <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> feel supported by their employer. The implication of this thesis is that whilst accepting the many benefits to the individual and their workplace, Foundation degrees are contributing towards the creation of divisions and frustration levels of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants.</b> In this case, the impact on pupils needs to be explored.

5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E
5|$|Barry Voight (born 1937) is an American geologist, volcanologist, author, and engineer. He is {{also the}} brother of actor Jon Voight and {{songwriter}} Chip Taylor, and the uncle of actress Angelina Jolie. After completing a five-year intensive dual-degree program at the University of Notre Dame, Voight became a <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> there while pursuing his master's degree. He then studied at Cornell University for a year before transferring to Columbia University, where he earned his Ph.D. in geology in 1965. Voight worked {{as a professor of}} geology at several universities, including Pennsylvania State University, where he taught from 1964 until his retirement in 2005; he remains an emeritus professor there. He still conducts research, focusing on rock mechanics, plate tectonics, disaster prevention, and geotechnical engineering.|$|E
5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant,</b> and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E

Influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch and the Social Gospel movement, McGovern began divinity studies at Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, near Chicago. He preached as a Methodist student supply minister at Diamond Lake Church in Mundelein, Illinois, during 1946 and 1947, but became dissatisfied by {{the minutiae of}} his pastoral duties. In late 1947, McGovern left the ministry and enrolled in graduate studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, where he also worked as a <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant.</b> The relatively small history program there was {{among the best in}} the country and McGovern took courses given by noted academics Ray Allen Billington, Richard W.

Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black that the previous Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world.

When Dennis's mother, Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) questions Dennis about his injury, he lies that Whitney assaulted him. Sharon complains and Whitney is suspended, but appeals for her job and is allowed to keep it. Whitney later sets her sights on newcomer Johnny Carter (Sam Strike), unaware that he is gay. Johnny's parents, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), hope that Johnny and Whitney will become an item, but his sister Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) reveals to them that he is gay. A few weeks later, Johnny comes out to Whitney, which hurts her as she feels that Johnny has been using her. They later become good friends and Whitney forgives Johnny.|$|E
5|$|Professor Ellis (Rudolf Martin), a {{lecturer}} {{of the dead}} woman, gives a eulogy at her funeral. Chloe, {{a friend of the}} dead woman, attacks Ellis and slashes his neck, whose blood Mick recognizes as the blood in the vial. Beth tracks down Chloe, who explains that the professor has a vampire-worshipping blood cult, and he believes that he is a vampire. Later, Mick finds Chloe's dead body, who was murdered by Ellis. Knowing that Beth has gone to Ellis's class, he rushes to save her. After the class, Beth talks to Ellis about vampires and the young woman's murder, but he discovers that she is wearing a wire. Ellis attacks Beth and although she escapes, she is kidnapped by the professor's <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant.</b> Mick tracks down the assistant, defeats him, and takes an unconscious Beth to his apartment. In flashbacks to 22years in the past, Mick investigates the case of a missing girl. In a domestic fight between Mick and his ex-wife Coraline over the kidnapped girl, Mick stabs Coraline's heart with the leg of a broken chair. He lights the house on fire and rescues the girl, leaving Coraline to the fire. It is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth, and that Mick has tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years. In the present, Beth wakes up and remembers that Mick was stabbed by the assistant, and that {{he was the one who}} saved her as a child. Mick dismisses the claims as being caused by her head injury. Thanking him for saving her, she hugs him.|$|E

40|$|Health {{curriculum}} traditionally (re) produces obesity discourse, {{a fusion}} of biomedical and moral perspectives of weight and fat. This weight-centered approach to bodies may perpetuate weight stigmatization, indirectly supports a culture of thinness, and contradicts other health messages concerning bodies. A Health At Every Size® (HAES®) approach is an alternative, multidimensional health-centered approach that can reconcile the incongruent messages in obesity and eating disorder discourses and may reduce weight stigmatization. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop and evaluate a college personal health curriculum module to promote healthy bodies of all sizes. Discourse positions of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> were explored through interviews and provided an understanding of their values and teaching methods regarding weight and health. A HAES®-based curriculum module was developed for college personal health classes at a Midwestern university. Quasi-experimental design was used to compare attitudes toward HAES® principles among students who received the alternative, HAES®-based curriculum module versus those receiving a traditional weight management curriculum. Pre- and posttest attitudes of students and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> were assessed using the Health and Weight Attitudes Scale developed for this study. <b>Teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> provided evaluation of the HAES® module in a focus group. While <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> 2 ̆ 7 discourse positions varied, most used obesity discourse to talk and teach about bodies and weight. Alternative discourses were most common when <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> discussed eating disorders or body image. Students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes at pre-test were slightly positive and did not differ significantly between comparison and intervention groups. Intervention group students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes were significantly more positive than comparison group students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes at posttest. Intervention group <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> reported primarily positive experiences with the module. <b>Teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> rely primarily on obesity discourse to teach about weight and bodies but are receptive and positive when offered an alternative method. A HAES® curriculum module can increase positive attitudes of students and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> toward promotion of size acceptance and multidimensional health for people of all sizes...|$|R
