40|$|The <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> sectors play a {{significant}} role in Pakistan’s economy. In the rapidly changing global economic environment, there is an urgent need to strengthen the competitiveness of the <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> sectors. This paper highlights the issues and challenges in the <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> sectors, specifies strategic objectives and targets, and spells out an action plan for implementation. The <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> sectors are facing a number of challenges including a low technological base, lack of research and development, lack of trained manpower, low quality standards, concentration in low-value added products, and too much reliance on cotton. To address these challenges and to facilitate the transformation of these sectors into strong, dynamic, and internationally competitive industries led by the private sector, the public sector must create an enabling environment through a business friendly regulatory framework, appropriate incentives to the private sector, institutional support and provision of quality infrastructure. The paper recommends an action plan aimed at: improving the regulatory and policy framework; human resource development through improving the HRD institutions and encouraging the private sector to invest in skill enhancement; promoting research and development through strengthening of the existing institutions and establishing new institutions; technological up-gradation; rewarding value addition; ensuring quality standards; and establishing common facility centers. ...|$|R
