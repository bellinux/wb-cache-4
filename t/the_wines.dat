5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} {{in nearly every}} South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> were historically limited by the excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. <b>The</b> <b>wines</b> of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> more approachable at a younger age.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the grape}} was {{fermented}} and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, {{where it was}} used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel.|$|E

For a grape variety to appear on <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> label as a varietal wine it must account for at least 85% of <b>the</b> <b>wine.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> is a multi-grape blend it must list the grapes on <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> in order of importance with the exact percentages of each grape listed somewhere on <b>the</b> <b>wine.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> is labelled with a region then at least 85% of the grapes must be sourced from that area.|$|R

5|$|In Argentina, Cabernet Sauvignon {{lags behind}} Malbec as the country's main red grape but its numbers are growing. The varietal {{versions}} often have lighter fruit flavors and {{are meant to}} be consumed young. Premium examples are often blended with Malbec and produce full, tannic wines with leather and tobacco notes. In recent years, there have been increased plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon in the Uco Valley of the Mendoza Province; <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> coming from vineyards planted at higher altitudes garner some international attention.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, ampelographers began to {{distinguish}} Sauvignon blanc from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non-blended Chilean Sauvignon blanc are noticeably less acidic than <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of New Zealand and {{more similar to}} the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for Sauvignon blanc in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes {{to be picked up}} to six weeks later than in other parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called Sauvignon blanc planted in the region are really Seyval blanc.|$|E
5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed to the reputation of <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> that came from this area. The Counts of Champagne ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the last Count of Champagne assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region {{became part of the}} Crown territories.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E
5|$|The crémant {{produced}} in the Languedoc is made according to the Méthode Traditionnelle - formerly known as méthode champenoise, the same method used to produce the Champagne, including a second fermentation in the bottle to encapture the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast - in the small villages around the town of Limoux. <b>The</b> <b>wines</b> are normally composed of 70% Mauzac and a 30% combination of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. AOC regulations require a year of aging on the lees. The Blanquette de Limoux, when labelled méthode ancestrale, is composed entirely of Mauzac, undergoes only one fermentation and is aged approximately three months less on the lees before the bottling, the actual date being determined by the moon's cycle.|$|E
5|$|The still wines of {{the area}} were highly prized in Paris under the {{designation}} of vins de la rivière and vins de la montagne- wines {{of the river and}} wines of the mountain in reference to the wooded terrain and the river Marne which carried <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> down to the Seine and into Paris. The region was in competition with Burgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims' location along the trade route from Beaune. In the 15th century, Pinot noir became heavily planted in the area. The resulting red wine had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of Burgundy wines, despite the addition of elderberries to deepen the color. This led to a greater focus on white wines.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wine</b> is left {{to mature}} in vats or barrels for several months and {{is not allowed to}} leave <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> sheds before 31 March of the year {{following}} the harvest. Quarterly rackings ensure that the lees held in suspension in <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> are gradually removed. Before being bottled, <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> is filtered and the sulfite level is adjusted.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} causes for <b>the</b> {{perception}} in <b>wine</b> faults, including poor hygiene at the winery, excessive or insufficient exposure of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> to oxygen, excessive or insufficient exposure of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> to sulphur, overextended maceration of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> either pre- or post-fermentation, faulty fining, filtering and stabilization of <b>the</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>the</b> use of dirty oak barrels, over-extended barrel aging {{and the use}} of poor quality corks. Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> can contribute to the perception of flaws in <b>the</b> <b>wine.</b> These include poor storage of <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty stemware during wine tasting that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.|$|R
5|$|Winemakers {{can also}} control the {{influence}} of oak by using alternatives to the standard barrique barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and therefore less pronounced oak flavors. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is tea bagging with oak chips or adding oak planks to <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> while fermenting or aging it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than oak barrels, they create more pronounced oak flavors, which tend not to mellow or integrate {{with the rest of}} the wine's components; nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel aging.|$|E
5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in <b>the</b> <b>wines.</b> It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{short-term}} aging needs of wine {{is a period}} where <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> is considered [...] "sick" [...] due to the trauma and volatility of the bottling experience. During bottling <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> is exposed to some oxygen which causes a domino effect of chemical reactions with various components of <b>the</b> <b>wine.</b> <b>The</b> {{time it takes for}} <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> to settle down and have the oxygen fully dissolve and integrate with <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> is considered its period of [...] "bottle shock". During this time <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> could taste drastically different from how it did prior to bottling or how it will taste after <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> has settled. While many modern bottling lines try to treat <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> as gently as possible and utilize inert gases to minimize the amount of oxygen exposure, all wine goes through some period of bottle shock. The length of this period will vary with each individual wine.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the tanks}} {{the carbon dioxide}} {{by-product}} of fermentation is trapped with the gas dissolving into <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> and creating <b>the</b> ultimate source of the bubbles that are seen in a wine glass. Fermentation is allowed to continue until <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> has reached between 7-9% alcohol and between 3-5% residual sugar. <b>The</b> <b>wine</b> is chilled again to halt fermentation before it is sent to a centrifuge that filters and removes all yeast from <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> to prevent fermentation from resuming. <b>The</b> <b>wine</b> is then bottled and shipped.|$|R
25|$|The {{area around}} Chinon, Bourgueil and Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil {{produces}} {{the majority of}} the Loire Valley's red wine based on the Cabernet franc grapeknown in this areas as Breton. <b>The</b> <b>wines</b> of the Chinon area are the softest and rich expression of the grape while the Bourgueil area produces more tannic and firm wines. The St-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil area produces the lightest colored wines. In the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of the Chinon area were compared favorably by critics to <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of Château Margaux and even today is considered some of the best expression of the Cabernet franc grape. <b>The</b> <b>wines</b> from this region can achieve a nice purple color with notes of raspberry fruit and graphite. Unlike Cabernet franc from warmer climates, Chinon are typically served slightly cooler than most red wine.|$|E
25|$|Coteaux du Layon Villages AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du Layon AOC, this wine region covers six communes {{along the}} Layon river that have {{historically}} produced wines of high quality. The six communes are Beaulieu-sur-Layon, Faye-d'Anjou, Rablay-sur-Layon, Rochefort-sur-Loire, Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné and Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay. According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, there are noticeable differences among <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> produced by each commune (all made from Chenin blanc) with <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of Beaulieu-sur-Layon being characterized by their light aromas; Faye-d'Anjou wines having a distinctive brushwood aroma; Rablay-sur-Layon wines {{tend to be}} the most bold and round; <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of Rochefort-sur-Loire tend to be full bodied and have the most aging potential; Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné wines are characterized by their delicate aromas that develop over time and <b>the</b> <b>wines</b> of Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay often have very round mouthfeel and robust flavors.|$|E
