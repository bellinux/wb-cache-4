5|$|Three {{individual}} models, or grades, {{were available}} on the car's release in 2006; S, M, and G, in ascending order of price. They all shared the same five-door hatchback body style and <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engine,</b> but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment. In 2007 the base S model was given the new naturally aspirated powerplant, and was positioned below the two new grades, L and LX, whose engine it shared.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engine,</b> codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for Sportcar racing. As the V64V was originally naturally aspirated, TWR needed to redesign all parts of the engine to accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the internals, and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90° bank angle, four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead camshafts. It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{took over}} the IMSA GT Championship {{operation}} in 1988 and one model– Jaguar XJR-9– was launched to compete in both series. The XJR-9, which retained the Jaguar V12 engine, {{went on to win}} the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans and World Sportscar Championship in the same year. The poor fuel consumption of the Jaguar V12 combined with new rules restricting refueling during races forced the replacement of the V12 engine in the XJR-9s successors, the XJR-10 and XJR-11. The normally-aspirated Austin Rover V64V engine, designed for the MG Metro 6R4 had recently been made redundant thanks to the Group B rally ban in 1987, and the design rights were for sale. The compact, lightweight and fuel efficient nature of the small-displacement, <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engine</b> was investigated by TWR, who considered it an ideal basis for a new engine to power the XJR-10 and purchased the design rights from Austin Rover Group.|$|E

5|$|Brabham {{had been}} working with the German engine {{manufacturer}} BMW since 1980 on the development of a <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engine</b> for Formula One. The BMW-powered BT50 made its debut {{at the start of the}} 1982 season, taking advantage of the high-altitude Kyalami circuit in South Africa, which favoured turbocharged cars. However, the as yet unreliable BMW-powered cars were dropped for the next two races. Piquet finished first at the Brazilian Grand Prix in a BT49D, but was disqualified after a protest from Renault and Ferrari on the grounds that the car had raced underweight due to its water-cooled brakes. FISA ruled that in future all cars must be weighed before coolants were topped up, resulting in a boycott of the fourth race of the season by most of the DFV-powered teams, including Brabham. Under threat from BMW, Brabham did not use its Ford-powered BT49s again until the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, where one was entered for Riccardo Patrese alongside Piquet in a BT50. Patrese won the race after a chaotic final lap on which several other cars stopped. Patrese used the BT49 for the next two races, taking a second place behind Piquet's BMW-powered car in the BT49's final Formula One race, the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Renault had {{introduced}} turbocharged engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had tested a BMW four-cylinder M12 <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the summer}} of 1981. For the 1982 season the team designed a new car, the BT50, around the BMW engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years before, was based on a road car engine block, the BMW M10. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D {{in the early part of}} the season while reliability and driveability issues with the BMW units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the Canadian Grand Prix. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers Riccardo Patrese, who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the Monaco Grand Prix, 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the Drivers' Championship. In the 1983 season, Piquet took the championship lead from Renault's Alain Prost at the last race of the year, the South African Grand Prix to become the first driver to win the Formula One Drivers' World Championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the Constructors' Championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. Riccardo Patrese was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period—the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons. Patrese finished ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points, dropping the team behind Ferrari and Renault to third in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

25|$|The Proton Prevé GXR CVT {{was finally}} {{launched}} in Australia between November and December 2013, {{almost a year}} after the Prevé GX Australian début. The GXR offers all the exclusive kit first seen on the Malaysian-market Prevé Premium trim and is priced at $23,990 drive-away, with an early bird $1,000 factory bonus. Australian-market Prevé GXRs are fitted with a Turbo badge in place of the usual CFE on the rear bootlid to emphasise the new <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engine</b> and to better distinguish the GXR from the GX variants. Additionally, a 6-speed manual variant of the Prevé GXR will launch {{in the second quarter of}} 2014 with an estimated price of $20,990, or $2,000 less than the GXR CVT currently on sale. Additionally, a more luxurious LE variant and a sportier R3 model will join the Prevé line-up later in 2014. The Prevé will also be offered with an all-new 2.0 litre <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engine</b> in early 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The new formula reintroduced <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engines,</b> {{which last}} {{appeared}} in [...] These have their efficiency improved by turbo-compounding and introduce more energy recovery systems – with {{power to be}} harvested from the brakes and exhaust gases. The original proposal for four-cylinder <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engines</b> was not welcomed by the racing teams, in particular Ferrari. Adrian Newey stated during the 2011 European Grand Prix that the change to a V6 enables teams to carry the engine as a stressed member, whereas an inline 4 would have required a space frame. A compromise was reached to adopt V6 <b>turbocharged</b> <b>engines</b> instead. The internal combustion engines are limited to 15,000 rpm, but rarely exceed 12,000 rpm during Grand Prix due to the new reliability and fuel flow restrictions.|$|R
