5|$|In 23BC Emperor Augustus became gravely ill and his {{possible}} death {{threatened to}} plunge the Roman world into chaos again. Historians generally {{agree that it}} is during this time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that Agrippa and Marcellus would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United States v. Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trialas authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not {{be the subject of}} a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate a rejection of the motion. Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC {{conceded that}} the state governments were not {{carrying}} on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity. On 16 May 2005, The Federal Court of Australia (Allsop J presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance. While {{the court held that}} Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding). The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of Bradken.|$|E

25|$|The Marshall Court heard thirty-one {{criminal}} cases under the certificate of division procedure authorized by § 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1802. However, the Court had {{held that the}} sufficiency of the evidence could not be certified—whether on a motion {{for a new trial}} or a motion for a directed verdict. In United States v.

25|$|In 1802 William Paley {{formulated}} {{the first}} known teleological argument depicting machines producing other machines, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> who originally made a watch was rendered moot if it were demonstrated that the watch was able to manufacture a copy of itself. Scientific study of self-reproducing machines was anticipated by John Bernal as early as 1929 and by mathematicians such as Stephen Kleene who began developing recursion theory in the 1930s. Much of this latter work was motivated by interest in information processing and algorithms rather than physical implementation of such a system, however.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} extreme {{examples}} showing that second-order logic with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. There is a finite second-order theory whose only {{model is the}} real numbers if the continuum hypothesis holds and which has no model if the continuum hypothesis does not hold (cf. Shapiro 2000, p.105). This theory consists of a finite theory characterizing the real numbers as a complete Archimedean ordered field plus an axiom saying that the domain is of the first uncountable cardinality. This example illustrates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether a sentence in second-order logic is consistent is extremely subtle.|$|E

25|$|Besides the lattice of recursively {{enumerable}} sets, automorphisms {{are also}} studied for {{the structure of}} the Turing degrees of all sets as well as for {{the structure of the}} Turing degrees of r.e. sets. In both cases, Cooper claims to have constructed nontrivial automorphisms which map some degrees to other degrees; this construction has, however, not been verified and some colleagues believe that the construction contains errors and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether there is a nontrivial automorphism of the Turing degrees is still one of the main unsolved questions in this area (Slaman and Woodin 1986, Ambos-Spies and Fejer 2006).|$|E

Advocates for same-sex spouses of veterans welcomed the announcement, but noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the rights of such spouses remained uncertain if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2015, {{federal judge}} George H. King {{ruled that the}} Warner/Chappell {{copyright}} claim over the lyrics was invalid.

The court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether the 1922 and 1927 publications were authorized, thus placing the song in the public domain, presented questions of fact that {{would need to be}} resolved at trial. However, Warner/Chappell had failed to prove that it actually had ever held a copyright to the lyrics, so the court was able to grant summary judgment to the plaintiffs, thus resolving the case.|$|E

25|$|Nielsen {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> origin is {{the wrong}} one to ask and can produce misleading results. Because of the widespread migration of numerous ethnic groups like the Celts and Teutonic peoples and events like Roman expansion and subsequent Romanization, {{it is highly unlikely}} that only one ethnic group was responsible for the development of the Gundestrup cauldron. Instead, the make and art of the cauldron can be thought of as the product of a fusion of cultures, each inspiring and expanding upon one another. In the end, Nielsen concludes that, based on accelerator datings from beeswax found on the back of the plates, the vessel was created within the Roman Iron Age at a location somewhere in Central Europe.|$|E
25|$|Following independence, Ukraine {{declared}} {{itself a}} neutral state.

It was later agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> joining NATO should be answered by a national referendum {{at some point in}} the future. Recently deposed President Viktor Yanukovych considered the current level of co-operation between Ukraine and NATO sufficient, and was against Ukraine joining NATO.
