5|$|These {{changes were}} {{embodied}} in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute over the future status of Militia regiments. It essentially abolished the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry, and used them {{to create a new}} Territorial Force of fourteen infantry divisions, fourteen cavalry brigades, and a large number of support units, all raised, organised and financed by local organisations but liable for service under War Office command. The Militia provided the Special Reserve, which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> for service with the regular forces in wartime.|$|E
5|$|An {{accomplice}} {{could be}} sued {{if he had}} provided help ope consilio – a physical act relating to the method of execution, rather than mere encouragement. It appears that Labeo {{was the first to}} require help or advice, and earlier sources suggest that both help and advice was required. Labeo's version was certainly entrenched by the early second century AD. An accomplice was treated as if he himself had committed the crime. Only one person needed to have handled the thing for all wrongdoers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable.</b> Republican jurists were harder on accomplices than later jurists under the empire. Indeed, Ulpian considers the unwitting accomplice, who accidentally knocks out of the victim's hand some coins which are then stolen, an accomplice to the theft. Some commentators have gone as far to say that the veteres ("ancients") may not have even required a third party to remove the coins, {{as long as they were}} otherwise lost to the owner.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{admitted}} {{that those who}} were mere investors ought not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> for debts arising from the management of a corporation, throughout {{the late nineteenth century}} there were still many arguments for unlimited liability for managers and directors on the model of the French société en commandite. Such liability for directors of English companies was abolished in 2006. Further, it became increasingly common {{from the end of the}} nineteenth century for shareholders to be directors, protecting themselves from liability.|$|E

25|$|Alternative {{scenarios}} {{have been}} put forth as more accurate and realistic representations of the moral issues present in abortion. John Noonan proposes the scenario of a family who was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick. It is argued that just as {{it would not be}} permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect him from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus.|$|E
25|$|On June 12, 2009, {{the trial}} {{court held that the}} {{complaint}} should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim, because if everything stated in the complaint was taken as true, it stated grounds for Yoo <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> to Padilla for civil damages. But on February 17, 2011, the District Court dismissed another suit by Padilla against other former officials (including Leon Panetta who was Secretary of Defense {{at the time of the}} hearing) that had been brought on February 9, 2007. Lebron v. Rumsfeld, 764 F.Supp.2d 787 (D.S.C.). On January 23, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this dismissal.|$|E

25|$|In November 1916, Pfalz hired Rudolph Gehringer from Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen GmbH. As Pfalz’s {{new chief}} engineer, Gehringer {{immediately}} commenced {{work on an}} original fighter design. The resulting D.III emerged in April 1917. Like the Rolands, the D.III used a plywood monocoque fuselage. Two layers of thin plywood strips were placed over a mold to form one half of a fuselage shell. The fuselage halves were then glued together, covered {{with a layer of}} fabric, and doped. This Wickelrumpf method gave the fuselage great strength, light weight, and smooth contours compared to conventional construction techniques. However, it also proved to be more labor-intensive and expensive. Furthermore, fuselages of the Wickelrumpf type proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> to twisting or warping in service, affecting performance as well as causing control problems. This has been attributed to moisture absorption in damp front-line conditions or to the use of insufficiently seasoned wood.|$|E
25|$|After the verdict, the {{question}} was how to collect. The former monarchy of Iran had {{billions of dollars in}} assets within the United States that were frozen after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. However, in order to secure an end to the Iranian Hostage Crisis, the assets were unfrozen and most if not all of it, was collected by 1982 due to the Iran–Iraq War. Rhode Island attorney David J. Strachman, along with other attorneys, representing the plaintiffs, found that the late Shah had purchased a home in Lubbock, Texas for his son, which was sold for $400,000;. After that, they attempted to go after assets of Iranians who had previously worked for the former monarchy, but the U.S. courts would overturn all their attempts to seize their assets, as they were not found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> for the damages. They then went after Iranian-owned objects held by U.S. museums in Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan. The Oriental Institute and its holdings from Persepolis became a primary target. Strachman said collectors are interested in the antiquities, potentially for tens of millions of dollars.|$|E
500|$|It {{extended}} the Reserve Forces Act 1882 {{to allow the}} enlistment of men who had not served in the regular forces, {{to be known as}} [...] "special reservists". Special reservists were permitted to agree to serve for an indefinite period without discharge, and could agree in writing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> for callout without a proclamation or order of Parliament. No more than four thousand men could be liable under this latter provision at any one time, and the power was not to be exercised except for overseas service when [...] "warlike operations are in preparation or in progress". The Reserve Forces and Militia Act 1898 was extended to allow up to six thousand men in total <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> for callout without proclamation, and for the period of their liability to be up to two years.|$|E

Rebecca also strongly defended Toral to the point where Trump allowed Toral one last chance to prove herself.

60|$|Mixed modes, therefore, {{that are}} made up but of a few and obvious simple ideas, have usually names of no very {{uncertain}} signification.

The names of substances, being annexed <b>to</b> ideas that <b>are</b> neither the real essences, nor exact representations of the patterns they <b>are</b> referred <b>to,</b> <b>are</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> yet greater imperfection and uncertainty, especially when we come to a philosophical use of them.|$|R
500|$|The Supreme Court {{provided}} {{additional guidance}} on the [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test in Johnson v. De Grandy (1994). The Court {{emphasized that the}} existence of the three Gingles preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination, especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans. In particular, the Court held that even where the three Gingles preconditions are satisfied, a jurisdiction is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority-minority districts that is proportional to the minority group's population. The decision thus clarified that Section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize the number of majority-minority districts. The opinion also distinguished the proportionality of majority-minority districts, which allows minorities to have a proportional opportunity to elect their candidates of choice, from the proportionality of election results, which Section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{before the}} release of the album (in May 2006), Keane had started their second world tour that would promote the album. However, because of the {{extensive}} touring, on 22 August 2006, Chaplin announced he had admitted himself to a clinic for drinking and drug problems. This initially resulted in the cancellation of three gigs and postponement of their September US tour. The entire North American tour was later cancelled outright to allow continued treatment. As a result, the upcoming UK and European tours – scheduled for October and November 2006 – were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> for possible postponement depending on Chaplin's treatment. Chaplin then left the Priory Clinic in London on 6 October, although he continued to receive treatment. The tour reached for the first time South American countries (Argentina, Chile and Brazil) and saw the band's third visit to Mexico in late April with four dates, playing at the downtown zócalo in Mexico City, as well their first visit to Monterrey and Guadalajara. On 7 July 2007, Keane played at the UK leg of Live Earth at Wembley Stadium, part of a series of gigs similar to Live 8, to highlight the threat of global warming. They performed [...] "Somewhere Only We Know", [...] "Is It Any Wonder?" [...] and [...] "Bedshaped". The Under the Iron Sea tour was brought to an end with performances in Oporto, Portugal, and at the Natural Music Festival in El Ejido, Spain, on 3 August and 4 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{shortly after the}} {{protectorate}} was founded in 1891, little of the land on European estates was planted, as few African workers were resident on estate lands at that time. Many of the Certificates of Claim issued to settlers contained “non-disturbance” clauses allowing these existing residents to continue to cultivate their existing fields rent-free [...] Many of the new workers who moved onto estates were so-called [...] "Anguru", migrants from Mozambique who were required to pay rent, usually satisfied by two months’ labour {{a year in the}} early years, under the system known as thangata although later many owners required a longer period of work. R S Hynde, the General Manager of Blantyre and East Africa Ltd, made an agreement with the headmen of villages on the company's estates in Cholo District under which the villagers were to give up their rights under the non-disturbance clause and become the company’s tenants, working for two months during the growing season in lieu of rent and Hut tax. If any of the villagers worked for another employer they were to pay their rent and taxes in cash, and those who could not work for it or pay rent were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liable</b> to be evicted. In 1903, the administration asked the High Court to cancel this agreement, as it contravened the non-disturbance clause. The court accepted that the villagers’ rights protected by the non-disturbance clause could not be exchanged for an insecure tenancy under an illegal thangata agreement.|$|E
