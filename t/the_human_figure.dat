5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive {{of the female}} body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the ceiling}} {{decoration}} are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> and which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since.|$|E
5|$|The {{design and}} {{personality}} traits {{of the character}} Rei Ayanami were reused for many anime characters of the late 1990s, such as Ruri Hoshino of Nadesico, Ruriko Tsukushima (The Droplet), Miharu (Gasaraki), Anthy Himemiya (Revolutionary Girl Utena), and Lain Iwakura (Serial Experiments Lain). The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel (Excel Saga), {{and some of her}} traits were used to create the character of Mai in Gunparade March. According to Italian critic Guido Tavassi, Evangelions mecha design, characterized by a greater resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> and the abstract designs of the Angels, also {{had a significant impact on}} the designs of future anime productions.|$|E

The rare woman figure holding a bow in her hand is thought to show the mythic [...] "Tellervo", a goddess from the Kalevala mythology, who {{is thought to be}} the progenitor of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> race. Women never usually took part in the hunting, that is why she is thought to be of a more divine nature.|$|R

5|$|The make-up for Citizen Kane {{was created}} and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior {{member of the}} RKO make-up department. Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, {{escaping}} persecution. As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the Moscow Art Theatre, where {{his father was a}} wigmaker and make-up artist. In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union. He worked on Max Reinhardt's 1924 production of The Miracle and with the Yiddish Art Theatre, and he studied <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> at the Art Students League of New York. After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by Max Factor and then by RKO. Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.|$|E
5|$|In the Pasión River {{region of}} Petén, rulers {{began to be}} portrayed as ballplayers on stelae. Seibal was the first site {{in the region to}} depict its rulers thus. Seventeen stelae were erected at Seibal between 849 and 889, and show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, {{including}} a lord wearing the beaked mask of Ehecatl, the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth. Some of these have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at Cacaxtla, a non-Maya site in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala. This hybrid style seems to indicate that the kings of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources. Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs. Stelae at Oxkintok, to the north in the Puuc region of the Yucatán Peninsula, divided the face of the stela into up to three levels, each of which contained a different scene, usually of a lone figure that could be either male or female. The representation of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> differed from the formal treatment in the south, and were simplified, coarse representations lacking individuality amongst sociopolitical and religious symbols.|$|E

25|$|The tools {{represented}} in Levantine Art are usually arrows, sticks, quivers and bags, and ropes, perhaps used as lassos or trip-ropes.

25|$|The role of art models {{has changed}} through {{different}} eras as {{the meaning and}} importance of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure</b> in art and society has changed.

25|$|The {{painting}} combines {{elements of}} both the Cubist and Futurist movements. In the composition, Duchamp depicts motion by successive superimposed images, similar to stroboscopic motion photography. Duchamp also recognized {{the influence of the}} stop-motion photography of Étienne-Jules Marey, particularly Muybridge's Woman Walking Downstairs from his 1887 picture series, published as <b>The</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Figure</b> in Motion.|$|E
50|$|As in {{his earlier}} {{picture of the}} Garden at Sainte-Adresse, Monet {{concentrated}} on repetitive elements - the ripples on the water, the foliage, <b>the</b> boats, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> - to weave a fabric of brushstrokes which, although emphatically brushstrokes, retain a strong descriptive quality.|$|R

25|$|The ukiyo-e {{style that}} {{developed}} from the 16th century onwards, first in painting and then in coloured woodblock prints that were cheap and widely available, initially concentrated on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> individually and in groups.

25|$|Eadweard Muybridge {{returned}} to his native England in 1894, and continued to lecture extensively throughout Great Britain. He {{returned to}} the US once more, in 1896–1897, to settle financial affairs and to dispose of property related to {{his work at the}} University of Pennsylvania. He retained control of his negatives, which he used to publish two popular books of his work, Animals in Motion (1899) and <b>The</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Figure</b> in Motion (1901), both of which remain in print over a century later.|$|E
50|$|Between 1884 and 1886, Rodin created nude {{studies of}} each of the burghers, then draped them in wet canvas in order to cover to better grasp how <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> would look clothed with sackcloth, as their real-life {{counterparts}} were supposed to have worn when surrendering to Edward III of England.|$|R
50|$|Only {{very few}} artistic works of Matthijs Musson are known. His style was clearly {{influenced}} by his master Rubens in his preference for ornamental opulence, sumptuous still lifes and a dramatic sense of narration. <b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>figures</b> in his compositions are more stylised and svelte {{in comparison with}} the Rubenesque models.|$|R

25|$|Animals are, with <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> the {{earliest}} subject for sculpture, and {{have always been}} popular, sometimes realistic, but often imaginary monsters; in China animals and monsters are almost the only traditional subjects for stone sculpture outside tombs and temples. The kingdom of plants is important only in jewellery and decorative reliefs, but these form almost all the large sculpture of Byzantine art and Islamic art, and are very important in most Eurasian traditions, where motifs such as the palmette and vine scroll have passed east and west for over two millennia.|$|E
25|$|Just as in Csaky's Groupe de femmes (1911–12), Danseuse already {{showed a}} new way of {{representing}} <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> an unwillingness to revert to classical, academic or traditional methods of representation. The complex angular syntax visible in Danseuse was born out of a growing sense of contemporary dynamism, out of rhythm, balance, harmony and out of the powerful geometric qualities of Egyptian art, African art, early Cycladic art, Gothic art, of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Auguste Rodin, Gustave Courbet, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne, all of whom Csaky greatly admired.|$|E
25|$|Most notable was his {{interest}} in the instruction of all aspects of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>figure,</b> including anatomical study of the human and animal body, and surgical dissection; there were also rigorous courses in the fundamentals of form, and studies in perspective which involved mathematics. As an aid to the study of anatomy, plaster casts were made from dissections, duplicates of which were furnished to students. A similar study was made of the anatomy of horses; acknowledging Eakins' expertise, in 1891 his friend, the sculptor William Rudolf O'Donovan, asked him to collaborate on the commission to create bronze equestrian reliefs of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch in Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn.|$|E
