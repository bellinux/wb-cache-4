5|$|Home Rule was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> in British {{politics}} in the late 1880s. The debate revolved around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to devolve power to Ireland. The Conservatives were opposed to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a split in the Liberal party, the creation of the Liberal Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with the Liberal Unionists.|$|E

25|$|The {{achievement}} of Human Sexual Inadequacy {{was to move}} thinking from psychopathology to learning, only if a problem {{did not respond to}} educative treatment would psychopathological problems be considered. Also treatment was directed at couples, whereas before partners would be seen individually. Masters and Johnson saw that sex was a joint act. They believed that sexual communication was <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> to sexual problems not the specifics of an individual problem. They also proposed co-therapy, a matching pair of therapists to the clients, arguing that a lone male therapist could not fully comprehend female difficulties.|$|E
25|$|On February 6, a {{separate}} committee, charged with drafting {{a proposal for}} the entire convention to consider, was formed. The committee consisted of one representative from each state and was headed by James Guthrie. The entire convention met for three weeks, and its final product was a proposed seven-point constitutional amendment that differed little from the Crittenden Compromise. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue,</b> slavery in the territories, was addressed simply by extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific Ocean, with no provision for newly-acquired territory. That section passed by a 9–8 vote of the states.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976, {{concern of}} nuclear weapons {{proliferation}} (especially after India demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities using reprocessing technology) led President Gerald Ford to issue a Presidential directive to indefinitely suspend the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the U.S. On 7 April 1977, President Jimmy Carter banned the reprocessing of commercial reactor spent nuclear fuel. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> driving this policy was the risk {{of nuclear weapons}} proliferation by diversion of plutonium from the civilian fuel cycle, and to encourage other nations to follow the USA lead. After that, only countries that already had large investments in reprocessing infrastructure continued to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but did not provide the substantial subsidy {{that would have been}} necessary to start up commercial reprocessing.|$|E

25|$|Suppressing a {{rebellion}} in America presented the British with major problems. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> was distance; {{it could take}} up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated {{by the time that}} they arrived. The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict, yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston. Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly {{in the power of the}} Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority of the American population was agrarian, not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.|$|E

500|$|The Venezuelan {{crisis of}} 1895 {{occurred}} over Venezuela's longstanding {{dispute with the}} United Kingdom about the territory of Essequibo and Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory. As the dispute became a crisis, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> became Britain's refusal {{to include in the}} proposed international arbitration the territory east of the [...] "Schomburgk Line", which a surveyor had drawn half a century earlier as a boundary between Venezuela and the former Dutch territory of British Guiana. The crisis ultimately saw Britain accept the United States' intervention in the dispute to force arbitration of the entire disputed territory, and tacitly accept the United States' right to intervene under the Monroe Doctrine. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.|$|E

2500|$|Lithium–sulfur {{batteries}} may succeed lithium-ion cells {{because of}} their higher energy density and reduced cost {{from the use of}} sulfur. Currently the best Li–S batteries offer specific energies on the order of 500W·h/kg, significantly better than most lithium-ion batteries, which are in the range of 150 to 200W·h/kg. Li–S batteries with up to 1,500 charge and discharge cycles have been demonstrated.

2500|$|John Maynard Keynes {{was among}} the first proponents of a {{securities}} transaction tax. In 1936 he proposed that a small tax should be levied on dealings on Wall Street, in the United States, where he argued that excessive speculation by uninformed financial traders increased volatility. For Keynes, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> was the proportion of 'speculators' in the market, and his concern that, if left unchecked, these types of players would become too dominant. Keynes writes: [...] "The introduction of a substantial Government transfer tax on all transactions might prove the most serviceable reform available, with a view to mitigating the predominance of speculation over enterprise in the United States.
