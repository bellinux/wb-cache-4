5|$|Maldonado {{filed suit}} in the South Carolina U.S. District Court on July 24, 2013, asking that the ICWA be {{declared}} unconstitutional. On July 31, 2013, the Capobiancos legally adopted the child. Concurrently with the South Carolina court finalizing the adoption, the Native American Rights Fund filed a civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court {{on behalf of the}} child, alleging that her rights had been violated by the South Carolina court. In addition, a South Carolina court order cannot be enforced in Oklahoma without the agreement of an Oklahoma court, and Brown stated that he would fight the order in Oklahoma, with the aid of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation.</b> Prior to the South Carolina adoption being finalized, <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> District Court granted temporary guardianship to Brown's wife and parents while Brown was in military training out of state. At the same time, a judge in South Carolina ordered Brown to immediately turn over the child to the Capobiancos, which representatives of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> said was impossible while Brown was performing his military duties.|$|E
5|$|The elder Hindman {{frequently}} made {{business trips}} to Alabama and even moved {{the family to}} Jacksonville after buying several lots of land there. He {{took advantage of the}} many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. He also gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included Cherokee Indian tribes in the area. Hindman became trusted by <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> and was appointed as the sub-agent to the Cherokees by President James Monroe. After Andrew Jackson became President, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation.</b> The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation,</b> and in 1841 was assigned by Acting Secretary of War Albert M. Lea to determine why the Cherokees in North Carolina had rejected the government's suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory. Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to rejoin the rest of their nation further West.|$|E
5|$|The English {{language}} has been {{official in the}} state of Oklahoma since 2010. The variety of North American English spoken is called Oklahoma English, and this dialect is quite diverse with its uneven blending of features of North Midland, South Midland, and Southern dialects. In 2000, 2,977,187 Oklahomans—92.6% of the resident population five years or older—spoke only English at home, a decrease from 95% in 1990. 238,732 Oklahoma residents reported speaking a language other than English in the 2000 census, about 7.4% of the state's population. Spanish is the second-most commonly spoken language in the state, with 141,060 speakers counted in 2000. The two most commonly spoken native North American languages are Cherokee and Choctaw with 10,000 Cherokee speakers living within <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> tribal jurisdiction area of eastern Oklahoma, and another 10,000 Choctaw speakers living in the Choctaw Nation directly south of the Cherokees. Cherokee is an official language in <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> tribal jurisdiction area and in the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.|$|E
2500|$|In 1861, Quantrill went to Texas with a slaveholder named Marcus Gill. There he met Joel B.

[...] He {{had moved from}} Georgia to the old Indian Territory in 1838. Mayes enlisted {{and served as a}} private in Company A of <b>the</b> 1st <b>Cherokee</b> Regiment in <b>the</b> Confederate army. It was Mayes who taught Quantrill guerrilla warfare tactics. He would learn the ambush {{fighting}} tactics used by the Native Americans as well as sneak attacks and camouflage.

5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E

5|$|Situated {{along the}} lower Little Tennessee, lower Tellico, and lower Hiwassee rivers, the Overhill towns rose to {{prominence}} within <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> {{in the early}} 18th century, when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists. In {{the early part of}} the century, the Overhill towns' remote location at the far end of the Trading Path meant they were reached only by those traders and explorers adventurous enough to make the difficult journey to the interior over the mountain range. By the middle of the century, the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries, as the two powers struggled for the control of the continent and the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation.</b> Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines {{the best interest of the}} child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{also took}} {{up the issue of}} white {{settlement}} in Indian Territory. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the Unassigned Lands in what is now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation,</b> which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land to be open to white settlement.|$|E

25|$|The Delaware Tribe of Indians (Lenape) {{became part}} of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> in 1867. On 28 July 2009 it {{achieved}} independent federal recognition as a tribe.

The name of the group originated in 1978 and in 1991 after learning more of their history, changed it to Northern <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> of <b>the</b> Old Louisiana Territory to better describe the history of who they are.

25|$|On September 26, 2004, Lucy Allen, a Freedmen descendant, filed {{a lawsuit}} with <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> <b>Nation</b> Supreme Court, asserting that the acts barring Freedmen {{descendants}} from tribal membership were unconstitutional, {{in the case of}} Allen v.
