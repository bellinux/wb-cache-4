25|$|Nivkhs {{lived in}} {{two types of}} {{self-built}} winter dwellings. Most ancient of these was the ryv (or to). The dwelling was a round dugout about 7.5 meters (23feet) in diameter, shored up by wooden poles and covered with packed dirt and grass. The ryv had a fireplace {{in the center and}} a smoke hole for light and smoke escape. The other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> used for winter is the chad ryv similar to the Nanai dio which was modeled after Manchurian and Chinese dwellings of the Amur. The chad ryv were one-room structures with a gable roof and a kan (Korean furnace) for heating. A nearby shed held sledges, skis, boats, and dogs.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2001 Census, the {{population}} of the Dulwich census area (which includes adjoining Rose Park) is 2,663 people, with a very slight decrease in population between the 1996 and 2001 censuses. 52.4% of {{the population}} is female, 79.4% are Australian born (see chart for a breakdown of foreign-born) and 92.5% of residents are Australian citizens. Religious adherence in Dulwich is lower than the Burnside and Adelaide average, standing at 64.3%. The eight strongest religions in decreasing order are; Catholic, Anglican, Uniting Church, Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Buddhism and Hinduism. The most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> was a Separate House (64.4%) followed by a flat, apartment or other (24.9%) and a semi-detached house (9.6%). Dulwich has a highly educated population with 44.5% holding a diploma or higher degree. This educational attainment is reflected in household income - almost two thirds earn over A$1000 per week.|$|E
2500|$|Concurrent {{with the}} {{development}} of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> that {{came to be known as}} the Usonian House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the Malcolm Willey House (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including sandwich walls that consisted of layers of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper, a significant change from typically framed walls. Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the water consumption patterns for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> residential <b>dwellings</b> and areas in Adelaide, Australia. The method uses datasets regularly collected and maintained {{by a number}} of organizations to allow water consumption patterns to be analyzed and examined over time. The results suggest that water consumption varies between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> residential <b>dwellings,</b> and areas, and that using metropolitan averages to measure national consumption patterns can be misleading. Importantly, the results suggest that per capita consumption is not significantly different between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings.</b> The ability to analyze water consumption patterns at the local level would enable planners and managers to better target initiatives aimed at reducing water consumption, and would also give planners a new tool to assess planning and environmental policies. ...|$|R

40|$|Définition des {{habitats}} isolés, diffus et groupés. Méthode de caractérisation et de cartographie de ces types d'habitat dans le contexte de prévention du risque d'incendie. Mise en relation des types d'habitat avec le risque d'incendie. / In {{a context}} of forest fire risk, the development of actions concerning wildfire prevention and land management is necessary and essential particularly in wildland urban interfaces (WUI). The term WUI' always includes components such as human presence and wildland vegetation. Both the hazard (probability of fire outbreak, distribution) and the vulnerability of urban areas can be characterized through the spatial organization of houses and vegetation. The first required step is to characterize and map WUI in large areas and at a large scale, which in turn requires qualifying different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> and mapping them. With this goal in view, the paper presents a brief synthesis of results coming from an exploratory process for the characterization <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> <b>types</b> (Lampin et al., 2007), and develops a method based on GIS-geo treatments to characterize different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> with regard to fire risk. Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> were classified: isolated dwellings, scattered dwellings and clustered dwellings, using criteria based on the distance between houses, the size of clusters of houses and housing density, which can be mapped automatically. Within dwelling types, the density value of forest fire ignition changed and was twice as high for isolated dwellings as for clustered dwellings. The spatial organization <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> {{seems to have a}} real impact on fire occurrence. Thus maps <b>of</b> different <b>dwelling</b> <b>types</b> can be interpreted for use in developing fire fighting strategies or prevention actions concerning end-users such as forest and land planning managers or fire-fighters...|$|R
