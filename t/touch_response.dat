40|$|SummaryBackgroundAmong the Aristotelian senses, the {{subcellular}} {{and molecular}} mechanisms {{involved in the}} sense of touch are the most poorly understood. ResultsWe demonstrate that specialized sensory neurons, the class II and class III multidendritic (md) neurons, are gentle touch sensors of Drosophila larvae. Genetic silencing of these cells significantly impairs gentle <b>touch</b> <b>responses,</b> optogenetic activation of these cells triggers behavioral touch-like responses, and optical recordings from these neurons show that they respond to force. The class III neurons possess highly dynamic dendritic protrusions rich in F-actin. Genetic manipulations that alter actin dynamics indicate that the actin-rich protrusions (termed sensory filopodia) on the class III neurons are required for behavioral sensitivity to gentle touch. Through a genome-wide RNAi screen of ion channels, we identified Ripped Pocket (rpk), No Mechanoreceptor Potential C (nompC), and NMDA Receptors 1 and 2 (Nmdars) as playing critical roles in both behavioral <b>responses</b> to <b>touch</b> and {{in the formation of the}} actin-rich sensory filopodia. Consistent with this requirement, reporters for rpk and nompC show expression in the class III neurons. A genetic null allele of rpk confirms its critical role in <b>touch</b> <b>responses.</b> ConclusionsOutput from class II and class III md neurons of the Drosophila larvae is necessary and sufficient for eliciting behavioral <b>touch</b> <b>responses.</b> These cells show physiological responses to force. Ion channels in several force-sensing gene families are required for behavioral sensitivity to touch and for the formation of the actin-rich sensory filopodia...|$|R

50|$|Roots also rely on {{touch to}} {{navigate}} {{their way through}} the soil. Generally, roots have a negative <b>touch</b> <b>response,</b> meaning when they feel an object, they would grow away from the object. This allows the roots to go through the soil with minimum resistance. Because of this behavior, roots are said to be negatively thigmotropic. Thigmotropism seems to be able to override the strong gravitropic response of even primary roots. Charles Darwin performed experiments where he found that in a vertical bean root, a contact stimulus could divert the root away from the vertical.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of spinal circuits underlying motor behaviors was examined in zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos showed three sequential, stereotyped behaviors: a transient period of spontaneous coiling contractions, followed by touch-evoked rapid coils, and swimming. Lesioning the hindbrain eliminated swimming and <b>touch</b> <b>responses,</b> {{but not the}} spontaneous contractions. The first (spontaneous) behavior was chosen for further analysis in order to characterize the underlying circuit. In vivo patch clamp recordings were obtained from identified spinal neurons. These neurons showed periodic depolarizations that triggered rhythmic bursts of action potentials with a frequency and duration that were {{consistent with those of}} the spontaneous contractions. As with the behavior, transecting the spinal cord at the hindbrain border did not affect the rhythmic activity patterns of the neurons. Surprisingly the contractions and the periodic depolarizations were insensitive to both general and specific blockade of synaptic transmission. The periodic depolarizations were suppressed by heptanol and by intracellular acidification treatments that are known to uncouple gap junctions, indicating that electrotonic synapses could underlie network synchronization during the earliest motor behavior. Paired recordings were obtained from identified spinal neurons. These showed that active ipsilateral neurons were electrically coupled in a simple network consisting initially of motoneurons and only three types of interneurons. Therefore, this early spinal circuit consists of rhythmically active and electrically coupled neurons. Furthermore, this circuit is also initially independent of the main neurotransmitter systems, sensory inputs, and descending hindbrain projections. The descending projections are required later in development for the onset of <b>touch</b> <b>responses</b> and swimming...|$|R

Extensive claims for the effect of breastfeeding were made in the 1930s by Margaret Ribble, a champion of [...] "infant rights," [...] but were challenged by others. The claimed effect is not universal, and bottle-feeding mothers are generally appropriately concerned with their babies. It is difficult {{to determine the extent of}} causality due to a number of confounding variables, such as the varied reasons families choose different feeding methods. Many believe that early bonding ideally increases response and sensitivity to the child's needs, bolstering the quality of the mother-baby relationship—however, many exceptions can be found of highly successful mother-baby bonds, even though early breastfeeding did not occur, such as with premature infants who may lack the necessary sucking strength to be successfully breastfed.|$|E

50|$|The Roland JP-8000 was {{released}} in early 1997 {{as part of the}} first wave of virtual analog modeling synthesizers (VA synths). Others from that period included the Clavia Nord Lead (1995), Korg Prophecy (1995), Access Virus (1997) and Yamaha AN1x (1997). While the functionality, sound, and architecture of the JP-8000 differs from these other synthesizers, it shared the same purpose of attempting to recreate the unique sound and functionality of classic analog synths. The JP-8000 was viewed at the time as the modern digital incarnation of the classic Roland Jupiter-8, from 1981. The programming interface, synthesis options and general tone is very similar to Roland's Jupiter-6 as well. The JP-8000 sought to digitally reproduce the warm analog tonalities and sheer power of its older, analog brothers. Although it lacked somewhat in analog warmth due to its early digital architecture, it added many new features such as motion control, and RPS (Realtime Phrase Sequencing), which allowed short sequenced phrases to be assigned to keys. It also featured the unique Supersaw oscillators and analog-style controllers such as an arpeggiator and an assignable <b>touch</b> <b>response</b> ribbon control.|$|E

Mirror touch synesthetes have a higher ability to feel empathy than non-synesthetes, and can {{therefore}} feel the same emotions that someone else may be observed to feel.

Approximately 30% of the normal population experience some form of this condition and around 16% of amputees report synesthetic pain after an amputation. This condition can either be acquired or developed. In the congenital condition, synesthetes experience pain in the same location as the observed pain; however, in the acquired condition, high intensity pain is felt at the same location as the trauma.|$|R

5000|$|A Brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) {{is a type}} of implant {{that allows}} for a direct connection between a patient's brain and some form of external hardware. Since the mid-1990s, the amount of research done on BCI's in both animal and human models has grown exponentially. Most brain-computer interfaces are used for some form of neural signal extraction, while some attempt to return sensation through an implanted signal. As an example of signal extraction, a BCI may take a signal from a paraplegic patient's brain and use it to move a robotic prosthetic. Paralyzed patients get a great amount of utility from these devices because they allow for a return of control to the patient. Current research for brain-computer interfaces is focused on determining which regions of the brain can be manipulated by an individual. A majority of research focuses on the sensorimotor region of the brain, using imagined motor actions to drive the devices, while some studies have sought to determine if the cognitive control network would be a suitable location for implantations. This region is a [...] "neuronal network that coordinates mental processes in the service of explicit intentions or tasks," [...] driving the device by intent, rather than imagined motion [...] An example of returning sensation through an implanted signal would be developing a tactile response for a prosthetic limb. Amputees have no <b>touch</b> <b>response</b> in artificial limbs, but through an implant in their somatosensory cortex could potentially give them an artificial sense of touch. A current example of a brain-computer interface would be the BrainGate, a device developed by Cyberkinetics. This BCI is currently undergoing a second round of clinical trials as of May 2009. An earlier trial featured a patient with a severe spinal cord injury, with no control over any of his limbs. He succeeded in operating a computer mouse with only thoughts. Further developments have been made that allow for more complex interfacing, such as controlling a robotic arm.|$|E

VIP 1 and its close homologs (i. e., Arabidopsis group I bZIP proteins) {{are present in}} the cytoplasm under steady conditions, but are transiently localized to the nucleus when cells are exposed to hypo-osmotic conditions, which mimic mechanical stimuli such as touch. Recently we have reported that overexpression of a repression domain-fused form of VIP 1 represses the expression of some touch-responsive genes, changes structures and/or local auxin responses of the root cap cells, and enhances the touch-induced root waving. This raises the possibility that VIP 1 suppresses touch-induced responses. VIP 1 should be useful to further characterize <b>touch</b> <b>responses</b> of plants.

40|$|SummarySensory {{information}} is actively gathered by animals, but the synaptic mechanisms driving neuronal circuit function during active sensory processing are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the synaptically driven membrane potential dynamics during active whisker sensation using whole-cell recordings from layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons {{in the primary}} somatosensory barrel cortex of behaving mice. Although whisker contact with an object evoked rapid depolarization in all neurons, these touch responses only drove action potentials in ∼ 10 % of the cells. Such sparse coding was ensured by cell-specific reversal potentials of the touch-evoked response that were hyperpolarized relative to action potential threshold for most neurons. Intercontact interval profoundly influenced touch-evoked postsynaptic potentials, interestingly without affecting the peak membrane potential of the <b>touch</b> <b>response.</b> Dual whole-cell recordings indicated highly correlated membrane potential dynamics during active touch. Sparse action potential firing within synchronized cortical layer 2 / 3 microcircuits therefore appears to robustly signal each active <b>touch</b> <b>response...</b>|$|E
40|$|Neuroligins are cell {{adhesion}} proteins that interact with neurexins at the synapse. This interaction {{may contribute to}} differentiation, plasticity and specificity of synapses. In humans, single mutations in neuroligin encoding genes lead to autism spectrum disorder and/or mental retardation. Caenorhabditis elegans mutants deficient in nlg- 1, an orthologue of human neuroligin genes, have defects in different behaviors. Here we show that the expression of human NLGN 1 or rat Nlgn 1 cDNAs in C. elegans nlg- 1 mutants rescues the fructose osmotic strength avoidance and gentle <b>touch</b> <b>response</b> phenotypes. Two specific point mutations in NLGN 3 and NLGN 4 genes, involved in autistic spectrum disorder, were further characterized in this experimental system. The R 451 C allele described in NLGN 3, was analyzed with both human NLGN 1 (R 453 C) and worm NLG- 1 (R 437 C) proteins, and both were not functional in rescuing the osmotic avoidance behavior and the gentle <b>touch</b> <b>response</b> phenotype. The D 396 X allele described in NLGN 4, which produces a truncated protein, was studied with human NLGN 1 (D 432 X) {{and they did not}} rescue any of the behavioral phenotypes analyzed. In addition, RNAi feeding experiments measuring gentle <b>touch</b> <b>response</b> in wild type strain and worms expressing SID- 1 in neurons (which increases the response to dsRNA), both fed with bacteria expressing dsRNA for nlg- 1, provided evidence for a postsynaptic in vivo function of neuroligins both in muscle cells and neurons, equivalent to that proposed in mammals. This finding was further confirmed generating transgenic nlg- 1 deficient mutants expressing NLG- 1 under pan-neuronal (nrx- 1) or panmuscular (myo- 3) specific promoters. All these results suggest that the nematode could be used as an in vivo model for studying particular synaptic mechanisms with proteins orthologues of humans involved in pervasive developmental disorders...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine {{has been}} implicated in the {{modulation}} of diverse forms of behavioral plasticity, including appetitive learning and addiction. An important challenge is to understand how dopamine’s effects at the cellular level alter the properties of neural circuits to modify behavior. In the nematode C. elegans, dopamine modulates habituation of an escape reflex triggered by body touch. In the absence of food, animals habituate more rapidly than {{in the presence of}} food; this contextual information about food availability is provided by dopaminergic mechanosensory neurons that sense the presence of bacteria. We find that dopamine alters habituation kinetics by selectively modulating the <b>touch</b> <b>responses</b> of the anterior-body mechanoreceptors; this modulation involves a D 1 like dopamine receptor, a Gq/PLC-b signaling pathway, and calcium release within the touch neurons.

This greatly reduces the shadowing of the touch locations when two or more fingers align with each other.

In addition, children with DCD exhibited greater inhibitory errors and inaccurate fixation during the Cued trials. Thus, children with DCD were reasonably proficient in executing saccades during reflexive (Non-Cued) conditions, but showed deficits in more complex control processes involving prediction and inhibition.
