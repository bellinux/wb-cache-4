5|$|During 1936, the Arab Revolt {{broke out}} in the British Mandate of Palestine. British troops were dispatched, ending {{the first phase of the}} war by the close of the year. Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With rising <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> Europe, the British began to {{withdraw}} troops from Palestine for use elsewhere. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement—on 30September 1938—calmed the rising <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume their military build-up in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|One {{month before}} the riots, Priestley {{attempted}} to found a reform society, the Warwickshire Constitutional Society, which would have supported universal suffrage and short Parliaments.

Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks, and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The National Guard was brought in to restore order.|$|E

5|$|Clarence Edward Smith {{was born}} on February22, 1928, and raised in Danville, Virginia, with his five {{brothers}} and one sister. During his childhood, Virginia was racially segregated, and he witnessed incidents of racism, including a fight between his father and a white man that was sparked by racial <b>tensions.</b> <b>In</b> 1946, he moved with his mother to New York City, where they settled in Harlem. He attended only two years of high school.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> Jordan {{between an}} {{increasingly}} autonomous PLO and King Hussein's government had been simmering; following the Dawson's Field hijackings, a military campaign was launched to rout out PLO forces.

5|$|Two years later, Tombalbaye banned {{opposition}} parties {{and established a}} one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic <b>tensions.</b> <b>In</b> 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT), began a civil war. Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by Hissène Habré took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.|$|E
5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Although disbanded in 1919 {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, it was re-raised in 1921 in the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) as a part-time infantry battalion based in Victoria. However, due to lack of funding {{following the}} Great Depression and a shortage of manpower following the suspension of the compulsory training scheme in 1929, the battalion was amalgamated with the 38th Battalion as the 7th/38th Battalion, although it was delinked again in 1936 when the Army was expanded due to rising <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> Europe.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{remained}} {{active in}} the military, continuing to serve {{as part of the}} Militia, which was reorganised in 1921 following the conclusion of the demobilisation process. From then until 1926, he served as commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade, before being appointed to command the 2nd Division. In 1930, he was promoted to the rank of major general and over the ensuing years became increasingly parochial against the small permanent Staff Corps. He was transferred to the unattached list in 1932. In 1937, amidst increasing <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> Europe, he came into conflict with the Military Board after he wrote a number of newspaper articles expressing his concerns about complacent defence policy and the efficiency of regular officers.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with the <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E
5|$|Cormoran {{was built}} by the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. Her keel was laid in 1890 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 17 May 1892. Kaiser Wilhelm II attended the launching ceremony with the senior director of the Kaiserliche Werft. Work was completed by 25 July 1893, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. Following her commissioning, she underwent two months of sea trials, which were completed on 22 September. Starting in 1894, Cormoran was assigned to overseas service in Germany's colonial possessions. She was initially ordered on 2 October to the East Asia Station to replace the gunboat , but the rising <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> South Africa led the Navy to send the new cruiser to German East Africa to secure German {{interests in the region}} instead.|$|E

5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was ordered}} under the {{provisional}} name Ersatz Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and {{built at the}} AG Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 4. Her keel was laid in October 1911 and she was launched on 5 May 1913. At her launching ceremony, Prince Oskar of Prussia christened the ship. Due to the heightening political <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> Europe in mid-1914, the final construction work was accelerated, so {{the first set of}} dockyard trials were conducted on 15 July, and fitting-out work was completed by the 30th, the day she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet. Grosser Kurfürst cost the Imperial German Government 45 million Goldmarks.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with the Church varied considerably across his lands and over time: as with other aspects of his rule, there was no attempt to form a common ecclesiastical policy. Insofar as Henry had a policy it was to generally push back on papal influence, increasing his own local authority. The 12th century saw a reforming movement within the Church, however, advocating greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy and more influence for the papacy. This trend had already caused <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> England, for example when King Stephen forced Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, into exile in 1152. There were also long-running concerns over the legal treatment {{of members of the}} clergy.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{was also}} a major {{contributor}} to the political <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> Biafra. Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French-influenced African states, Foccart sent Houphouët-Boigny and Lieutenant-Colonel Raymond Bichelot on a mission in 1963 to monitor political developments in the country. The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967, when Biafra, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, undertook to secede from Nigeria. French-aligned African countries supported the secessionists who, provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré, began a civil war. By the end of the 1960s, French-supported nations suddenly and openly distanced themselves from France and Côte d'Ivoire's position on the civil war. Isolated on the international scene, both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu, who eventually went into exile in Côte d'Ivoire.|$|E
