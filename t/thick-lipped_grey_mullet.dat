The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of environmental salinity on the mRNA expression and protein activity of the main digestive enzymes of <b>thick-lipped</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> (Chelon labrosus). Specimens of <b>thick-lipped</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> were acclimated to different environmental salinities (0, 12, 40 and 55 ppt) during 21 days. Samples of complete digestive system were obtained for mRNA expression analysis and for determining enzymatic activities. Results showed a clear effect of environmental salinity on digestive activity as well as on gene expression of these enzymes. Low salinities had a positive influence on digestive acid proteases, which showed a higher activity and expression in 12 ppt-acclimated specimens salinity, whereas higher mRNA expression levels of alkaline proteases were found in fish maintained at 40 ppt.

40|$|Allometric {{growth and}} {{ontogeny}} were studied in <b>thick-lipped</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> Chelon labrosus reared in mesocosms from 1 to 71 day post hatching (dph). Multivariate allometric analysis of morphometric growth distinguished three distinct developmental stanzas separated by two morphometric metamorphosis lengths (L-m 1 = 4. 46 +/- 0. 06 mm; L-m 2 = 28. 56 +/- 1. 04 mm). Body mass growth also showed three distinct episodes separated by two inflections, correlated with morpho-functional changes. First episode concerned pre-flexion larvae and ended around 4. 5 mm-L-T (14 -dph), coinciding with estimated L-m 1. It was distinguished by reduced growth, but intense morphogenesis and differentiation processes. Organogenesis and allometric changes indicated that development priorities concerned feeding efficiency, by improving detection ability (sensory system development), ingestion capacity (head growth) and assimilation performance (digestive system differentiation), together with respiration efficiency (gill development). Second episode concerned post-flexion larvae and, ended around 8. 6 mm-L-T (25 -dph). It was distinguished by fast growth of trunk and tail, acquisition of adult axial muscle distribution and completion of gill filament development, improving locomotion and oxygenation performances. It corresponded to transition towards metamorphosing stage {{as indicated by}} later isometric growth, musculature maturation and acquisition of juvenile phenotype. Metamorphosis seemed to end at L-m 2, suggesting to avoid zootechnic handling before this size...|$|E

40|$|Trabajo presentado en el 8 º Congreso de la Asociación Ibérica de Endocrinología Comparada (AIEC), celebrado en Madrid del 5 al 7 de septiembre de 2011. <b>Thick-lipped</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet,</b> Chelon labrosus (Risso, 1827), is {{a marine}} teleost {{from the family}} Mugilidae, very common in the {{estuaries}} and natural earthen ponds of the Bay of Cádiz, and of great importance for extensive aquaculture in this area. This euryhaline species is characterized by amphidromic life cycles, migrating to estuarine areas for feeding and other physiological processes. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) present a role in fish osmoregulation processes, being important pieces for the adaptation of specimens to changes in environmental salinity. We cloned pituitary GH and hepatic IGF-I in C. labrosus by cDNA library screening, using a species specific probe developed by PCR with degenerated primers, designed from the conserved regions of other teleost sequences from GenBank. In addition, changes in expression were measured in specimens maintained under different environmental salinities (0, 12, 40 and 55 ppt) during 21 days using real time RT-PCR. Moreover, cortisol levels were evaluated in plasma samples {{in order to assess}} the osmotic stress of specimens. Fish acclimated to lower salinities enhanced plasma cortisol levels, while specimens maintained at the highest salinity decreased this value compared to control. Previous studies have shown the existence of a positive interaction between GH and cortisol for improving osmoregulatory capacity in teleosts, but this relation is species-dependent. Pituitary GH and hepatic IGF-I expression will be presented and discussed under this hypothesis. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>thick-lipped</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> to mount both humoral and {{cellular}} immune responses to Cryptocotyle lingua {{has been demonstrated}} {{here for the first}} time. Of the 3 procedures for immunisation investigated, namely exposure to live cercariae, intraperitoneal (ip) injection of whole killed cercariae and ip injection of a cercarial sonicate, the former gave the highest primary antibody titres with a peak response at 4 weeks post infection. Peak titres occurred at 5 and 7 weeks after immunisation by ip injection of sonicated cercariae and whole killed cercariae respectively. An enhanced secondary antibody response was observed following challenge by ip injection of sonicated cercariae. Cercariacidal activity, apparently involving complement, was detected in normal serum and enhanced in immune serum. However, the mechanism for complement activation remains uncertain. Parasite antigens were identified following separation by SOS-PAGE and immunoblotting using mullet and rabbit antisera. Mullet failed to respond to certain parasite proteins recognised by rabbit antiserum and in situ immunogold-silver staining demonstrated that mullet. immunised by exposure to live cercariae, were unable to recognise the metacercarial cyst wall. Migration and polarisation of pronephric leucocytes in vitro was enhanced following immunisation but cellular adherence to encysted and unencysted parasites was not observed. In vitro studies further demonstrated a possible role for fish serum in stimulating metacercarial encystment. The intensity of melanisation of the host capsule in metacercarial infections was increased in fish held in total darkness and with increased temperature. The rate of development of the metacercarial tegument and cyst wall and the associated host response was similarly affected by temperature and initial development was inhibited by prior immunisation via ip injection of sonicated cercariae. There was however, no evidence of protection against cercarial infection following such immunisation. These results are discussed in relation to mechanisms of immunity, metacercarial survival strategies and control of metazoan infections in fish...|$|E

Therefore, the purpose of study was to investigate the effects of low water temperature on the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Mugil cephalus acclimated in freshwater. The blood samples of experimental fish (TL: 28. 2 ± 1. 1 cm, BW: 198. 6 ± 25. 9 g) were collected during winter season when the water temperature of controlled rearing system was stable at 25 °C and uncontrolled rearing system slowly dropped until 12 °C. Their stress response on both rearing systems was observed. The results showed that low temperature affected to lower the behavior activity and increase the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets.</b> The breath frequency of <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> regarding their opercular movement at 12 °C was 74 - 97 breath/min., while at 25 °C it was 95 - 114 breath/min. Hematocrit (Ht) and hemoglobin (Hb) were shown higher values of 43. 5 % and 9. 5 g/dL, respectively at 25 °C than 12 °C (28. 0 % and 7. 1 g/dL, respectively). The tendencies of cortisol and glucose level increased with the lowering temperature, showing higher value of 264. 8 ng/mL and 35. 5 mg/dL in 12 °C than 5. 5 ng/mL and 32. 7 mg/dL in 25 °C.

In four sites in Korea (Ansan, Yeosu, Tongyeong, and Busan) and two sites in Japan (Nagasaki and Fukuoka), serum VTG in immature and male <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> was detected at levels greater than 1. 0 μg/ml, which {{is considered to be}} an abnormal level.

Although individuals with testis-ova were found in Omuta, these fish expressed normal levels of serum VTG.
