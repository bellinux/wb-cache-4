5|$|Harmon <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and {{he added that the}} game was unambitious. Bertz <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E

5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that}} there was not anything special about it. They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting. Famitsu writers <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Card Summoner rules were very complex, but noted that the tutorial made it easy to learn.|$|E
5|$|Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy, {{commander}} of the proposed attack, cancelled the attack because he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} content {{featured}} in the game received mixed reviews. Miller <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the game only revolved around one idea, which led to its simplistic gameplay. Camron and Cooper <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the campaign was too short for most players. Shoemaker <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> for a full-priced game, it lacked content. Reiner furthered criticized the game's low replay value. Carter advocated that players purchase the game when its price dropped. He added that while the game features lots of ideas, most of them failed to deliver.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} received mixed reviews. Prell <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the mission-design was varied, and {{the voting}} system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, {{noting that the}} items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the action featured in this mode is satisfying, but <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode a rewarding experience. Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting {{received}} positive responses. Carter <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the verticality {{nature of}} the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, {{as well as the}} game's long draw distance. Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable. Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of Far Cry 3. Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from Game Informer praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich. Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq praised the content found within the world, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the world itself was absorbing and interesting.|$|E

5|$|The left-handed Darling was {{a strong}} driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket. His fellow players <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was {{sometimes}} unnecessarily defensive in his approach to batting {{and that he was}} at his best when driving hard. His South Australian and Australian team mate George Giffen <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Taylor and Bigelow brought the WWF {{mainstream}} press coverage. The {{reactions to the}} match were mixed; some people <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Taylor performed surprisingly well for a non-wrestler. Others <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the WWF pushing a football player to defeat a wrestler made professional wrestling look bad. Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF.|$|E
