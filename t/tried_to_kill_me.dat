2500|$|Bree, like Ashley, has {{not spoken}} to Castor since the trial. Bree said that though losing {{her mother was}} hard, [...] "I was happy that they said she was guilty, because {{we all know that}} she's guilty." [...] Ashley said, [...] "I would have done {{anything}} for her. But she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> instead." [...] Both of Castor's daughters expressed concern that their mother had not yet apologized to them. Castor maintains she is innocent of the deaths of her husbands and the attempted murder of Ashley.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2007, JR and Babe's tempestuous romance {{received}} notice by TV Guide's Daniel R. Coleridge, {{who published}} {{an exclusive interview}} with Babe's former portrayer, Alexa Havins, and queried her about the matter. Coleridge cited the marriage as dysfunctional and seemed perplexed as to why Babe would stay with a man who tried to kill her, and as he put it, [...] "verbally abuses her all the time". Havins addressed deeper issues about the coupling:I know. I asked if we could do a PSA (Public service announcement) for women in abusive relationships to get help, but that didn't happen. I was concerned about how viewers might be influenced by Babe saying, 'Oh, it's OK, JR, you only <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> because you were drinking.' What if a woman decided to ignore the warning signs of abuse and stay in a bad relationship, and then a true tragedy happened? ...|$|E

6000|$|I set {{him on a}} {{chair and}} looked at him. It is true I felt some pity for a man that looked so sick, but I was full besides of righteous anger; and I {{numbered}} over before him the points on which I wanted explanation: why he lied to me at every word; why he feared that I should leave him; why he disliked it to be hinted that he and my father were twins--"Is that because it is true?" [...] I asked; why he had given me money to which I was convinced I had no claim; and, last of all, why he had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me.</b> He heard me all through in silence; and then, in a broken voice, begged me {{to let him go}} to bed.|$|E

60|$|At last, now, I was {{thoroughly}} conscious that I desired alcohol. But what of it? I wasn't afraid of John Barleycorn. I had associated with him too long. I was wise {{in the matter}} of drink. I was discreet. Never again would I drink to excess. I knew the dangers and the pitfalls of John Barleycorn, the various ways by which he had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> in the past. But all that was past, long past. Never again would I drink myself to stupefaction. Never again would I get drunk. All I wanted, and all I would take, was just enough to glow and warm me, to kick geniality alive in me and put laughter in my throat and stir the maggots of imagination slightly in my brain. Oh, I {{was thoroughly}} master of myself, and of John Barleycorn.|$|E
60|$|Later.--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully {{waited until}} the {{attendant}} was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow. Again {{he went into the}} grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he would have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me.</b> As we were holding him a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlight sky, except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own.|$|E

50|$|Master P's No Limit Records label, based out of New Orleans, {{became quite}} {{popular in the}} late 1990s, though {{critical}} success was very scarce, with the exceptions of some later additions like Mystikal (Ghetto Fabulous, 1998).
