In this scheme, each message is transmitted periodically by using a specific <b>transmitter</b> <b>buffer,</b> and therefore, the transmitter can send at most N messages in parallel, where N {{is the number of}} <b>transmitter</b> <b>buffers.</b> A simple concept, the degree of parallelism, is defined so that a conventional go-back-N ARQ scheme and our proposed scheme are extended to a more general scheme. We analyze a simple approximate approach to this general model in which a system {{is considered to be a}} queueing system with the same number of servers as the degrees of parallelism. It is shown that our approximation is simple but accurate and that the multiple stop-and-wait ARQ scheme has high performance especially for high traffic intensity. 　　データ通信での誤り制御法である再送訂正方式のひとつとして，多重ストップアンドウェイトARQ方式を提案する。本方式はストップアンドウェイトARQ方式の待ち時間を利用しメッセージ単位の多重化送信を行うもので，高効率が期待できる。本方式と既存のgo-back-N ARQ方式とを統一的に解析するために多重度の概念を導入し，両方式を特別な場合として含むような，よりー般的な方式を考察する。メッセージの送信時間を適切に定義することによって，待ち行列モデルによる性能解析が可能となり，種々の評価量が容易に算出される...|$|R

With these techniques, it was shown {{that the rate of}} acid secretion in response to a steak meal in seven duodenal ulcer patients was twice the rate achieved in six control subjects and that the amount of acid secreted after eating exceeded the peak histamine response in the ulcer patients but not in the controls. Meal-stimulated acid secretion, expressed {{as a function of the}} peak histamine response, was roughly correlated with the serum gastrin concentration (r = 0. 45), but it was concluded that other factors must also contribute to the higher than normal secretory responses to a meal found in duodenal ulcer patients. Measurement of buffer content of the stomach revealed that the duodenal ulcer patients <b>emptied</b> the meal <b>buffer</b> at a much more rapid rate than the normal subjects.

30|$|The above results {{prove the}} fact that {{enabling}} the RTS/CTS handshake causes significant influence over the entire network performance regardless if the network is protected or not. In this case, the amount of delay that packets experience is higher than when the handshake is disabled. The reason for this increase is because the handshake process needs extra time to be accomplished. The originator node must wait until the handshake is completed before the actual data transmission takes place. This sending RTS and waiting for CTS before any data transmission is time consuming {{while at the same}} time data are waiting in the <b>transmitter</b> <b>buffer</b> to be sent. In contrast, with a disabled handshake, data are sent immediately as soon as they are ready, which in turn decreases the overall amount of delay.|$|R

A counter-intuitive result is that comparatively improved objective video quality occurs even though privileged application-layer forward error correction is not given to high priority data. Instead a flat channel coding is used across the data partitions. The scheme results in a lower number of dropped packets at the <b>transmitter</b> <b>buffer</b> and/or a reduced number of packets corrupted by channel noise compared to simple slicing or no frame slicing at all.

40|$|In cold-climate locations, where {{natural gas}} is burned during the day to enrich {{greenhouses}} with carbon dioxide, water tanks (buffers) are often used to store the surplus daytime heat for nighttime heating. A practical control strategy for filling (charging) and emptying (discharging) of the buffer, based on a virtual value (costate) of the stored heat (the state), is suggested and illustrated by simulation. Heating and ventilation decisions are obtained by maximizing, at each time step, the virtual increase in value of the greenhouse system (including stored heat). As long as the heat <b>buffer</b> is neither <b>empty</b> nor full, the virtual value (co-state) of the stored heat remains constant. When the buffer is full (towards {{the end of a}} day), this value is gradually decreased, until the buffer starts to discharge. When the <b>buffer</b> <b>empties</b> (towards the end of a night), the virtual value is gradually increased, until recharging of the buffer starts again. This heuristic strategy is meant to minimize the time that the <b>buffer</b> is <b>empty</b> or full, because in these states the buffer is inactive (ineffective). Simulations with an annual weather sequence show the following: (1) the winter-Time virtual value of stored heat is about equal to the actual cost of heat, while in summer it is close to zero; (2) the utilization of the buffer, judged by the time on the storage bounds (full or empty), is roughly uniform along the year; (3) the performance of the system improves asymptotically with an increase of the installed capacity of the buffer; (4) expensive energy (heat) results in reduced intensity of cultivation (less heat and less yield) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) is used {{to ensure}} a {{reliable}} communication between transmitter and receiver over an error-prone channel. When the transmitter sends a data packet over the channel to the receiver, a transmission error may occur depending {{on the condition of}} the channel. The receiver checks the integrity of the packet and notifies the transmitter by returning a NACK in case of erroneous transmission or an ACK otherwise. If necessary, the packet is retransmitted a number of times until it is received correctly. We present the analysis of the Stop-and-Wait ARQ protocol in case the channel produces errors in a bursty, correlated manner. Indeed, {{especially in the case of}} wireless communications with mobile transmitters and receivers, it is expected that the conditions of the wireless medium are not static but change over time.

40|$|Day-to-night {{heat storage}} in water tanks (buffers) is common {{practice}} in cold-climate greenhouses, where gas is burned during the day for carbon dioxide enrichment. In Part 1 of this study, an optimal control approach was outlined for such a system, the basic idea being that the virtual value (shadow price) of the stored heat (its 'co-state') {{could be used to}} guide the instantaneous control decisions. The results for daily-periodic weather showed: (1) The optimal co-state is constant in time. (2) The optimal solution is associated with minimum time on the storage bounds (<b>buffer</b> <b>empty</b> or full). With these conclusions as guidelines, a semi-heuristic procedure of optimisation for realistic (i. e. not strictly periodic) weather is developed. The co-state remains constant while the storage trajectory is between the heat storage bounds. It is gradually increased while the <b>buffer</b> is <b>empty,</b> and decreased when the buffer is full, attempting to push the trajectory away from the bounds, thus minimising the time that the buffer is idle. The main outcomes are: (1) No information about the future is required.

(3) The predictions of yield and heat requirement compare favourably with practice. (4) The gain in performance achievable with the suggested method is probably 75 % or more of the true optimum.
