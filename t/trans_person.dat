40|$|This paper investigates how {{employing}} neoliberal {{discourses of}} equal rights, anti-discrimination laws, and hate crime legislation limits {{the advancement of}} equality and protection for <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> under the law. The push for the legal recognition of <b>trans</b> <b>persons,</b> through the addition of 2 ̆ 2 gender identity 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 gender expression 2 ̆ 2 to anti-discrimination and hate crime laws relies on neoliberal discourses of biological determinism and medicalization. This approach ultimately pathologizes <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> and precludes their self-determination. As the trans community continues to gain rights in Canada and the United States, a backlash of anti-trans “bathroom bills” threaten to restrict <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> from sex-segregated spaces that align with their gender identity. Moreover, hate crime legislation focuses on individual perpetrators, reinforcing systemic forms of transphobia and state-sanctioned violence against <b>trans</b> <b>persons.</b> In order to guarantee that <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> have equal access to state services and are protected from discrimination and violence, systems of power must be dismantled and reimagined...|$|R
40|$|Researchers and {{scholars}} {{have been discussing}} media representations of gender {{and their impact on}} audiences over the last fifty years in the Western context. However, most studies on this subject have taken “gender” and “woman” as interchangeable terms, overlooking how various gender identities are depicted in the media. Most work on media representations of transgender is carried out by activist groups of <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> and allies, and one such group is Trans Media Watch (TMW), a charity founded in 2009 that aims to improve media coverage of trans issues in Britain. It was the awareness of the devastating effects of media representations of transgender that ridicule and dehumanize <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> that brought the group together to tackle the struggle over representations of transgender in the media. This study explores how TMW is challenging the media, discussing what the group understands as “problem coverage” and the alternatives they propose, as well as their methods and strategies to get their message across to media professionals of how they would like <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> to be represented. The study also discusses the group’s position in the British context of media and trans activism, further problematizing the notion of representation by looking at how they negotiate their position as liaisons between <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> and media professionals and institutions. This study is based on a series of nine in-depth interviews with three members of TMW’s core team. This thesis positions Trans Media Watch as an instance of a social movement – the trans movement – that emerged to tackle a gap both in theory and in practice. The struggle of <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> over representation and self-definition takes place in the realms of theory and academia as well as in political activism, connecting the symbolic and the material in the struggle for full citizenship and social acceptance...|$|R

40|$|In Canada, <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> {{seeking to}} {{transition}} face legal and medical regulation. In British Columbia and Ontario, sexual reassignment surgeries (SRS) {{are no longer}} required to legally change an individual’s gender designation. In Québec, however, trans people are still required to demonstrate proof of SRS. This thesis argues {{that there are two}} key spatial spheres that trans people must negotiate in their transition process which have received little attention in geographic work: state and medical spaces. State space will be examined by focusing on the Directeur de l’etat civil (DEC), the principle governing body of civil affairs in the province. This government agency plays a pivotal role in determining whether a person has met the legal requirements to warrant a change of gender designation. Medical space, defined as the hospitals, clinics, and psychotherapeutic offices where trans people seek guidance and support for their transition is also central to this study. This project employs a Foucauldian biopolitical framework to help structure the analysis of the embedded power relations between state and medical authorities and individuals. The population studied is trans-masculine persons living in Québec who were undergoing or who had planned to undergo transition-related medical interventions. Participants were recruited through university LGBTQ centers, as well as through trans organizations located in Montréal. The participants were interviewed following oral history interview principles. The findings of this study demonstrate that due to the restrictive regulations imposed by the Government of Québec that in legal spaces, <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> are limited in terms of their self-determination, as they must conform to established biopolitical norms. Additionally, in medical spaces, not only do medical professionals lack awareness of trans-specific needs, but trans identities are also regulated through the documentation requirements.

40|$|Background: Studies {{examining}} HIV {{prevalence and}} risk behaviors within trans subgroups have identified them as high risk. Yet {{few studies have}} addressed how discrimination impacts this prevalence. Minority stress theory {{suggests that there is}} a relationship between minority stress and HIV-related risk behaviour. We hypothesize that multiple minority statuses may result in discriminatory experiences, specifically self-reported transphobia and racism in synchrony with other attributes, that interact to alter past-year HIV-related risk behaviour. Methods: Data came from the Trans PULSE project, a mixed-methods, community-based research study that used respondent-driven sampling to access 433 trans Ontarians, between May 2009 and May 2010. RDSAT 6. 0 was used to produce descriptive statistics and SAS 9. 2 was used for regression analyses. Results: Transphobia was commonly perceived as 97. 8 % (C. I. = 97. 1 %, 100. 0 %) of trans Ontarians reported at least one experience of transphobia, while 44. 7 % (C. I. = 36. 6 %, 52. 5 %) reported at least one instance of racism. Analysis of a multivariable logistic regression model predicting past-year HIV-related sexual risk behaviour among <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> hints at an interaction between racism and sexual orientation and racism and ethnicity, as well as, transphobia and sexual orientation and transphobia and medical transition status, suggesting that transphobia and racism affects past-year HIV-related sexual risk behaviour differently across these groups. Conclusions: The relationship between self-reported racism, self-reported transphobia and past-year HIV-related sexual risk behaviour is complex and interactive but limited. Our results contextualized HIV-related sexual risk behaviour showing the potential role of discrimination in determining sexual risk for <b>trans</b> <b>persons...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Trans</b> <b>persons</b> {{identify}} as, {{or desire}} to be, {{a member of}} the opposite gender of their birth gender. In case of gender dysphoria, this incongruence causes discomfort or distress often leading to the choice for hormonal and/or surgical treatment to conform the body to the desired gender. Although this phenomenon is of all time, and is known in many cultures, it has only gained medical interest in the last decades. Due to more media attention and the widespread use of internet, gender clinics are confronted with increasing numbers of applicants. Consequently, this demands more research of treatment protocols in this underserved group. Hormonal treatment in <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> consists of sex steroid reversal. The principal endogenous sex steroid (i. e. androgen in men and estrogen in women) is suppressed and replaced by the principal sex steroid of the opposite sex. For trans women, who have a male birth sex, this means androgen suppression and estrogen replacement therapy inducing feminization. Trans men, who have a female birth sex, undergo testosterone therapy, inducing masculinization. Research in <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> may also shed light on the origin of gender differences in the body and the interplay with sex steroids. Boys, for example, develop longer and bigger bones than girls during puberty indicating a crucial role for sex steroids in this process. Body composition changes during puberty too, resulting in more muscle and less fat mass and a different body shape in men versus women by the time of adolescence. Besides both muscle and fat tissue have an influence on bone. A vast body of evidence indeed pointed out that sex steroids are vital for bone acquisition and maintenance. The differential effects of sex steroids on bone health remain however unclear. In particular, their influence on cortical (the hard outer layer of bone) and trabecular (the interior of bone, a network of rod-like and plate-like tissue) bone needs further clarification. The objectives of this thesis are therefore twofold. We aim to describe bone health in <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> using hormonal and/or surgical therapy. Secondly, cross-sex hormonal therapy (CSH) in <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> may help to illuminate differential effects of sex steroids on the skeleton and the interplay with body composition. Previous studies on bone health in <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> are scarce, often small-scaled and hampered by the use of dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The latter imaging technique shows a projection of the bone and results in the measurement of areal bone mineral density (aBMD). We have made use of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). This technique adds a third dimension to bone imaging, quantifies volumetric BMD, and allows the differentiation of cortical and trabecular bone. In chapter 1, we provide information on gender dysphoria its treatment options and give an overview of some important gender differences in bone and body composition and the relationship with sex steroids. Known literature on bone and body composition in <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> is also summarized. Further, we state our research objectives and this chapter ends with the presentation of the study groups and the materials and methods. In the addendum, we present data on the prevalence on gender incongruence in Flanders in a population-based survey. In chapter 2, we focus on bone geometry, trabecular and cortical vBMD and the relation to body composition in <b>trans</b> <b>persons.</b> We compare bone, lean and fat mass in <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> prior to any hormonal treatment and control populations (ch 2. 1) and evaluate short-term (up to 2 years follow-up) (ch 2. 2) and long-term effects (ch 2. 3) of CSH. We show that prior to treatment, trans women have a similar hormonal status, but already had a lower bone and muscle mass vs. control males and a male reference population (ch 2. 1). Osteoporosis is prevalent in 16 % of trans women vs. 4 % of controls. Peripheral QCT reveale a thinner bone cortex with a lower cortical bone area in trans women compared with control men. We hypothesize that trans women, prior to any hormonal treatment, have a different lifestyle than control men as they have a higher prevalence of 25 (OH) vitamin D deficiency (67 % vs. 35 %) and lower levels of sports activity and muscle mass vs. control men. During {{the first two years of}} antiandrogen and estrogen therapy in trans women, the aBMD increases at nearly all measured sites (whole body, lumbar spine, femoral neck, radius) and vBMD and bone geometry is unaffected (ch 2. 2. 1). Considerable loss of muscle mass and strength is also noted in trans women during CSH, whereas they gain body fat mass and subcutaneous fat mass (appendicular as well as at the hips). In a subgroup of these trans women, antiandrogens are used in monotherapy for a short term (median 25 weeks), before combination with estrogen therapy. The aBMD changes are similar in both groups. The markers of bone turnover increase during the first year, followed by a decrease in the second year in the group that had antiandrogens alone. In the group that used combination therapy from the start, bone turnover markers decline during the first and second year. We conclude that estrogen therapy is able to maintain bone health despite hypoandrogenism and substantial muscle loss. In addition, we propose that estrogen treatment in trans women induces a lower bone turnover leading to an increase in aBMD (by estrogen-mediated filling of the remodeling space). The absence of changes in volumetric bone parameters may have been due to the short follow-up, the relatively low sample size and the higher coefficient of variation of pQCT vs. DXA. In chapter 2. 2. 2, trans men prior to testosterone treatment and age-matched control women are followed prospectively and after one year. After the baseline visit, trans men received testosterone treatment (testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg, IM, 1 x/ 12 weeks), sometimes preceded by progestagens. At baseline, bone parameters are alike in both groups. After one year of testosterone therapy in trans men, considerable increases in muscle mass and strength and markers of bone turnover, and declines in fat parameters (subcutaneous as well as trunk and total body fat mass) are observed. We report a modestly increased aBMD at the total hip and trabecular vBMD in trans men, but not in control women. Other areal and volumetric bone parameters are unaffected. In chapter 2. 3. 1, we consider the long-term effects of testosterone treatment and sex reassignment surgery (including gonadectomy) on bone and body composition in 50 trans men and 50 age-matched control women in a cross-sectional study. Corresponding with the short-term effects of testosterone therapy, trans men still have higher muscle mass and strength and lower body fat mass vs. control women median 10 yr after the start of testosterone therapy. Trans men have a larger waist circumference too, indicating a more central, masculine pattern of fat distribution (apple-shape). A greater cortical bone size at the radius in trans men vs. control women is observed which was related to the higher muscle mass and strength. Trabecular vBMD is also higher than control women, similarly to the increased trabecular vBMD in our short-term study in trans men. Both findings may be suggestive for a direct or indirect (through muscle mass and strength) anabolic effect of testosterone therapy on trabecular and cortical bone. In chapter 2. 3. 2, in a subgroup of these 50 trans men on long-term testosterone treatment who underwent phalloplasty (n= 44), we assess bone health at the forearm that is used as donor-site for radial forearm phalloplasty. We observe no functional limitations on daily life activities, a painless and rather aesthetic scar and unaffected bone health. Long-term effects of CSH on bone geometry and body composition in trans women were previously described by our research group and are therefore not part of this thesis. In chapter 3, body composition is assessed in relationship to cardiovascular factors in 40 trans women and 20 trans men prior to and after one year of CSH. Trans women gain fat and loose muscle and body lean mass, while trans men undergo changes in the opposite direction during the first year of CSH. Estrogen treatment in trans women result in modestly increased insulin resistance and generally improved lipid profile (decline in triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein (Apo) A and B, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol (TC)) after one year. In contrast, trans men develop less insulin resistance but a worsening of lipid profile (increased TG, LDL and ApoB and lower HDL) in their first year using testosterone treatment. Less decline (in trans men) and a greater incline (in trans women) in fat mass are associated with a less favorable lipid profile. So, the CSH-mediated changes in body composition in <b>trans</b> <b>persons</b> have implications for their cardiovascular profile. In chapter 4, we summarize and discuss the main findings of the included studies. We then highlight the limitations of our work, suggest perspectives for further research and end with a discussion of the clinical relevance of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} the short- and long-term cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidities during cross-sex hormone therapy {{in a large}} sample of <b>trans</b> <b>persons.</b> Subjects and methods: A specialist center cross-sectional study compared 214 trans women (male-to-female transsexual <b>persons)</b> and 138 <b>trans</b> men (female-to-male <b>trans</b> <b>persons)</b> with an age- and gender-matched control population (1 - 3 matching). The participants were on cross-sex hormone therapy {{for an average of}} 7. 4 years. We assessed physical health and possible treatment-related adverse events using questionnaires. Results: Five percent of trans women experienced venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism during hormone therapy. Five of these adverse events occurred {{during the first year of}} treatment, while another three occurred during sex reassignment surgery. Trans women experienced more myocardial infarctions than the control women (P= 0. 001), but a similar proportion compared with control men. The prevalence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) was higher in trans women than in the control men (P= 0. 03). The rates of myocardial infarction and CVD in trans men were similar to the control male and female subjects. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was higher in both trans men and women than in their respective controls, whereas the rates of cancer were similar compared with the control men and women. Conclusion: Morbidity rate during cross-sex hormone therapy was relatively low, especially in trans men.
