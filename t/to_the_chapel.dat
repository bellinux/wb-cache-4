5|$|Although repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> {{were carried}} out by the last Baron Hylton and the {{successive}} owners in the 19th century, it fell into disrepair until, like the castle, it was taken over by the state in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), the 18th-century world-famous {{botanist}} {{and professor}} at Uppsala University, has a memorial designed by Tobias Sergel next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chapel</b> of Remembrance.|$|E
5|$|Smyth-Pigott died in 1927 and the sect {{gradually}} declined {{until the}} last member, Ruth, died in 1956. Her funeral in 1956 {{was the only time}} when outsiders were admitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel.</b>|$|E

50|$|Eventually <b>the</b> {{congregation}} decided <b>to</b> combine <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> {{and church}} into one large building. This began in 1924 {{with a simple}} hyphen, and culminated 15 years later with the current linkage and its accompanying changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel's</b> fenestration. <b>The</b> church and rectory have remained intact since that time.|$|R
50|$|The church {{contains}} two chapels: <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, <b>the</b> <b>Chapel</b> of Marquesa (marchioness) Vélez, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, <b>the</b> <b>Chapel</b> of San Felipe. <b>The</b> latter <b>chapel</b> contains relics {{of the saint}} brought from Sicily by Marquesa Vélez in 1648.|$|R
5|$|At 11 am a {{disturbance}} {{started in the}} chapel at Strangeways Prison when some 300 prisoners attacked staff. Those prisoners then gained access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> roof and then broke into the living accommodation in the main prison. Other prisoners, including those on remand, joined in the disturbance and staff had to be withdrawn. The perimeter is secure.|$|E
5|$|Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now {{an escaped}} {{political}} prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> hidden {{at the feet of}} the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds.|$|E
5|$|The Corn Store {{adjacent}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chapel</b> may originally {{have been}} used as accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp. Five oak-framed bins inside may have held barley for the Brew-house, which is now used as a toilet block.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2017, Italian {{specialists who}} had {{previously}} conducted restoration operations at Davidank returned to continue their cleaning and restoration of the monastery. They had already restored of <b>the</b> four <b>chapels</b> and their frescoes, and were now planning to restore inscriptions and ornaments near <b>the</b> doors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapels.</b> <b>The</b> entire restoration project is planned {{to be completed by}} 2020.|$|R
5|$|The main {{architectural}} {{focus of}} the inner bailey was the great keep, but it also contained a Norman chapel and, from at least the 14th century onwards, a complex of smaller residential and service buildings. The visible stone foundations {{on the north side}} of the keep belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> and range built for Queen Isabella around 1330. The bailey well can also still be seen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the west}} end of the Lower Ward is the Horseshoe Cloister, {{originally}} built in 1480, near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> to house its clergy. It houses the vicars-choral, or lay clerks of the chapel. This curved brick and timber building {{is said to have been}} designed to resemble the shape of a fetlock, one of the badges used by Edward IV. George Gilbert Scott heavily restored the building in 1871 and little of the original structure remains. Other ranges originally built by Edward III sit alongside the Horseshoe, featuring stone perpendicular tracery. As of 2011, they are used as offices, a library and as the houses for the Dean and Canons.|$|E
5|$|George, {{although}} increasingly {{reliant on}} Walpole, could still have replaced his ministers at will. Walpole was actually {{afraid of being}} removed from office {{towards the end of}} George I's reign, but such fears were put to an end when George died during his sixth trip to his native Hanover since his accession as king. He suffered a stroke on the road between Delden and Nordhorn on 9 June 1727, and was taken by carriage to the Prince-Bishop's palace at Osnabrück where he died {{in the early hours of}} 11 June 1727. He was buried in the chapel of Leine Castle but his remains were moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> at Herrenhausen after World War II.|$|E

50|$|Carfury Bible Christian Chapel {{was founded}} in 1821 with seating for 172. From 1907 <b>to</b> 1932, <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> was known as Carfury United Methodist Church. It closed and the {{premises}} were sold in 1971. Records and papers relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Carfury <b>Chapel</b> are held by Cornwall Record Office.|$|R
50|$|The nave is {{flanked by}} an aisle on each side. The aisles are harmoniously matched with the nave. The central nave has two large {{elliptical}} domes, matched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapels</b> of St. Gregory Barbarigo and San Lorenzo Giustiniani. A large circular dome rises over <b>the</b> crossing. <b>Chapels</b> line <b>the</b> side aisles. Under the presbytery, the crypt is <b>the</b> <b>Chapel</b> of Santa Cross.|$|R
5|$|The Unitarian Chapel retains {{much of its}} {{original}} interior, including square Corinthian columns, Oak galleries and a carved wooden pulpit. A large brass chandelier was donated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> later in the 18th century by Nathaniel Webb, one the town's members of parliament. In 1881, the building's frontage was decorated with stucco to an Italianate style. Each floor is split {{by a number of}} Corinthian pilasters, and the doorway is framed by two pairs of similar identical pilasters, and topped by a triangular pediment. On the ground floor, there are four round-headed windows, while the first floor has five round-headed window bays, though the outer pairs are blocked. It was designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the crash, Onassis's father and {{stepmother}} arrived from New York at the hospital where Onassis was being treated. The couple were accompanied by an American neurosurgeon. Onassis's mother arrived from Switzerland with her husband, Stavros Niarchos. Aristotle had also flown the English neurosurgeon Alan Richardson from London to Athens, but Richardson later told Onassis that Alexander had no chance of surviving his injuries. Aristotle Onassis considered having his son's body cryogenically frozen with the Life Extension Society, but was persuaded against it, and it was embalmed by Desmond Henley. Alexander Onassis was buried next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> on his father's private Ionian island of Skorpios.|$|E
5|$|The three-storey Block 151 of Roberts Barracks (off Martlesham Road) {{still stands}} today, {{but is now}} part of the Ministry of Defence's Changi Airbase Camp. Most of the {{buildings}} surrounding Block 151 were demolished in July 2003. Inside the Chapel, there is a photo of Stanley and some narrative about him and the murals but access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chapel</b> is restricted. However, for public interest, a replica of Stanley Warren's murals is also on display at the Changi Chapel and Museum, along with an audio-visual theatre that screens videos about POW life, display of POW belongings and collection of books about Singapore during WWII.|$|E
25|$|An icon of Red Willow Vineyard is <b>the</b> Monsignor <b>Chapel</b> {{built by}} <b>the</b> Sauer family {{on a hill}} planted mostly to Syrah in homage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> many <b>chapel</b> {{vineyards}} in France—particularly Hermitage in the northern Rhône wine region. As the hill was cleared for cultivation, the stones removed from the hillside were saved <b>to</b> construct <b>the</b> <b>chapel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also in 1970, the Houses of Canons, a {{building}} attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapels</b> facing Micalet street, were demolished <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> cathedral back its previous appearance, {{and at the}} same time elements of little or no architectural value were removed.|$|R
5000|$|Nowadays <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> is {{used for}} {{perpetual}} adoration of the blessed Sacrament. Prior <b>to</b> this <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> was used for catechism.|$|R
5|$|Above the {{entrance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a {{room on the}} first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{known as}} the Carnary chapel and college, the complex was {{originally}} formed of separate buildings which were later joined together. The entrance porch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> was added between 1446 and 1472 during the episcopate of Walter Lyhart, Bishop of Norwich. The crypt beneath the chapel {{was used as a}} charnel house administered by the sacristan of the cathedral which stored the bones of people buried in the churches of the city to await resurrection, and the ocular windows of the chapel would allow visitors to view the charnel remains. From 1421 to 1476 the crypt was also the location of the Wodehous chantry, established by Henry V at the request of John Wodehous, a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt. The college was dissolved in 1547 during the English Reformation by the Abolition of Chantries Act before being purchased by the city in 1550, and used by the school shortly after. Until the 19th century the chapel was used as the main classroom, though it was not until 1908 the chapel returned to the role of religious assembly and 1940 when it was consecrated for use as a church, due to the cost of refurbishment.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} Parish church, St Andrew (see Landmarks), {{there are}} several other {{religious}} sites. The Roman Catholic church, Saint Boniface, was built in 1929 by Manuel de las Casas who was descended from the uncle of Bartolomé de las Casas. The Methodist church in New Cut is the third chapel on the site. The first was started in 1764 and the current building was built following a fire in 1872 which did serious damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> built in 1806. The Unitarian chapel on Pound Square dates from 1913 following the collapse of the previous building in 1911. It is the oldest nonconformist congregation in Cullompton. Hebron Evangelical Church was built in 1962. The Baptist Church is the site of a meeting house erected in 1743 on High Street.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, the Royal Military College of Canada {{is celebrating}} the 50th {{anniversary of the}} two small devotional chapels in Yeo Hall, which were {{installed}} in 1963. With a view to encourage and enhance their spiritual well-being, the Protestant and Royal Catholic Chaplains, cadets and staff use <b>the</b> <b>Chapels.</b> Gifts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapels</b> {{have been made by}} successive generations of cadets and ex-cadets.|$|R
5|$|Between 1430 and 1445 Walter {{expanded}} the castle considerably. An outer court {{was built to}} {{the south side of}} the original castle, with its own towers and an additional gatehouse which formed the new entrance to the castle. These new defences were less strong than those of the original inner court, and indeed the eastern gatehouse was not crenellated at the time. A barbican was built, extending the older gatehouse to the inner court. The new court enclosed the parish church, which became the castle chapel, with a replacement church being built by Walter in the village. Walter had the chapel decorated with a number of murals, depicting scenes from the story of Saint George and the Dragon; Saint George was a favoured saint of Henry V, and associated with the prestigious Order of the Garter, of which Walter was a proud member. A house was built next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> for the use of the chantry priest. Walter also legally combined the two parishes of Farleigh in Somerset and Wittenham in Wiltshire, which formed part of his castle's park, altering the county boundaries of Somerset and Wiltshire in the process. As a village, Wittenham disappeared completely.|$|E
5|$|Doggett first {{appears in}} the fifth episode. She wishes to hang up a cross in Litchfield Penitentiary's chapel but is refused permission. She ignores this and hangs her cross up on a light fixture; this causes the entire fixture to fall down and hence damages the chapel's ceiling. She also {{displays}} transphobia; calling the transgender woman Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) an 'abomination' and 'it' and blaming her for the damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel.</b> Doggett has numerous clashes with Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon); firstly Vause threatens to rape Doggett after growing tired of her complaining about Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling); Doggett locks Vause in a dryer while she is helping Chapman to fix it and, lastly, Doggett snitches on Chapman and Vause for dancing provocatively with each other; resulting in Chapman being placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, {{there were}} eightday schools and three Sunday schools in New Sleaford and two daily schools in Old Sleaford. An infant {{school in the}} old playhouse on Westgate opened in 1855; Wesleyan schools {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chapel</b> on North Street accommodated up to 200 pupils. In addition to private girls' schools, short-lived private schools for boys were established by Mr Herring and Charles Boyer in 1851, Henry Carruthers, and Edwin Reginald Dibben in 1870 in competition with the grammar school. Charles Kirk built a school and chapel at Quarrington in 1867. It became St Botolph's Primary School and in 2002 {{moved to a new}} site. In 1879, an art school was established in Duke Street in connection with the Science and Art Department; by 1896, two Wesleyan schools and a Catholic school were also in operation.|$|E
50|$|Although not {{intended}} as such, this broad room {{is really an}} antechamber <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sistine <b>Chapel,</b> reached by <b>the</b> Scala Regia. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> left of the entrance formerly stood the papal throne, which {{is now at the}} opposite side before <b>the</b> door leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pauline <b>Chapel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The nave's west wall has a sculptural group {{depicting}} Magnificence and Religion (1650) by Alessandro Algardi.
