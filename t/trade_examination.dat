30|$|The {{research}} approach {{that has been}} followed so far, to the extent {{it was able to}} be reviewed, is the selection of a specific type of event, like an increased dividends announcement or a merger announcement. Such an approach may be suitable when the effects of insider trading are studied on an aggregate basis. In a firm-specific examination, though, such an approach would probably narrow the scope of research by limiting the examined cases and by completely disregarding unannounced events or firm-specific events. As a result, this study’s objective is to construct the proposed environment around a process that can identify informationally significant events which thereafter may be used as the focal points for insider <b>trading</b> activity <b>examination.</b> The ground for the present study is the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) while it is carried out by utilizing previous research, publicly available sources of information and information technology.|$|R
40|$|Vocational Education and Training {{systems are}} {{important}} elements of countries' economic development strategies. Improving {{the skills and knowledge}} of the workforce is crucial for achieving or maintaining economic competitiveness, especially in a context of progressing globalisation. As a consequence, governments around the world are engaging in improving their respective VET systems. The role of vocational education and training (VET) is regarded as key to economic development. In the same context, the Namibian government has initiated a comprehensive reform of its VET system. More than 10 years after passing the Vocational Training Act in 1994, the VET system still experiences many weaknesses in terms of high failure rates in <b>trade</b> <b>examinations,</b> high drop-out rates and not fully matching employers' skill needs. Many of the weaknesses have been {{known for a long time}} and various reform initiatives have been designed in the past, but the majority of them have not been implemented successfully. In the context of Namibia's Vision 2030 to become a newly industrialised economy by the year 2030, the education and training sector is again subject to comprehensive reform. The aim of reforming the VET sector is to improve its management, introduce competency based training standards to increase access, improve the responsiveness of skills supply to skills demand and increase the financial base through the introduction of a levy. The purpose of the paper is to analyse in greater detail the prospects of the current VET reform initiative and to identify factors that are likely to influence the outcome of the reform. One central question is: why, given past experiences, should the current reform initiative which is much broader and complex than in the past, be successful this time? The paper argues that the current reform looks promising in scope, but many caveats exist that might limit its successful implementation. Among the greatest dangers are a neglect of the micro-level of reform implementation due to an insufficient involvement of trainees and instructors, a low involvement of the private sector and the inappropriateness of introducing a training levy and the resulting lack of required financial resources...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an inquiry into}} the concept and phenomena of content marketing and its corresponding market in Sweden by attending to its constituent practices. By adopting a practice based approach to markets, influenced by recent developments in economic sociology, it utilizes a constructivist  view of markets as constantly forming and emerging. This allows examination of a concept that is novel, ambiguously defined yet increasingly popular by focusing on its practical enactments along with actors' conceptions and ideas in order to study what constitutes content marketing. By archival analysis of <b>trade</b> media, <b>examination</b> of industry media and in-depth interviews with content marketing practitioners the paper highlights the formatting effect of ideas on practice, the existence of multiple and conflicting definitions and enactments of content marketing and the implications thereof. It also shows how different categories of content marketing practice are connected and interlinked, before arriving at a definition drawing on practitioners descriptions, enactments and ideas central to the market. The thesis contributes with an inquiry into content marketing where academic research is scant and also provides an empirical application of theory from the growing research tradition concerned with a practice approach to markets. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We have {{discovered}} distinctive red/gray chips {{in all the}} samples we have studied of the dust produced by {{the destruction of the}} World <b>Trade</b> Center. <b>Examination</b> of four of these samples, collected from separate sites, is reported in this paper. These red/gray chips show marked similarities in all four samples. One sample was collected by a Manhattan resident about ten minutes {{after the collapse of the}} second WTC Tower, two the next day, and a fourth about a week later. The properties of these chips were analyzed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The red material contains grains approximately 100 nm across which are largely iron oxide, while aluminum is contained in tiny plate-like structures. Separation of components using methyl ethyl ketone demonstrated that elemental aluminum is present. The iron oxide and aluminum are intimately mixed in the red material. When ignited in a DSC device the chips exhibit large but narrow exotherms occurring at approximately 430 ˚C, far below the normal ignition temperature for conventional thermite. Numerous iron-rich spheres are clearly observed in the residue following the ignition of these peculiar red/gray chips. The red portion of thes...|$|R
