In order to help Doyle with this, Paolini recorded the pronunciation of every invented name and word in Brisingr from a list over nine pages long. It was tricky even for Paolini {{to do this because}} he cannot [...] "roll [...] r's" [...] properly. Doyle said he prepared for narrating Brisingr by going [...] "largely by physical description. If there are specific details about the voices, I latch onto those as best I can. But if a creature’s anatomical features are described, I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine,</b> for example, how the jaw might work...and then try and adapt that and attach it to something that sounds okay to the ear and is still slightly stranger than normal." ...|$|E
500|$|Miller is {{considered}} one of the founders of psycholinguistics, which links language and cognition in psychology, to analyze how people use and create language. His 1951 book Language and Communication {{is considered}} seminal in the field. His later book, The Science of Words (1991) also focused on language psychology. He published papers along with Noam Chomsky on the mathematics and computational aspects of language and its syntax, two new areas of study. Miller also researched how people understood words and sentences, the same problem faced by artificial speech-recognition technology. [...] The book Plans and the Structure of Behavior (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, explored how humans plan and act, trying to extrapolate this to how a robot could be programmed to plan and do things. Miller is also known for coining Miller's Law: [...] "In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume it is true and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what it could be true of".|$|E
500|$|Some writers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> Ahalya's {{life after}} the curse and redemption, a {{denouement}} which remains undisclosed in the ancient scriptures. Pudhumaipithan's Tamil story Sapavimocanam (1943, [...] "Deliverance from the Curse") and K. B. Sreedevi's Malayalam language work (1990) translated as [...] "Woman of Stone" [...] focus on Rama's [...] "double standard" [...] from a feminist perspective. They ask why Rama frees Ahalya from being cursed for adultery, but punishes his wife Sita over false accusations of adultery with her kidnapper, Ravana. In Pudhumaipithan's tale, Ahalya turns back into stone after hearing that Sita had to undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. Sreedevi portrays her turning into stone upon learning that Sita was banished from the kingdom on charges of adultery even after proving her chastity through the trial. Pudhumaipithan also narrates how, after the redemption, Ahalya suffers from [...] "post-trauma repetition syndrome", repeatedly re-experiencing Indra's seduction and Gautama's fury, as well as suffering the ire of a conservative society that rejects her. Gautama also suffers from self-recrimination at his hasty decision to curse Ahalya. In another story, Ahalya by Pudhumaipithan, Gautama forgives both Ahalya and Indra.|$|E

2500|$|As a detective, Seedman {{was known}} for his unorthodox {{approaches}} that solved otherwise perplexing cases. [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> who was in a room the second before the murder," [...] he recalled years later. In one case early in his career, a Bronx woman was found dead of a shotgun blast in the lobby of her apartment building. Seedman noticed an empty chair next to the building's stoop. Neighbors told him it was usually occupied by a man who sat there watching the traffic go by. Although he normally was out shopping at the time, Seedman insisted on entering the man's apartment through a window—where he found his body hanging from a pipe. The murder-suicide had occurred after the woman rejected him.|$|E
2500|$|I {{thought it}} was {{absolutely}} {{the worst thing that}} could possibly hit, I mean worst. It was so unlike anything that it had to be incredible. It was new, it was something that wasn't being done. ... So <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine,</b> in a small rehearsal studio, four guys are up there playing. In front of them are Bill, Neil, Joyce, and myself. They finished the first song and no applause. Gene (Simmons) walks down to Neil Bogart, grabs both of his hands, and makes him applaud ... and Neil started applauding because he was scared to death. And I said to myself at that moment, [...] "This I wanna be involved in" ... because that's the kind of balls you have to have to do anything.|$|E

The college-age daughters of {{many of my friends}} voted for Obama because they were completely turned off by Neanderthal comments like the suggestion of 'legitimate rape.'" [...] Brad Bannon of US News and World Report wrote, [...] "The [...] insults may also have an ironic backlash. Ryan, Akin, Mourdock, and Koster are poster boys for the need for more women in Congress, so Republican attacks on women may mean the election of more women." [...] The conservative blog Hot Air linked Akin's remarks to a ten percent shift in US public opinion polls toward supporting legalizing abortion in all circumstances. In a column in Salon, Joan Walsh wrote, [...] "suddenly Americans had to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> how doctors or hospital administrators or law enforcement officials would decide what was 'legitimate rape,' as opposed to something else.

5000|$|The {{process of}} writing the story is meant to {{parallel}} {{the events in the}} story itself; Borges writes in an afterword to the story that his attempt to understand Averroës was as doomed as Averroës's attempt to understand drama. [...] "I felt that the work mocked me, foiled me, thwarted me. I felt that Averroës, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what a play is without ever having suspected what a theater is, was no more absurd than I, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> Averroës yet with no more material than a few snatches from Renan, Lane, and Asín Palacios." ...|$|R

2500|$|Bohr's {{response}} was to illustrate Einstein's idea more clearly using the diagram in Figure C. (Figure C shows a fixed screen S1 that is bolted down. Then <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> one that can slide up or down along a rod instead of a fixed bolt.) Bohr observes that extremely precise knowledge of any (potential) vertical motion of the screen is an essential presupposition in Einstein's argument. In fact, if its velocity in the direction X before {{the passage of the}} particle is not known with a precision substantially greater than that induced by the recoil (that is, if it were already moving vertically with an unknown and greater velocity than that which it derives {{as a consequence of the}} contact with the particle), then the determination of its motion after the passage of the particle would not give the information we seek. However, Bohr continues, an extremely precise determination of the velocity of the screen, when one applies the principle of indeterminacy, implies an inevitable imprecision of its position in the directionX. [...] Before the process even begins, the screen would therefore occupy an indeterminate position at least to a certain extent (defined by the formalism). Now consider, for example, the point d in figure A, where the interference is destructive. It is obvious that any displacement of the first screen would make the lengths of the two paths, a–b–d and a–c–d, different from those indicated in the figure. If the difference between the two paths varies by half a wavelength, at point d there will be constructive rather than destructive interference. [...] The ideal experiment must average over all the possible positions of the screen S1, and, for every position, there corresponds, for a certain fixed point F, a different type of interference, from the perfectly destructive to the perfectly constructive. The effect of this averaging is that the pattern of interference on the screen F will be uniformly grey. Once more, our attempt to evidence the corpuscular aspects in S2 has destroyed the possibility of interference in F, which depends crucially on the wave aspects.|$|E
