500|$|The series {{introduced}} a new incarnation of the Doctor, the Eleventh, played by Matt Smith. This followed the departure of David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor, who left the role to help ease the transition from Davies to Moffat's showrunning. Smith's agent had called him and suggested that he try out for the role. Moffat was looking to cast a middle-aged actor, who was [...] "young enough to run but old enough to look wise". However, Smith, who was only 26 when cast, was the third person to audition and the production team knew [...] " [...] had their man". The producers were cautious about casting Smith because they felt that a 26-year-old actor could not play the Doctor adequately; BBC Head of Drama and executive producer Piers Wenger shared the sentiment, but noted that Smith was capable enough to play the role. Moffat also stated that Smith {{did not appear to}} be youthful at all. [...] Smith's casting in the role was revealed during an episode of Doctor Whos companion show Doctor Who Confidential, during which he described the role as [...] "a wonderful privilege and challenge <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> I will thrive on".|$|E

Also in October, Mangold {{revealed that the}} film follows the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, saying, [...] "Where this film sits in the universe of the films is after them all. Jean Grey is gone, most of the X-Men are disbanded or gone, so there’s {{a tremendous sense of}} isolation for [...]" [...] Mangold later stated that in the fight scenes, [...] "there's an urgency and a kind of intensity and hand to hand physicality <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> is a little different than everything else out there." [...] On October 25, 2012 production relocated to Sydney Olympic Park in western Sydney. The set was made into a Japanese village draped in snow with filming beginning on November 1, 2012. [...] On November 10, 2012, filming took place on a back street in Surry Hills. The set, constructed on Brisbane St., was transformed to look like a Japanese street with Japanese signage and vehicles scattered throughout. Principal photography concluded on November 21, 2012.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode an 8.9 rating out of 10 and wrote [...] "...the real reason to watch, as always, was Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin and their fantastic comedic performances." [...] Canning responded favorably to the episode {{with the exception}} of the Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth storyline, calling it [...] "silly". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote that Jack taking on the Larry Braverman persona [...] "gave Baldwin a chance to play a delightfully goofy strain of those occasional glimpses we get of a happy Jack." [...] Like Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was favorable to Jack going to the reunion, but most enjoyed the character impersonating Larry Braverman, observing it was a [...] "well-used plot device" [...] as Baldwin [...] "made it believable". TV Guides Matt Mitovich was positive about [...] "Reunion", calling it a [...] "nice" [...] episode. Jeff Labrecque for Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the episode, and said that [...] "Reunion" [...] was the first episode of the season that [...] "I think the show benefited from the refocused attention on its core characters. The reunion plot was so strong, and the Carrie finale so inspired, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> the viewership ratings reflect positively and encourage a continuance of this creative trend." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that he was [...] "much more amused" [...] by Rob Sussman's [...] "still-simmering rage" [...] against Liz, because he [...] "scored many of the show's biggest laughs." [...] He said that he found the second plot [...] "a little underwhelming though I thought there was a neat meta-textual element to it", but wrote that it [...] "scored some nice shots at the vapid narcissism of actors but it promised more than it could deliver." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it said that despite the [...] "super-capital-A-list guest stars" [...] that guest starred at the beginning of the season, [...] "Reunion" [...] got back [...] "to the show's core cast... the show gave us probably the best episode of the season." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik opined that this episode was [...] "pretty good" [...] and [...] "funny in most of the usual 30 Rock ways." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantics David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common {{complaint}} to that point, stating, [...] "After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn’t that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out." [...] He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, if they lose interest, [...] "can take as long as they want to catch up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month." [...] The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting [...] "A lot of this detail [...] good, {{but it could have been}} considerably compressed—none of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economical—and better—storytelling from its shows." [...] Sims concluded by saying, [...] "What’s most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn’t getting rid of this approach anytime soon. Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain’s motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all." [...] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider.com spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, [...] "By focusing so intently on making these series... much more grounded in a gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [...] on The CW), the problem is that they miss out on the key element: this [...] be fantastical entertainment." [...] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, [...] "The Defenders is far from perfect. But it’s an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him." ...|$|E

I would ask the rhetorical question: My fellow Australians, if a foreigner were to come to Australia and a foreign government were to start telling us how we should handle , we would react very angrily to that."

2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that the reasons for not completing the Henry IV cycle had to do with the current political events of the time. Marie de' Medici was banished from Paris in 1631 as Cardinal Richelieu gained power over Louis XIII. Consequently, the project was abandoned completely due to approval of the plans for the gallery being repeatedly delayed by the French court. Richelieu, who now had full control of the cycle, refused to speak to Rubens about completing the Henry Gallery based on the falsehood that he was tending to affairs of the state. Richelieu's true motivations were most likely political. During this time, Rubens was in Madrid preparing for a diplomatic mission to London, working towards the rapprochement of Spain and England. The commissioned artist being active in an opposing political parties was cause for Richelieu to object. He was thus actively seeking for an Italian artist to replace Rubens, which resulted in Rubens only sporadically continuing his work. After Marie's banishment in 1631, the project was to be completely abandoned, which seems a travesty seeing as Rubens was very optimistic about the project and its effects on his career; [...] "I have now begun the designs of the other gallery which, in my judgment, because of the nature of the subject will prove to be more splendid than the first so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> I shall rather gain [...] than decline." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{listeners}} associate Klemperer {{with slow}} tempos, but recorded evidence now available on compact disc {{shows that in}} earlier years his tempi could be quite a bit faster; the late recordings give a misleading impression. For example, one of Klemperer's most noted performances was of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, Eroica. Eric Grunin's Eroica Project contains tempo data on 363 recordings of the work from 1924–2007, and includes 10 by Klemperer [...] some recorded in the studio, most from broadcasts of live concerts. The earliest Klemperer performance on tape was recorded in concert in Cologne in 1954 (when he was 69 years old); the last was in London with the New Philharmonia Orchestra in 1970 (when he was 85). The passing years show a clear trend with respect to tempo: as Klemperer aged, he took slower tempi. In 1954, his first movement lasts 15:18 from beginning to end; in 1970 it lasts 18:41. In 1954 the main tempo of the first movement was about 135 beats per minute, in 1970 it had slowed to about 110 beats per minute. In 1954, the Eroica second movement, [...] "Funeral March", had a timing of 14:35; in 1970, it had slowed to 18:51. Similar slowings {{took place in the}} other movements. Around 1954, Herbert von Karajan flew especially to hear Klemperer conduct a performance of the Eroica, and later he said to him: [...] "I have come only to thank you, and say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> I shall live to conduct the Funeral March as well as you have done".|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{criticism}} of Amos Barton was mixed, with Blackwood's close friend W. G. Hamley [...] "dead against Amos" [...] and Thackeray diplomatically noncomittal. However, the complete Scenes of Clerical Life {{was met with}} 'just and discerning applause', and considerable speculation as to the identity of its author. Sales were no better than satisfactory, following a first printing of 1,500 copies, but Blackwood was none the less confident of Eliot's talent. Early reviewers deemed the writer [...] "religious, without cant or intolerance" [...] and [...] "strong in his [...] knowledge of the human heart". It was praised for its realism: one contemporary review noted approvingly that [...] "the fictitious element is securely based upon a broad groundwork of actual truth, truth as well in detail as in general". Due to its subject matter, it was widely assumed to {{be the work of}} a real-life country parson; one such even attempted to take the credit. Popular opinion in Eliot's home town attributed the work to a Mr Joseph Liggins, who attempted ineffectually to deny the rumours, and eventually accepted the undeserved celebrity. George Eliot's [...] "identity" [...] was revealed in a letter to The Times, but this claim was immediately refuted in a letter from Eliot herself. In 1858 Charles Dickens wrote to Eliot to express his approval of the book, and {{was among the first to}} suggest that Scenes of Clerical Life might have been written by a woman.I have been so strongly affected by the two first tales in the book you have had the kindness to send me, through Messrs. Blackwood, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> you will excuse my writing to you to express my admiration of their extraordinary merit. The exquisite truth and delicacy both of the humour and the pathos of these stories, I have never seen the like of; and they have impressed me in a manner that I should find it very difficult to describe to you. if I had the impertinence to try. In addressing these few words of thankfulness to the creator of the Sad Fortunes of the Rev. Amos Barton, and the sad love-story of Mr. Gilfil, I am (I presume) bound to adopt the name that it pleases that excellent writer to assume. I can suggest no better one: but I should have been strongly disposed, if I had been left to my own devices, to address the said writer as a woman. I have observed what seemed to me such womanly touches in those moving fictions, that the assurance on the title-page is insufficient to satisfy me even now. If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman since the world began.|$|E
