5|$|Just {{prior to}} the start of the show, a clock counts down from 1 minute to the kick-off. Music, similar to that in the show, is piped in. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> covered in fog. An {{announcement}} is followed by dancers moving to On the Floor by Jennifer Lopez.|$|E
5|$|The show is {{free with}} {{admission}} to the park. During the day, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> used for the Peanuts' Celebration at the Point show. It is also used during HalloWeekends for a show called Skeleton Crew.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Luminosity {{performers}} do flash mobs, giving {{visitors a}} glimpse of the show. The stage for Luminosity is also used for a Peanuts show called Peanuts' Celebration at the Point. Carly Rae Jepsen held a concert on the Luminosity stage on July 7, 2012. It was free with admission and was the first concert on the stage. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> also used during HalloWeekends for a show called Skeleton Crew.|$|E
30|$|The {{review of}} policy {{changes can be}} divided into {{different}} periods. <b>The</b> first <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> from 1930 s to 1970 s. <b>The</b> second <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> about <b>the</b> 1980 s. <b>The</b> third <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> about 1990 s and <b>the</b> final <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> from 2000 s to the present.|$|R
50|$|Plans for the {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>were</b> first announced in April 2004. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> opened on 18 May 2005, by Gordon Brown, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Brown opened <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> by pressing a button that dropped a car into the water tank.|$|R

5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> assessed {{to determine}} whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a new Kraków Arena began in May 2011; for concerts, indoor athletics, hockey, basketball, futsal, etc. The Arena will be ready in 2013; the total cost is estimated to be 363 million Polish złoty. It will accommodate up to 15 thousand viewers. In the case of a concert, when <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> set on the lower arena, the facility will be able to seat up to 18 thousand people.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{acoustic}} {{system is a}} distributed sound reinforcement system, which allows musicians on stage to hear each other clearly {{in a way that}} facilitates ensemble play. In addition, direct natural sound from <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems. The forward-facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels. Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers, which would disturb neighboring residences and business.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> marred when <b>the</b> riders {{were forced}} to cease racing and ride behind a safety car after organisers failed to close the roads to traffic. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> neutralised for 20 miles after a dispute between the organisers and North Yorkshire Police.|$|R
5000|$|West End Stage [...] - A stage {{used for}} events every night. The roof of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> torn down in 2009 {{and most of}} <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> taken to <b>the</b> Disney Boneyard with small parts intact. It was {{replaced}} by Celebration Plaza in 2009.|$|R

5|$|Malmö Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 are standing spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> on either long {{side of the}} stadium, or up to 40,000 when it is {{placed in front of}} either short side. It comprises two main stands on each of the long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the stand until the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor terracing sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malmö FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand terracing was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans.|$|E
5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> set for mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
5|$|The Front of <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>is</b> open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, {{with the}} Harpsicals and Theorbo's which {{accompany}} the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd {{to the great}} Pylasters, {{on each side of}} the Stage... Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.|$|E

25|$|The Love theater, which {{replaced}} the Siegfried & Roy theater at The Mirage, {{is said to}} have cost more than $100 million. The theater is set up as a circular theatre in the round, with seats 360 degrees around the stage. There are four balconies in the theater, and the furthest seat from the absolute center of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> only 98 feet. The closest seat to the absolute center of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> 23 feet and 4 inches, which is only 2 feet and 9 inches {{from the edge of the}} stage.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} {{removal of the}} cancer with surgery and review by the pathologist, the letter p (for pathologic) or yp (pathologic after neoadjuvant therapy) may appear before the T and N letters. If <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> based on {{clinical}} assessment using physical exam and imaging, the letter c (for clinical) may appear. The TNM information is then combined to give the cancer an overall stage. Stages are expressed in Roman numerals from stage I (the least advanced stage) to stage IV (the most advanced stage). Non-invasive cancer (carcinoma in situ) is listed as stage 0.|$|E
25|$|The stage, and tiring-house, were thrust {{forward into}} the middle of the square. The tiring-house had glazed windows; the manner of its {{attachment}} to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> unknown but presumably similar to that of the Swan. The stage was forty-three feet across; it was covered with tile.|$|E

25|$|Beaumont Pavilion - An outdoor {{stage that}} {{sits in front}} of Cupples I. It was built in 1965 and was named after Louis D. Beaumont. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> used for annual {{commencement}} ceremonies, the semesterly W.I.L.D. concert, as well as other outdoor theater productions and concerts.|$|E
25|$|With 70 {{performances}} {{from late}} June through early August, Children's Theatre-in-the-Woods presents family-friendly shows at 10:30a.m. on Tuesdays through Saturdays. Amidst 117 rolling wooded acres and {{nestled in a}} shady grove, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> set for lively adventures in music, dance, storytelling, puppetry, and theater. All performances are recommended for children between Kindergarten and 6th grade.|$|E
25|$|The {{stage of}} the breast cancer is the most {{important}} component of traditional classification methods of breast cancer, because it has a greater effect on the prognosis than the other considerations. Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10-year disease free survival of about 98%.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> {{cancelled}} altogether due {{to strong}} winds.|$|R
50|$|On 27 June, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> {{breakdown}} <b>was</b> announced. On 30 June, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> times <b>were</b> announced.|$|R

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> {{once again}} visible, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern {{lie in the}} same {{position}} as had the actors portraying their deaths. The partners are upset that they have become the pawns of the royal couple. Claudius enters again and tells them to find where Hamlet has hidden Polonius' corpse. After many false starts they eventually find Hamlet, who leaves with the King.|$|E
25|$|Alongside <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> an {{interesting}} building, the former Bath House built in 1902 and designed by Max Paul Bertschy. At {{the beginning of}} the 19th century Liepāja was a renowned health resort and the Russian tsar and his family had been visiting Liepāja. This all encouraged other aristocrats from Russia and Europe to spend their summers in Liepāja as well.|$|E
25|$|Silver Star Carousel Stage – Located {{between the}} {{entrance}} and exit stairways to the Silver Star Carousel attraction, this multi-leveled stage showcases a variety of performances throughout the regular park operating season and during private park events as well. Although <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> relatively small in size, performances include dance spectacles during both Fright Fest and Holiday in the Park, school and private band recitals, and the daily Looney Tunes Party Rockin' Dance Party (March–September).|$|E
