25|$|Several {{different}} {{families of}} liquid crystals {{are used in}} liquid crystals. The molecules used have to be anisotropic, and to exhibit mutual attraction. Polarizable rod-shaped molecules (biphenyls, terphenyls, etc.) are common. A common form {{is a pair of}} aromatic benzene rings, with a nonpolar moiety (pentyl, heptyl, octyl, or alkyl oxy group) on one end and polar (nitrile, halogen) on the other. Sometimes the benzene rings are separated with an acetylene group, ethylene, CH=N, CH=NO, N=N, N=NO, or ester group. In practice, eutectic mixtures of several chemicals are used, to achieve wider <b>temperature</b> <b>operating</b> range (-10..+60°C for low-end and -20..+100°C for high-performance displays). For example, the E7 mixture is composed of three biphenyls and one terphenyl: 39 wt.% of 4'-pentyl-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 24..35°C), 36 wt.% of 4'-heptyl-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 30..43°C), 16 wt.% of 4'-octoxy-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 54..80°C), and 9 wt.% of 4-pentyl-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 131..240°C).|$|E

50|$|An <b>operating</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> is {{the temperature}} at which an electrical or mechanical device operates. The device will operate effectively within a specified temperature range which varies {{based on the}} device function and application context, and ranges from the minimum <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> to the maximum <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> (or peak <b>operating</b> <b>temperature).</b> Outside this range of safe <b>operating</b> <b>temperatures</b> the device may fail. Aerospace and military-grade devices generally operate over a broader temperature range than industrial devices; commercial-grade devices generally have the narrowest <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> range.|$|R

40|$|Loop {{heat pipes}} (LHPs) are {{versatile}} two-phase heat transfer devices that have gained increasing acceptance for space and terrestrial applications. The <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> of an LHP {{is a function}} of its operating conditions. The LHP usually reaches a steady <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> for a given heat load and sink <b>temperature.</b> The <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> will change when the heat load and/or the sink temperature changes, but eventually reaches another steady state in most cases.

5000|$|Temperature traps. They have a valve that {{is driven}} on / off the seat by either {{expansion}} / contraction caused by temperature differ from mechanical traps in that their design {{requires them to}} hold back some condensate {{waiting for it to}} cool sufficiently to allow the valve to open. In some exceptional circumstances this is not desirable if condensate needs to be removed as soon as it is formed. According to best practices to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions, in most of applications (like tracing lines) it is universally accepted that condensate must be removed 40 °C (104 °F) below saturation temperature. This best practice is only possible by using <b>temperature</b> <b>operated</b> traps. Thermostatic traps, Bi-Thermostatic traps and bimetallic traps are examples of <b>temperature</b> <b>operated</b> traps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{figure on}} the right shows the {{performance}} characteristics of narrow ridge-waveguide interband cascade lasers at room <b>temperature</b> <b>operating</b> in cw mode. [...] Specifically, the figure shows plots {{of the amount of}} power emitted by lasers with different ridge widths for a given injection current. Each of these lasers had five cascade stages and cavity lengths of 4 mm. These lasers were mounted so that the top of the epitaxial structure (rather than the substrate) was in contact with the copper heat sink (typically referred to as an epitaxial side down configuration) in order to achieve optimal heat dissipation. In addition, they were fabricated with corrugated sidewalls. The sidewall corrugation lowers optical losses by ensuring fewer photons are generated in the higher-order optical modes that are more susceptible to optical scattering losses.|$|E
50|$|Utility-scale {{wind turbine}} {{generators}} have minimum <b>temperature</b> <b>operating</b> limits which apply in areas that experience temperatures below -20 C. Wind turbines must be protected from ice accumulation. It can make anemometer readings inaccurate and which, in certain turbine control designs, can cause high structure loads and damage. Some turbine manufacturers offer low-temperature packages at a few percent extra cost, which include internal heaters, different lubricants, and different alloys for structural elements. If the low-temperature interval is combined with a low-wind condition, the wind turbine will require an external supply of power, equivalent to a few percent of its rated power, for internal heating. For example, the St. Leon Wind Farm in Manitoba, Canada, has a total rating of 99 MW and is estimated to need up to 3 MW (around 3% of capacity) of station service power a few days a year for temperatures down to -30 C. This factor affects the economics of wind turbine operation in cold climates.|$|E
