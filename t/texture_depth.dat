Enhancements of the environments and vistas were achieved using a procedure called [...] "Paint-over", with a larger amount of onscreen objects and effects being integrated into them. Raven also wanted to give the environments a sense of place and history to avoid feeling generic. The vast majority of objects were remodeled, with the game using improved <b>texture</b> <b>depth,</b> physically-based rendering, and light-reflection; and additional features such as realistic physics and joints employed for movable objects like character models. Raven paid close attention to improving all guns in the game because, as a developer explained, [...] "We needed to take the weapons up to the same level of personality as the characters"; each received better dynamics, alterations made to their firing mechanisms, and a new feature in the series that allowed each type to eject shell casings unique to that weapon. However, issues arose during the remastering of the game's graphics as the remaster used a heavily upgraded version of the series' engine. As a result, this meant that several of the original's visual assets were not compatible with the new technology, so the developers were necessitated to remake them. Most of the existing motion capture animation was redone for the same reason, as well as to provide further story exposition. The campaign saw a number of new first-person animations added for further immersion and emotional responses from players, and to improve how the camera made use of the player character's body, enhancing the [...] "body sense". Pellas said, [...] "I think that for [...] campaign, we were definitely more liberal with our animations and additions, as long as they enhanced the true intent of the moment." [...] The artificial intelligence of non-player characters was also improved to respond more realistically with the environment, and vice versa, such as long grass reacting to the player character's presence.|$|E

Road Administrations face the problems of dealing with data acquired by different methods and, in addition to that, the repeatability and reproducibility of the results. This paper presents an analysis of test methods used for <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> evaluation in Portugal: the volumetric patch method and two methods based on surface profiles. Hence, three roads with low (dense asphalt), medium (“open texture asphalt”) and high (porous asphalt) texture depths were selected, where five profilometers made five runs. Two subsections of 150 m length were also selected to carry out the volumetric patch test. The texture indicators analysed were: the mean <b>texture</b> <b>depth,</b> the mean profile depth and the sensor measured <b>texture</b> <b>depth.</b> The average and the standard deviation were the statistical parameters used for the analysis.

In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation among <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of multiview images. More specifically, suppose we are given a coding tool to encode <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps at the encoder and a view-synthesis tool to construct intermediate views at the decoder using neighboring encoded <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps. Our goal is to determine how to best select captured views for encoding and distribute available bits among <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of se-lected coded views, such that the visual distortion of desired con-structed views is minimized. First, in order to obtain at the encoder a low complexity estimate of the visual quality {{of a large number of}} desired synthesized views, we derive a cubic distortion model based on basic DIBR properties, whose parameters are obtained using only a small number of viewpoint samples. Then, we demon-strate that the optimal selection of coded views and quantization levels for corresponding <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps is equivalent to the shortest path in a specially constructed 3 -D trellis. Finally, we show that, using the assumptions of monotonicity in the predictor’s quantization level and distance, suboptimal solutions can be ef-ficiently pruned from the feasible space during solution search. Experiments show that our proposed efficient selection of coded views and quantization levels for corresponding <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps outperforms an alternative scheme using constant quanti-zation levels for all maps (commonly used in video standard im-plementations) by up to 1. 5 dB.

40|$|<b>Texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of two {{neighboring}} camera viewpoints {{are typically}} required for synthesis of an intermediate virtual view via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). However, the bitrate over-head required for reconstruction of multiple <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps at decoder can be large. The performance of multiview video en-coders such as MVC {{is limited by}} the simple fact that the chosen representation is inherently redundant: a <b>texture</b> or <b>depth</b> pixel visible from both camera viewpoints is represented twice. In this paper, we propose an alternative 3 D scene representation without such redundancy, yet at decoder, one can still reconstruct <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> maps of two camera viewpoints for DIBR-based synthe-sis of intermediate views. In particular, we propose to first encode <b>texture</b> and <b>depth</b> videos of a single viewpoint, which are used to synthesize the uncoded viewpoint via DIBR at decoder. Then, we encode additional rate-distortion (RD) optimal auxiliary infor-mation (AI) to guide an inpainting-based hole-filling algorithm at decoder and complete the missing information due to disocclu-sion. For a missing pixel patch in the synthesized view, the AI can: i) be skipped and then let the decoder by itself retrieve the missing information, ii) identify a suitable spatial region in the reconstructed view for patch-matching, or iii) explicitly encode missing pixel patch if no satisfactory patch {{can be found in the}} reconstructed view.

40|$|Chipseal is {{the most}} common road surface in New Zealand due to its low cost and high {{performance}} monitoring. One of the parameters surveyed is the road <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> which is currently measured by a volumetric technique known as the circular sand patch method, a method that is slow to perform, requires traffic control and depends on operator skill. The objective of our research is to design and build a portable device able to estimate the <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> and evaluate its performance by correlating the results with the depths obtained with the sand patch method. The method chosen falls under the circular texture meters (CTM) category where a surface profile is acquired using a laser displacement sensor mounted on an arm that is rotated around an axis. The mechanical design follows the specifications from current practice established by a number of standards in Australia, USA and Europe. Profile processing is realized on board by a purpose built embedded system the results are available to the operator on an LCD display. Parameters used in estimation of <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> are the standardized mean profile depth (MPD) and three parameters borrowed from surface metrology: average roughness (Ra), average square roughness (Rq) and average maximum height (Rz) which was redefined to allow for shorter CTM profiles. Algorithms were first developed into a Matlab toolbox then ported to the embedded system. The efficiency of the parameters was determined by the extent of how parameters correlate with <b>texture</b> <b>depth</b> obtained with the sand patch method characterised by the slope α and the intercept β of the linear relation that result in the best r-square for the parameter. The intercept was derived from mean of the parameters measured over a flat surface. The slope was estimated firstly from a test area of one square meter where sand patch texture depths were obtained and a number of profiles were recorded. Secondly, the slope was estimated from tracks acquired from a variety of sites using the correlation method with the intercept being constrained to the value found from the flat surface measurements. The results show that all parameters have an improved r-square when a second order fit is applied to the profile segments. The slopes estimated with the correlation method are in average 67 % percent smaller than the slopes projected with the square meter test. Considering both the coefficient of determination of the correlations and the slope, the circular texture meter returns best estimates from the average maximum height when a second order fit is applied to the profile segments...|$|E

This result will help in understanding the tribological behaviour of grease on a textured surface and in predicting the lubrication conditions of sliding bearings for better operation in any machinery...|$|E
