500|$|During their {{marriage}} the Roseberys travelled extensively, usually without their children. In September 1883 the couple left {{their children in}} the care of the nannies and nursery maids, supervised by Rosebery's sister Lady Leconfield, for a long tour of America and Australia. Lady Rosebery owned large investments in North America, including ranches in Texas and mines in Montana. Their arrival in New York was widely reported, and a full and flattering description of Lady Rosebery was reported in The Herald. The newspaper went on to describe Rosebery as looking like a prosperous farmer. Lady Rosebery was very taken with California, from where she wrote: [...] "The inhabitants are very entertaining... the women are very handsome, <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> dresses costing £80, [...] "fix up" [...] their faces very frequently and are generally divorced." [...] Having toured and been fêted in America, the party moved on to Australia via Honolulu. In Australia, Rosebery chose to indulge his habit of solitude, installing his wife in a hotel in Sydney, while he went off alone to tour the outback.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Green had {{her film}} debut, when {{director}} Bernardo Bertolucci cast {{her for the}} role of Isabelle in The Dreamers (2003), which involved her in extensive full frontal nude scenes and graphic sex scenes. [...] Green told The Guardian that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role, concerned that the film would cause her career to [...] "have the same destiny as Maria Schneider", because of Schneider's traumatic experience during the filming of Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris. Green said that with Bertolucci's guidance she felt comfortable during the filming of the nude and sex scenes but was embarrassed when her family saw the film. Her performance was well-received, and some compared her to Liv Tyler. Green expressed surprise when a minute was cut from the film for the American market, stating, [...] "here is so much violence, both on the streets and on the screen. They <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> it. Yet I think they are frightened by sex." [...] Her next film was Arsène Lupin (2004), in which she portrayed Lupin's love interest. She enjoyed the light-hearted role, although she has stated that she generally prefers more complex characters.|$|E

2500|$|After the fair, Pawnee Bill’s Wild West Show {{brokered}} {{an agreement}} with the government to have Geronimo join the show, again under Army guard. The Indians in Pawnee Bill’s show were depicted as “lying, thieving, treacherous, murderous” monsters who had killed hundreds of men, women and children and would <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> taking a scalp from any member of the audience, given the chance. [...] Visitors came to see how the “savage” had been “tamed,” and they paid Geronimo to take a button from the coat of the vicious Apache “chief.” (Geronimo was not a chief.) The shows put a good deal of money in his pockets and allowed him to travel, though never without government guards.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he visited}} London {{a few years}} later and was {{received}} with general welcome in the literary world, he was very surprised. [...] "In my own village," [...] he told James Smith, [...] "they <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> me." [...] The three years following the publication of The Borough were especially lonely for him. He did have his two sons, George and John, with him; they had both passed through Cambridge, one at Trinity and the other at Caius, and were now clergymen themselves, each holding a curacy in the neighbourhood, enabling them to live under the parental roof, but Mrs. Crabbe's health was now very poor, and Crabbe had no daughter or female relative at home to help him with her care.|$|E
2500|$|In Pakistan, an {{editorial}} in Dawn, the country's oldest English-language newspaper, {{said that there was}} no doubt that the Facebook initiative [...] "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation," [...] adding that it was [...] "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." [...] However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a [...] "knee-jerk reaction," [...] saying that, [...] "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," [...] and that the block might [...] "have played right into the hands of those who <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tommy Dorsey's first {{band was}} formed {{out of the}} remains of the Joe Haymes band, and so began Dorsey's long-running {{practice}} of raiding other bands for talent. If he admired a vocalist, musician or arranger, he would <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> taking over their contracts and careers. [...] Dorsey had a reputation for being a perfectionist. He was volatile and also known to hire and fire (and sometimes rehire) musicians based on his mood. [...] The new band was popular from almost the moment it signed with RCA Victor with [...] "On Treasure Island," [...] the first of four hits for the new band in 1935. After his 1935 recording, however, Dorsey's manager cut the [...] "hot jazz" [...] that Dorsey had mixed with his own lyrical style and instead had Dorsey play pop and vocal tunes. Dorsey would keep his Clambake Seven as a Dixieland group that played during performances, too. The Dorsey band had a national radio presence in 1936, first from Dallas and then from Los Angeles. Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra took over comedian Jack Pearl's radio show in 1937.|$|E
2500|$|Later, in {{the week}} of episodes from 27 to 31 August, a fight breaks out {{involving}} the remaining suspects. Kat is seen tending to her lover's injuries, but viewers only saw his arm. Inisde Soap said the arm could eliminate at least one suspect, as it shows some skin and a dark top. They compared it to what the suspects were wearing earlier in the episode and said it could belong to Michael or Derek, but [...] "EastEnders might have a few tricks up their sleeves {{in order to put}} Jack and Max back in the mix." [...] When Kat receives flowers from her lover, Inside Soap opined that Derek would be [...] "the sort of bullish man [...] <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> sending flowers to , unconcerned that it might expose the affair." [...] After Kat confesses to Alfie, she concentrates on her marriage, but Inside Soap noted that over a period of weeks, she had been seen [...] "drunkenly flirting with Max, [...] making small talk with Jack [...] and giving Derek some very guilty looks", though it was still not clear who was her lover. They said that Jack had become devoted to Sharon in that time and is bothered by the bond Sharon has with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), but the bold gestures made towards Kat, such has her lover buying back the ring she pawned, are Derek's style, and [...] "he's made no secret {{of the fact that he}} fancies Kat rotten!" [...] When Kat receives a candle with a note saying [...] "Light it. Put it in the window. I'll come knocking", Soaplife thought this was [...] "creepy" [...] and seemed to be something Derek would do.|$|E
2500|$|Mick was {{described}} by the BBC as a patriotic family man, who is a [...] "big softie" [...] after spending {{most of his life}} around women. He was called a [...] "bloke's bloke" [...] and [...] "kind hearted", and it was said he would [...] "apparently <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> throwing on Linda's pink dressing gown and cooking breakfast for the family before getting the beer barrels ready downstairs." [...] Dyer said that Mick is in touch with his feminine side, and is [...] "the alpha male of the show without being a bully", and said it was [...] "not in an obvious way". He felt it was important that Mick was a family man, and called him a [...] "grafter". He called him a [...] "normal guy" [...] who is protective of his family. When he appeared on ITV panel show Celebrity Juice, he described Mick as [...] "a lovely fella" [...] who is [...] "not a villain." [...] He said that Mick would be a [...] "completely different landlord" [...] to Alfie, and said the character has [...] "a bit of [...] Butcher about [...] ". The Daily Mail called him [...] "big hearted", and All About Soap stated that he was [...] "no bad boy". Shane Richie said that Mick is [...] "not the hardman, but {{there is an element of}} that just underneath". Inside Soap said that Mick's battles are only verbal. They reported that Mick is enthusiastic about running his pub and has a [...] "proper, old-school cockney attitude". Dyer said that he wanted viewers to be confused by Mick's use of cockney rhyming slang and wanted to get as much [...] "cockney-ness" [...] into the role as he could. He said that his own use of slang was sometimes [...] "too out there" [...] for the show but he had tried to stop it being taken out.|$|E
