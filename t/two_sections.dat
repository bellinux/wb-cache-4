As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his <b>two</b> <b>sections,</b> was hand-picked by his company commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Rane, along with his <b>two</b> <b>sections,</b> expertly evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E

2500|$|The SAT {{has four}} sections: Reading, Writing and Language, Math (no calculator), and Math (calculator allowed). The test taker may {{optionally}} {{write an essay}} which, in that case, is the fifth test section. The total time for the scored portion of the SAT is three hours (or three hours and fifty minutes if the optional essay section is taken). Some test takers who are not taking the essay may also have a fifth section which is used, at least in part, for the pretesting of questions that may appear on future administrations of the SAT. (These questions {{are not included in}} the computation of the SAT score.) <b>Two</b> <b>section</b> scores result from taking the SAT: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing, and Math. Section scores are reported on a scale of 200 to 800, and each section score is a multiple of ten. A total score for the SAT is calculated by adding the <b>two</b> <b>section</b> scores, resulting in total scores that range from 400 to 1600. There is no penalty for guessing on the SAT: scores are {{based on the number of}} questions answered correctly. In addition to the <b>two</b> <b>section</b> scores, three [...] "test" [...] scores on a scale of 10 to 40 are reported, one for each of Reading, Writing and Language, and Math.
