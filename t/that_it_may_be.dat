5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology. Lindow further states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.|$|E

5|$|The {{low mass}} of the planet has led to {{suggestions}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a terrestrial planet. This type of massive terrestrial planet could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the inward migration of the gas giants.|$|E
5|$|The meteoritic {{hypothesis}} is now viewed by geologists as doubtful. The British Natural History Museum suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a pseudometeorite, {{in other words}} a terrestrial rock mistakenly attributed to a meteoritic origin.|$|E

50|$|The Temple <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> {{built in}} the 2nd century BCE under the Greeks in India (Indo-Greeks). The exact {{alignment}} of the Temple with Sirkap leads some authors to think <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> built during the main occupation period of the Greek city, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> {{the work of an}} architect from Asia Minor, or from Greece or an architect trained in Greek techniques.|$|R

5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> useful in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Built in the {{vicinity}} of an older church, the Church of St Demetrius is a crossed-dome stone building. According to several legends, the church was dug into the ground as the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> protected from desecration. It was only unearthed {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when it was dedicated to Saint Demetrius. It was proclaimed a monument of culture of national importance in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy {{efficiency}} and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the AB Doradus moving group, less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a spectral class T brown dwarf, Delorme speculates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a planet.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, this {{experiment}} was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption property was confirmed {{and indicated that}} copernicium has adsorption properties completely in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84Â°C, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a gas at standard conditions.|$|E

5|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} patch of grass, the right-hand figure's toothed mouth is stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester has suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> yawning. Its mouth {{is open to}} a degree impossible for a human skull. The orange background of this panel is brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames, and the figure's neck opens up into a row of teeth, while a protruding ear juts out from behind its lower jaw. This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon, Untitled, c. 1943, which was thought destroyed until it re-emerged in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, {{designed to make}} it easier for the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> interested in expropriating at some point in the future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{impossible to}} ever identify {{the number of}} deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E
