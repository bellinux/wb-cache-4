According to kabbalic ideas, Man was created {{and put into}} This World in order to acquire the life he had received as a gift from his Creator, achieving this by treating others with the moral dignity and ethical respect that such gift demanded. As Rav Ashkenazi applied a metahistorical and ethical terminology to Kabbalic principles, he managed all the while to connect the abstract framework of Kabbalah to the moral mundane activities of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> believer. <b>Monotheism</b> becomes <b>the</b> basis for morals, and morals are a crucial element of monotheism.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Hadrian {{intended}} to assimilate <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Temple into <b>the</b> civic-religious basis of support to his reign, {{as he had done}} with Greek and other traditional places of worship. It has also been ventured that Hadrian attempted to unify all belief systems in his empire as a coherent whole that would serve as a basis of support for his autocratic legitimacy - a project that had already been devised earlier by Hellenized Jewish intellectuals such as Philo. The neighbouring Samaritans had already undergone such a process of Hellenisation and religious syncretism, integrating their religious rites with Hellenistic ones. Hadrian probably sanctioned this Hellenised Samaritan worship when, after the suppression of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> revolt, he built a temple to the Hellenistic (and probably syncretic) god Zeus Hypsistos ("Highest") on Mount Gerizim.

In his most recent publications, he has also urged greater awareness of the historical value of earliest Christian manuscripts as key physical artifacts of early Christianity, drawing attention to such phenomena as the nomina sacra (distinctive abbreviated forms of certain Greek words, e.g., Theos, Iesous, Kyrios, Christos), the Christian preference for the codex bookform, {{and a number of}} other features.|$|R

50|$|Judaism has two {{conflicting}} {{attitudes toward}} the existence of evil. In one interpretation, evil is not real, it is per se not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions.

50|$|Strictly speaking, Jewish {{engagement}} with atheism (i.e. disbelief in God’s existence) can scarcely be found before the modern period, unless one expands the definition to include biblical condemnations of practical atheism (i.e. non-observance), and Jewish attraction to ancient world beliefs {{that might be}} said to have challenged <b>the</b> idea of <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism.</b> Of course, there were also debates about the existence of others’ gods (e.g. disbelief in the official gods of the Classical world, or disbelief in the triune God of Christianity), which generated condemnations of Jewish atheism. Likewise, serious <b>Jewish</b> encounters with <b>the</b> Greek sources of philosophical scepticism (i.e. disbelief that a true knowledge of things is attainable by humans) are rare until thinkers like Simone Luzzatto in the early-modern period, although a weaker definition of scepticism (i.e. doubts about authority and suspension of judgment in approaching sources of knowledge, whether secular or sacred) might {{be said to have}} a <b>Jewish</b> legacy from <b>the</b> time of the first-century philosopher Philo onwards, including tantalizing figures such as Elisha Ben Abuyah in the Talmud, and especially in the form of medieval fideism (i.e. the idea that faith is independent of reason). These shallow intellectual eddies of pre-modern doubt about God’s existence and nature, and about the veracity of human knowledge derived through tradition, became stronger currents with the seventeenth-century philosopher Spinoza, who was regarded by many as atheistic, and with <b>the</b> eighteenth-century <b>Jewish</b> Enlightenment or Haskalah. From that time suspicion of revealed religion began its ascendency and the ties of religion loosened so that less ambiguously sceptical expressions within Jewry began to be heard. However it was the nineteenth-century culture of scientific progress, and the attendant popular interest in ostensibly naturalistic and materialistic writings in the 1870s (especially those of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud in Germany; Spencer, Huxley, and Russell in England; and Ingersoll in the US), that provoked a sea change in popular <b>Jewish</b> thought. Increasingly, <b>the</b> God of revelational religion simply appeared too naïve to countenance. It was from that time that a good number of Jewish thinkers felt obliged to establish oppositional, alternative, synthetic, or complementary models explicitly relating Judaism to the challenges of such atheistic and materialistic philosophies.Significant scholarship on the subject exists - such as the studies of Giuseppe Veltri and David Ruderman in the early-modern period 1 - but that scholarship tends to be localized and fragmented in nature and we still await a general survey of these related topic.2----1 Among Ruderman’s most important contributions is David Ruderman, Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery in Early Modern Europe (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1995). Veltri currently directs a research programme on <b>Jewish</b> Scepticism at <b>the</b> University of Hamburg and among his most relevant publications is Giuseppe Veltri, “Principles of <b>Jewish</b> Skeptical Thought. <b>The</b> Case of Judah Moscato and Simone Luzzatto,” in Rabbi Judah Moscato and <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Intellectual World of Mantua in 16th-17th Centuries, ed. Giuseppe Veltri and Gianfranco Miletto (Boston: Brill, 2012). Together they co-edited David Ruderman and Giuseppe Veltri, eds., Cultural Intermediaries: Jewish Intellectuals in Early Modern Italy (Philadelphia University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004).|$|R
2500|$|In {{its early}} 12th-century dissemination, Kabbalah {{received}} criticism from some rabbis, who adhered to chakirah, for its alleged introduction of multiplicity into <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism.</b> <b>The</b> seeming plurality of the One God {{is a result}} of the spiritual evolution of God's light, which introduced a multiplicity of emanations from the one infinite Divine essence. This was necessary due to the inability of mankind to exist in God's infinite presence. [...] God does not change; rather, it is our ability to perceive His emanations that is modified. This is stressed in Kabbalah in order to avoid heretical notions of any plurality in the Godhead. One parable to explain this is the difference between the [...] "Ma'Ohr" [...] ("Luminary"-Divine essence) and the [...] "Ohr" [...] ("Light") He emanates, like the difference between the single body of the sun and the multiple rays of sunlight that illuminate a room.|$|R

The governor of Roman Syria, Publius Petronius, fearing civil war if the order were carried out, delayed implementing it for nearly a year. Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order. However, only Caligula's death at the hands of Roman conspirators in 41 CE prevented a full-scale war in Judaea, that might have well spread to the entire Eastern Roman Empire.|$|R
