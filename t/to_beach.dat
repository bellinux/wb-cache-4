5|$|NYC Ferry {{operates}} three {{shuttle bus}} routes. One is a preexisting NY Waterway {{service to the}} East 34th Street landing. The other two are brand-new services to the Rockaway landing, which is at Beach 108th Street. One route goes west to Jacob Riis Park, while the other was originally planned for operation between the ferry landing and Beach 67th Street, but was ultimately extended eastward. The Environmental Impact Statement provided for {{an extension of the}} Beach 67th Street bus <b>to</b> <b>Beach</b> 31st Street via Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach Channel Drive, but de Blasio's office said that extending the bus further would cause a bus fleet shortage, resulting in passengers missing their boats. As of June 2017, the East Shuttle bus only runs <b>to</b> <b>Beach</b> 35th Street.|$|E

5|$|A second branch, the Q21B, {{ran from}} New Lots Avenue {{non-stop}} <b>to</b> <b>Beach</b> 98th Street at the Rockaways' Playland amusement park. It then made stops in Rockaway Park and Neponsit before terminating at {{the beaches of}} Jacob Riis Park on the western portion of the peninsula. This route only operated {{during the summer months}} of 1936.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of , the Japanese fleet began to fire on the Chaoyong. Within a few minutes, fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong attempted to make way to a nearby island <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Both Bayern and Baden were interned in Scapa Flow {{following}} the Armistice in November 1918. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, {{the commander of}} the interned German fleet, ordered his ships be sunk on 21 June 1919; Bayern was successfully scuttled, though British guards managed <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> Baden to prevent her from sinking. The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. Sachsen and Württemberg, both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal. Bayern was raised in 1934 and broken up the following year.|$|E

In the firefight that followed, one of the craft– Elevala– was forced <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> and its occupants forced to return {{to take to the}} jungle on foot, eventually reaching Gili Gili some time later; the other, Bronzewing, was holed and of its passengers, 11 were killed either in the engagement or by the Japanese following their capture.|$|E
5|$|The French {{destroyer}} Chacal was {{the name}} ship of her class of destroyers (contre-torpilleur) built for the French Navy during the 1920s. Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron, she {{spent most of the}} following decade as a training ship. The ship was assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic after the start of World War II in September 1939 until she was committed to the English Channel after the Battle of France began in May 1940. Chacal was crippled by German bombers and artillery on 23/24 May and had <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> herself near Boulogne-sur-Mer.|$|E
5|$|The scuttling {{was carried}} out on 21 June 1919. Intervening British guard ships were able <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> {{a number of the}} ships, but 52 of the 74 interned vessels sank. Many of the wrecks were {{salvaged}} {{over the next two decades}} and were towed away for scrapping. Those that remain are popular diving sites.|$|E

5|$|Asama {{continued}} to make training cruises until she ran aground again in 1935, after which she became a stationary training ship {{for the rest of}} her career. Tokiwa was converted into a minelayer in 1922–24. She was placed in reserve in 1927 after she was damaged by an accidental explosion of several mines. The ship became a training minelayer in 1940. During the Pacific War, Tokiwa participated in the occupation of the Gilbert Islands and Rabaul and Kavieng in New Guinea. Damaged by American aircraft shortly afterwards, the ship was forced to return to Japan for repairs. Tokiwa laid minefields during 1944–45 until she was twice damaged by mines in 1945. Shortly before the end of the war, the ship was badly damaged by American aircraft and her crew was forced <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> her. Tokiwa was salvaged in 1947 and subsequently broken up for scrap. Asama survived the war intact and was scrapped in 1946–47.|$|E
5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{commissioned}} into the fleet in July 1916 and March 1917, respectively. This {{was too late}} for either ship {{to take part in the}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. Bayern was assigned to the naval force that drove the Imperial Russian Navy from the Gulf of Riga during Operation Albion in October 1917, though the ship was severely damaged from a mine and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs. Baden replaced Friedrich der Grosse as the flagship of the High Seas Fleet, but saw no combat. Both vessels were interned in Scapa Flow following the Armistice in November 1918. Bayern was successfully scuttled on 21 July 1919, but British guards managed <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> Baden to prevent her from sinking. The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. Sachsen and Württemberg, both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal in the early 1920s.|$|E

5|$|By late December 1946, {{the ship}} was in very bad condition; on 21 December, she began to list severely. A salvage team could not be brought to Kwajalein in time, so the US Navy {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> the ship to prevent her from sinking, but on 22 December, Prinz Eugen capsized and sank. Her main battery gun turrets fell out of their barbettes when the ship rolled over. The ship's stern, including her propeller assemblies, remains visible above {{the surface of the}} water. The US government denied salvage rights {{on the grounds that it}} did not want the irradiated steel entering the market. In August 1979, one of the ship's screw propellers was retrieved and placed in the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany. The ship's bell is currently held at the National Museum of the United States Navy, while the bell from Tegetthoff is held in Graz, Austria.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Petropavlovsk was still incomplete. She was {{nevertheless}} {{used as a}} floating battery {{in the defense of}} Leningrad in August of that year. Several other ships, including the cruiser , joined Petropavlovsk in shelling the advancing Germans. On 7 September, the ship fired on German forces encircling the city; she fired forty salvos from her forward main battery turrets—the only two operational—expending some 700 rounds of ammunition during the attack. On 17 September 1941, the ship was disabled by German heavy artillery; after being hit 53 times, the ship was forced <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> herself to avoid sinking.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, {{the balance}} of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much {{depleted}} and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In {{a desperate attempt to}} slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, with orders <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.|$|E

5|$|Financed, {{trained and}} {{equipped}} by the Germans, the saboteurs sank the armed trawler , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper , {{which resulted in}} the deaths of six British seamen on 18 January 1942. Plazas was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of Puente Mayorga, Manuel Romero Hume, who allowed him <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> a rowboat there. The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations. In March 1942, a Gibraltarian, José Key, {{one of the most prominent}} agents working for the Germans, responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the Abwehr was arrested and executed in Wandsworth Prison in late 1942. By September 1942, Plazas, whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time, resigned and left Carlos Calvo, his second in command, in charge of the operations. In late 1942, the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded. In early 1943, the arrival of an experienced head of Abwehr operations in Spain improved the outreach of the operations.|$|E
5|$|In 1935–1937, {{the ship}} was {{converted}} to radio-control which allowed her to be maneuvered by operators aboard another ship and additional armor was added. At {{the beginning of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, she transported a battalion of naval troops to the Shanghai area. Settsu simulated the radio traffic of eight aircraft carriers {{at the beginning of the}} Pacific War in an effort to deceive Allied intelligence as to the locations and activities of the Japanese carriers. For the rest of the war she served as a target for carrier pilots. Settsu was badly damaged when Allied carrier aircraft attacked the IJN base at Kure in July 1945 and was forced <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> herself lest she sink. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 20 November and her hulk was raised and broken up in 1946–1947.|$|E
5|$|Nürnberg saw {{relatively}} {{limited service}} during the war, {{due to her}} commissioning late in the conflict. She participated in Operation Albion in October 1917 against the Russian Navy in the Baltic. The following month, she was engaged in the Second Battle of Helgoland Bight, but was not significantly damaged during the engagement. She {{was assigned to the}} final, planned operation of the High Seas Fleet that was to have taken place in the closing days of the war, though a major mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. After the end of the war, the ship was interned in Scapa Flow. In the scuttling of the German fleet in June 1919, British ships managed <b>to</b> <b>beach</b> Nürnberg and she was later refloated and sunk as a gunnery target in 1922.|$|E
