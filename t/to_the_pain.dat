5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> (Waddell's signs).|$|E
5|$|The {{motivations for}} self-harm vary, {{as it may}} be used to fulfill a number of {{different}} functions. These functions include self-harm being used as a coping mechanism which provides temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness and a sense of failure or self-loathing. There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and emotional abuse. Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> experienced earlier in the person's life of which they had no control over (e.g., through abuse).|$|E

25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the {{decision-making}} power in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially those who can afford to go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|E

25|$|Leaders of both fraternities {{made great}} {{attempts}} {{to be sensitive}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of change and emotions of loss that any such merger would naturally entail. There were pockets of dissent, and not all chapters nor all alumni of Phi Sigma Epsilon participated. Soon after the merger, {{unable or unwilling to}} commit to another national, the former PSE chapter at Cornell was released, and its building was sold to Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Other PSE chapters were found to be non-viable or had simply vanished in the time since a PSE officer had last visited or corresponded, and these were formally closed. Eventually, following several disaffected alumni leaders of Phi Sigma Epsilon, seven PSE groups would go on to form Phi Sigma Phi in 1988.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} match {{of the night}} the regular team of Los Villanos went {{head to head with}} the {{makeshift}} team of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther and Black Warrior who all represented Mexico's La Lagunero (the Lagoon) area, but were not considered a regular team as such. In the first fall Villano IV pinned El Galeno del Mal ("the bad Doctor"; Dr. Wagner Jr.) and then team captain Villano III pinned Blue Panther to claim the first fall for their team. In the second fall Dr. Wagner Jr. won the fall for his team by defeating team captain Villano III by pinfall. The third fall of the match, which was also the longest of the three falls by far, saw Villano IV force team captain Dr. Wagner Jr. to give in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of a submission hold. In the fourth match of the night Los Guapos ("The Hansome Ones"), the team of Shocker and Emilio Charles Jr. teaming up with Tarzan Boy from Los Guerreros del Infierno.

In the first fall Tarzan Boy pinned his rival Satánico while Shocker pinned Atlantis to gain the first fall. In the second fall Satánico reversed his fortune when he pinned Tarzan Boy moments after Atlantis had pinned Shocker, tying the match at one fall apiece. In the third fall Tarzan Boy caused his team the match when he was disqualified for excessive violence against Satánico, ignoring the referee's instructions to stop on more than one occasion. With the disqualification Satánico, Atlantis and Mr. Niebla won the fall and the match.|$|E
