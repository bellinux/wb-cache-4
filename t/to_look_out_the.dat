25|$|Imagine {{for example}} using a {{stopwatch}} to mark-off tiny increments {{of time as}} a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car. To understand {{the power of this}} theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.|$|E
25|$|The prince {{next came}} across a railway {{switchman}} who told him how passengers constantly rushed {{from one place to}} another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> windows. A merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E
500|$|The {{office and}} {{warehouse}} of the Scranton branch office were sets {{on the production}} company's office in Van Nuys, California, although a real office {{was used in the}} show's first season. For episodes in season two and beyond, scenes set in the parking lot made use of the exterior of the production company's office building. Since the stage set had no windows, writer Jennifer Celotta's office was dressed to look like Michael Scott's when the script called for him or someone else <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window into the parking lot. [...] In the second and subsequent seasons, the office interiors and exteriors are at a different location in Van Nuys.|$|E

500|$|Helen Baxendale {{was nearing}} the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and {{exterior}} scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. The Loaf bar at Deansgate Locks provided a filming location for some scenes. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, [...] "We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together. The bits were flapping all over the place whenever anyone moved. I had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> porthole and have a weep. As I was doing that, I looked out and there through the window, standing where the wing should be, was the show's carpenter trying to hold the set together." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "After I'd {{smoked a}} few, {{and listened to}} the sartorial {{breathing}} of H. O., I happened <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window toward the shearing-pens, where {{there was a kind of}} a road coming up from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away.|$|E

60|$|The day came. I had not slept {{during the}} night that preceded it; so I rose early <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on <b>the</b> morning.|$|R
60|$|Blanche {{left the}} sofa, and, {{going to the}} window, opened <b>the</b> {{shutters}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> night. She suddenly came back to Anne.|$|R

[...] "I cannot {{go until}} the afternoon," [...] he added after a {{momentary}} pause. [...] "I have an engagement for luncheon. Perhaps, {{if you are}} not too busy, you will see that Morrison packs some things for me." ...|$|E
60|$|After obtaining all the {{information}} he could from this man and from the other passengers, the captain steamed out to sea in a westerly direction, keeping {{a man at the}} mast-head <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> captives were in the meanwhile made as comfortable as circumstances would admit of, and the ten pirates were put in irons in the hold.|$|E
60|$|After {{pitching}} the hay down {{a little}} while, Rollo descended, {{though it was not}} necessary for Jonas to help him, for he jumped down upon the heap of hay which he had made. They then went together, attending to Jonas's work about the barn, while Rollo stopped occasionally <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> open door or window, where the sun was shining in very pleasantly. Rollo began to think it was a warm, pleasant morning.|$|E

60|$|Fifty yards farther on, a stout, red-faced, elderly gentleman was {{observed}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> street door and frown at things in general.|$|R
6000|$|Almost it hurt her, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> {{window and}} see the lilacs towering in the vivid sunshine. Or was this the jewelled glass? ...|$|R
60|$|This was not long, however; Marco soon {{grew tired}} of it, and then began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. There was a little staple in the window sill, placed there {{as a means of}} {{fastening}} the blind. Marco pushed the point of his pencil into this staple, in order to see if it would go through. It did go through in an instant, and slipping through his fingers, it fell out of the window.|$|E
6000|$|The {{woman was}} gone, {{but in a}} few moments she reappeared armed with a glass. This action filled me with amazement. Could it be {{possible}} that the woman was alone on the steamer, {{and that there was no}} one else to signal and <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out?</b> <b>The</b> thing was incredible, and yet, if there were men on board, why did they not show themselves? And why did not one of them wave the signal and use the glass? ...|$|E
60|$|As he dashed {{the cold}} water {{over his head and}} face, he felt {{completely}} himself again, and with his black eyes as keen as ever and his thick black hair all glistening with the fresh moisture, he went into the workshop <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> wood for his father's coffin, intending that he and Seth should carry it with them to Jonathan Burge's and have the coffin made by one of the workmen there, so that his mother might not see and hear the sad task going forward at home.|$|E

60|$|When {{we tried}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> spot for our house, {{we had to}} get a {{surveyor}} to go before us and cut a path through the dense underbrush that was laced together in a general network of boughs and leaves, and grew so high as to overtop our heads. Where the house stands, four or five great old oaks and chestnuts had to be cut away to let it in; and now it stands {{on the bank of the}} river, the edges of which are still overhung with old forest-trees, chestnuts and oaks, which look at themselves in the glassy stream.|$|E
60|$|He {{occupied}} one window, and I the other; and I {{saw that}} if one stayed there long, his principal business would be <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. I had soon read all the tracts that were left there, and examined where former prisoners had broken out, and where a grate had been sawed off, and heard {{the history of the}} various occupants of that room; for I found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail. Probably this is the only house in the town where verses are composed, which are afterward printed in a circular form, but not published. I was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape, who avenged themselves by singing them.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good God!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Dodd, [...] "he's {{the most}} notorious, depraved {{man in the}} state. Hain't we got <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for <b>the</b> fair name of Brampton?" ...|$|R

60|$|Marco was {{but little}} {{accustomed}} to solitary study, and, after performing {{one of the}} examples which Forester had given him, {{he thought he was}} tired, and he began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and to play with his pencil. He would lay his pencil upon the upper side of his slate, and let it roll down. As the pencil was not round, but polygonal in its form, it made a curious clicking sound in rolling down, which amused Marco, though it disturbed and troubled Forester. Whatever may have been the nice peculiarities in the delicate mechanism of Forester's ear, and of the nerves connected with it, compared with that of Marco's, by which the same sound produced a sensation of pleasure in one ear, while it gave only pain in the other, it would require a very profound philosopher to explain. But the effect was certain. Forester, however, did not speak, but let Marco roll his pencil down the slate as long as he pleased.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. George {{got into}} the coach, and Rollo {{followed}} him. As they drove along the streets, Rollo tried <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and see; but the window was so small, and the streets were so narrow, and the coachman, moreover, drove so fast, that he had very little opportunity to make observations. At length he caught a momentary glimpse of a monstrous column {{standing in the middle}} of an open square; and immediately afterward the carriage drove in under an archway, and came to a stand, in a small, open court, surrounded with lofty buildings. This was the hotel. There was a small room, which served as a porter's lodge, in this court, near where the coach stopped. A girl came to the door of this lodge to receive the guests. She bowed to Mr. George and Rollo with great politeness, and seemed glad to see them. Mr. George spoke to her in French, to say what rooms he wished to engage. What he said, literally translated, was this:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but if {{they don't}} manage right with them! I'll tell you, Flora, I got into a fit of wishing the other day; it does seem such a grievous pity to see those {{children}} running to waste for want of daily teaching, and Jenny Hall had forgotten everything. I was vexed, {{and thought it was}} all no use while we could not do more; but just then I began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> texts Ritchie had marked for me to print for them to learn, and the first was, 'Be thou faithful over a few things, and I will make thee ruler over many things,' and then I thought perhaps we were learning to be faithful with a few things. I am sure what they said to-night showed it was lucky we have not more in our hands. I should do wrong for ever with the little we have {{if it were not for}} Ritchie and Margaret. By the time we have really got the money together for the school, perhaps I shall have more sense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know well}} enough what I meant," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Vervain. [...] "And now, {{we want you}} to get us a window <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on <b>the</b> procession." ...|$|R
