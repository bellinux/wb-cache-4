5|$|The {{likewise}} {{very common}} Lactarius deliciosus {{is similar in}} appearance. Lactarius deterrimus differs basically from the first because its flesh becomes reddish within 10minutes and in about 30minutes dark maroon, caused by the discolouration of <b>the</b> <b>milk.</b> <b>The</b> <b>milk</b> of L.deterrimus stays orange or becomes reddish within 30minutes. Also, <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> of the latter tastes mild, while <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> of the first distinctly bitter.
