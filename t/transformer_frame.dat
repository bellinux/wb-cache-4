That {{site was}} subject to a late 1979 fire when a Harris MW-5 transmitter melted down. The MW-5 used a step up transformer to raise the three phase input power (at 240 volts) to 17,000 volts. The primary wiring had been bundled closely to the secondary wiring and tightly lashed together. When an insulation breakdown allowed the input wiring to arc, the high temperatures allowed the secondary wires to short to the inputs.

40|$|The weakest {{precondition}} semantics of recursive procedures {{with local}} variables are developed for an imperative language with demonic and angelic operators for unbounded nondeterminate choice. This {{does not require}} stacking of local variables. The formalism serves {{as a foundation for}} a proof rule for total correctness of (mutually) recursive procedures with local variables. This rule is illustrated by a simple example. Its soundness is proved for arbitrary well-founded variant functions. Keywords: predicate <b>transformers,</b> <b>frames,</b> recursive procedures, proof rule 1 Introduction Formalisms for weakest preconditions for imperative programs usually treat predicates as boolean functions on a single state space, cf. [BvW 90, DiS 90, Hes 92, Nel 89]. It follows that procedures cannot have local variables. For nonrecursive procedures, local variables can be made global by careful renaming. Actually, this is also possible for recursive procedures by means of methods analogous to those developed be [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{asymmetry}} phenomenon {{observed during}} the load-loss test of three-phase transformers is rigorously analyzed. The transformer is {{represented as a}} three-port impedance network despite its six-port network nature, making any formal study more tractable. The analytical restrictions required for such a representation are derived. As a result, {{it is possible to}} mathematically prove (and understand) the asymmetrical behavior of a three-phase transformer subjected to the load-loss test. Only two circuit-field simulations or tests (single-phase load-loss tests) are required to obtain the impedance system of the six-winding transformer. A 3 -D finite-element (FE) model of a transformer is used here to obtain its short-circuit impedances, exemplifying the use and extent of the analytical results. The eddy currents generated at the <b>transformer</b> tank and <b>frame</b> are properly taken into consideration. The short-circuit impedance model is validated with the 3 -D FE model and with a six-port network approach that has been previously verified...|$|R
40|$|A six-port {{impedance}} {{network for}} a three-phase transformer is {{obtained from a}} 3 D time-harmonic finite-element (FE) model. The network model properly captures the eddy current effects of the <b>transformer</b> tank and <b>frame.</b> Ail theorems and tools of passive linear networks {{can be used with}} the multi-port model to simulate several important operating conditions without resorting anymore to computationally expensive 3 D FE simulations. The results of the network model are of the same quality as those produced by the FE program. Although the passive network may seem limited by the assumption of linearity, many important transformer operating conditions imply unsaturated states. Single-phase load-loss measurements are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the network model and to understand phenomena that could not be explained with conventional equivalent circuits, In addition, formal deduction of novel closed-form formulae is presented for the Calculation of the leakage impedance measured at the high and low voltage sides of the transformer.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{aspects of}} the approximation theory application on the certain subsets of the measured samples of the transformer excitation current and the sinusoidal magnetic flux. The presented analysis is performed for single-phase <b>transformer</b> case, Epstein <b>frame</b> case and toroidal core case. In the paper the theorem of direct mapping the transformer excitation current in the stationary regime is proposed. The excitation current is mapped to the dynamic hysteresis loop branch (in further text DHLB) by an appropriate cosine transformation. This theorem provides the necessary and satisfactory conditions for above described mapping. The theorem highlights that the transformer excitation current under the sinusoidal magnetic flux has qualitatively equivalent information about magnetic core properties as the DHLB. Furthermore, the theorem establishes direct relationship {{between the number of}} the transformer excitation current harmonics and their coefficients with the degree of the DHLB interpolation polynomial and its coefficients. The DHLB interpolation polynomial is calculated over the measured subsets of samples representing Chebyshev nodes of the first and the second kind. These nonequidistant Chebyshev nodes provides uniform convergence of the interpolation polynomial to the experimentally obtained DHLB with an excellent approximation accuracy and are applicable on the approximation of the static hysteresis loops and the DC magnetization curves as well...|$|R
