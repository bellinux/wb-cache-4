5|$|The four {{throwing}} events generally all {{begin on}} one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the straights of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the Pitch (sports field) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel diagonally across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a <b>toe</b> <b>board</b> at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area {{on one side}} of the field specifically for steeplechase races.|$|E
2500|$|The air-cooling exhibit {{planned for}} the show [...] "will {{be one of the}} most novel ever {{attempted}} by the Franklin at an automobile show." [...] It consisted of a six-cylinder motor mounted on a chassis, and the motor was seen running, getting its power from the motor generator of the Entz electric starter system, which was regular equipment on Franklin models. The sloping hood of the cooling chassis had glass sides and a glass top. Additionally, the dash and <b>toe</b> <b>board</b> of the chassis also were made out of glass. This permitted the spectators to obtain a full view of the engine as it was run under the power of the electric starter.|$|E

50|$|Jerry goes to Pendant Publishing and heckles Toby. Upset, {{she runs}} out of the {{building}} where her foot is run over by a street sweeper, severing her pinky toe. Later, Kramer retells the story of how he found the <b>toe,</b> <b>boarded</b> a bus, and fought a gunman to get to hospital, where her toe was successfully reattached.|$|R
25|$|Across {{both types}} of skiing, LW9 {{competitors}} use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able-bodied. If they are using outriggers, these are fitted to the skier based {{the height of the}} skier's hip joint when the skier is standing. While learning to ski, skiers in this class with cerebral palsy may use ski-bras, bungi cords, outriggers, slant <b>boards</b> or <b>toe</b> <b>boards.</b> In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|R
5000|$|The athlete may {{touch the}} inside {{surface of the}} circle or <b>toe</b> <b>board,</b> but must not touch the top or outside of the circle or <b>toe</b> <b>board,</b> or the ground beyond the circle. Limbs may however extend over {{the lines of the}} circle in the air.|$|E

50|$|The {{steering}} box of Aurea are virtually {{identical to the}} FIAT 501 model but do not contain the characteristic FIAT throttle arrangement. Aurea vehicles have a throttle knob located longitudinally parallel to the steering column rod and protrude through <b>toe</b> <b>board</b> plate.|$|E
50|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. One method of learning to ski for competitors with cerebral palsy in this classification is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns. While learning to ski, skiers in this class with cerebral palsy may use ski-bras, bungi cords, outriggers, slant <b>boards</b> or <b>toe</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|These feet can {{be secured}} {{to the bottom}} of the cabinet by having the leg base screwed onto the cabinet bottom. They can also be {{attached}} by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, hollow machine screw. The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The <b>toe</b> kick <b>board</b> is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the kick board, or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a saw kerf, also made on the back side of the kick <b>board.</b> This <b>toe</b> kick <b>board</b> can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To provide {{guidance}} in minimizing employee exposure to fall hazards {{in the work}} place by the proper selection and use of fall protection systems. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has many controls and work procedures, including administrative and engineering controls in place which reduce employee exposure to fall hazards. These may include the use of guardrails, <b>toe</b> <b>boards,</b> warning lines, covers, and various travel restriction systems such as barriers and fences. However, when these types of controls are neither feasible nor practical to fully protect employees during work efforts involving minor construction and maintenance projects, a personal fall protection systems must be employed to prevent employee injuries from falls. Policy/Action: In order to provide for proper employee fall protection on the job, the following initiatives will be implemented. (Reference the attached policy for specific requirements.) 1. Supervisors are responsible to ensure that all employees are protected from fall hazards during the work day. All work sites must be evaluated to determine existing fall hazards and the means to eliminate these hazards identified. A Risk Assessment (RA) or a Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) must be completed for each work assignment, listing the nature and severity of the fall hazards to which an employee is exposed and specifying the type of fall protection systems required to abate or minimize these hazards. Supervisors will provide appropriate training for each employee who is exposed to fall hazards or who is required to wear personal fal...|$|R
50|$|The {{weight is}} thrown one-handed from a {{rectangular}} (4.5 feet by 9 feet) area behind a <b>toe</b> <b>board</b> or trig. The athlete must stay behind the trig {{at all times}} during the throw. The techniques vary, but usually involve a turning or spinning motion to increase momentum before the release. Each athlete gets three attempts, with places determined by the best throw.|$|E
50|$|Most roofers work in {{a variety}} of weather conditions, {{sometimes}} severe heat, and resist wearing an apparatus such as a safety harness. As a result of needing both an uncumbered work environment and the need to stay as cool as possible, roofers prefer the <b>toe</b> <b>board</b> due to its freeness of movement. If an accident happens and a roofer loses his/her footing, the 2x4 would stop the roofer from sliding down and/or off the roof.|$|E

While the [...] "spin" [...] is considered a more powerful style (because of its speed), competitors have a greater tendency to foul {{compared to those who}} use the more traditional [...] "glide" [...] technique. Although their throws usually remain within the legal sector, spinners are more prone to lose their balance control and to step on the front <b>toe</b> <b>board</b> (or, to have a foot come down to the side, on/over the ring's 7-foot circle line.) ...|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s {{freestyle}} skateboarders {{learned to}} flip the board over beneath them by lifting {{an edge of}} the board with the top of one <b>toe.</b> While the <b>board</b> flipped completely over, It did not gain much clearance from the ground, and the setup required the rider to stand more parallel to the direction of motion, with both feet facing the nose. Very well known and commonly performed today, the kickflip is a basic skateboarding trick. Once they have mastered the trick on flat ground, many skateboarders like to up the stakes and start taking this recently learned maneuver down obstacles. They also start combining it with other tricks such as kickflip to frontside boardslide.|$|R

50|$|People in {{this class}} use a {{prosthetic}} limb when competing in athletics. It has four parts: a socket, a knee, a shank and a foot. Above the knee amputees have difficulty using standard able-bodied sprint actions because {{of the differences in}} their functional muscle mass. As a result, they often use a specialized sprinting technique called “Leg-Over-Leg”. This technique involves using hip extensions to avoid deceleration caused by the prosthetic leg hitting the ground. Use of a specially made carbon fibre running prosthetic leg assists runners {{in this class}} in lowering their heart rate compared to using a prosthetic not designed for running. Runners in this class can have lower metabolic costs compared to elite runners over middle and long distances. In shot put, people in this class often plant their left leg against the <b>toe</b> <b>board</b> when they begin the glide stage of their throw. Double amputees have difficulty using a starting block in track events because they cannot align their legs with the block in the standard way. They often use different starting positions as a result.|$|E
50|$|Medieval {{boots were}} built {{according}} to {{a wide array of}} architectures. One commonly encountered boot consisted fundamentally of a pair of upright parallel boards that splinted the toes. Turning the screw squeezes the <b>toes</b> between the <b>boards,</b> inflicting untold lateral pressure on the metatarsal heads and causing agony. This is the type of boot commonly associated with the torture of Esmeralda in Victor Hugo's Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The cruelty of the torture could be increased by spacing the toes apart with stiff wooden pegs. Various extensions of the instrument were designed to crush the ankle, calf, or knee in addition to its primary target, the instep. The toes often protruded {{from the front of the}} boot, facilitating the infliction of additional tortures, such as forcibly tearing the nails from the toes with red-hot iron pincers.|$|R

The effect of angle of upstream slope, angle of downstream slope, angle of toe filter, height of dam, crest width of dam, free <b>board,</b> length of <b>toe</b> filter and coefficient of permeability on the quantity of seepage were studied. The results show that, the seepage quantity decreased with increasing angle of <b>toe</b> filter, free <b>board</b> height and crest width of dam.

50|$|Good {{foundations}} are essential. Often scaffold frameworks {{will require}} more than simple base plates to safely carry and spread the load. Scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces, although base plates are always recommended. For surfaces like pavements or tarmac base plates are necessary. For softer or more doubtful surfaces sole boards must be used, beneath a single standard a sole board {{should be at least}} 1000 cm2 with no dimension less than 220 mm, the thickness must be at least 35 mm. For heavier duty scaffold much more substantial baulks set in concrete can be required. On uneven ground steps must be cut for the base plates, a minimum step size of around 450 mm is recommended. A working platform requires certain other elements to be safe. They must be close-boarded, have double guard rails and <b>toe</b> and stop <b>boards.</b> Safe and secure access must also be provided.|$|R

50|$|In the final, the {{surprise}} find {{of the season}} Ryan Crouser set the tone with a 21.15 m on the first throw of the competition. Two throwers later, O'Dayne Richards also set his tone with a big first throw, but his foot went over the <b>toe</b> <b>board.</b> Two time defending champion Tomasz Majewski and his Polish teammate, two time world junior champion Konrad Bukowiecki also had foul trouble. Bukowiecki never got a legal throw in. On the fourth throw of the competition, the home crowd got a thrill as Darlan Romani threw the Brazilian National Record 21.02 m, beating the mark he set earlier in the morning. Two more throws later, Franck Elemba threw 21.20 m {{to take the lead}} and set the new national record for the Congo. On the tenth throw, the 2016 world leader Joe Kovacs threw 21.78 m to take over the lead {{at the end of the}} first round. Starting the second round, Crouser tossed 22.22 m, to not only take the lead but to become tied for the number 17 thrower in history. Near the end of the round, Tomas Walsh threw 21.20 m, to equal Elemba's distance, but with his second throw of 21.00 Elemba held the tiebreaker for bronze position. For his third round throw, Crouser improved his best to 22.26 m, to advance to become the number 14 thrower in history. After dropping off four competitors and changing the throwing order, Walsh moved into the bronze medal position with a 21.36 m in the fifth round. Then Crouser put the exclamation point on his night's work with a , beating Ulf Timmermann's Olympic Record from 1988; the days of East German doping dominance. It moved him into a tie for the number 10 thrower in history. Since 2004, only Kovacs has thrown farther.|$|E
