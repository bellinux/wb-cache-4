5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that it was the last <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> yield under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E

5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 2007 Fowler {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} {{to play for}} Cardiff City. He missed the season's opening fixtures {{due to a lack}} of fitness, making his debut in a League Cup tie on 28 August. He scored his first two Cardiff goals on 22 September against Preston North End, scoring with two headers. Fowler scored twice in his next game, a third round League Cup tie against West Brom, which Cardiff won 4–2. This led to a fourth round tie against Fowler's former club Liverpool, at Anfield, to which even the Liverpool faithful crowd urged Fowler to score seeing that it may be the last <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> play in Anfield but Cardiff were knocked out in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised that for the first <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Rio Branco {{became the}} President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) {{for the first}} <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> become the Council's longest-serving president, and his cabinet the second longest, in Brazilian history. His {{government}} was marked by a time of economic prosperity and the enactment of several necessary reforms—though they proved to be seriously flawed. The {{most important of these}} initiatives was the Law of Free Birth, which granted freeborn status to children born to slave women. Rio Branco led the government that enacted this law, and its passage increased his popularity. However, his government was plagued by a long crisis with the Catholic Church that had resulted from the expulsion of Freemasons from its lay brotherhoods. After more than four years heading the Cabinet, Rio Branco resigned in 1875. Following a long vacation in Europe, his health swiftly declined and he was diagnosed with oral cancer. Rio Branco died in 1880 and was widely mourned throughout the country. He is regarded by most historians as one of Brazil's greatest statesmen.|$|E
