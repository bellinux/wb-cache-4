50|$|The {{original}} {{company that}} was contracted to manage the <b>towage</b> <b>operation</b> upon {{the sale of the}} ferry was dispensed with and replaced with Gull Marine Ltd, which resolved outstanding issues that were delaying the project and successfully executed the towage on behalf of the owners from the berth to the outer harbour in Holyhead. On 1 November 2015, she departed on tow from Holyhead and arrived in Turkey on the 17 November.|$|E
40|$|Main {{cause of}} {{accidents}} {{is just not}} always bad luck. Literature on safety has emphasised on the facts that accident finally leads to unfortunate consequence. The first step of risk assessment is to identify the hazards that are present. The Routine Ship Towage, also called harbour towage, is potentially a hazardous operation. The main objective {{of this research is}} to identify and quantify the important factors impacting on the safety of routine ship towage operations in Indian coast. In doing so, initially, the existing literature on factors influencing safety of harbour <b>towage</b> <b>operation</b> was analysed to design questionnaire. Rest necessary data was collected through questionnaires. Finally, the factor analysis (Principal Component analysis) was applied to find grouped dimensions from identified hazard variables from literature and subsequently the critical analysis of incident type frequency, cause and consequences to get a clear picture of critical safety risk factors. As a result, the research found 20 criteria in 6 dimensions safety risk factors such as Crew Incompetency, Rough Weather, Poor Work Process, Suitability of Tug Type, Poor Safety Management System, and Poor Navigational Risk Assessment...|$|E
25|$|As this {{activity}} was happening, towage began to reassert {{itself as an}} important element of the company; From 1993 it exhibited a period of aggressive growth until the company had a fleet of 156 tug boats, and operated in over 40 Australian, Indian, Pacific Oceana and British ports. Strengthened by a series of industry rationalisations - Brambles' Port Kembla, Sydney and Newcastle <b>operations</b> and P's <b>towage</b> <b>operations</b> in Western Australia - the towage division became a valuable candidate for asset disposal. In April 1997 the company changed its name to Residual Assco Group Limited and in June 1997 floated its marine division which was registered on the Australian Stock Exchange as Adsteam Marine Limited.|$|R
50|$|In 1977 the company's {{interest}} in Bulkships Limited was disposed of, and Adelaide Steamship Company ceased its connection with ship owning and operating. It had diversified into investment and property ownership, vineyard and wine production, optical goods manufacturing and distribution, engineering, share investment, and, until 1973, shipbuilding. Thus <b>towage</b> and associated <b>operations</b> {{continued to have}} prominence, even during the 1970s and 1980s when the Adelaide Steamship Company became the foundation for one the country's major conglomerate organisations.As this activity was happening, towage began to reassert itself as {{an important element of}} the company; From 1993 it exhibited a period of aggressive growth until the company had a fleet of 156 tug boats, and operated in over 40 Australian, Indian, Pacific Oceana and British ports.

25|$|A {{relatively}} minor sideline, {{started in the}} 1890s, was the company's tug boat operations. Gradually, tug boat operations extended {{over a number of}} ports, but until the middle of the 20th century they remained the poor relation of the more significant coastal shipping operations. With the decline of coastal shipping however, towage assumed more importance. By the 1960s, <b>towage</b> and associated <b>operations</b> represented a very significant part of the company's activities.|$|R

5000|$|The ships normal tasks include {{fisheries}} inspections, environment protection, {{search and}} rescue, sovereignty enforcement, icebreaker assignments, <b>towage</b> and salvage <b>operations</b> and general {{assistance to the}} Danish and Greenland governments (including police tasks). The class has a helicopter deck aft behind the superstructure but lacks an aircraft hangar. However, it can perform Rotors running refueling and can thus increase the endurance {{and the range of}} the helicopter. December 2013 a third ship of the class (HDMS Lauge Koch) was ordered by the Danish Parliament. Service entry of the third ship will be 2016, with an estimated cost of 513 mill Dkr (US$ [...] ).|$|R
25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, {{the company}} diversified into the airline <b>operations,</b> <b>towage,</b> shipbuilding, and the {{shipping}} of salt, coal and sugar. Adelaide Airways {{was formed in}} 1935, and purchased West Australian Airways before merging with Holyman's Airways to form Australian National Airways (ANA) in 1936. ANA was sold to Reg Ansett in 1957. In 1964, the Interstate fleet merged with McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co, and the partnership developed the world's first purpose built container ships. However, in 1973, the company ceased its shipbuilding operations, and in 1977, in its 103rd year of operation, the company sold its shipping related businesses, and ceased its connection with ship owning and operating. The company did, however, retain its interests in tugboat operations.|$|R
