Software testing {{is the process}} {{used to measure the}} quality of developed computer software. It exhibits all mistakes, errors and flaws in the developed software. There are many approaches to software testing, but effective testing of complex product is essentially a process of investigation, not merely a matter of creating and following route procedure. It is not possible to find out all the errors in the program. This fundamental problem in testing thus throws an open question, as to what would be the strategy we should adopt for testing.

40|$|In social animals, the {{presence}} of an affiliative conspecific alleviates acute stress responses, and this is called social buffering. We previously reported that social buffering mitigates the fear responses of male rats to auditory conditioned stimuli that had been paired with foot shocks. Subsequent studies revealed that signals that are perceived by the main olfactory epithelium are important for social buffering. Because olfactory signals are the signal perceived by the main olfactory epithelium, we hypothesized that we could induce the social buffering of conditioned fear responses by presenting olfactory signals that were derived from a conspecific. In order to test this hypothesis, we exposed fear-conditioned subjects to a conditioned stimulus either in a clean <b>test</b> <b>box</b> or in a <b>test</b> <b>box</b> that was odorized by keeping a conspecific in it as an odor donor beforehand. When the subjects were tested in the clean <b>test</b> <b>box,</b> they showed behavioral fear responses and enhanced Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus. In contrast, {{the presence}} of conspecific olfactory signals blocked these fear responses and Fos expression. These results suggested that olfactory signals suppress conditioned fear responses. Fos expression in the posteromedial region of the olfactory peduncle and amygdala suggested that this suppression involves the same neural mechanisms as those of social buffering. Taken together, we concluded that olfactory signals mediate the social buffering of conditioned fear responses...|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to have consistent ballast testing methods that provide results reflecting the performance of different ballast materials in the railway trackbed. In this research, extensive laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the correlation between simple ballast index <b>tests,</b> and <b>box</b> <b>tests</b> simulating ballast field loading conditions in a simplified and controlled manner. In the <b>box</b> <b>test,</b> a sleeper load of 40 kN was applied to a simulated sleeper {{on the top of a}} sample of ballast in a box of dimensions 700 x 300 x 450 mm. The ballast was tamped using a Kango hammer which caused particles to rearrange as the level of the sleeper was raised. The ballast tests investigated in this project are those ballast tests specified in the Railtrack Line Specification (RT/CE/S/ 006 Issue 3, 2000), in addition to single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, petrographic analysis, and <b>box</b> <b>tests.</b> It was found that there was some correlation between the single particle crushing <b>tests,</b> oedometer <b>tests,</b> <b>box</b> <b>tests</b> and petrographic analysis. One of the current ballast tests, namely the Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) test, which is analogous to the oedometer test, is not appropriate because the ACV test uses 10 - 14 mm ballast particles, and there is a size effect on the strength of ballast and different ballasts have different size effects. However, if an oedometer test is used on track ballast, the results correlate better with ballast field performance as simulated in the <b>box</b> <b>tests.</b> Six ballasts were tested: A, B, C, D, E and F (mineralogy of these ballasts can be found in the appendix). The aim was to examine the relative performance of these ballasts and to establish which index tests were most indicative of performance in the <b>box</b> <b>test.</b> Simple index tests were performed on each of the ballasts, whilst <b>box</b> <b>tests</b> were only performed on ballasts A, B, C and D. The <b>box</b> <b>tests</b> were generally performed wet by adding a known volume of water at each tamp. For ballast A, controlled tests were also performed on dry ballast, and tests involving traffic loading only and tamping only were also conducted. A <b>box</b> <b>test</b> on 10 - 14 mm ballast A was also conducted to investigate the size effect on ballast behaviour in the box. The Wet Attrition Value (WAV), Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA), and Micro-Deval Attrition (MDA) seem to be suitable parameters to indicate ballast performance in the <b>box</b> <b>test.</b> However, this is considered to be due to the rearrangement of particles in the <b>box</b> <b>test</b> caused by the simulated tamping. In addition to the laboratory tests, the application of discrete element program PFC 3 D (Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., 1999) in simulating ballast behaviour was also investigated. Single particle crushing test was simulated to produce crushable agglomerates with a distribution of strengths of ballast A. These agglomerates were then used to simulate the oedometer test. The resulting normal compression line was compared with that for real oedometer tests: discrepancies can be attributed to the simplified geometry of the agglomerates. Due to the high computational time in simulating a <b>box</b> <b>test</b> with crushable agglomerates, uncrushable spherical balls and uncrushable angular agglomerates were used to represent individual ballast particles in the box. Important aspects of ballast behaviour under repeated loading, namely resilient and permanent deformation, were studied. It was found that the <b>box</b> <b>test</b> on uncrushable angular agglomerates give less permanent deformation compared with the test on spherical balls, because of the additional resistance provided by the irregular shape of the agglomerates.
