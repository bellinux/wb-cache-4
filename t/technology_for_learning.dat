The research group is one of the Media Lab's oldest and one of a few that predates the creation of the lab. While at the lab, Bender held the Alexander W. Dreyfoos Chair. Bender's research has attempted to build upon the interactive styles associated with existing media and extend them into domains where a computer is incorporated into the interaction. He has participated in research in the field of electronic publishing, and personalized, interactive multimedia, particularly including news. From 2000 through 2006, Bender was executive director of The Media Lab.|$|E

This study aimed to enhance {{our understanding of the}} determinants of self-directed technology use through the construction of a structural equation modelling (SEM) framework of factors and interactions that determine students ’ self-directed use of technology for language learning. A survey was conducted among second language learners at one university in Hong Kong to provide the basis for a model that describes how various psychological and sociocultural factors interact to influence language learners ’ use of <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> outside school. Attitudinal factors—such as language learning motivation, perceived usefulness of <b>technology</b> <b>for</b> <b>learning,</b> and perceived compatibility between technology use and learning expectancies—played a dominant role in shaping technology use. Perceived support from teachers and peers, self-regulation skills, and confidence in the selection and use of technology effectively impacted technology use mainly through strengthening perceived compatibility and usefulness. The findings suggest that attitudinal factors deserve much greater attention than currently given in promoting language learners ’ selfdirected use of technology...|$|E

40|$|Computers and the Internet have {{revolutionized}} {{communication and}} information sharing, which {{is having a}} significant impact on education. As technologies continue to evolve, traditional post-secondary institutions, such as Holland College, are faced with the challenge of adapting curriculum and delivery methods to meet the changing needs of students, instructors, and industry through electronic learning (e-learning). In order to achieve success in the area of e-learning, the College must first determine the needs and expectations of two key stakeholder groups, the students and instructors; who, until now have been relatively silent. The purpose of this quantitative research was to inquire about students’ and instructors’ expectations and overall perceptions of <b>technologies</b> used <b>for</b> <b>learning.</b> The study analyzed the secondary data provided by the College which included responses from 533 student and 109 instructor surveys concerning their perceptions of <b>technologies</b> <b>for</b> <b>learning,</b> and more specifically the benefits, use patterns, importance, and challenges of <b>technologies</b> <b>for</b> <b>learning.</b> The data revealed the primary benefit of e- <b>learning</b> was <b>for</b> academic achievement.
