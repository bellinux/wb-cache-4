5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling. <b>This</b> <b>color</b> change {{is caused by}} a small loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the non-stoichiometric Zn1+xO, where at 800°C, x = 0.00007.|$|E
5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity. One reason for including <b>this</b> <b>color</b> final was, according to Tarkovsky, {{to give the}} viewer some rest and {{to allow him to}} detach himself from Rublev's life and to reflect. The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life was the source of all of Rublev's art.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{commercial}} use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, {{is for the}} production of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. <b>This</b> <b>color</b> cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.|$|E

5|$|The {{single most}} major aspect of shell {{variation}} within the genus {{is the color}} patterning. In general, many arboreal snails are brightly colored, obvious examples being the bulimulid genera Drymaeus and Liguus, the cepolid Polymita, and the camaenid Papuina. However, Polymita, Liguus and Amphidromus are particularly noted for their color variations. The basic ground color of Amphidromus appears to be yellow, and <b>this</b> <b>color</b> is usually (except for Amphidromus entobaptus) confined to the surface layers of the shell, since worn specimens appear to be nearly devoid of color. In some species the background color is whitish, and a few have dark background colors. The apical whorls are pale, purple, brown, or black, and this sometimes varies within a population (as in A. quadrasi). A few species, for example A. schomburgki, have a deciduous green periostracum.|$|E
5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing <b>this</b> <b>color</b> could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E

25|$|A bright {{turquoise}} blue colour - 'Maya Blue' - {{has survived}} {{through the centuries}} due to its unique chemical characteristics; <b>this</b> <b>color</b> is present in Bonampak, Cacaxtla, Jaina, El Tajín, and even in some Colonial Convents. The use of Maya Blue survived until the 16th century, when the technique was lost.|$|E
25|$|The wheels {{were soon}} {{replaced}} by an alloy five-spoke design with Goodyear white-letter tires.

25|$|Those {{who passed}} the japgwa were {{originally}} given a crimson certificate, {{the same color}} obtained by those who passed the literary examination.

25|$|In an aqueous {{solution}} the color change exhibited {{can be used}} to test for distinguishing aldehydes from ketones. Aldehydes reduce dichromate from the +6 to the +3 oxidation state, changing color from orange to green. <b>This</b> <b>color</b> change arises because the aldehyde can be oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid. A ketone will show no such change because it cannot be oxidized further, and so the solution will remain orange.|$|E
25|$|The Lake Superior agate {{is noted}} for its rich red, orange, and yellow coloring. <b>This</b> <b>color</b> scheme {{is caused by the}} {{oxidation}} of iron. Iron leached from rocks provided the pigment that gives the gemstone its beautiful array of color. The concentration of iron and the amount of oxidation determine the color within or between an agate's bands. There can also be white, grey, black and tan strips of color as well.|$|E
25|$|A truly red bearded iris, like a truly blue rose, {{remains an}} unattained goal despite {{frequent}} hybridizing and selection. There are species and selections, most notably {{based on the}} beardless rhizomatous Copper iris (I. fulva), which have a relatively pure red color. However, getting <b>this</b> <b>color</b> into a modern bearded iris breed has proven very difficult, and thus, {{the vast majority of}} irises are in the purple and blue range of the color spectrum, with yellow, pink, orange and white breeds also available.|$|E
25|$|The granny knot is tricolorable. In <b>this</b> <b>coloring</b> {{the three}} strands at every {{crossing}} have three different colors. Coloring one but not {{both of the}} trefoil knots all red would also give an admissible coloring. The true lover's knot is also tricolorable.|$|R

25|$|For example, a {{butterfly}} may produce offspring with new mutations. The {{majority of these}} mutations will have no effect; but one might change the color {{of one of the}} butterfly's offspring, making it harder (or easier) for predators to see. If <b>this</b> <b>color</b> change is advantageous, the chance of this butterfly's surviving and producing its own offspring are a little better, and over time the number of butterflies with this mutation may form a larger percentage of the population.|$|E

The uniforms where modernized in the year 2000, and the old gray uniform was replaced by a new dark blue uniform, called M/2000. The uniform has been edited some times, and a new rescue-uniform was created in 2009 for USAR teams. The M/2000 is being replaced by a new uniform currently under development.|$|E
25|$|Fullerenes are {{sparingly}} soluble in aromatic solvents such as toluene and carbon disulfide, but insoluble in water. Solutions of pure C60 {{have a deep}} purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>color</b> change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of molecular levels responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating the blue light transmittance and causing the purple to brown color change.|$|E

5000|$|De Bruijn was led {{to prove}} this result after his then-seven-year-old son, F. W. de Bruijn, was unable to pack bricks of {{dimension}} [...] into a [...] cube. The cube has a volume {{equal to that of}} [...] bricks, but only [...] bricks may be packed into it; one way to see this is to partition the cube into [...] smaller cubes colored alternately black and white, and to observe that <b>this</b> <b>coloring</b> has more unit cells of one color than of the other, whereas with <b>this</b> <b>coloring</b> any placement of the [...] brick must have equal numbers of cells of each color. De Bruijn's theorem proves that a perfect packing with these dimensions is impossible, in a more general way that applies to many other dimensions of bricks and boxes.|$|R
25|$|Chemical {{reactions}} yield LiH in {{the form}} of lumped powder, which can be compressed into pellets without a binder. More complex shapes can be produced by casting from the melt. Large single crystals (about 80nbsp&mm long and 16nbsp&mm in diameter) can be then grown from molten LiH powder in hydrogen atmosphere by the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique. They often have bluish color owing to the presence of colloidal Li. <b>This</b> <b>color</b> can be removed by post-growth annealing at lower temperatures (~550nbsp&°C) and lower thermal gradients. Major impurities in these crystals are Na (20–200 parts per million, ppm), O (10–100 ppm), Mg (0.5–6 ppm), Fe (0.5-2 ppm) and Cu (0.5-2 ppm).|$|E
25|$|Color {{selection}} was {{by using the}} difference in the levels of three Optical filters, in order to capture these color limits: u-r ≤ 2.5 (1), r-i ≤ -0.2 (2), r-z ≤ 0.5 (3), g-r ≥ r-i + 0.5 (4), u-r ≥ 2.5 (r-z) (5). If the diagram on the right (one of two in the paper) is looked at, the effectiveness of <b>this</b> <b>color</b> selection can be seen. The Color-color diagram shows ~100 GPs (green crosses), 10,000 comparison galaxies (red points) and 9,500 comparison quasar (purple stars) at similar redshifts to the GPs. The black lines show how these figures are on the diagram.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse populations can be {{monitored}} and effectively controlled using simple, inexpensive traps. These often use electric blue cloth, since <b>this</b> <b>color</b> attracts the flies. Early traps mimicked {{the form of}} cattle but this seems unnecessary and recent traps are simple sheets or have a biconical form. The traps can kill by channeling the flies into a collection chamber or by exposing the flies to insecticide sprayed on the cloth. Tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes. Some scientists put forward the idea that zebra have stripes, not as a camouflage in long grass, but because {{the black and white}} bands tend to confuse tsetse and prevent attack.|$|E
