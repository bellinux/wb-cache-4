Although compression is conceptually straightforward, there are various design parameters that may affect the intelligibility of speech, the quality of sounds, {{and the perception of}} background noise. Four combinations of the Dual Front-End automatic gain control (AGC) system were implemented: (1) The Dual Front-End with a <b>Hold</b> <b>Timer</b> developed in Stone et al. [8], which aimed at reducing pumping effects while maintaining a relatively fast release; (2) The Dual Front-End with the SNR Estimator, investigated by Martin et al. [4], designed to provide a varying release time constant depending on the SNR level; (3) The Dual Front-End with both the <b>Hold</b> <b>Timer</b> and the SNR Estimator; (4) The Dual Front-End by itself, without the <b>Hold</b> <b>Timer</b> or the SNR Estimator. A fifth system, composed of linear amplification and compression limiting, was implemented {{to be used as a}} reference condition. A variety of stimuli consisting of speech at different levels and speech plus environmental sounds were processed by the five systems and presented over headphones to three hearing-impaired subjects. Subjects rated the processed stimuli for intelligibility and quality. While no clear differences were found among the four compression systems, there were some major differences between the Dual Front-End systems and the Linear system. The direction of these differences varied with subject, and to a lesser degree, with stimulus condition. In addition, compression systems generally performed better in stimuli conditions with low SNRs, indicating that compression may be useful for suppression of background noise. by Ivan Aguayo.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in real-time distributed systems research have produced quality-of-service (QoS) technologies that allow asynchronous real-time distributed systems to specify and dynamically negotiate service expectations such as timeliness and survivability, {{which was not}} previously possible under classical real-time theory.

Compliance is especially important when a system self-adapts to perform a repair, improve performance, or modify decisions. There remain significant challenges assessing the risk of adaptations that are dynamically configured at runtime with respect to critical property compliance. Assuming compliance verification was performed for the originally deployed system, the proof process holds valuable meta-data about the variables and conditions that impact reusing the proof on the adapted system. We express this meta-data as a verification workflow using Colored Petri Nets. As dynamic adaptations are configured, the Petri Nets produce alert tokens suggesting the potential proof reuse impact of an adaptation.

40|$|Abstract — Token Ring is a {{local area}} network which resides in the Data Link Layer (DLL) of the OSI model. Stations on a token ring LAN are logically {{organized}} in a ring topology with data being transmitted sequentially from one ring station to the next with a control token circulating around the ring controlling access. Each station passes or repeats the special token frame around the ring to its nearest downstream neighbour. This token-passing process is used to arbitrate access to the shared ring media. Stations that have data frames to transmit must first acquire the token before they can transmit them. It can transmit the packet for fixed duration decided by <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> time.

40|$|Abstract-The IEEE 802. 5 {{token ring}} {{protocol}} defines eight packet priorities. The intent is that “high priority ” packets should be delivered prior to “low priority ” packets. Through {{a series of}} simulations we show that this expected behavior occurs under {{a unique set of}} circumstances: when there are very few network stations, very short data packets (but still long relative to ring latency), very short <b>token</b> <b>hold</b> times, and very high network load. In the general case, we found that priorities did not markedly influence packet delivery time. Use of the priority system generally resulted in more overhead and longer average packet delays than when all packets were carried as a single priority. We mathematically describe the features of the protocol operation that are the cause of this increased delay and lack of priority discrimination. 50 E 03, I I I I I I I I 1 I.

The heuristic algorithms adapt the application to workload changes through trans-node message-level adaptation mechanisms. We present adaptive communication heuristics for IEEE 802. 5 token ring networks {{that support the}} prioritydriven protocol and for FDDI networks that use the Timed Token protocol. The heuristic algorithms adapt periodic computations of the application to workload changes by reprioritizing application messages and by dynamically changing <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> times at processor nodes, respectively. The objective of the heuristics is to minimize (end-to-end) missed deadline ratios of the tasks. We study {{the performance of the}} techniques through a combination of benchmarking and simulation. The performance of the heuristics is compared with an adaptive resource management algorithm that performs adaptation by dynamically replicating application processes for load sharing. The experimental results indicate that the adaptive communication strategies outperform the process replication algorithm for load patterns that cause communication latencies to grow faster than execution latencies. Moreover, we also observe that the adaptive communication algorithms perform as good as the process replication algorithm for load patterns that cause execution latencies to grow faster than communication latencies. 1...|$|R

40|$|Vehicular {{communication}} {{has been}} an emerging topic among current wireless research. The vehicular communication can be classified to Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) and Road-to-Vehicle Communication (RVC). IVC and RVC support applications mainly on two aspects: safety applications aiming to reduce dangers on the road, and data applications aiming to provide information and entertainment to people on traveling. Vehicles nearby form Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) without any fixed infrastructures. Due to the characteristics of vehicular networks such as quickly changing and unstable network topology, IVC has special requirements to the network protocols. Several MAC protocols have been appeared or improved based on previous work for IVC. But these protocols are designed either for QoS guaranteed data service or for reliable message broadcast. There is not a protocol including both application requirements and inexpensive to implement as well. MAC protocol for vehicular communication hasn’t been finalized. In this thesis, an overlay token ring protocol (OTRP) is proposed which can work on MAC layer with broadcast function and taking into the IVC features into consideration. In OTRP, vehicles are grouped to overlapped rings with a token passed in each ring as the sole right for transmission. The ring is dynamically updated in a distributed manner based on smart algorithm at each node. OTRP provides bounded delay by assigning maximum <b>token</b> <b>holding</b> time for each node. It also reduces collisions by decreasing the number of contention nodes by times of ring size. Fair and high throughput is obtained as well. Furthermore, it provides reliable and prompt broadcast of emergency messages by pre-emptively transmitting while applying the token as an acknowledgement. The time nodes reliably receive the message is within limit. Theoretical analysis is provided and simulation results are given to evaluate the performance of OTRP under saturated traffic conditions both in safety and data applications...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the translation into Portuguese of the demonstrative pronoun this, whenever used as an anaphor. The study relies on the analysis of a sample of tokens collected in a parallel English-Portuguese bilingual corpus containing literary texts and international law texts, as well as technical and scientific materials. Only tokens appearing in texts originally produced in English were considered. Each case of anaphoric this was classified according to four properties, namely: syntactic function; reference type (anaphoric, cataphoric or deictic), according to the relation each <b>token</b> <b>holds</b> with the antecedent; explicitness of the antecedent; and antecedent phrase structure. Explicitness assigns the values of either explicit or implicit to antecedents of anaphoric this tokens, as identified by the analyst, whereas phrase structure classifies those antecedents as either nominal – a noun phrase – or textual – a discourse chunk that cannot be treated as a single noun phrase. Relations between these variables are analysed with a view to revealing semantic relations of a textual nature, and renderings into Portuguese are also discussed so as to establish the way these relations are expressed by means of anaphora in each language. Collocational analysis of the tokens was used to establish patterns of translation for the anaphor in the English-Portuguese language pair. The study attempts to show that the anaphoric demonstrative this plays a particularly important role in the definition of patterns for textual semantics in English, and that corresponding patterns in Portuguese branch out over a range of forms which may be predicted using the analytical framework proposed. It is 2 expected that the definition of such patterns contributes {{to a better understanding of}} textual aspects in translation, possibly extensible to other Romance languages, and also provides subsidies for the improvement of machine translation systems.

30|$|Two {{similar works}} focus on {{intermittent}} connectivity problem; they are anti-intermittence source routing protocol (AiSorp) [25] and anti-intermittence routing [26]. AiSorp combines the forward routing discovery process of DSR and backward process of AODV. In its routing discovery, when the cognitive radio routing request reaches the destination node, the destination node stops transmitting and computes the corresponding path metric. The path metric considers the PUs’ channel utilization, link weight, and two predefined parameters. For the route maintenance, when a path is invalid, the affected node does not immediately send a cognitive radio routing error (CR 3 ER) {{to the source}} node. Instead, the node waits {{for a period of}} time, called the routing holding state.
