25|$|The Slogan Concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maximae dilabuntur (concord {{will make}} small things flourish, discord will destroy even the greatest) was adapted on August 23, 1870.

25|$|Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw {{objects as}} {{perceived}} within an environment {{according to all}} of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of perception—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It {{is based on the}} here and now, and in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> seen. Images can be divided into figure or ground. The question is what is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.|$|E

25|$|Techno-liberals {{look for}} change. By their nature, they're not {{satisfied}} with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> and want {{to find new ways}} to do things. Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, Net neutrality for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural perspectives that imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and use technology, especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't come soon enough. For those who see the true promise of the web for multi-media and as a general platform for application software, the Internet is still far too slow and primitive.|$|E
25|$|Prohibited {{discrimination}} may include, {{among other}} things, firing or refusing {{to hire someone}} based on a real or perceived disability, segregation, and harassment based on a disability. Covered entities are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation {{is a change in}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> typically done that the person needs because of a disability, and can include, among other things, special equipment that allows the person to perform the job, scheduling changes, and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated. An employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense), and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements. An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.|$|E

500|$|On 18 May 1968, Lennon {{summoned the}} other Beatles {{to a meeting}} at Apple Corps to {{announce}} {{that he was the}} living reincarnation of Jesus: [...] "I have something very important to tell you all. I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again." [...] The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again. In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko", with Lennon singing the lines, [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be, <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> going, They're gonna crucify me." [...] In a BBC interview a few months later, Lennon called himself [...] "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry Yoko Ono in church.|$|E
500|$|In {{speculative}} fiction, extrapolation allows {{writers to}} focus not on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> (or were), as non-genre literature does, {{but on the}} way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called [...] "cognitive estrangement": the recognition {{that what we are}} reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.|$|E

2500|$|Romney's {{relationship}} with the state legislature was somewhat fraught. He insisted that discussions with executive branch appointees always go through the governor's office, which left legislators annoyed.

[...] Romney was disinclined towards making political deals with the legislature, saying: [...] "I ran on the platform of cleaning up the mess on Beacon Hill, [...] reform means changing <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are.</b> Legislatures by and large, despite the political titles, are conservative.
