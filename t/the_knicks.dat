5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Knicks</b> were shorthanded {{with their}} {{starting}} center, Phil Jordon, out sick. Jordon's illness was officially reported as influenza {{but it was}} widely suspected he was simply hung over.

5|$|The New York Knickerbockers, {{better known}} as the New York Knicks, are a {{professional}} basketball team based in New York City that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). An original member of the NBA, <b>the</b> <b>Knicks</b> play in the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division. In its 71 seasons, the franchise has reached the NBA Finals eight times and won two championships.

5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, <b>the</b> <b>Knicks</b> began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul <b>the</b> <b>Knicks,</b> get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and <b>the</b> <b>Knicks</b> with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E

5|$|In Bradley's rookie season, {{he joined}} the team late, having also missed the entire preseason.
