25|$|Bottas's {{preparation}} for his final timed lap was slightly compromised, {{and made a}} mistake in the first turn, restricting him to eighth. Magnussen took ninth and Kvyat rounded out the top ten after only having the super soft compound tyre available to him. Button was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 46.943 seconds was 1.1 seconds slower than Rosberg's pace in the second session. He locked his front tyres at the turn 13 hairpin on his final timed lap and went wide, losing him time, and struggled with front-end grip despite changing engine and differential settings. Vergne did not improve on his second attempt, struggling with front-end grip, and locked his tyres, restricting him to 12th. The two Force India cars qualified in 13th and 15th (with Hülkenberg ahead of Pérez) after being unable to improve on their fastest laps at their second attempts and were separated by Gutiérrez in the faster of the two Sauber entries. Romain Grosjean was the slowest driver in the second session; he suffered from a <b>turbocharger</b> <b>wastegate</b> problem that prevented him from driving at full power and vented his frustration to Lotus over the radio after being eliminated. Adrian Sutil failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, after having energy management and engine problems that prevented him from pushing hard. Maldonado was affected by the same problem his teammate had and was only able to qualify 18th. Jules Bianchi made minor mistakes on his first timed lap en route to 19th and was ahead of Kamui Kobayashi in 20th. Max Chilton could not extract full engine power on his first attempt because of mapping problems and had to prepare for another lap and took 21st. Marcus Ericsson ventured onto the track late in the first session after his team worked quickly to rectify an electrical issue and completed the field in 22nd.|$|E
50|$|The Buicks' {{day came}} to an end on lap 19 when Scott Brayton stopped on the track with a blown engine from a cracked {{cylinder}} wall. After keeping a close margin to Andretti, Bobby Rahal went to the pits on lap 52 with a <b>turbocharger</b> <b>wastegate</b> problem. After several long pit stops, Rahal eventually dropped out with 84 laps.|$|E
50|$|After {{qualifying}} was closed, eight {{teams that}} failed to qualify filed a protest on Monday May 21. They charged that the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>wastegate</b> inlet rules were unfair, and {{there was too much}} of a gray area to begin with. In addition, they claimed that many cars that qualified during the first weekend of time trials were technically illegal, but that officials were only closely checking the cars that made attempts on the second weekend.|$|E

5000|$|During the month, {{a second}} {{controversy}} erupted regarding the technical regulations of the <b>turbocharger</b> <b>wastegate.</b> The specifications called for wastegate exhaust pipes to be {{a minimum of}} 1.470 inches (inside diameter). The standard pipe diameter was typically 2 inches. In addition, the pop-off valves affixed to the cars were to be set at 50 inHG of [...] "boost" [...] for qualifying (down from 80 inHG). USAC issued a last-minute ruling that in-car adjustments of the boost dial would be banned during time trials.|$|E

5000|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished the session 15th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify. The {{second part of the}} qualifying session lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 14th. The final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth, deciding the pole position. Cars in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. Hamilton set the fastest time in the final session to clinch his sixth pole position of the season, his third in Singapore, and the 37th of his career with a time of one minute and 45.681 seconds. The lap was achieved despite Hamilton locking his tyres entering turn one and missing the turn's apex as a consequence, losing him two-tenths of a second. Hamilton was joined on the grid's front row by Rosberg who recorded a lap 0.007 seconds slower than his teammate. Rosberg called it [...] "the most difficult qualifying of my career so far" [...] because he had difficulty finding a rhythm and changed his brakes for qualifying. Ricciardo took third and had the pole position until both Mercedes drivers went faster in the session's closing seconds. He was ahead of teammate Vettel in fourth who believed he could have achieved the pole position after feeling he pushed too hard. Alonso made a minor set-up change, enabling him to feel confident and qualified in fifth place. Massa took sixth, ahead of Räikkönen, who was quickest in the first session, and declared his satsification with his car's handling, but his engine shut down while preparing for his second timed lap of the final session. Bottas's preparation for his final timed lap was slightly compromised, and made a mistake in the first turn, restricting him to eighth.

5000|$|The first {{performance}} Delta was the Delta HF, {{which was}} introduced in July 1983 and went on sale in September after a first appearance at the Frankfurt Motor Show. the HF acronym—last used on the Stratos—stood for [...] "High Fidelity", and had been used on performance version of Lancia cars since 1966. It was front-wheel drive and powered by a turbocharged version of the 1.6-litre engine from the Delta GT; the system used a Garrett TBO- 225 <b>turbocharger</b> with <b>wastegate</b> valve, an air-to-air heat exchanger, a blow-through twin-choke Weber carburetor and Marelli Microplex ignition with pre-ignition control. To withstand the additional stress deriving from turbocharging upgrades {{were made to the}} oil system, with increased capacity and an oil cooler, and to the heads with sodium-filled valves. The gearbox was a ZF 5-speed unit. Dampers, springs and steering were retuned, and the tyres were wide 175/65 Michelin TRX on R 340 alloy wheels. In true Lancia tradition the exterior of the HF was relatively understated: changes were limited to silver [...] "HF" [...] badging on the grille, a deeper chin spoiler, black trim as on the GT, black roof drip rail mouldings, black side skirts with small silver [...] "turbo" [...] badges in front of the rear wheels, the 1982 roof spoiler painted in black, air intake cowls on the bonnet grilles, bronze-tinted athermic glass and 8-spoke alloy wheels.The cabin featured a leather-covered steering wheel and supplementary digital instrumentation with bar indicators; the upholstery material was the usual Zegna fabric, and Recaro sport seats covered in the same cloth optional. About ten thousand Delta HF were made, in a two-year production period.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962 and 1963 Oldsmobile built a {{turbocharged}} {{version of}} the 215. The small-diameter Garrett T5 <b>turbocharger</b> with integral <b>wastegate</b> was manufactured by Garrett AiResearch and produced a maximum of 5 psi (34 kPa) boost at 2200 rpm. The engine had 10.25:1 compression and a single-barrel carburetor. It was rated at [...] at 4600 rpm and [...] at 3200 rpm. In development, the high compression ratio combined with the charged load created problems with spark knock on hard throttle applications, which led Olds to develop and utilize a novel water-injection system that sprayed metered amounts of distilled water and methyl alcohol (dubbed [...] "Turbo-Rocket Fluid") into the intake manifold air-stream to cool the intake charge. If the fluid reservoir was empty, a complex double-float and valve assembly in the Turbo-Rocket Fluid path would set a second butterfly (positioned between the throttle butterfly and the turbocharger) into the closed position, limiting the amount of boost pressure. Unfortunately, many customers did not keep the reservoir filled, or had mechanical problems with the turbocharger system which resulted {{in many of the}} turbo-charger installations being removed and a conventional 4 barrel carburetor and manifold installed in its place.|$|R
50|$|The HF turbo soon {{lost its}} crown as {{top-of-the-range}} Delta, as the turbocharged 2.0-litre and four-wheel drive Delta HF 4WD was unveiled at the April 1986 Turin Motor Show.Some {{of the features}} of the HF 4WD previewed a major mid-cycle refresh for the entire Delta range, announced in May 1986 and put on sale in June.New enveloping bumpers—the front one with provisions for integrated fog lights—gave the car a more modern look; the entire front end was changed with a new grille and new headlight covers, which were slanted forward and protruded from the bodywork {{in an effort to make}} the car more aerodynamic. The roof spoiler introduced in 1982 was removed.Seven models composed the 1986 range: 1.3, LX 1.3, 1.5 Automatica, GT i.e., HF turbo, HF 4WD and turbo ds.Entry-level model was the 1.3; the 1,301 cc engine had revised intake and exhaust system, fuel cut-off, a new carburettor and breakerless ignition. It was also available on the more upscale LX 1.3. Similar changes were made to the powertrain of the Delta 1.5 Automatica.The Delta GT and HF turbo were given Weber IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection system to become the Delta GT i.e. and the Delta HF turbo i.e., with 108 PS and 140 PS respectively. Deeper changes had been made to the GT i.e. engine: the cylinder head had been rotated 180°, bringing the exhaust side to the front for better cooling, and the whole engine was canted forward 18° to lower its centre of gravity. Delta HF turbo was updated to HF 4WD looks and interior, from which it differed mainly for the square headlights and single exhaust.Delta turbo ds marked the introduction of the first diesel engine on the Delta. This was a 1,929 cc 8-valve four-cylinder from the Prisma, with an output of 80 PS; it used a KKK <b>turbocharger</b> with <b>wastegate</b> valve, an intercooler and an oil cooler. The turbo ds was positioned on the market like the GT i.e., and given similarly complete standard equipment comprising such features as an oil pressure gauge, boost pressure gauge and power steering.|$|R
