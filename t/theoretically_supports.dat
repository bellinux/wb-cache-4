40|$|AbstractThe star graph {{has drawn}} {{a lot of}} {{attention}} recently as an attractive alternative to hypercube. Due to its reduced diameter, the star graph <b>theoretically</b> <b>supports</b> more efficient communication than popular networks such as the hypercube and the mesh. However, practically only limited results have been obtained related to the design of parallel algorithms on the star graph. By its own nature, the star graph seems to be inadequate for certain types of algorithms especially those based on matrix computations. Furthermore, no efficient embeddings of hypercubes or meshes in the star graph are known, which would (had they existed) allow us to simulate the corresponding hypercube or mesh algorithms. In this paper, we show how to overcome these difficulties with the star graph while allowing to take advantage of its communication capabilities. We propose to consider the Cartesian product of star graphs as interconnection networks and we design and evaluate block-cyclic matrix triangulation on these networks. We demonstrate how such star graph based Cartesian product networks are more suitable for real applications than traditional star graphs, while inheriting the theoretically established communication efficiency of star graphs. We present a framework for practical implementation of block-cyclic matrix triangulation on the Cartesian product of star graphs along with a performance evaluation and comparison with other topologies. The proposed techniques for matrix decomposition and mapping are of general use and can be applied to design other matrixbased algorithms on the Cartesian product of star graphs...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of electrophysiological recordings often involves visual inspection of time series data to locate specific experiment epochs, mask artifacts, and verify {{the results of}} signal processing steps, such as filtering or spike detection. Long-term experiments with continuous data acquisition generate large amounts of data. Rapid browsing through these massive datasets poses a challenge to conventional data plotting software because the plotting time increases proportionately {{to the increase in}} the volume of data. This paper presents FTSPlot, which is a visualization concept for large-scale time series datasets using techniques from the field of high performance computer graphics, such as hierarchic level of detail and out-of-core data handling. In a preprocessing step, time series data, event, and interval annotations are converted into an optimized data format, which then permits fast, interactive visualization. The preprocessing step has a computational complexity of O(n x log(N)); the visualization itself can be done with a complexity of O(1) and is therefore independent of the amount of data. A demonstration prototype has been implemented and benchmarks show that the technology is capable of displaying large amounts of time series data, event, and interval annotations lag-free with < 20 ms ms. The current 64 -bit implementation <b>theoretically</b> <b>supports</b> datasets with up to 2 (64) bytes, on the x 86 _ 64 architecture currently up to 2 (48) bytes are supported, and benchmarks have been conducted with 2 (40) bytes/ 1 TiB or 1. 3 x 10 (11) double precision samples.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of animal time budgets {{is crucial to}} behavioural biology. Although many studies have analysed time budgets of individual species, only a few have made interspecific comparisons. Here we take an interspecific look at {{one part of the}} time budget, feeding time. We hypothesize that feeding time can be predicted by the amount of time an animal needs to reach satiation. This time should be equal to the ratio of handling time to digestion time. For 19 herbivorous species from insects to mammals, we calculate this ratio and compare it to the observed feeding time. The mean difference between calculated and observed values is small (a half hour per 24 h-day), indicating that herbivore feeding times can often be approximated by the ratio of handling time to digestion time. We make three points concerning the time allocated to feeding in herbivores based on this interspecific comparison. First, our analysis suggests that herbivores often feed to satiation, which could mean that they are often released from time constraints. It is also possible, however, that while herbivores have enough time to reach satiation, they do not necessarily have sufficient time to choose the most desirable diet. Wilson's principle of stringency <b>theoretically</b> <b>supports</b> the former interpretation. It suggests that animals experience periods in their life in which they are time-constrained but that these periods are {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Most optimal foraging studies have assumed the opposite. The second point of this paper is therefore a recommendation: to consider the possibility that animals may often be released from time constraints. The third and final point is that feeding time is independent of body mass in our analysis. This is because handling time scales with body mass according to a parameter that is similar to the one for digestion time, and feeding time can be approximated by the ratio of handling time to digestion time...|$|E
