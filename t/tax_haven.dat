5|$|Nauru is a {{phosphate}} rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, , are not economically viable for extraction. Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign {{state in the}} world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> and illegal money laundering centre. From 2001 to 2008, and again from 2012, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, many sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a <b>tax</b> <b>haven.</b>|$|E

25|$|A <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> is a state, {{country or}} {{territory}} where certain taxes are levied {{at a low}} rate or not at all, which are used by businesses for tax avoidance and tax evasion. Individuals and/or corporate entities can find it attractive to move themselves to areas with reduced taxation. This creates a situation of tax competition among governments. Taxes vary substantially across jurisdictions. Sovereign states have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories, unless limited by previous international treaties. The central feature of a <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions. In its December 2008 report on the use of tax havens by American corporations, the U.S. Government Accountability Office was unable to provide a satisfactory definition of a <b>tax</b> <b>haven,</b> but regarded the following characteristics as indicative of it: nil or nominal taxes; lack of effective exchange of tax information with foreign tax authorities; lack of transparency in the operation of legislative, legal or administrative provisions; no requirement for a substantive local presence; and self-promotion as an offshore financial center.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>havens</b> have {{attracted}} increasing attention from policy-makers in recent years. This paper {{provides an overview}} of {{a growing body of research}} that analyses the consequences and determinants of the existence of tax-haven countries. For instance, recent evidence suggests that <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> tend to have stronger governance institutions than comparable non-haven countries. Most importantly, <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> provide opportunities for tax planning by multinational corporations. It is often argued that <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> erode the <b>tax</b> base of high-tax countries by attracting such corporate activity. However, while <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> host a disproportionate fraction of the world's foreign direct investment (FDI), their existence need not make high-tax countries worse off. It is possible that, under certain conditions, the existence of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> can enhance efficiency and even mitigate tax competition. Indeed, corporate tax revenues in major capital-exporting countries have exhibited robust growth, despite substantial FDI flows to <b>tax</b> <b>havens.</b> Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{endogenous growth}} model featuring <b>tax</b> <b>havens,</b> and {{uses it to}} examine how the existence of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> affects the economic growth rate and social welfare in high-tax countries. We show {{that the presence of}} <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> generates two conflicting channels in determining the growth effect. First, the public investment effect states that <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> may erode <b>tax</b> revenues and in turn decrease the government’s infrastructure expenditure, thereby reducing growth. Second, the tax planning effect of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> reduces marginal cost of capital and hence encourages capital accumulation so as to spur economic growth. The overall growth effect is ambiguous and is determined by the extent of these two effects. The welfare analysis shows that <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> {{are more likely to be}} welfare-enhancing if the government expenditure share in production is low, or the initial income tax rate is high. Moreover, the welfare-maximizing income tax rate is lower than the growth-maximizing income tax rate if <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> are present. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> and {{offshore}} financial centres have come under increasing political pressure to cooperate with other countries in matters of taxation and efforts to crowd back tax evasion and avoidance.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of tax {{competition}} for real investment and profits and show {{that the presence of}} <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> in some cases increases the tax revenue of countries. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we argue that tax competition for profits is likely to be imperfect in the sense that the jurisdiction with the lowest tax rate does not necessarily attract all shifted profits. Under this assumption, tax competition between a large number of identical countries may lead to either a symmetric equilibrium with no profit shifting or an asymmetric equilibrium where firms shift profits from high-tax to low-tax countries. In the second part of the paper, we introduce <b>tax</b> <b>havens.</b> Starting from a symmetric equilibrium, <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> unambiguously reduce the tax revenue of countries due to a 'leakage effect' [...] <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> attract <b>tax</b> base from countries [...] and a 'competition effect' [...] the optimal response to the increased tax sensitivity of tax bases involves a reduction of tax rates. Starting from an asymmetric equilibrium, however, <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> also raise the tax revenue of countries through a 'crowding effect' [...] <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> make it less attractive to compete for profits and thus induce low-tax countries to become high-tax countries. We demonstrate that the latter effect may dominate the former effects so that countries, on balance, benefit from the presence of <b>tax</b> <b>havens.</b> <b>Tax</b> competition Profit shifting <b>Tax</b> <b>havens...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{the issue}} of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> has risen to the fore of the fiscal policy debate, with <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> being singled out as {{the root cause of}} many of the fiscal {{shortfalls}} plaguing the governments of the world. Surprisingly, however, although there has been a fair amount of literature on why <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> are harmful to the modern international tax regime, which countries become <b>tax</b> <b>havens,</b> and what means are available to combat <b>tax</b> <b>havens,</b> there has been less written specifically on the underlying question of why, notwithstanding all these points, <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> exist in the first place, or why they persist {{in the face of such}} overwhelming criticism. This Article will fill that gap by directly confronting the question: why are there <b>tax</b> <b>havens?</b> To this end, this Article will propose for the first time that the focus of the international tax laws of wealthier countries, such as the United States, on capital neutrality—or making the flow of capital across borders easier and cheaper—can actually create or exacerbate the incentives necessary for poorer countries to act as <b>tax</b> <b>havens.</b> This can be thought of as a “capital neutrality paradox” in that it is the pursuit of capital neutrality—meant to increase worldwide efficiency—which leads to more countries acting as <b>tax</b> <b>havens,</b> effectively undermining worldwide efficiency. Consequently, punishing such countries in response would also prove counterproductive, because it would only exacerbate these incentives created by U. S. law in the first place. This “punishment paradox” in connection with the “capital neutrality paradox” can fundamentally alter the way in which the law should conceptualize and respond to {{the issue of}} <b>tax</b> <b>havens.</b> Rather than ask “why are there tax havens?”, the question would become “why pursue capital neutrality?” Rather than ask “what can we do to punish tax havens?”, the question would become “would punishment be effective?” Such an approach could not only lead to a more efficient international tax regime, but could also be the first step to finally answering the question of why there are <b>tax</b> <b>havens...</b>|$|R
