40|$|This study {{investigated}} the elastic elongation and elastic recovery of the elastic warp knittedfabric made of PET(polyethylene terephthalate) and PBT(polybutylene terephthalate) filament. Using 50 / 24 F PET and 50 D/ 24 F PBT in two threadingbars, the tricot, locknit and satin warp knitted fabrics were produced on the E 28 <b>tricot</b> warpknitting <b>machine.</b> The knitting parameters influencing the elastic elongation under 100 N wereanalyzed in terms of fabric structure, yarn run-in speed and drawing density set on machine. Besides, dyeing temperature and heat setting temperature/time were also examined in order toretain proper elastic elongation and elastic recovery. The relationship between elastic elongationand knitting parameter and finishing parameter were analyzed. Finally, the elastic recovery ofPET/PBT warp knitted fabric was examined to demonstrate the elastic property of final finishedfabric. This study could help us to further exploit the use of PET/PBT warp knitted fabric in thedevelopment of elastic garment in future...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objects are}} {{to find the}} {{velocity}} and the acceleration of the cam roller after the jumping at the cam roller {{and the strength of}} the guide springs of the <b>tricot</b> <b>machine.</b> We know the following things, i. e, if we assume the initial contact strength at the contact between the cam and cam roller and assume the strength of cam roller spring, we can find the strength of the guide spring...|$|E
40|$|The cams {{which is}} used in the {{knitting}} parts of the <b>tricot</b> <b>machine</b> is a complex type 	having two definite functions brought about by the front and back rollers which follow the 	two faces of the composit cam. The first function is to lead the thread and the second is 	to prevent the vibration. 	The author analysing thus elucidated in the present paper the cause of the vibration 	finding the value of Coriolis' functional acceleration equation...|$|E
40|$|Polypropylene {{monofilament}} {{is selected}} to fabricate the mesh used for hernia repair, and the mesh is warp knitted on a <b>Tricot</b> <b>machine</b> with a compound needle (gauge E 18); an atlas structure is used. The mesh with 18 to 20 courses per centimetre {{has the best}} mecha-nical properties. The heat-setting conditions are confirmed {{on the basis of}} trials. It can be concluded that the heat-setting temperature between 125 °C to 128 °C and the time between 5 to 8 minutes benefit the mechanical properties of the mesh...|$|E
40|$|There {{are great}} needs at {{present for the}} {{improvement}} of the eccentric knitting mechanisms 	in the <b>tricot</b> <b>machine</b> in which difficul ties are being found in the high speed running 	because of the strong vibration and the inertia forces that are actuated by the clearances and 	the weights of the followers and cams. 	The author， according， tried {{to get rid of the}} present difficulty and calculated the 	magnitudes and the directions of the acceleration of the eccentric by the analytical and graphical 	method using the determinant and complex variable equations...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{predicting}} the runner length, that is, {{the length of}} warp yarn required to knit 480 courses on two bar <b>tricot</b> <b>machine,</b> is presented here by using {{a model of the}} critical tensile state, which was established in an analysis for the biaxial tensile deformations of warp-knitted fabrics. By comparing some calculations using this model with experimental measurements, it has been found that this method gives better result in practice than Grosberg's model. The effects of the yarn thickness on the calculation of the runner length are examined, and the result shows that a short diameter of closest packing of yarn is more adequate for the prediction...|$|E
