5|$|The {{failure of}} Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 underscored the {{requirement}} for a new long-range, high-speed, vertical-takeoff aircraft for the United States Department of Defense. In response, the Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. A partnership between Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the V-22 <b>tiltrotor</b> aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties {{of being the first}} <b>tiltrotor</b> for military service led to many years of development.|$|E
5|$|The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, <b>tiltrotor</b> {{military}} aircraft with both vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. It {{is designed to}} combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The PT6C is a 1600 to 2300 {{horsepower}} (1190 to 1720 kW) {{engine for}} helicopters and <b>tiltrotors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Transverse rotors are pair of {{counter-rotating}} rotors {{mounted at}} each end of the wings or outrigger structures. They are found on <b>tiltrotors</b> and some earlier helicopters.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} concepts, {{based on}} using open airscrew(s) for VTOL maneuvers, are re-examined {{in light of}} current technology: (1) tip-driven helicopters, (2) compound helicopters; and (3) high-speed VTOL aircraft, represented by <b>tiltrotors,</b> tiltwings, retractoplanes and stoppable rotors. Criteria, permitting one to compare performance of aircraft using diverse lifting and propelling methods are established. Determination of currently possible performance, indication of near-future potentials, and comparison of those items with the baseline levels (as represented by contemporary shaft-driven helicopters, first generation <b>tiltrotors,</b> and commercial turboprop fixed-wind aircraft) constitutes bulk of this report...|$|R
5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, <b>tiltrotor</b> aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
5|$|The 27th Special Operations Wing (27 SOW) {{is located}} at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. Its primary mission {{includes}} infiltration, exfiltration and re-supply of special operations forces; air refueling of special operations rotary wing and <b>tiltrotor</b> aircraft; and precision fire support. These capabilities support a variety of special operations missions including direct action, unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, personnel recovery, psychological operations and information operations.|$|E
5|$|The United States Marine Corps began crew {{training}} for the Osprey in 2000, and fielded it in 2007; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The Osprey's other operator, the U.S. Air Force, fielded their version of the <b>tiltrotor</b> in 2009. Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medevac operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Kuwait.|$|E
5000|$|Ducted {{fans can}} {{allow for a}} limited amount of thrust vectoring, {{something}} normal propellers are not well suited for. This allows them to be used instead of <b>tiltrotors</b> in some applications.|$|R
50|$|The Army {{issued a}} draft request for {{proposals}} for the CIRCM contract in May 2009, opening the competitive phase for a deal to develop and install the missile jammer on thousands of helicopters and <b>tiltrotors</b> in US military inventory.|$|R
50|$|A related {{technology}} {{development is the}} tiltwing. Although two designs, the Canadair CL-84 Dynavert and the LTV XC-142, were technical successes, neither entered production due to other issues. <b>Tiltrotors</b> generally have better hover efficiency than tiltwings, but less than helicopters.|$|R
5|$|Four {{years later}} {{after the events}} of , Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her clones lead the assault to attack Umbrella HQ, located in Tokyo, slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who escapes in a <b>tiltrotor</b> plane and detonates a bomb that leaves a massive sinkhole. The real Alice boarded {{beforehand}} and attempts to execute Wesker, only for him to injects her with an Anti-Virus to remove her superhuman abilities. Wesker is revealed to have used the T-Virus to gain his own superhuman abilities and prepares to kill Alice, before the autopilot crashes the plane into the mountains and only Alice survives.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} AgustaWestland and Lockheed Martin was {{selected}} as the winners of the US VXX competition to replace the President's Marine One helicopters of the United States Marine Corps. A variant of the AW101, designated VH-71 Kestrel, was to be manufactured domestically and had proceeded into the flight testing stages. However the programme encountered significant cost overruns and political opposition, which led to the procurement being scrapped in June 2009. Separately, the Marine Corps had also conducted studies into the adoption of the EH101 as a fallback option to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey <b>tiltrotor</b> during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Since March 2000, VMMT-204 has {{conducted}} Marine Corps crew {{training for the}} V-22. On 3 June 2005, Marine Corps helicopter squadron Marine Medium Helicopter 263 (HMM-263) stood down to transition to the MV-22. On 8 December 2005, Lieutenant General James Amos, commander of II Marine Expeditionary Force, accepted delivery of the first fleet of MV-22s, delivered to HMM-263. The unit reactivated on 3 March 2006 as the first MV-22 squadron, redesignated as VMM-263. On 23 March 2007, HMM-266 became Marine Medium <b>Tiltrotor</b> Squadron 266 (VMM-266) at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina.|$|E
50|$|This {{condition}} also {{occurs with}} <b>tiltrotors,</b> and {{was responsible for}} an accident involving a V-22 Osprey. Vortex ring state caused {{the loss of a}} heavily modified MH-60 helicopter during Operation Neptune Spear, the 2011 raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed.|$|R
40|$|Rotorcraft (helicopters and <b>tiltrotors)</b> are {{generally}} reliable flying machines capable of fulfilling missions impossible with fixed-wing aircraft, most notably rescue operations. These missions, however, {{often lead to}} high and sometimes excessive pilot workload. Although high standards in terms of safety are imposed in helicopter design, studies sho...|$|R
25|$|Many of MAG-41 units {{deployed}} in the Global War on Terror to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2009 helicopters returned to MAG-41 when they took over responsibility for HMM-764 Moonlight after MAG-46 cased its colors. HMM-764 transitioned from the CH-46E Seaknights (Phrogs Phoever) to MV-22B Ospreys in January 2013 bringing <b>tiltrotors</b> to the Marine Reserve Aviation for the first time.|$|R
5|$|The {{defining}} {{mission of}} the Marine Corps has been to perform an amphibious landing, and they were {{particularly interested in the}} JVX program. They realized that a concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal; and their CH-46s were wearing out; without replacement, the threat of a merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered, similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II. The OSD and Navy administration were against the <b>tiltrotor</b> project, but congressional pressure eventually proved persuasive.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} {{the wreckage of}} the XR-1A at a price of 4 cents per pound. Leavitt had formed a new company, Helicopter Air Transport, intending to provide helicopter flight training in anticipation of a postwar aviation boom, and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition. The projected boom failed to materialise, however, and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy, Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki, another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company. Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns, and used the airframe {{in the development of the}} PA-2B, a planned <b>tiltrotor</b> which failed to proceed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} <b>tiltrotor</b> aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E
50|$|An ESG is {{composed}} of an Amphibious Assault Ship (LHA/LHD), a Dock Landing Ship (LSD), an Amphibious transport dock (LPD), a Marine expeditionary unit, AV-8B Harrier II aircraft, CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters and CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters or, more recently, MV-22B <b>tiltrotors.</b> Cruisers, destroyers and attack submarines are deployed with either an Expeditionary Strike Group or a carrier strike group.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{building}} Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft using helicopter-like rotors at the wingtips {{originated in the}} 1930s. The first design resembling modern <b>tiltrotors</b> was patented by George Lehberger in May 1930, {{but he did not}} develop the concept further. In World War II, a German prototype called the Focke-Achgelis FA-269 was developed starting in 1942, but it never flew.|$|R
50|$|V: V/STOL. A Vertical and/or Short Takeoff and Landing {{aircraft}} {{is designed}} to take-off and land vertically, but not rely on rotary-wing lift for flight. This includes vectored thrust aircraft such as the AV-8 Harrier and <b>tiltrotors</b> such as the V-22 Osprey. It also applies to aircraft of the normal fixed-wing configuration {{that are capable of}} taking off and landing in a short runway space, such as the OV-10 Bronco.|$|R
5|$|Animators created digital {{versions}} of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures of the practical suits. Imageworks received pieces of the suits for reference. The company's library of reflection data on various materials helped enhance the armor's shading. SPI's crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film's drop ships, barracks and mess halls, replaced the existing aircraft. Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given {{that the city is}} a no-fly zone, Framestore's artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane parked in the Louvre courtyard. The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad <b>TiltRotor.</b> Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a gimbal set to depict the plane used by Cage's squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart in a realistic way during the crashes.|$|E
25|$|The Bell Boeing Quad <b>TiltRotor</b> (QTR) is a {{proposed}} four-rotor derivative of the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey <b>tiltrotor</b> developed jointly by Bell Helicopter and Boeing. The concept is a contender in the U.S. Army's Joint Heavy Lift program. It {{would have a}} cargo capacity roughly equivalent to the C-130 Hercules, cruise at 250 knots, and land at unimproved sites vertically like a helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Similar to <b>tiltrotor</b> concept, {{but with}} {{turbojet}} or turbofan engines instead of ones with propellers.|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{new class of}} aircraft - the Advanced Theater Transport (ATT) will combine strategic range and high payload with 'Super-STOL' (short take-off and landing) capability. It is also proposed to modify a YC- 15 into a technology demonstrator with a 20 -deg tilt wing; four, eight-bladed propellers; cross-shafted gearboxes and V- 22 engines. These constitute a unique combination of design features that potentially affect performance, loads and whirl-mode stability (whirl flutter). NASA Ames Research Center is working with Boeing and Hamilton Sundstrand on technology challenges presented by the concept; the purpose of NASA involvement is to establish requirements for the demonstrator and for early design guidance, with emphasis on whirl flutter. CAMRAD II {{is being used to}} study the effects of various design features on whirl flutter, with special attention to areas where such features differ from existing aircraft, notably <b>tiltrotors.</b> Although the stability margins appear to be more than adequate, the concept requires significantly different analytical methods, principally including far more blade modes, than typically used for <b>tiltrotors...</b>|$|R
50|$|Powered lift types rely on engine-derived lift for {{vertical}} takeoff {{and landing}} (VTOL). Most types transition to fixed-wing lift for horizontal flight. Classes of powered lift types include VTOL jet aircraft (such as the Harrier jump-jet) and <b>tiltrotors</b> (such as the V-22 Osprey), among others. A few experimental designs rely entirely on engine thrust to provide lift {{throughout the whole}} flight, including personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks. VTOL research designs include the flying Bedstead.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a mini tilt-rotor {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle which is capable to perform hover flight. Unlike conventional full-scale <b>tiltrotors,</b> in our design we avoid the use of swashplate and we propose a simpler mechanical design which use only the tilting rotors to stabilize the vehicle dynamics. A detailed mathematical model is derived via the Newton-Euler formalism. A nonlinear control scheme, incorporating bounded smooth function, is obtained from the decoupled dynamics and applied to real prototype for controlling hover flight. 1...|$|R
25|$|The BA609 drew on {{experience}} gained from Bell's earlier experimental <b>tiltrotor,</b> the XV-15. In 1996, Bell and Boeing {{had formed a}} partnership to develop a civil <b>tiltrotor</b> aircraft; however, in March 1998, {{it was announced that}} Boeing had pulled out of the project. In September 1998, it was announced that Agusta had become a partner in the development program. This led to the establishment of the Bell/Agusta Aerospace Company (BAAC), a joint venture between Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland, to develop and manufacture the aircraft. The Italian government subsidized Agusta's development of a military <b>tiltrotor,</b> and as the AW609 has civilian aspects, the European Commission requires AgustaWestland to pay back progressive amounts per aircraft to the Italian state to avoid a distortion of competition. , Bell continues to perform contract work on the AW609 program while considering commercial potential for the bigger V-280 <b>tiltrotor,</b> where military production may reach larger numbers and hence reduce unit cost. However, in 2016, Bell preferred the 609 for commercial applications and kept the V-280 for military use only. Bell also stated that conventional helicopters were not part of Bell's future for military customers.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tiltrotor</b> or proprotor tilts its {{propellers}} or rotors vertically for VTOL {{and then}} tilts them forwards for horizontal wing-borne flight, while the main wing remains fixed in place.|$|E

25|$|On 23 October 2015, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force {{selected}} the KC-46 as their new tanker, with {{a contract for}} three tankers expected in 2016. The decision allows for common operations and training with the USAF, and Japan was reportedly attracted to its capability to refuel MV-22 Osprey <b>tiltrotors</b> the JASDF will soon receive. Airbus declined to bid their A330 MRTT, because they viewed Japan's request for proposals as intended for the KC-46.

2500|$|The aircraft's {{purpose is}} to take off and land vertically, but fly faster than a helicopter. Over 45 {{different}} aircraft [...] have flown proving VTOL and STOL capabilities, of which the V-22, Harrier, Yak-38 and F-35 jets have proceeded to production. By 2008, Bell had estimated that very light jets and large offshore helicopters like the Sikorsky S-92 had reduced the potential market for <b>tiltrotors.</b> Also in 2008, {{it was reported that}} limited funding of the program by both Bell and AgustaWestland had resulted in slow flight testing progress.|$|R
