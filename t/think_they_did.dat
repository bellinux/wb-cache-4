Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything, either, and write from {{a place where they}} didn't understand it. [...] I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. And you could tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry." ...|$|E
500|$|Andre Ethier, Russell Martin and Wilson Valdez {{managed to}} each earn three hits each during the Dodgers game. Ethier {{hit a home}} run which drove in the first four runs of the season for the Dodgers, who stole five bases — their most since August 23, 1999 when they stole seven in a game at Milwaukee. [...] "It's kind of cool to have a decent game on Jackie Robinson Day," [...] Martin said. [...] "I’m going to {{remember}} this probably {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] Randy Wolf, who was playing for the Dodgers at the time (currently a free agent) allowed six hits and three runs in six innings and struck out seven. [...] "The whole team wearing No. 42, it kind of goes sour if we don’t win," [...] Wolf said. [...] "It was great. There were a lot of special people here. It's a special day and I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it right." [...] The San Diego Padres' José Cruz, Jr. hit his 200th career home run.|$|E
500|$|The tone poem premiered on 4June 1914 at [...] "The Shed" [...] {{concert hall}} of the Norfolk Music Festival, Sibelius himself {{conducting}} at a podium decorated in the American and Finnish national colors. The orchestra, which Sibelius praised as [...] "wonderful... surpasses anything we have in Europe", comprised musicians drawn from three of America's best music societies: the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The Oceanides was unlike anything the musicians had previously encountered. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not understand it all at first from what they said", Stoeckel recalled. [...] "The next morning, after having run it through three times, they were thoroughly delighted with it and remarked that {{the beauty of the}} music grew with each rehearsal". The festival public sounded a similarly positive note about the new piece, which concluded a concert of Sibelius's music that included Pohjola's Daughter, the King Christian II Suite, The Swan of Tuonela, Finlandia, and Valse triste. Stoeckel recounts the events of 4June: ...|$|E

500|$|While Green Day {{was nearing}} {{completion}} of Warning, the band {{announced it would}} be performing on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour during the summer before the album's October release. Although the group {{had been invited to}} perform on the tour before, the band was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts. Because of Green Day's new stylistic change displayed on Warning, the band was considered an unconventional choice for the tour. Jason White, guitarist for Armstrong's side project Pinhead Gunpowder, was recruited to perform with the band to add [...] "more power" [...] to the group's sound; White observed that [...] "Even I was like, 'Why are Green Day on the Warped Tour?'". Fat Mike of NOFX recalled, [...] "They were the biggest band on the tour but it wasn't by far. [...] Green Day weren't super popular at that time. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the Warped tour because they wanted to get popular again." [...] He also went on to call Warning [...] "probably their worst album, I think. It's what happens, the ups and downs." [...] However, Joel Madden of Good Charlotte, whose 2002 release The Young and the Hopeless outsold Warning, opined that [...] "I was definitely aware that our record at the time sold more maybe than their record but I think we idolized them so much that it didn't matter. [...] We thought Warning was one of their best records." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{explained}} that {{in developing the}} relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of the season four finale, with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it.

2500|$|In May 2009, Yusuf Islam {{stated that}} the song {{is very similar to}} his song [...] "Foreigner Suite," [...] {{recorded}} under his former stage name, Cat Stevens. He said [...] "My son brought it to my attention and said: 'Doesn't that sound like 'Foreigner Suite?'" [...] Islam said that any legal action he might take [...] "depends on how well Satriani does." [...] Coldplay drummer Will Champion denied the claim, stating, [...] "We're confident we haven't done anything wrong." [...] In June 2009, Islam later said, [...] "They did copy my song but I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it on purpose," [...] adding, [...] "I don't want them to think I am angry with them. I'd love to sit down and have a cup of tea with them and let them know it's okay." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark {{became the}} first {{mainstream}} soap character to be diagnosed as HIV-positive. The storyline came after a government request to [...] "spread the word". Mark's story also helped dispel the myth that HIV is an automatic death sentence. He lived with the condition for 13 years before dying of an AIDS related illness. The Terrence Higgins Trust worked with the production team {{for the duration of}} Mark's story. Despite all the public health campaigns concerning HIV transmission, the biggest peak in requests for testing in Britain was seen in January 1991 when Mark Fowler was diagnosed HIV-positive. Carty has commented: [...] "I feel that the storyline educated people {{at a time when there}} were lots of misconceptions about HIV and AIDS…My main concern was that they'd get it right and, overall, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> - because it showed someone living with HIV, as opposed to dying of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nina Wadia has praised Womack and Wallace {{for their}} [...] "acting skills" [...] during the storyline. Wadia told The Sun: [...] "Sam and Jessie were amazing {{and it all}} got taken away from them because people made it out like a real baby had died. It's a soap. It's portraying fictional characters!" [...] Marc Elliott added: [...] "The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not {{representative}} in any way, shape or form of mothers {{who have lost their}} babies." [...] EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its [...] "great acting". In an interview with Take It Easy, asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> I know there's been loads of bad press, but something like that {{is always going to be}} sad to watch and it will upset people. But at the end of the day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped and snatched in hospitals. I'm sure that any parent who has lost a child will find even talking about their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since its release, [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] {{has been}} covered on {{numerous}} occasions. In 2002, Dynamite Boy covered {{the song in}} a punk rock version for the Punk Goes Pop series. American musician Ryan Adams performed the song live several times starting in 1999, although his performance featured a bit of sarcasm. Selena Gomez & the Scene cover the song on their House of Blue Tour. British boyband JLS performed the song and [...] "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)", along with two NSYNC songs, in a medley on their tour [...] "JLS Tour", in support of their second album Outta This World. Psychedelic rock band Vanilla Fudge covered it on their album The Return. In 2010, Steel Panther covered the song on a few live shows and released the single as a download in the UK, supposedly {{as a result of}} a bet. In 2013, the Glee Cast covered the song on the episode [...] "Feud" [...] as a mashup with NSYNC's [...] "Bye Bye Bye". In 2013, Charli XCX performed a cover live at the Borderline Music in Chicago. The singer-songwriter also performed a version of the song in August 2013 for The A.V. Club A.V. Undercover series. Also in 2013, British boy-band One Direction performed a cover of the song during their Take Me Home Tour, live at a Stockholm, Sweden concert. Backstreet Boys member Howie D approved the cover, saying, [...] "It’s nice to see groups like that pay homage to us. We definitely paid homage to groups in the earlier days that we admired So it’s cool. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> a great job. It seemed like it went over really well." ...|$|E
