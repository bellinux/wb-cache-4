A supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer who faces a newsvendor problem is considered.

Then, we construct menus of <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariff</b> contract offered by the retailer to the supplier who has production capacity manipulation and type dependent reservation profits.

40|$|When a firm {{operates}} {{in an industry}} with very large differences in consumers' willingness {{to pay for the}} service it offers, it faces a challenge in the pricing decision. It wants to engage in price discrimination, but cannot identify a given consumer's market segment ex ante. When consumers' willingness to pay is private information, a widely used sorting mechanism is to offer a menu of two part tariffs, letting high demand and low demand consumers self-select into distinct market segments by their tariff choice. However, when the difference in consumers' willingness to pay is very large, simple two part tariffs are not longer sufficient to discriminate between high and low demand segments; Despite the ability to price discriminate, the firm still prefers to serve high demand consumers only. The model suggests that {{it might be possible to}} discriminate between consumers by other means than price-cost distortions; Low demand consumers face a <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariff</b> with a per unit price possibly above marginal cost, together with a restriction on usage, whereas high demand consumers face an efficient <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariff...</b>|$|E

In particular, we find that price per unit can exceed marginal costs, and the fixed fee can be below costs if the firms are forced to serve all consumers. We also show that <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariffs</b> may collapse, because each firm would rather commit to a traditional Cournot price system (zero fixed fee).

In accordance with interconnection fee, the price determination depends on the types of competition. In symmetric competition and linear pricing, the price would be high because of the penchant of collusion and interconnection fee should be high. The opposite results occur when non linear pricing (<b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariff)</b> is applied because all companies set the interconnection fee close to marginal cost. In asymmetric competition, the price tends to be low. However, the lowness of price caused by the application of predatory pricing by incumbent company and interconnection fee equals with marginal cost.

However, strategic reactions of both manufacturers and retailers are missing in empirical analyses. Rather, passive pricing is assumed. Ignoring strategic pricing might lead to under-estimate or over-estimate the impact of food taxation. Based on the example of the soft drink industry, we analyse the bias which is introduced when assuming passive pricing. Using structural econometric model, we first estimate models of vertical relationships between the beverage industry and the retail industry. After selecting the âbestâ model of vertical relationships, we then simulate different scenrios of input cost changes or final products taxation. Our results indicate that assuming passive pricing by firms leads to under-estimate the impact on food consumption. In our example, the under-estimation amounts to 15 % for regular products and 50 % for diet ones when contracts between manufacturers and retailers are not taken into account. We thus conclude that for empirical analysis of food price policies for better health, considering strategic pricing is a key issue. vertical contracts, <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariffs,</b> competition, manufacturers, private labels, retailers, differentiated products, soft drinks, non nested tests, sugar CMO, passthrough, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Health Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} current {{questions}} regarding the functionality of liberalized electricity markets are studied addressing different topics of interest in two main directions: market power and competition policy on electricity wholesale markets, and network investments and incentive regulation.

First an optimization model is designed to obtain the competitive benchmark which can be compared to the observed market outcomes between 2004 and 2006. In a second step the horizontal breaking up of dominant firms (divestiture) is simulated applying equilibrium techniques (the classical Cournot approach and the Supply Function Equilibrium approach).

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} optimal pricing {{for access}} to essential facilities in a competitive environment. The focus is on investment incentive issues arising from regulation under complete information. To that end, examining the provision of a natural monopoly infrastructure with unlimited capacity, it is shown that the fixed component of a regulated access price can be structured so as to induce a ârace â between market participants to provide the infrastructure. An appropriate pricing formula can ensure that a single firm chooses to invest at the socially optimal time (taking into account producer and consumer surplus) despite the immediate access granted to rivals and the non-existence of government subsidies. Under the optimal pricing formula, firms choose their investment timing based on their desire to pre-empt their rivals.

A user applications are characterized by its received rate which {{is a function of the}} allocated spectrum, its link gain to the SP and the transmit power spectral density. The SP obtains the net spectrum requested by all the users from a central clearinghouse. The SP charges the users a <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariff</b> consisting of a fixed subscription fee and variable usage cost and pays the clearinghouse a spectrum cost. The SP also incurs a cost proportional to the power it transmits to all the users.

40|$|This {{deliverable}} {{consists in}} principle of <b>two</b> parts; one <b>part</b> with {{a review of}} the literature around maritime infrastructure cost with a focus on fairways (section 3), pilotage (section 4) and ports (section 5) and another part with an in-depth study on the Baltic icebreaking fleet (section 6). Our main conclusion from the first part is that all these parts of the infrastructure (fairways, pilotage and ports) show significant economies of scale. A long run marginal cost pricing strategy will never recover the cost and a short run pricing strategy (including user costs) will have problems with cost recovery if the capacity utilisation is low. The pricing strategies observed seem to use numerous forms of <b>two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariffs</b> and "Ramsey" pricing solutions to solve the cost recovery issue of the sector. The consequence of all these (small) deviations from marginal cost pricing should probably be further analysed. The second part deals with icebreaking and notes that icebreaking in open water is not charged for by any EU Member State. Still the case study reported in this paper shows that the operation is characterised by considerable marginal costs. Finally, a relevant question to address is to what extent there are justifications for European or international legislation on maritime charging in the light of economic theory. Obviously, it is useful to address different parts of the maritime infrastructure separately. CATRIN - Cost allocation of transport infrastructure cos...|$|R
40|$|Ownership matters. It affects {{residual}} {{rights under}} incomplete contracts and, therefore, incentives. The {{first chapter of}} this thesis analyzes in how far ownership can be substituted by other economic factors. Contrary to an assumption {{found in the literature}} market foreclosure can be achieved without vertical integration in the following scenarios: repeated games, reputation games, and also in a finitely repeated game when there are switching costs. The main chapter is concerned with implications of ownership in regulated industries where a monopolistic supplier of an essential input is required by a regulator to charge cost based prices. Our analysis focuses on the impact of ownership on the monopolist's incentives to exploit informational asymmetries about production costs. We conduct a comparative study of vertical integration, vertical separation, and joint ownership. Effects on welfare, investments incentives, and entry are analyzed for each ownership structure. Joint ownership performs best. Accounting separation is shown to be generally ineffective as regulatory instrument. We use an alternative model which allows to take into account network duplication. Starting from a free market analysis of equilibrium pricing and entry decisions we explore the relation between ownership and the degree of regulation required in order to ensure efficient outcomes. <b>Two</b> <b>part</b> <b>tariffs,</b> network duplication, price discrimination and a long-term commitment to fixed input prices induce reductions of final prices. The final part of this thesis investigates results in the theory of competitive market equilibrium. Many of these results rely on restrictive assumptions on consumer behaviour.

We do not assume agents to be rational in the sense that their choices arise from maximisation.

At the same moment, a reform of the Common Organisation of the Sugar Market will lead to a decrease by more than 30 % of the sugar price in the EU. Using the example of the soft drink industry, this paper investigates the impact of that reform on the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages. Because the soft drink industry as well as the retail industry are both highly concentrated, using structural econometrics model, we first estimate models of vertical relationships between the beverage industry and the retail industry. After selecting the âbestâ model of vertical relationships, we then simulate the impact of the decrease in sugar price on prices and consumption for different categories of consumers. We also study the impact of setting taxes on soft drink as it was recently proposed in order to counterbalance the impact of the sugar policy reform. Using French data on the Soft Drinks purchases, we find that this reform could decrease prices by 5 % and increase market shares of regular products by 8 % that would rise the consumption of regular soft drink by more than 1 liter per year and per person. The increase in per person consumption is larger in households composed of overweight and obese individuals. A tax of 6 cents on high sugar content products and 3 cents on low sugar content products might more than annihilate the effect of the sugar price decrease. In average, the combination of the sugar policy reform and the additional tax might provoke {{a decrease in}} the average consumption of regular soft drinks by and would fall the consumption of regular soft drinks by about 1. 9 liters per person.

40|$|In {{wastewater}} management big variations in flowrates, caused by precipitation, leads to high peak loads forcing treatment facilities to maintain large over capacity. Wastewater management is a capital-intensive industry, meaning that new investments are costly and {{should therefore be}} avoided. But as peak load levels increase and stricter regulations are imposed it becomes increasingly hard to maintain sufficient reduction rates and facilities are likely to face new investments if the highest flowrates canât be reduced. One way to reduce flowrates is to charge higher prices for the peak loads through an efficient tariff design. This thesis includes a literature review to define what constitutes an efficient tariff and then moves on to develop a model including marginal cost pricing and increasing block tariff design that examine how the marginal cost price is affected by constructing the tariff in different ways.

P. acanthamoebae is a putative emerging agent of community-acquired and inhalation pneumonia that may enter and multiply within human macrophages. However, since Parachlamydia induces their apoptosis, macrophages may not represent a perennial niche for this obligate intracellular bacterium. Therefore, we investigated whether pneumocytes and lung fibroblasts are permissive to Parachlamydia infection and might act as a replicative niche. Entry of Parachlamydia into pneumocytes (A 549) and lung fibroblasts (HEL) was confirmed by confocal and electron microscopy. In A 549 cells, the mean number of Parachlamydia per cell increased 7 -fold from day 0 to day 7, independently of the technique used to label the bacteria. The proportion of infected A 549 cells also increased over time, whereas cell viability remained unaffected by Parachlamydia infection. The sustained (3 weeks) viability of Parachlamydia when incubated in the presence of A 549 cells contrasted with that observed in the absence of cells. HEL cells were also permissive to Parachlamydia infection, as we observed a 3 - to 4 -fold increase in the mean number of bacteria per cell. In HEL cells, Parachlamydia retained some viability for 2 weeks. These findings demonstrate that Parachlamydia is able to enter and multiply within pneumocytes and fibroblasts. The viability of both cell types was not compromised after Parachlamydia infection. We therefore conclude that these cells may remain infected for a prolonged time and may represent an intrapulmonary niche for the strictly intracellular Parachlamydia. This indirectly supports the role of Parachlamydia as an agent of pneumonia...|$|E
40|$|The {{mainstay}} of the public transport system in Kerala is the private stage carriages (PSC), the economics of operation {{of which is the}} subject of this paper. The long run sustainability of the sector depends on the full recovery of costs. In the presence of fixed costs, there are various approaches to the full recovery of costs and Kerala has taken the approach of regular fare revision ostensibly to cover costs based on committee recommendations. Since 1999, fares are being revised on the basis of the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre's price index for stage carriage operations (PISCO) applicable in Kerala, which, it is argued here, is one of the causes of the poor sustainability of the industry. PISCO uses average kilometers run and average concessional load factor in the computation of fares, which leads to a situation of those running above average kilometers, and carrying below average concessional load factor making above average profits and others not covering their costs. The use of weighted load factor raises general fares with the travelling public, and not the society at large, subsidizing the concessional passengers. One of the solutions to this problem lies, firstly in moving over to <b>two</b> - <b>part</b> <b>tariff</b> and secondly to tax financing of student subsidy.

40|$|The {{existing}} literature about exclusive dealing contracts {{has focused on}} cases where an incumbent manufacturer offers exclusive contracts to deter an entry. In contrast, we consider the case where an incumbent distributor offers exclusive dealing contracts to deter an entry. Exclusive dealing contracts by a distributor are less effective. We will show that the outcome of such contracts {{is quite different from}} the outcomes in the traditional literature. If the number of manufacturers is sufficiently high, it is impossible to exclude an efficient entry. Furthermore, if we allow two- <b>part</b> <b>tariff</b> contracts, the entrant distributor can enter the market for any number of manufacturer...|$|R
