25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E
500|$|The stage {{version of}} Our Friends in the North {{was seen by}} BBC {{television}} drama producer Michael Wearing in Newcastle in 1982, and he was immediately keen on producing a television adaptation. At that time, Wearing was based at the BBC English Regions Drama Department at BBC Birmingham, which had a specific remit for making [...] "regional drama", and had established his reputation by producing Alan Bleasdale's Boys from the Blackstuff in 1982. Wearing initially approached Flannery to adapt his play into a four-part television serial for BBC Two, with each episode being 50 minutes long and the Rhodesian strand dropped for practical reasons. A change of executives meant that the project did not reach production, however, Wearing persisted in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> commissioned. Flannery extended the serial to six episodes, one for each United Kingdom general election from 1964 to 1979. However, by {{this point in the}} mid-1980s, Michael Grade was Director of Programmes for BBC Television, and he had no interest in the project.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the family}} can call it a day, they arrive home and find Amber and Ginger waiting in their driveway. Amber shows Marge and the kids video footage of a drunk Homer marrying Amber in Vegas, while Ginger is next door with the widowed Ned Flanders. Homer tries to get his {{marriage}} to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up getting its doorway stuck to his head and spends {{the rest of the}} night <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> off. The next day, Marge finds Homer asleep amid the broken remains of the doghouse, and she tells Homer that she is still angry at Homer over what he did, but she has a plan to get Amber out of their house.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Bhasker, {{one of the}} song's producers, {{explained}} the track's roots as it [...] "came {{in the middle of}} the process of putting together the album". He further elaborated; [...] "We were just having a jam session, tracking some things, and Bruno started playing this groove and making up something on the spot; we all thought it was pretty good. We wound up working a long time on that, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> just right." [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] began as a [...] "cha-cha-style duet, à la Santana's [...] "Smooth"." [...] Ronson asked the Dap-Kings to collaborate on the track in order to get a [...] "crisply syncopated, locked-in groove." [...] Regarding the song, Mars says [...] "Man, there's a good pocket on this song right now. Let's keep it going." [...] He also mentioned that it took a long time to create it, commenting [...] "People didn't see us going at each other's throats in the studio and pulling out our hair." [...] He added, [...] "Trying to get these drums right and figure out a bass line." [...] Lawrence believes the lack of [...] "heavy hitting drums" [...] and the presence of a small guitar solo allows the song to be carried by Mars.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{received}} everyday {{playing time}} in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, {{and in the}} outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I told myself to start using my legs so I didn't blow my arm out or anything like that. But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Faulkner and Randall {{explained}} {{the game was}} still utilizing the Omen Engine, with Faulkner saying of programming for the PlayStation 2 [...] "The PS2 is certainly good at pushing polys, no doubt about that. And the two vector processors can handle the physics and geometry we have with room to spare. The trick is the video memory, mainly. All of the cool visual features, like a high-res framebuffer, FSAA and high-res textures all {{take a lot of}} video memory. It's a real juggling act <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> to do all that at once." [...] Faulkner explained [...] "the PS2 math capabilities are like Intel's SSE, but on steroids. The math processors can be used to optimize any kind of math operations, which, in a 3D game, means a lot. So they will basically be used to speed up a lot of the 3D transformations and lighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2017, it was {{revealed}} that the script for Zombieland 2 has been completed.

It’s just a matter of making our cast deals and making it for a budget number. All the cast have become superstars now so, we made Zombieland with 20 million, so it’s trying to fit that financial model into the sequel model so it makes sense for the studio and being able to pay the actors what they now get paid and deserve to get paid. We see Tom Rothman pretty frequently now and we’re pestering that dude. He’s like, ‘Please, enough with the Zombieland talk!’ We’re pestering him the way we pestered Fox on Deadpool. We’re not letting it go. We really want to see Zombieland 2.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 1957 season, Phillies {{management}} made {{it clear}} that they were looking for a new backup catcher for Lopata. He signed his new contract in January 1958, marking his 11th season with the Phillies. Throughout spring training, Lopata did daily exercises for his injured knee, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> strong enough to hold up for the 1958 season. He got off to a slow start in the season, and by the end of May the fans had turned on their once local favorite. His woes continued on June 8 when Larry Jackson out of St. Louis hit Lopata in the head with a pitch. It was reported to not be serious, but he would not be released from the hospital until three days later on June 11. Lopata suffered yet another injury in July, playing in only seven games that month. He finished the season with a [...]248 average to go with 9 home runs and 33 RBI in 86 games. After the season ended, Lopata was asked to join Willie Mays' National League [...] "All-Star" [...] Team for an exhibition game against an American League All-Star team put together by Mickey Mantle in New York City.|$|E
