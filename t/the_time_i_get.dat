500|$|Jimmy Webb – songwriting ("By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix" [...] sample) ...|$|E
500|$|In 1969, after scoring hits {{as a solo}} artist such as [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix" [...] and [...] "Wichita Lineman", Glen Campbell {{left the}} Wrecking Crew. [...] Carol Kaye, {{exhausted}} from the constant pressure of the L.A. recording scene, went on to other musical endeavors. [...] According to guitarist Bill Pitman, [...] "You leave the house at seven o'clock in the morning, and you're at Universal at nine till noon; now you're at Capitol Records at one, you just got time to get there, then you got a jingle at four, then we're {{on a date with}} somebody at eight, then the Beach Boys at midnight, and you do that five days a week... jeez, man, you get burned out".|$|E
500|$|Though Glen Campbell became {{better known}} as a highly {{successful}} country music artist in his own right, he played guitar in the Wrecking Crew during the 1960s and appeared along with them on several of the Beach Boys' classics of the period such as [...] "I Get Around" [...] and [...] "Help Me Rhonda". [...] In 1965 he toured with the Beach Boys, and in 1966 he and the Wrecking Crew played on the Pet Sounds album. [...] Campbell enlisted the Wrecking Crew as a backup unit on many of his own solo records during the 1960s, such as on [...] "Gentle on My Mind", and on two songs written by Jimmy Webb, [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix" [...] and his single [...] "Wichita Lineman".|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} {{give up that}} money I'll have you arrested as a thief <b>the</b> first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance," [...] was my reply; and I meant just what I said.|$|R
6000|$|Bill grinned comprehendingly. [...] "I'll tell Tom, {{but nobody}} else. We {{have our own}} little row with the vermin, and <b>the</b> next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my grip on him there'll be an end of him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Condor said, {{sitting down}} again, [...] "you {{are safe for}} a day or two; but mind, <b>the</b> first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> an {{opportunity}} <b>I</b> will give you the soundest thrashing that you ever had." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{many years}} of {{releasing}} studio albums of newly recorded material, McEntire's nineteenth studio album, Starting Over (1995) was collection of her favorite songs originally recorded by others from the 1950s through the early 1980s. The album was made to commemorate twenty years in the music industry, but many music critics gave it a less positive response than her previous release. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that although the album was considered a [...] "rebirth" [...] for McEntire, he thought that some tracks were recorded for merely [...] "nothing more than entertainment". The album paid tribute to many of McEntire's favorite artists and included cover versions of [...] "Talking In Your Sleep" [...] originally sung by Crystal Gayle, [...] "Please Come to Boston", [...] "I Won't Mention It Again" [...] sung by Ray Price, [...] "Starting Over Again", cowritten by Donna Summer and originally a hit for Dolly Parton, [...] "On My Own", and [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix". [...] "On My Own" [...] featured guest vocals from Davis, as well as Martina McBride and Trisha Yearwood.|$|E
500|$|A dance song of {{four minutes}} and twenty-two seconds in length, [...] "Since I Left You" [...] is {{primarily}} sample-based. The track features doo-wop vocal harmonies and employs various pieces of instrumentation, including organs, flutes and acoustic guitars. Its chorus, sampled from [...] "Everyday" [...] by the Main Attraction, features a woman singing about leaving her lover. The [...] "Everyday" [...] sample {{was the final}} element of [...] "Since I Left You" [...] to be added by Chater and Seltmann, and the former stated that its addition was a moment when they [...] "really succeeded in writing a pop song." [...] The original song described a woman's happiness after meeting a man, but Chater and Seltmann re-arranged various vocals to make the final sample appear to describe a break-up. Other sample sources include Rose Royce's [...] "Daddy Rich", Tony Mottola's [...] "Anema e core" [...] and [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix", the Duprees' [...] "The Sky's the Limit", Lamont Dozier's [...] "Take Off Your Make-Up" [...] and Klaus Wunderlich's [...] "Let's Do the Latin Hustle".|$|E
500|$|Carol Kaye {{provided}} {{an exception to}} the predominantly male world of Los Angeles session work in the 1960s. [...] Originally a guitarist, she began doing session work in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, playing behind Ritchie Valens on [...] "La Bamba" [...] and in the 1960s becoming a regular contributor on Phil Spector's recordings as well as on Beach Boys songs, such as [...] "Help Me, Rhonda" [...] and their subsequent Pet Sounds and Smile LPs. [...] Ray Pohlman, who had assumed an early leadership position in the Wrecking Crew, became the musical director for the Shindig! TV show in 1965, resulting in reduced studio work from that point on. [...] After Pohlman's move to television, Kaye began to gravitate to the electric bass. [...] She supplied the signature bass line in Sonny and Cher's [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] released in 1967. [...] Joe Osborn played bass on numerous Wrecking Crew-backed songs, such as Glen Campbell's [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix", The Mamas & the Papas' [...] "California Dreamin'", Richard Harris' [...] "MacArthur Park", and the 5th Dimension's [...] "Up, Up and Away". [...] Other notable electric bassists who played with the Wrecking Crew were Bill Pitman, Max Bennett, Red Callender, Chuck Rainey, and Bob West, as well as Jimmy Bond, Lyle Ritz, Chuck Berghofer, who played acoustic upright bass.|$|E

2500|$|Campbell and De Lory collaborated {{again on}} 1967's [...] "Gentle on My Mind", written by John Hartford, {{which was an}} {{overnight}} success. The song {{was followed by the}} bigger hit [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix" [...] later in 1967, and [...] "I Wanna Live" [...] and [...] "Wichita Lineman" [...] in 1968, remaining on Billboard's Top 100 charts for 15 weeks. He won four Grammy Awards for [...] "Gentle on My Mind" [...] and [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix".|$|E

6000|$|He {{paused and}} went on in tones of unendurable wrong. [...] "It isn't {{as though he was}} doing it right. He isn't. He can't. He's a fool.

2500|$|Arizona is {{prominently}} {{featured in}} the lyrics of many Country and Western songs, such as Jamie O'Neal's hit ballad [...] "There Is No Arizona". George Strait's [...] "Oceanfront Property" [...] uses [...] "ocean front property in Arizona" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} a sucker proposition. The line [...] "see you down in Arizona Bay" [...] is used in a Tool song in reference to the possibility (expressed as a hope by comedian Bill Hicks) that Southern California will one day fall into the ocean. Glen Campbell, a notable resident, popularized the song [...] "By <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> To Phoenix".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1987, Arizona {{governor}} Evan Mecham {{canceled a}} state holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr. because the holiday {{had not been}} properly authorized. [...] In response to this action, the group wrote a song entitled [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Arizona". In the video for the song, the group was seen assassinating Mecham by planting a bomb underneath his limousine and detonating it by remote control, perhaps intending an analogy or other reference to the 1976 murder of Don Bolles, an investigator reporter for the Arizona Republic newspaper. This {{is not the first}} time that the group has been involved in some political controversies, as their songs revolve around political and social issues at the time.|$|E
2500|$|During his 50 {{years in}} the music business, Campbell {{released}} more than 70 albums. He sold 45 million records worldwide and accumulated 12 gold albums, four platinum albums, and one double-platinum album. He placed a total of 80 different songs on either the Billboard Country Chart, Billboard Hot 100, or Adult Contemporary Chart, of which 29 made the top 10 and of which nine reached number one {{on at least one}} of those charts. [...] Among Campbell's hits are [...] "Universal Soldier", his first hit from 1965, along with [...] "Gentle on My Mind", [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix", [...] "Wichita Lineman", [...] "Dreams of the Everyday Housewife", [...] "Galveston", [...] "Rhinestone Cowboy" [...] and [...] "Southern Nights".|$|E

2500|$|Campbell {{made history}} in 1967 by winning four Grammys {{in the country}} and pop categories. For [...] "Gentle on My Mind", he {{received}} two awards in country and western; [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix" [...] did the same in pop. Three of his early hits later won Grammy Hall of Fame Awards (2000, 2004, 2008), while Campbell himself won the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. He owned trophies for Male Vocalist of the Year from both the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM), and took the CMA's top award as 1968 Entertainer of the Year. Campbell played a supporting role in the film True Grit (1969), which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. He also sang the title song, which was nominated for an Academy Award.|$|E
2500|$|The group's next release, Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black, {{continued}} this trend, {{with songs}} like [...] "Can't Truss It", which addressed {{the history of}} slavery and how the black community can fight back against oppression; [...] "I Don't Wanna be Called Yo Nigga", a track that takes issue {{with the use of}} the word nigga outside of its original derogatory context. The album also included the controversial song and video [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Arizona", which chronicled the black community's frustration that some US states did not recognize Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a national holiday. The video featured members of Public Enemy taking out their frustrations on politicians in the states not recognizing the holiday. In 1992, the group was one of the first rap acts to perform at the Reading Festival, in England, headlining the second day of the three-day festival.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell {{recorded}} and released 60 studio albums and six live albums between 1962 and 2017. He also lent his vocals to four soundtracks for motion pictures: True Grit (1969), Norwood (1970), Rock-a-Doodle (1992), and the 2014 documentary film [...] He placed {{a total of}} 82 singles (one {{of which was a}} re-release) on either the Billboard Country Chart, the Billboard Hot 100, or the Adult Contemporary Chart, nine of which peaked at number one on at least one of those charts. He released 15 video albums and featured in 21 music videos. His first two music videos, [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix" [...] and [...] "Wichita Lineman", were directed by Gene Weed in 1967 and 1968, respectively. Campbell released his final music video, [...] "I'm Not Gonna Miss You", in 2014 to coincide with the release of the documentary Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me. His final studio album, Adiós, was released on June 9, 2017.|$|E

2500|$|His next {{album was}} Hot Buttered Soul, which was {{released}} in 1969 after Stax had gone through a major upheaval. The label had lost its largest star, Otis Redding, {{in a plane crash}} in December 1967. Stax lost all of its back catalog to Atlantic Records in May 1968. As a result, Stax executive vice president Al Bell called for 27 new albums to be completed in mid-1969; Hot Buttered Soul, was the most successful of these releases. This album is noted for Hayes's image (shaved head, gold jewelry, sunglasses, etc.) and his distinct sound (extended orchestral songs relying heavily on organs, horns and guitars, deep bass vocals, etc.). Also on the album, Hayes reinterpreted [...] "Walk On By" [...] (which had been made famous by Dionne Warwick) into a 12-minute exploration. [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> to Phoenix" [...] starts with an eight-minute-long monologue before breaking into song, and the lone original number, the funky [...] "Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic" [...] runs nearly ten minutes, a significant break from the standard three-minute soul/pop songs. [...] "Walk On By" [...] would be the first of many times Hayes would take a Burt Bacharach standard, generally made famous as three-minute pop songs by Dionne Warwick or Dusty Springfield, and transform it into a soulful, lengthy and almost gospel number.|$|E
