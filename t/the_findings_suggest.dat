People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help, such as doctors or police officers, and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance.

Included are the Rayleihg law for small particles, the Chandrasekhar solution of the planetary scattering problem, and the Mie theory for large particle scattering. Observations cover the wavelength range from 0.37 to 0.79 micrometre at the scattering angle 2.4 degrees, and over the altitude range from 42,000 ft. to 80,000 ft. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> that {{the form of the}} particle size distribution changes with altitude, becoming a steeper function of particle radius at higher altitudes.|$|E
