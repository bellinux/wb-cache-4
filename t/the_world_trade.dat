During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center included The Mall at <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, and a PATH station.

40|$|AbstractNew {{developments}} and significant changes {{are under way}} in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. We are witnessing a revival of trading nations’ interest in international trade agenda and trade talks, which have taken a backseat since the economic downturn following the global crisis. The improved outlook for global trade growth, but also the acute need for adjusting <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system to <b>the</b> ongoing structural changes in the spheres {{of international trade and}} industrial organization are, essentially, behind this policy shift. This paper takes stock of recent developments in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system and highlights the prospects for global trade governance. It focuses on three issues: (1) the significance of the Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2013 for resuming global trade cooperation; (2) the recent drive towards plurilateral sector-specific trade deals; and (3) the outstanding pace and scale of negotiations on new preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The paper concludes with a discussion of the future direction of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. It argues that despite improved prospects for multilateral <b>trade</b> liberalization, <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system is becoming more fragmented and less coherent, and also more uncertain, being increasingly driven by PTAs and a variable geometry approach to WTO trade agreements...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the original World Trade Center, there was debate regarding the future of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. When the public rejected the first round of designs, a second, more open competition took place in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner. This design underwent many revisions, mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease to <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site at that time.|$|E
