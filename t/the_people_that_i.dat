500|$|The {{strain in}} race {{relations}} {{led to the}} Singaporean 1964 Race Riots, which PAP Malay politician Othman Wok later insinuated were planned beforehand by the ultras. In the year following the riots, tension continued growing. Syed Jaafar Albar declared that [...] "Wherever I am, I am a Malay", drawing harsh return fire from Lee, who stated in Parliament: [...] "If I had been going round and saying what [...] has been saying — wherever I am, I am a Chinese — where would we be? But I keep on reminding <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a Malaysian. I am learning Bahasa Kebangsaan [...] and I accept Article 153 of the Constitution." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{pitching}} {{the strategy}} to RCA, Miguel first marketed Kaleidoscope Dream virally with a three-volume series of EPs entitled Art Dealer Chic, which were released as free downloads during February to April 2012 and previewed {{songs from the}} album. He released two more EPs—Kaleidoscope Dream: Water Preview on July 31 and Air Preview on September 11— to digital retailers. In an interview for The Village Voice, Miguel said that the strategy allowed listeners to absorb the songs at his desired pace and called it [...] "a great {{way for me to}} reconnect with my peers ... <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hang out with—that go to the same shows, listen to the same music, read the same blogs, same magazines." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{continuing}} crisis {{reached a}} {{point of no return}} when the Cortes dissolved the central government in Rio de Janeiro and ordered Pedro's return. This was perceived by Brazilians as an attempt to subordinate their country again to Portugal—Brazil had not been a colony since 1815 and had the status of a kingdom. On 9 January 1822, Pedro was presented with a petition containing 8,000 signatures that begged him not to leave. He replied, [...] "Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am staying." [...] Avilez again mutinied and tried to force Pedro's return to Portugal. This time the prince fought back, rallying the Brazilian troops (which had not joined the Portuguese in previous mutinies), militia units and armed civilians. Outnumbered, Avilez surrendered and was expelled from Brazil along with his troops.|$|E

500|$|At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was stationed {{on the east side}} of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a Cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, [...] "if [...] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I want you to do justice to my memory and tell <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it." ...|$|E
500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she had on her husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends I have and the loved ones that I have and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> care about in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gene Weingarten of the Washington Post interviewed Lehrer off {{the record}} in a February 2008 phone call.

2500|$|Many {{fans have}} speculated that this song was a tribute to Grohl's {{deceased}} friend and bandmate, Kurt Cobain. However, in Grohl's own words, the song is, [...] "(his) {{way of saying that}} when I was young, I didn't have big rock heroes, I didn't want to grow up and be some big sporting hero. My heroes were ordinary people and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have a lot of respect}} for are just solid everyday people - people you can rely on." [...] This was the third single to be released from the album.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the final}} game of the 2005 season, Kansas State offered to name the stadium Bill Snyder Stadium in honor of {{retiring}} head coach Bill Snyder. In 17 years, Snyder had turned the Wildcats, once the definition of college football futility, into a frequent championship contender in the Big 12 Conference. When he was asked about renaming the stadium, Snyder told school officials, [...] "If {{you are going to do}} it, name it after <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> care about the most." [...] Hence, the Regents renamed the stadium to honor the family of the coach who had led the team for 17 years.|$|E

2500|$|Vandenbroucke {{had turned}} down the Giro d'Italia, {{claiming}} problems with his knee, on which he had an operation the previous winter. His psychiatrist, Jef Brouwers, said [...] "... the problems with his knee have affected him badly. He could no longer ride as he wanted after the operation. Nor could the doctors say what the problem was. These last few days, he has been terrible. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> called in Italy could no longer help him. He had thought it through and, so {{far as he was}} concerned, everything was lost. The situation of his knee has worn him down completely [...] and his private life wasn't good either, with ups and downs." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Connor is Sarah's son and {{the future}} leader of the human resistance. He is only 14 {{years old at the}} {{beginning}} of the show, turning fifteen in the season one finale. As the series progresses, John struggles with his feelings for Cameron, who is a Terminator. Dekker was cast after Headey secured the role of Sarah Connor. Regarding the Terminator films, Dekker says [...] "They are like my favorite films when I was younger. So it's very ironic that I'm getting to do this. And I know for the younger generation and for myself, John was equally important to me as Sarah was, and I know a lot of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hear from really, really care about John". Dekker describes his character as [...] "a continuation of Eddie Furlong's character" [...] but [...] "he's in a darker, more mature place now".|$|E
2500|$|As their armies deployed, {{the commanders}} would {{have sought to}} motivate their soldiers. Tacitus, who wrote of the battle {{more than fifty years}} later, claims to relate Boudica's speech to her followers: [...] "'But now,' she said, 'it is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry, but as one of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am avenging lost freedom, my scourged body, the outraged {{chastity}} of my daughters. Roman lust has gone so far that not our very persons, nor even age or virginity, are left unpolluted. But heaven {{is on the side of}} a righteous vengeance; a legion which dared to fight has perished; the rest are hiding themselves in their camp, or are thinking anxiously of flight. They will not sustain even the din and the shout of so many thousands, much less our charge and our blows. If you weigh well the strength of the armies, and the causes of the war, you will see that in this battle you must conquer or die. This is a woman's resolve; as for men, they may live and be slaves.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} Tsawa Kachu of the Ganden Palace {{showed me}} statues and rosaries (that {{belonged to the}} Fourth Dalai Lama and other lamas), but I was unable to distinguish between them! When {{he left the room}} I heard him tell <b>the</b> <b>people</b> outside <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had successfully passed the tests. Later, when he became my tutor, he would often admonish me and say: [...] "You must work hard, since you were unable to recognize the objects!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps most importantly, {{the play}} has been championed by Michael Berenbaum, {{one of the}} world's {{foremost}} Holocaust historians and co-Founder and Project Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Mr. Berenbaum has written [...] "As the scholar specifically named in Jeff Cohen's play [...] "The Soap Myth," [...] I recognize in each of <b>the</b> characters <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have encountered in my professional career from passionate survivors to stodgy Museum officials, from naïve and innocent reporters to pernicious Holocaust deniers.

I am all the writers that I have read, all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have met, all the women that I have loved; all the cities that I have visited, all my ancestors." [...] As a young man, he visited the frontier pampas which extend beyond Argentina into Uruguay and Brazil. Borges said that his father wished him [...] "to become a citizen of the world, a great cosmopolitan," [...] in the way of Henry and William James. Borges lived and studied in Switzerland and Spain as a young student. As Borges matured, he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and, internationally, as a visiting professor; he continued to tour the world as he grew older, finally settling in Geneva where he had spent some of his youth. Drawing on the influence of many times and places, Borges's work belittled nationalism and racism. Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi (co-authored with Bioy Casares) and Death and the Compass. Borges wrote that he considered Mexican essayist Alfonso Reyes to be [...] "the best prose-writer in the Spanish language of any time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both groups {{convinced}} the Prince {{not to return}} to Portugal, and he replied on 9 January 1822: [...] "Since {{it is for the}} good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am staying."" [...] He appointed José Bonifácio, leader of the Luso-Brazilians, as head of the Cabinet on 18 January 1822. Pedro traveled to São Paulo province to secure its loyalty to the Brazilian cause, but he received a letter from Bonifácio as he was returning to Rio de Janeiro on 7 September. The prince learned that the Cortes had annulled the remaining powers he had retained. Pedro turned to his companions, who included his Guard of Honor and said: [...] "Friends, the Portuguese Cortes wants to enslave and pursue us. From today onward our relations are broken. No ties unites us any longer". Pulling off his blue and white armband which symbolized Portugal, he continued: [...] "Armbands off, soldiers. Hail to independence, to freedom and to the separation of Brazil". In a moment which would become the most iconic in Brazilian history, he unsheathed his sword and affirmed that [...] "For my blood, my honor, my God, I swear to give Brazil freedom", and then cried out: [...] "Independence or death!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.'

During his ten years at St. Stephen's, {{he came to}} believe in [...] "the essential value of every man, of whatever race or color or creed." [...] In the Philippines, this belief was deepened.
