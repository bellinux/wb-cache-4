Each job originates at the [...] "source", which we will label U on the graph. Each job will finish in a [...] "sink" [...] of jobs, which we will label V on the graph. Each row of nodes in the graph represents a job. Each node on the graph represents a task {{that is part of the}} job, the second number confirms the job being performed and the first number indicates what machine is being used for this task. At this point, the initial <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> of each job should be calculated by adding up the processing times that the job takes on each of the machines (or rows). After the <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> for each job has been calculated, the makespan for the system is determined by the longest <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> of any individual job.

The system is modeled as a large network of queues. Due {{to the size of the}} network, only the part of the laboratory at which all samples arrive and are prepared for testing (SAP) is investigated in detail. The analysis is mainly done by simulation and approximative methods, as the processes are too complex for exact analysis. The simulation reveals that the <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> are good in the current situation and the occupation rate of the employees is relatively low. The simulation also shows that the occupation rate cannot be increased while keeping the <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> at an acceptable level in the current situation, because the samples mainly arrive in batches. It is also found that there are many options for decreasing <b>throughput</b> <b>times.</b> Two machines at the SAP serve the customers in batches. To investigate the effect of the machine batch policy on the <b>throughput</b> <b>times,</b> a simplified model of the machines is analyzed by exact and approximative methods. The analysis shows that machines with a low workload should be started already when there are only a few samples present, in order to achieve optimal <b>throughput</b> <b>times.</b> The analysis also shows that the minimal batch size for which the waiting time is minimal increases when the workload of the system increases...|$|R

5000|$|As a priority, Buckley {{sought to}} {{eliminate}} the backlog of casework which had accumulated without affecting the quality of investigations undertaken by the Office. He targeted additional staff and changes in working methods and management as means of speeding up investigation throughput times. Staff would only undertake work that would add value to the resolution of a complaint. It was no longer to be assumed that all aspects of every complaint were to be exhaustively examined. Delegation within the Office also went much deeper so that decisions were made at the lowest appropriate level. Other additions to Office practice included targets, performance appraisals for staff, reviews of performance against targets and time recording. Screening and investigation staff were now to be employed on permanent contracts instead of the Office relying on those on short-term contracts and secondments. As a consequence of these initiatives, the average <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> for cases fell from 91 weeks in 1998-9 to just 44 weeks in 1999-2000. Investigations backlogs were also eliminated. These improvements were being achieved {{against a backdrop of}} consistently heavy workload: the Office was annually receiving approximately 1,500 new cases. [...] Greater use was also made of informal investigations to secure redress for complainants. Greater publicity was also given to the existence of the Office, including a website that included an interactive complaints form. The Office was also moved to new premises at Millbank Tower.|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{technology}} {{integration is}} an arising paradigm that aims at the functional integration of diverse manufacturing technologies into machine tools which are called multi-technology platforms. So far, machine tool builders {{have attempted to}} justify manufacturing technology integration through the machine hour rate calculation. However, this calculation approach is inadequate for such purpose since it neglects output quantities and {{the configuration of the}} manufacturing system. This dissertation applies models of production, cost, and queuing theory to derive the conditions under which manufacturing technology integration leads to greater productivity, lower cost, and smaller <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> than a conventional manufacturing system consisting of single-technology machine tools. Such a conventional manufacturing system is called segregated manufacturing system. Based on the efficiency models the design of multi-technology platforms is discussed with regard to the number and the type of manufacturing technologies to be integrated as well as the number of workspaces. It is found that manufacturing technology integration is particularly cost-efficient for low output quantities. However, although the logistic chain in a plant is shortened through manufacturing technology integration the <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> of an integrated manufacturing system might be greater than the <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> of a segregated manufacturing system. This {{is due to the fact}} that for low output quantities the resource utilization and as such the waiting times might be greater in an integrated manufacturing system than in a segregated manufacturing system...|$|R

The objectives of this study were twofold: 1. To assess the feasibility of collecting benchmarking data from different Swedish emergency departments (EDs) and 2. To evaluate patient <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> and inflow patterns. Method We compared patient inflow patterns, total lengths of patient stay (LOS) and times to first physician at six Swedish university hospital EDs in 2009. Study data were retrieved from the hospitals' computerized information systems during single on-site visits to each participating hospital. Results All EDs provided <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> and patient presentation data without significant problems. In all EDs, Monday was the busiest day and the fewest patients presented on Saturday. All EDs had a large increase in patient inflow before noon with a slow decline over the rest of the 24 h, and this peak and decline was especially pronounced in elderly patients. The average LOS was 4 h of which 2 h was spent waiting for the first physician. These <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> showed a considerable diurnal variation in all EDs, with the longest times occurring 6 - 7 am and in the late afternoon. Conclusion These results demonstrate the feasibility of collecting benchmarking data on quality of care targets within Swedish EM, and form the basis for ANSWER, A National SWedish Emergency Registry. </p...|$|R

The tool is created to cope with service level agreements (SLA) that put a limit on acceptable <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> of credit requests. Currently, SLA requirements are not well met and customer satisfaction is low. Because of the highly variable process times and complex flows with rework loops, a deterministic scheduler is not appropriate. Simulation is therefore used to model the processes. Firstly, matching simulation results with real data reveals if the processes are lean, and fine-tuning can be done. Secondly, based on simulation results a tool can be developed representing expected <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> and SLA impact for different degrees of capacity utilization.

40|$|<b>Throughput</b> <b>time,</b> {{the time}} {{duration}} from customer arrival to service com-pletion, is strategically important. In this paper, we consider flexibility {{as a way}} to reduce mean <b>throughput</b> <b>time.</b> In case where manufacturing or ser-vice systems are modelled as queueing systems, we derive substantial decrease in mean <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> by incorporating flexibility. We study two types of flexible systems: a parallel flexible system and a serial flexible system. In a case of this paper, the mean throuthput time is reduced to less than a half via flexibility. Thus we can choose flexibility as an alternative for specialization which has been a conventional way to improve production efficiency. The result in this paper should be helpful to the practitioners(b 0 th in man-ufacturing and service sectors) who try to shorten the response time to cus-tomers and gain competitive edge. By making servers more flexible, they can reduce mean <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> since the flexible servers can help each other and sequencing priority can sometimes be applied appropriately. ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{competitive}} world, most of {{the automotive}} manufacturers focus on updating the production system constantly to satisfy their customer demands. Most of the manufacturing companies found Lean production as a more efficient way of production. Lean production focuses on producing the products with short lead time and <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> thus delivering the products to the customer in short interval of time. The thesis {{is a part of}} an ongoing research project in Division of Supply and Operations Management, Chalmers University. This study is performed on four different automotive manufacturers in Sweden to analyze how different manufacturers control the flow of material between their warehouses and the assembly plant. Out of four different automotive manufacturers considered, three manufacturers using external warehouse and one manufacturer using warehouse within the assembly plant. To focus the flow of material, in each of the cases pallet flow and box flow has been considered for this study. The Material Flow Map (MFM) for different automotive manufacturers that were created {{as a part of the}} previous study is used for this thesis work. The main purpose of this thesis is to identify how controlling the flow of material from an external warehouse to the assembly line affects the different activities performed which therefore influences the lead time and <b>throughput</b> <b>time.</b> It involves in analyzing the different activities such as handling, administration, transportation, storage and time involved in those activities which affect the lead time and <b>throughput</b> <b>time.</b> The thesis also contrasts the lead time and <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> between having the warehouse externally and internally. Our thesis started by identifying the literature for the common factors that affected the lead time and <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> within the automotive manufacturers. In addition, a plant visit is done to collect the empirical date based on those factors obtained from the literature study requires for this thesis work. Data obtained by means of previous study, literature and plant visit showed us different activities such as handling, administration, transportation and storage are the four main factors that affect the lead time and <b>throughput</b> <b>time.</b> Based on the data obtained, a cross-case analysis has been made to analyze what affects the <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> and lead time for different manufacturers. The analysis showed the manufacturers with external warehouse store the material for a long time which increases the <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> greatly when compared to the manufacturer with the internal warehouse. In addition, it increased the handling, administration and transportation activities and time. As a suggestion to all the manufacturers, having their external warehouse within the company premises and following the principle of Just-In-Time (JIT) purchasing will reduce the overall <b>throughput</b> <b>time</b> and lead time.

The constraints as such could lower production rates ofthe line ifthey are not considered as integrated parts ofthe whole system. The research begins with manufacturing constraint analysis to identifr which one has the most impact and govems the productivity of the line. The output of the analysis is then used for comparing the efficiency between single-model assembly line balancing and multi-model assembly line balancing approaches. In addition, the algorithms to balance the line, i. e. COMSOAL and the current factory method, are compared. The research enquiry is investigated by computer simulation. An experimental design with 3 factors, namely line balancing methods, line balancing algorithms, and conveyor speeds, are conducted to evaluate the significance ofthe factors measured {{by the number of}} stations, line efficiency, output, and <b>throughput</b> <b>time.</b> It is found that the number of stations used in the multi-model assembly line balancing is less than the single-model one.

Using queueing theory as the underlying methodology for deductive modeling of manufacturing systems, we run computer simulations on networks of queueing systems and investigate synchronization measurements in relation to system parameters and performance indicators. Our initial findings suggest that different types of manufacturing systems display different synchronization behaviors and that periodically driven systems with deterministic arrival and service rates display higher synchronization in comparison to stochastic ones. Further, we show that intrinsic physics synchronization is correlated to capacity utilization, <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> and WIP levels, suggesting the co-activity of operations is related to highly utilized systems, while external physics synchronization is anticorrelated to <b>throughput</b> <b>times</b> and WIP levels, suggesting that higher efficiencies emerge with workstation repetitive behavior...|$|R
