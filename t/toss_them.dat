5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E
25|$|Kappa are {{not entirely}} {{antagonistic}} to human beings. They are curious about human civilization, and they can understand and speak Japanese. They may even befriend human beings in exchange for gifts or offerings of nasu (茄子, Japanese eggplant), soba (そば or 蕎麦, buckwheat noodles), nattō (なっとう or 納豆, fermented soybeans), or kabocha (カボチャ, 南瓜, winter squash), but especially cucumbers, the only food kappa are known to enjoy more than human children. Japanese parents sometimes write {{the names of their}} children, or their own names, on cucumbers and <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> into waters believed to be infested with kappa in order to mollify the creatures and allow the family to bathe. In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack. There is a cucumber-filled sushi roll known as kappamaki.|$|E
500|$|Each court {{consists}} {{of one or}} more saucer-shaped depressions or [...] "bowls" [...] dug in the ground by the male, up to [...] deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. The kakapo is {{one of only a handful}} of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks. Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound - the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males' booming mating calls. Each male's bowls are connected by a network of trails or tracks which may extend [...] along a ridge or [...] in diameter around a hilltop. Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris. One way researchers check whether bowls are visited at night is to place a few twigs in the bowl; if the male visits overnight, he will pick them up in his beak and <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> away.|$|E

2500|$|The 18th {{episode of}} the sixth season of the satirical stop-motion series Robot Chicken, {{released}} February 3, 2013, features a sketch where, after the failure of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, a second attempt is made to make a Marvel superhero musical, titled [...] "Avengers: Musictacular Tapstravaganza", featuring musical numbers sung by Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Loki, and Iron Man, a dance number by Captain America, and a large animatronic Hulk. The musical plays out decently at best until the animatronic Hulk begins to spark and malfunction, causing an explosion that decapitates the actor playing Thor, impales the actor playing Iron Man with a pipe, and severely injures {{the rest of the}} cast. Considering the fact that the actors have no insurance, the musical's director and producer light two Molotov cocktails and <b>toss</b> <b>them,</b> burning the theatre as they make a beeline for the exit.|$|E
2500|$|When the Aggie {{football}} team is defeated at home (or {{run out of}} time, as Aggie tradition declares the A never loses), the crowd remains in the stands {{at the end of}} the game while the Aggie Yell Leaders conduct a short yell practice, including the singing of the song 12th Man, in preparation for the next week's game. [...] If the Aggies win a home football game, the freshmen in the Corps of Cadets chase them around Kyle Field behind the 20 yard line, and, once they are captured, carry them across campus and <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> into Fish Pond, a fountain full of cold water. [...] A Yell Practice follows after the last Yell Leader has been thrown in. [...] Meanwhile, the Aggie fans follow the Aggie Band as they leave Kyle Field and congregate in front of the A YMCA Building for another Yell Practice. [...] The soaking-wet Yell Leaders then join the crowd, pacing back and forth across the steps of the YMCA building as they lead the fans in a yell practice against the following week's opponent.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to their}} cybernetic enhancements, all Borg are far {{stronger}} than humans {{to varying degrees}} (depending on the species from which the drone came). Some Borg drones are just able to easily overpower most humans and similar species, while others {{are strong enough to}} pick up or lift such species off the ground or shove or <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> across a room. However, they never run to their destination, hence most species can outpace them. Borg drones are resistant to phaser fire, being completely immune to the stun setting. In addition, all Borg drones possess personal shielding which collectively adapts to phaser fire. In various episodes, phasers tend to become ineffective after a dozen shots at most, depending on the settings and time between shots. Phaser frequencies can be altered to penetrate the shield, but the Borg adapt more quickly with each change in modulation. Due to this, crews have been known to employ a variety of other countermeasures such as holodeck-generated bullets and melee weapons, as demonstrated in [...] The Borg hive mind can lead to certain downsides: Borg drones have a weakness in that they usually ignore anything which does not present itself as a direct threat (unless specifically directed to attack), allowing armed but passive Starfleet crew to walk among them relatively unscathed until threatening behavior was observed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Pick {{them all}} up, Tom, and <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> on the fire. We {{will take the}} sting out of the snake, in case it tries to attack us again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are fond {{of burning}} houses," [...] one said at last, [...] "let them try how they like it. Let us make a blaze here, and <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> in, and let them roast in their own shells." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have summoned {{you here}} that you may cast the {{deciding}} vote," [...] added the Queen. [...] "What shall we do, Rosalie, allow them to remain here as honored guests, or <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> over the bushes into the sky?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am tired}} of poetry,' said the Princess, glancing over the costly volumes, and <b>tossing</b> <b>them</b> away; 'I long to see the world.' ...|$|R

6000|$|The Lady: [...] "Oh, loads. As many as {{you think}} I ought to have. I shall not have any other flowers, and I mean to <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> {{on the table in}} loose heaps. Perhaps I shall have some smilax to go with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|The twelve Counselors then voted, {{and when}} the vote was counted, Tourmaline {{announced}} that six had voted to allow the strangers to remain and six to <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> over the bushes.

6000|$|... "A {{great thing}} like a bird, sir, {{bigger than a}} man, flew up over my head, higher than the houses.

60|$|Billy Windsor {{stretched}} out {{an arm and}} pulled a bundle of papers from the book-stand. He <b>tossed</b> <b>them</b> on to the settee by Psmith's side.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, blow that!' said Master Bates: drawing two {{or three}} silk {{handkerchiefs}} from his pocket, and <b>tossing</b> <b>them</b> into a cupboard, 'that's too mean; that is.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{laid her}} out sweetly {{in a nice}} box, with a doll's blanket folded round her, and, bidding the poor dear a long farewell, confided her to old MacCarty for burial. He was my sexton, and I could trust him to inter my darlings decently, and not <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> disrespectfully into a dirt-cart or over a bridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no plunder to be {{obtained}} from them, comrades," [...] he said loudly. [...] "They are only poor knaves riding behind the master.

I will see what their leader has got upon him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having waited {{some twenty}} minutes, it pleased this reprehensible Boy to make various marks and blots on my documents, <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> to a venerable {{creature}} of sixteen, who delivered {{them to me}} with such paternal directions, that it only needed {{a pat on the}} head and an encouraging--"Now run home to your Ma, little girl, and mind the crossings, my dear," [...] to make the illusion quite perfect.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bravo!" [...] cried Stanley, {{laughing}} heartily at his friend's stare of mingled {{wonder and}} amazement,--"bravo, Frank! I'm no fisher myself, but I've always understood that fish required a little play before being landed. However, you have convinced {{me of my}} ignorance. I see that the proper way is to <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> over your head! A salmon must be rather troublesome to toss, but no doubt, with your strong arms, you'll manage it easily, hey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, father, that is true," [...] said Rollo; [...] "but I had rather {{hear them}} talk. I can {{understand}} almost all they say. And then I {{like to see}} them change horses, and to see the conductor climb up and down. Then, besides, at almost all the villages they have parcels to leave at the inns; and it is good fun to see them take the parcels out and <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> down, and tell the bar maid at the inn what she is to do with them." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{words were}} uttered hastily in broken exclamations, as Macgregor seized the logs {{that had been}} cut for firewood, and began violently to <b>toss</b> <b>them</b> {{together}} in a pile; while the trappers, although much amazed and horrified at the news, seized their hatchets and began to make instant preparation to resist an attack, without wasting time in useless questions. They observed that {{the commander of the}} Mountain Fort was pale as death, that his eyes were bloodshot, his clothes torn, and his hands and face begrimed with powder and stained with blood.|$|E
5000|$|Players should place {{chips on}} the board rather than <b>tossing</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Tossed</b> chips may {{displace}} other bets or roll down to the [...] "chipping machine". If the player cannot reach to place a bet themselves, they should announce the bet to the dealer. This is treated as any other call bet.|$|R
