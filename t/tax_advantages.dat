5|$|Norway Airlines was {{established}} on 2 April 1987 by Kjell Adserø and his holding company Hell Holding, {{along with several}} other investors from Trøndelag—the largest of which was Lyng Industrier. The business model was to operate charter flights from Norway to the Mediterranean; {{eighty percent of the}} market was carried out with foreign airlines and Adserø believed that Norwegians not only would prefer a Norwegian carrier, but {{would be willing to pay}} more for one. The company had an initial share capital of NOK10 million and established its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Separate companies, organized as kommandittselskap, wer established to own each aircraft and lease them to the airline. The aircraft owner companies paid 28.7 million United States dollars for each Boeing 737-300, which were delivered new from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Shares in the aircraft owning companies was offered to the public with a four-percent annual return on investment. Part of the investment model was based on <b>tax</b> <b>advantages.</b>|$|E

Other subsidies include <b>tax</b> <b>advantages</b> (for instance aviation fuel is typically not taxed), bailouts if companies that are likely to collapse (often applied to airlines) and reduction of competition through licensing schemes (often applied to taxis and airlines). Private transport is normally subsidized indirectly through free roads and infrastructure, as well as incentives to build car factories and, on occasion, directly via bailouts of automakers.|$|E

40|$|Patent boxes {{have been}} heavily debated for {{their role in}} {{corporate}} tax competition. This paper uses firm-level data for the period 2000 - 2011 for the top 2, 000 corporate research and development (R&D) investors worldwide to consider the determinants of patent registration across a large sample of countries. Importantly, we disentangle the effects of corporate income taxation from the <b>tax</b> <b>advantage</b> of patent boxes. We also exploit a new and original dataset on patent box features such as the conditionality on performing research in the country, and their scope. We find that patent boxes have a considerable effect on attracting patents, mostly because of their favourable tax treatment, especially for high-quality patents. Patent boxes with a large scope in terms of tax base definition also have stronger effects on the location of patents. The size of the <b>tax</b> <b>advantage</b> offered through patent box regimes is found to deter local innovative activities, whereas R&D development conditions tend to attenuate this adverse effect. Our simulations show that, on average, countries imposing such development conditions tend to grant a <b>tax</b> <b>advantage</b> that is slightly greater than optimal from a local R&D impact perspective...|$|R

30|$|If NLH workers’ payroll <b>tax</b> <b>advantage</b> is {{the main}} {{explanation}} of their higher callback rate, one would expect their callback advantage to be most pronounced in situations where their payroll <b>tax</b> <b>advantage</b> is the greatest. To pursue this idea, note that during our sample period employers of LH workers in Xiamen paid 21 percent of the worker’s monthly salary (with a minimum and maximum basis) to city’s retirement and health insurance programs. For NLH workers, these contributions were set at a fixed, low amount that is unrelated to the worker’s wage rate. The exact formulas and their consequences for average tax rates at typical salaries in our sample are shown in Appendix  2, which shows a roughly constant employer tax rate gap of about 19 percent between the two worker types across the entire wage distribution in our sample (column 3). The absolute tax differential in column (4), on the other hand, increases with earnings. Both these properties also apply to total (employer plus employee-paid) taxes (in columns 5 – 8). Thus, {{depending on whether the}} total tax difference (in yuan) or the difference in tax rates is most relevant to employers’ callback decisions, NLH workers’ payroll <b>tax</b> <b>advantage</b> is either increasing or roughly constant across job skill levels.|$|R
25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} <b>tax</b> <b>advantages</b> {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E

Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage. With notable exceptions, assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries, the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust. Under the Insolvency Act (Act 24 of 1936), assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent {{at the time of}} transfer, or 24 months if he/she is insolvent at the time of transfer. After 24 months, creditors have no claim against assets in the trust, although they can attempt to attach the loan account, thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets. Assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust (through a loan granted to the trust) or donating cash to it (any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax; 20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year).|$|E
