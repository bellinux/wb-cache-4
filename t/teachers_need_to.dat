25|$|The {{notion of}} {{evidence}} based practice {{has also had}} an influence {{in the field of}} education. Here, some commentators have suggested that the putative lack of any conspicuous progress is attributable to practice resting in the unconnected and noncumulative experience of thousands of individual teachers, each re-inventing the wheel and failing to learn from hard scientific evidence about 'what works'. Opponents of this view argue that hard scientific evidence is a misnomer in education; knowing that a drug works (in medicine) is entirely different from knowing that a teaching method works, for the latter will depend on a host of factors, not least those to do with the style, personality and beliefs of the teacher and the needs of the particular children (Hammersley 2013). Some opponents of EBP in education suggest that <b>teachers</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> develop their own personal practice, dependent on personal knowledge garnered through their own experience. Others argue that this must be combined with research evidence, but without the latter being treated as a privileged source.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the growing}} number of {{international}} business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and <b>teachers</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be aware of the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have [...] been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief students feel during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge about the students and their unique characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|Pedagogical content {{knowledge}} {{is understood as}} the “blending of content and pedagogy” that guides the organization, representation and adaptation of the material for all learners through instruction. This concept goes beyond the consideration of the {{content knowledge}} as isolated from the pedagogical knowledge teachers must possess to effectively cater {{to the needs of}} their students. In order to illustrate how pedagogical content knowledge operates in reference to a specific knowledge domain, we can turn to the field of second language teaching. In this field, pedagogical content knowledge can be considered a “developmental construct” [...] initiated in pre-service teacher education programs and continued through in-service classroom experiences or “knowledge in action”. From this perspective, it is useful to look at the various components. Pedagogical knowledge refers to the different instructional approaches and techniques used to teach languages as well as the consideration of how the linguistic knowledge progresses and grows in complexity along the continuum of a curriculum (i.e., Schulman’s lateral curricular knowledge). This pedagogical knowledge also involves a growing understanding of content choice and pedagogy that views language learning as communication, performance in tasks, student-centered instruction, attention to accuracy and message. On the other hand, if we were to characterize the content knowledge in language teaching, we would be talking about the target language. What it entails for the second language teacher is not only the mastery of the target language but also “discipline-derived understandings from applied linguistics, SLA, psychology and curriculum development, among other areas, in a deeper examination of [...] subject matter -language- as it becomes classroom content”. However, if we are to enhance the definition of the pedagogical content knowledge in second language teaching, we need to include aspects related to language knowledge for teaching by following Schulman’s dimension of “subject matter knowledge for teaching”. These aspects include language teachers’ use of effective ways to represent the various types of knowledge involved in learning a language [...] that include {{but are not limited to}} syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and phonology. Besides it will require teachers to have a wide understanding of their language learners’ characteristics to be able to identify and explore the conceptions and misconceptions and, more importantly, “potential misunderstandings of [...] subject area” [...] these learners bring and/or develop in the learning situation. It also includes ways to help learners overcome these difficulties. For instance, Spanish speakers tend to omit subjects while learning a language with weak nominal features such as English, due to the fact that Spanish is predominantly a null subject language. Therefore, this may turn into a source of overgeneralization while these learners learn the target language. [...] The two main aspects of pedagogical content knowledge presented here correspond to the two domains defined by Ball, Thames and Phelps [...] as knowledge of content and teaching as well as knowledge of content and students respectively. The consideration of all these components constitutes the pedagogical content knowledge language <b>teachers</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> possess to become effective practitioners.|$|E

There should also be an effective conclusion in which the teacher can summarize the key points and outcomes and stimulate further self-directed learning.
