5|$|The clock dial {{has been}} dated {{to either the}} {{building}} phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to {{the installation of the}} Brunner clockwork in 1527-30.

50|$|The {{mammalian}} period 1 and period 2 genes {{play key}} roles in photoentrainment of <b>the</b> circadian <b>clock</b> <b>to</b> light pulses. This was first seen in 1999 when Akiyama et al. showed that mPer1 {{is necessary for}} phase shifts induced by light or glutamate release. Two years later, Albrecht et al. found genetic evidence to support this result when they discovered that mPer1 mutants are not able <b>to</b> advance <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> in response <b>to</b> a late-night light pulse (ZT22) and that mPer2 mutants are not able <b>to</b> delay <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> in response <b>to</b> an early night light pulse (ZT14).

5|$|Although St. Lucia {{suffered}} {{significant damage}} to its residential structures and agricultural land, its airports and hotels were operational within days having needed only small-scale repair work. Hospitals and other essential services kept running on standby power supplied by independent generators {{to assist in}} the cleanup and recovery efforts. Roads connecting the north and south of the island were quickly cleared. LUCELEC, the nation's only electricity provider, worked around <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>to</b> repair dozens of downed electrical poles and restored electricity by August 21. The rest of the island's infrastructure weathered the storm. Two shelters were opened for hurricane-affected residence, and USAID/OFDA provided US$40,432 of assistance to the island.|$|E
5|$|Hardware stores {{experienced}} great {{demand for}} portable generators, chain saws, dehumidifiers, and air movers following {{the passage of}} the hurricane.

5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems that set <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>to</b> UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such {{as with a}} rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E

5|$|The first {{roadshow}} {{opened at}} the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940.

5|$|Florida State {{began work}} at its 30-yard line, again needing to just run down <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>to</b> ensure victory. As before, however, Drew Weatherford {{took to the}} air, {{throwing}} a two-yard pass. Two rushing plays followed, but were stopped for little gain. Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two {{and a half minutes}} had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two previous drives, however, Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.|$|E

40|$|All organisms have an {{internal}} timing mechanism, termed <b>the</b> circadian <b>clock,</b> <b>to</b> anticipate <b>the</b> light/dark cycle. <b>The</b> <b>clock,</b> with an oscillating rhythm that approximates 24 h, {{is a rather}} robust system persisting {{to a great extent}} in continuous light and dark. It is widely accepted that plant growth and development are regulated by <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> hormones and sugar signals. On the one hand, sugar signalling can affect circadian rhythms by altering the expression pattern of clock-regulated genes.

5|$|With 2:05 {{left in the}} game, Cutler began {{leading a}} two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, {{followed}} by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On {{the next set of}} downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>to</b> give the Bears the 22–20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral {{in the early stages of}} the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Yankees {{at home in}} a rematch of the {{previous}} year's title game. The crowd of 80,067 was the second-largest in professional football history at the time. More people were turned away at the gates because Cleveland Stadium was filled to capacity. New York scored first in the first quarter on a 47-yard field goal by Harvey Johnson, but Cleveland came back in the second quarter, putting up 17 points to lead 17–3 at halftime. New York came back and tied the game 17–17 in the third quarter. Graham responded with a touchdown throw to Speedie in the third quarter. The Yankees threatened a comeback in the final minutes when Lou Sossman blocked a Groza field goal try and New York recovered, advancing the ball to Cleveland's 25-yard line. Cleveland, however, took over on downs and ran down <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>to</b> three minutes with a series of running plays, reaching New York's 35-yard line. Groza then attempted a field goal that fell short, but the Yankees were called offside, and Groza successfully booted his next try through, giving Cleveland a 26–17 victory. The Browns had 14 first downs to New York's 11 and rushed for 212 yards, compared to 111 for the Yankees. Graham had 11 completions for 161 passing yards despite being sacked five times for 72 yards of losses.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>to</b> secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. Only {{a minute and a}} half had run off the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunication}} and horology, a {{slave clock}} is a clock that depends for its accuracy on another clock, a master clock. Many modern clocks are synchronized, either through the Internet or by radio time signals, to a worldwide time standard called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{based on a}} network of master atomic clocks in many countries. For scientific purposes, precision clocks can be synchronized to within a few nanoseconds by dedicated satellite channels. Slave clock synchronization is usually achieved by phase-locking <b>the</b> slave <b>clock</b> signal <b>to</b> a signal received from <b>the</b> master <b>clock.</b> <b>To</b> adjust for <b>the</b> transit time of the signal from <b>the</b> master <b>clock</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slave <b>clock,</b> <b>the</b> phase of <b>the</b> slave <b>clock</b> may be adjusted {{with respect to the}} signal from <b>the</b> master <b>clock</b> so that both clocks are in phase.
