5|$|Bancroft {{served as}} player–manager for the Braves for three seasons, from 1924 through 1927. Upon {{becoming}} manager, {{he became the}} youngest manager in the National League (NL). He missed time during the 1924 season with appendicitis. After finishing in last place in the eight-team NL, Bancroft overhauled the Braves' roster for the 1925 season. However, he lost the services of Rube Marquard and Joe Genewich, and the Braves finished in fifth place. Bancroft suggested <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> Smith, ineffective as an infielder, become a pitcher; Smith's successes as a pitcher benefited the Braves' starting rotation. The Braves lacked offense going into the 1926 season, but hoped their pitching and defense could lead them into contention. The Braves finished in seventh place in the NL in 1926 and 1927.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Tate {{arrives and}} discovers <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> Ewell has {{died during the}} fight. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the {{prudence}} and ethics of charging Jem (whom Atticus believes to be responsible) or Boo (whom Tate believes to be responsible). Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective, and regrets {{that they had never}} repaid him for the gifts he had given them.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 57,000, Liverpool took an early lead through Terry McDermott, but Allan Simonsen {{equalised}} for Mönchengladbach {{early in the second}} half. Liverpool regained the lead midway through the second half with a goal from Tommy Smith, and Phil Neal ensured Liverpool won the match 3–1 to secure their first European Cup. The victory was a year after they had won the UEFA Cup, which meant <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> Paisley became the first manager to win the UEFA Cup and European Cup in successive seasons.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{tactical}} battle Liverpool {{were able to}} score in the 81st minute. A throw-in from Ray Kennedy found Alan Kennedy, whose run up the left hand side of the pitch caught Real off-guard. Kennedy went past Real defender Rafael García Cortés into the Real box, his subsequent shot beat the Real goalkeeper to give Liverpool the lead. Soon afterwards Liverpool replaced Dalglish with midfielder Jimmy Case {{in an attempt to}} see out the match. Although Liverpool had chances to extend their lead as Real went all out to score, Real keeper Agustín Rodríguez made a number of saves to keep his team in the game. The score remained 1–0 and Liverpool won their third European Cup, the first British club to do so. Liverpool's victory meant <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> Paisley became the first manager to win the European Cup three times.|$|E
5|$|Doggett soon attacks Mulder {{for looking}} into his son's case, but Reyes {{explains}} {{why they are}} investigating. She reveals <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> Harvey, a suspect in Luke's murder, died in the car crash in New Orleans. Reyes stresses her vision's importance, but Doggett dismisses it. Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption. He asks her what made her start to believe in the paranormal. She says she realized she was “afraid to believe.” Scully later tells Mulder to keep trying to help Doggett.|$|E
5|$|Former {{criminal}} Sideshow Bob is {{declared a}} changed man by Reverend Lovejoy and released from prison on a work program, despite the protests of Bart. Bob is surprised {{to be taken into}} the care of his brother Cecil as the two had previously not spoken for ten years. A flashback reveals the cause of this rift: Cecil had auditioned to become the new sidekick for Krusty the Clown, a job he had long desired, but Bob, who had not originally intended to be the sidekick, was chosen instead. Cecil, who is Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer, employs Bob to supervise the construction of a hydroelectric dam in a river near Springfield, while Bart, believing <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> is still evil, continuously follows him around. Bob begins to become intensely annoyed by Bart's intrusions into his personal life and the dam's incompetent laborers (Cletus and his family), and he expresses a desire to see the dam burst and obliterate Springfield.|$|E

5|$|The police {{arrive and}} Cecil is {{immediately}} arrested. Bob gloats over his victory, having gained the respect from Bart and Lisa, who now believed <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> has truly changed. Unfortunately, Chief Wiggum suddenly arrives and arrests Bob, believing {{him to be}} involved in the plot as well, despite Bart and Lisa's protests. As they are taken away, Cecil tricks Bob into swearing revenge on Bart and incriminating himself. Upon realizing that he just made Bart his enemy again, Bob gets angry at Cecil for it. Just after the brothers are taken away, the dam crumbles and releases a torrent of water on Springfield, only to do apparently minimal damage. Wiggum muses on the evil the brothers could concoct while locked up together; in reality, the brothers merely continue to bicker childishly, as Bob is still angry at Cecil for making Bart his nemesis again.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bart enlists Lisa to {{help find}} out what Sideshow Bob is up to, but only ends up being {{discovered}} rummaging in Bob's trash and angrily escorted home by him. They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares to blow it up, taking the money with him.|$|E

The Giant appears and confirms that Leland is Bob's host and Laura's and Maddy's killer. Bob assumes total control over Leland's body and confesses to a series of murders, before forcing Leland to commit suicide. Leland, as he dies, free of Bob's influence, tells Cooper <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> has possessed him ever since molesting him as a child. He begs for forgiveness, sees a vision of Laura welcoming him into the afterlife, and dies in Cooper's arms. The lawmen question whether Leland was truly possessed or mentally ill, and considers the possibility <b>that</b> <b>Bob</b> might still stalk the community of Twin Peaks in search of a new host.|$|E
