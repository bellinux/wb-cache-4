5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>where</b> the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall.|$|E
5|$|Five Bristol Fighters in bombing formation, {{took off}} at 11:40 with eight bombs each, which were dropped on {{retreating}} columns between Et Tire and Tulkarm. They also fired hundreds of machine gun bullets, scattering the retreating force towards Kakon and Tulkarm. At this time, machine gun {{fire from the}} ground aimed at the aircraft was fairly heavy, causing a number of casualties to the air crews. At 12:30, a second formation of three aircraft repeated {{the attack on the}} same retreating Ottoman column, which had reached the corner on the Tulkarm road. Six aircraft took off in the afternoon, two pursuing the retreating columns north of Kakon heading towards Baka, while four aircraft found soldiers, transport, artillery, horses, and camels moving from Tulkarm to Anebta. These they bombed and machine gunned, in a section of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>where</b> it passed the little Wadi Zeimer, through a gorge with steep hills on either side. Before the column could escape, another formation of seven Bristol Fighters attacked them, at about 17:00 west of Anebta. The evening patrols reported the Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters still at Nablus, but the entire Eighth Army appeared to be in retreat, with their Tulkarm headquarters already captured. At the crossroads of the Afulah and the coast roads at Sumrah, a supply base with hospital and grain dump was in flames and its inhabitants were seen retreating into the hills.|$|E

25|$|Pedestrians {{must often}} cross {{from one side}} of a road to the other, and in doing so may come into the way of {{vehicles}} traveling on the road.

25|$|Communication {{with other}} Maritime {{communities}} {{and the rest of}} the world had been mostly a seaborne enterprise until the middle part of the 19th century. While roads did exist, they were often poorly maintained Corduroy roads and it wasn't until 1836 that the Westmorland Road became passable year-round and regular stage coach and mail service between Halifax and Saint John could begin. The Bend was strategically located at a point along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>where</b> a layover and transfer point could be established.

25|$|The mining {{companies}} that owned <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>where</b> {{the first season}} was filmed felt the show portrayed the road in a negative fashion.

Also, the companies felt the cameras and filming created distractions for the drivers. As a result, the owners decided {{not to participate in}} future seasons of the show, and a new rule for the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Roads was enacted for the 2008 season, prohibiting commercial, media, video, or rolling film cameras either inside or attached to the outside of vehicles. In response, the show's producers located an alternate ice road for season 2.|$|E

The Bears tied it up with a 67-yard by Jahvid Best, who played his first game since dislocating his left shoulder three weeks prior against Colorado State. Cal went ahead with an 18-yard touchdown reception by Cameron Morrah and a field goal to take a 24–14 lead at the half.|$|E
25|$|The canal loops {{around the}} east and north of the village of Halton, passing under Perch bridge and Halton bridge, after which it runs in a {{generally}} north-easterly direction. There is a footpath {{on both sides of}} the canal at this point. As it reaches the edge of RAF Halton, there is a grade II listed bridge made of ornamental ironwork, with piers of ashlar stone and brick. Halton House is a large country house, built between 1881 and 1883 for Alfred de Rothschild, which has been used as an officers mess since 1919. At Harelane bridge, the footpath on the left bank stops, and the towpath continues on the right bank. On the opposite side to the towpath is Green Park, once the grounds of Aston Clinton house, where there is a wharf, and a swing bridge once gave access from the grounds to the towpath. The next crossing is Bucklandwharf Bridge, which carries the former A41 road, and the towpath crosses back to the left hand bank at this location. Just beyond it is an accommodation bridge, which allows residents to reach a row of cottages. As the canal approaches the A41 bypass, the old bed has been turned into a reedbed, to filter the runoff from the road before it enters the canal. A paddle controls the flow into the canal, which has been diverted to the south, to pass under <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>where</b> it is at a higher level. Beyond the crossing, the channel rejoins its original course, and continues to Drayton Beauchamp bridge.|$|E
