We show that by expropriating naive <b>traders</b> in direct mechanisms, the mechanism designer can subsidize additional trades by strategic <b>traders</b> and improve efficiency. In fact, complete expropriation of naive <b>traders</b> {{is a necessary}} condition for constrained efficiency. A significant implication is that in the presence of naive <b>traders,</b> ex-post individually rational mechanisms are not constrained efficient.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the formation of}} market prices in a new experimental setting involving multi-period asset markets with state-dependent fundamentals. We are particularly interested in two informational aspects: (1) the role of <b>traders</b> who are informed about the true state and (2) the provision of Bayesian updates of the assets state-dependent fundamental value (BFVs) to all <b>traders.</b> We find that bubbles are a rare phenomenon in all our treatments. Markets with asymmetrically informed <b>traders</b> converge faster toward the fundamentals of the underlying state and exhibit smaller price deviations from fundamentals, suggesting higher efficiency of markets with asymmetrically informed <b>traders.</b> The provision of BFVs has little to no effect. Behavior of informed and uninformed <b>traders</b> differs at the beginning but converges {{during the course of}} the markets. On average offers of uninformed <b>traders</b> are lower (higher) than offers of informed <b>traders</b> in the good (bad) state resulting in that uninformed <b>traders</b> hold less (more) assets in good (bad) state markets compared to informed <b>traders.</b> Informed <b>traders</b> earn superior profits...|$|R

40|$|We take {{a closer}} look at the {{question}} of whether dual <b>traders</b> in futures markets are indeed informed <b>traders.</b> Underpinning this question is the intuition that a dual <b>trader’s</b> decision to trade on his own account is not random, but is endogenously determined by his expectations of trading profits related to this decision. We employ a simultaneous equations model with two endogenous variables: (1) the binary decision of own account trading (or not), and (2) the trading profit resulting from his own account trading. Our test of whether dual <b>traders</b> are informed <b>traders</b> comprises of estimating the correlation between the error terms of the two equations in our model, where one error term proxies for a dual <b>trader’s</b> unobserved private information and the other captures his abnormal profit. Upon estimating the model, using the Bayesian approach, we find no evidence of significant correlation between a dual <b>trader’s</b> private information and his abnormal profit.

40|$|Abstract An {{explanation}} is {{provided for the}} evolution of segmented marketplaces in a pairwise exchange economy.

Large and small <b>traders,</b> however, cannot be distinguished a priori, and the existence of the small <b>traders</b> imposes a negative externality on the large <b>traders.</b> We show that, under conditions which are not very restrictive, establishing a separate market (perhaps with an entry fee) designated for the large <b>traders</b> induces the two types of <b>traders</b> to segment themselves. However, this segmentation is not necessarily welfare improving. Key words market segmentation, intermediation, heterogeneous agent...|$|R

40|$|We model a <b>trader’s</b> {{decision}} {{to supply liquidity}} by submitting limit orders or demand liquidity by submitting market orders in a limit order market. The best quotes and the execution probabilities and picking off risks of limit orders determine the price of immediacy. The price of immediacy and the <b>trader’s</b> willingness to pay for immediacy determine the <b>trader’s</b> optimal order submission, with the <b>trader’s</b> willingness to pay for immediacy depending on the <b>trader’s</b> valuation for the stock. We estimate the execution probabilities and the picking off risks using a sample from the Vancouver Stock Exchange to compute the price of immediacy. The price of immediacy changes with market conditions — a <b>trader’s</b> optimal order submission changes with market conditions. We combine the price of immediacy with the actual order submissions to estimate the unobserved arrival rates of <b>traders</b> {{and the distribution of}} the traders’ valuations.
