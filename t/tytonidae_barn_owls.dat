40|$|Natural {{selection}} typically constrains {{the evolution}} of sexually-selected characters. The evolution of naturally- and sexually-selected traits can be intertwined if they share part of their genetic machinery or if sex traits impair foraging success or {{increase the risk of}} depredation. The present study investigated phenotypic correlations between naturally- and sexually-selected plumage traits in the <b>Tytonidae</b> (<b>barn</b> <b>owls,</b> grass owls, and masked owls). Phenotypic correlations indicate the extent to which selection on one trait will indirectly influence {{the evolution of}} another trait. In this group of birds, the ventral body side varies from white to dark reddish, a naturally- selected pheomelanin-based colour trait with important roles in predator-prey interactions. Owls also exhibit eumelanin-based black spots, for which number and size signal different aspects of individual quality and are used in mate choice. These three plumage traits are strongly heritable and sexually dimorphic, with females being on average darker reddish and more spotted than males. Phenotypic correlations were measured between these three plumage traits in 3958 free-living barn owls in Switzerland and 10 670 skin specimens from 34 Tyto taxa preserved in museums. Across Tyto taxa, the sexually-selected plumage spottiness was positively correlated with the naturally- selected reddish coloration, with redder birds being more heavily spotted. This suggests that they are genetically constrained or that natural and sexual selection are not antagonistically exerted on plumage traits. In a large sample of Swiss nestlings and within 34 Tyto taxa, the three plumage traits were positively correlated. The production of melanin pigments for one plumage trait is therefore not traded off against the production of melanin pigments for another plumage trait. Only in the most heavily-spotted Tyto taxa do larger-spotted individuals display fewer spots. This indicates that, at some threshold value, the evolution of many spots constrains the evolution of large spots. These analyses raise the possibility that different combinations of melanin-based plumage traits may not be selectively equivalent...|$|E

40|$|Capsule: <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> pellets {{can be used}} {{to assess}} {{population}} changes in small mammals though with certain important reservations. Aims: To conduct a large-scale, long-term analysis of pellets regurgitated by <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> collected from a defined area of countryside within the UK south Midlands and compare results with those of other studies that have used pellet analysis to investigate the diet of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls.</b> Methods: Over 61 000 <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> pellets collected over 20 years in the south Midlands of England were analyzed. Results: We recorded a steady increase in the proportion of Field Voles in pellets over time at the expense of Wood Mice, and a positive relationship between various rainfall measures and the proportion of Field Voles in pellets. We suggest that the conclusions of previous studies of the diet of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> have often been predicated on inconsistent or untenable assumptions. Conclusion: We challenge some of the premises on which <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> pellet analyses have traditionally been based. We do not think that either a shortage of Field Voles in pellets, or of pellets containing the remains of more, smaller prey items, are indicative of foraging difficulty. <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> pellets {{can be used to}} assess population changes in small mammals, so long as possible causes of bias, which we discuss, are acknowledged...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> feeds {{primarily}} on small vertebrates, particularly rodents.

40|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> (Tyto alba) {{are killed}} by vehicle {{collisions}} in greater numbers than any other North American bird of prey. Interstate- 84 (I- 84) in southern Idaho, USA has among the worldâ€™s highest known rates of Barn Owl-vehicle collisions. Little is known about <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> occupancy in this region, so it is unclear if owls are killed in proportion to their abundance, or if they are equally abundant in segments with lower mortality and somehow escape collisions. Furthermore, studies of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> movements and behavior are limited. I was interested in understanding (1) factors that affect <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> occupancy in two seasons: early- and post-breeding, (2) <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> colonization of sites from early-breeding to post-breeding season, (3) examining the relationship between model-predicted occupancy, based on the factors I assessed, and roadway mortality established from observed <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> mortality locations, and (4) examining <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> behavior, movements and habitat selection, particularly in relation to I- 84. I conducted nighttime point counts for <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> in southern Idaho during the early- and post-breeding seasons (Jan â€“ Mar and Sept â€“ Nov 2014, respectively). I detected <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> during 52 of 666 (7. 8 %) point counts and at 39 of 222 (17. 6 %) locations in the early-breeding season and during 50 of 201 (24. 8 %) point counts and at 31 of 67 (46. 3 %) locations in the post-breeding season. During the early-breeding season, probability of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> detection was 0. 32 Â± 0. 06 (SE). Detection increased with playback of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> calls and with increasing Julian date, percent moon illumination, and cloud cover. <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> occupancy increased with increased proportion of crops and presence of trees, and it decreased as background noise level (dBA) increased. Probability of detection of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> was higher in the post-breeding season (0. 45 Â± 0. 07). Detection increased with playback of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> vocalizations, increasing Julian date, and decreasing background noise. During the post-breeding season, <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> occupancy {{was positively related to}} stream length and negatively related to proportion development and increasing distance from the Snake River. Of the potential models I assessed to describe colonization between seasons, there were two top models. The first model indicated that colonization of sites from the early- to post-breeding season declined with increasing terrain roughness while the second suggested that colonization increased with increasing cumulative stream length but decreased with distance to the Snake River and proportion development. Understanding factors influencing occupancy of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> will facilitate more effective conservation of this species in southern Idaho, especially in light of potential population declines related to roadway mortality. Using data from standardized roadkill surveys, I also compared road mortality locations of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> to model-predicted occupancy estimates to understand how occupancy may be influencing mortality along I- 84. Using the previously created occupancy models, I generated predicted occupancy at point-count locations which I then paired with the nearest interstate segment (1 - and 5 -km lengths) to examine the potential effects of occupancy and season on the likelihood of dead <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls.</b> The likelihood that 1 -km segments near point count locations included a dead <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> increased with occupancy and was greater during the early-breeding season. For 5 -km segments, there was an interaction between occupancy and season, with occupancy having a greater positive effect on mortality during the early-breeding season than in the post-breeding season. However, a substantial proportion of variation in roadway mortality at both scales (96 % and 56 % at 1 and 5 km scale respectively) was not explained by occupancy and season, so factors such as geometric roadway features, traffic patterns, fluctuations in small mammal abundance, and owl behavior near the interstate likely also influence mortality rates and locations. Finally, to address questions of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> behavior and movements in relation to I- 84, as well as habitat use I studied four adult male <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> that were tending nests during February 2015. Two of these nests were within 3 km of the interstate, whereas the other two were more than 25 km away. I examined the efficacy of GPS data loggers for tracking <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> and assessed six recapture methods to retrieve the data loggers. I obtained location data that spanned approximately two weeks of activity for each owl during the nesting season. I recaptured all instrumented males and found that manual- or laser-break triggered trap doors mounted on the nest box were most effective for recapturing <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls.</b> Within home ranges, the probability a <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> used a site was higher near trees and minor roads and lower as distance from the nearest stream and the nearest major road increased. <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> use of areas also increased as terrain roughness increased. Relative use of development, hay/pasture, and sage steppe land cover were less than for cultivated crops, while owls used grassland/herbaceous and wetland land cover more than cultivated crops. The two male <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> that nested within 3 km of the interstate never moved closer than 1 km even though their maximum movements ranged up to 3 km. Thus, it is possible major roadways function as barriers to adult owl movements during the breeding season because they avoid roads, but they remain susceptible to road mortality in their more rare attempts to cross...|$|R

40|$|Visual {{search is}} the process of searching for {{something}} interesting in a cluttered environment. It is well studied in humans, but not in non-primate species. This study provides a comprehensive overview of visual search in <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> using a novel methodology: the OwlCam. The OwlCam is a tiny, lightweight camera that can be mounted onto the head of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> to record first person videos from these birds. Due to the very limited eye movements of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> this provides an easy method of gaze tracking with only one camera in these birds which is not possible in most other species. Six experiments to investigate overt visual search processes in <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> are described. Experiment 1 investigates basic overt attentional processes in <b>barn</b> <b>owls.</b> The question was, whether <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> are attracted to the same conspicuous stimuli as humans? This was shown by confronting <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> with arrays of differently oriented stimuli containing one odd target among similar distracters. <b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> were attracted to the odd stimulus, as humans are. Experiments 2 and 3 prove that <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> have a pop-out effect. Pop-out is the ability of visual systems to detect and localize certain visual targets equally efficiently regardless of the complexity of visual distraction. This was tested by training the owls to search for a unique target in feature-search arrays. These feature searches contained several quantities of uniform distracters and one odd target, different from the distracters in either orientation (experiment 2) or intensity (experiment 3). The search time and number of saccades until the target was found did not change at different set sizes, showing that <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> have a pop-out effect. Experiment 4 was similar to experiment 3 but with inverted target and distracters to test whether <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> have search asymmetries. That may be the case, if a search taskâ€™s difficulty changes when the target and distracters are inverted. The data showed that this was the case. Finally, experiment 5 and 6 were conjunction-search tasks. These are difficult search tasks, in which the target is a unique combination of two features, orientation and intensity, and the distracters are the other feature combinations. The owls could learn to do these tasks, and indeed it took them much longer to find the targets than in the simples feature searches, and search time depended on array size. Thus, this study shows that <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> match human performance in several visual searches. Therefore, a pop-out effect or complex visual searches do not require the elaborate cortical structure found in mammalian brains. Furthermore, this study shows that <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> wearing OwlCams could be a model system to study visual search and overt attention in non-primate species...|$|R

As in humans and virtually any other animal, the CSF of the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> rendered the typical band-limited inverted u-shaped function, with attenuated sensitivities for high and low spatial frequencies. Maximal sensitivity of about 20 was at a spatial frequency of about 1 cyc/deg. With a similar discrimination task, rating acuity was measured in a separate behavioral experiment. The results, 3. 7 cyc/deg, are in good agreement with the high-frequency cut-off of the CSF, and put the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> on the very low end of the acuity spectrum compared to other owls and birds.

The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost one hundred percent occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|R
40|$|Winter {{weather has}} a strong {{influence}} on <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> (Tyto alba) breeding biology. Here, we analyzed the impacts of weather conditions on reproductive performance during the breeding season using data collected over 22 years in a Swiss <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> population. Variations in rain and temperature during the breeding season {{played an important role}} in within-year variation in <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> reproduction. An increase in rainfall during the period from 4 to 2 weeks preceding egg laying had a positive effect on clutch size. In contrast, fledgling body mass was negatively influenced by rainfall during the 24 h preceding the measurements. Finally, ambient temperature during the rearing period was positively associated with brood size at fledging. In conclusion, weather conditions during the breeding season place constraints on <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> reproduction...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} diet of the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> (Tyto alba) in an {{agricultural}} area of southern Brazil (29 degrees 36 'S, 52 degrees 11 'W), based on analysis of regurgitated remains. The results clearly {{showed that the}} diet of the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> reflects the human impact on its habitat. The cosmopolitan house mouse (Mus musculus) was the most preyed upon small mammal (81. 9 %) {{and the most important}} in terms of the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> ingested biomass (69 %). This rodent, due to its small size, is also responsible for the relatively low me-an weight off small mammal prey in the owl diet (19. 6 g). In southern Brazilian agroecosystems, the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> probably feeds mainly on mice due to their great abundance in crop fields and grain storage areas of the region...|$|R
