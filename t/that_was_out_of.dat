25|$|During the English Civil War, Plymouth {{declared}} for Parliament and was {{the subject}} of a prolonged Royalist siege between 1642 and 1646. At this time Millbay was the only harbour of Plymouth <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach of the Royalist artillery so it became the sole source of resupply for the town. From the end of the Civil War Millbay reverted to a quiet anchorage with no jetties or port facilities, but in 1756 John Smeaton built a jetty and workyard in the south west corner of the harbour for unloading and working the stone for the third Eddystone Lighthouse. A ten-ton ship, named the Eddystone Boat, was based here and took the worked stones out to the reef.|$|E
25|$|Inge King (née Ingeborg Viktoria Neufeld) {{was born}} in Berlin on 26 November 1915, the {{youngest}} of four girls in a well-to-do Jewish family. Her early childhood was typical one for a child of her class and time in a European city. But after World War I, conditions in Germany became increasingly difficult. The period of the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), though a culturally stimulating time, was never stable. Conditions were made more difficult by the hyper-inflation of the early 1920s and the depression of 1929. During that time, things became increasingly difficult for the Neufeld family. By the time King's father died in 1930, when she was 14, the family had lost most of its money. Her older sisters supported her to stay at school until she finished, in 1932, which enabled her {{to get a good}} education. She {{would have liked to have}} gone on to university, possibly to study medicine, but, financially, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the question.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographical}} {{layout of}} Teotihuacan {{is a good}} example of the Mesoamerican tradition of planning cities, settlements, and buildings as a representation of the view of the Universe. Its urban grid is aligned to precisely 15.5º east of North. One theory says this is due to the fact that the sun rose at that same angle during the same summer day each year. Settlers used the alignment to calibrate their sense of time or as a marker for planting crops or performing certain rituals. Another theory is that there are numerous ancient sites in Mesoamerica that seem to be oriented with the tallest mountain in their given area. This appears to be the case at Teotihuacan, although the mountain to which it is oriented is not visible from within the Teotihuacan complex due to a closer mountain ridge. Pecked-cross circles throughout the city and in the surrounding regions indicate how the people managed to maintain the urban grid over long distances. It also enabled them to orient the Pyramids to the distant mountain <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Franz Ferdinand became heir {{presumptive}} (Thronfolger) {{to the throne}} of Austria-Hungary in 1896, after the deaths of his cousin Rudolf (in 1889) and his father Karl Ludwig. The relationship between him and Franz Joseph {{had always been a}} fairly contentious one, which was further exacerbated when Franz Ferdinand announced his desire to marry Countess Sophie Chotek, a match <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the question {{in the mind of the}} emperor, as Sophie was merely of nobility as opposed to being of dynastic rank. Although the emperor was receiving letters from members of the imperial family throughout the fall and winter of 1899 importuning him to relent, Franz Joseph stood his ground. He finally gave his consent in 1900; however, the marriage was to be morganatic and any children of the marriage would be ineligible to succeed to the throne. The couple were married on 1 July 1900 at Reichstadt. The emperor did not attend the wedding, nor did any of the archdukes. After that, the two men disliked and distrusted each other.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the second}} Algérie Ferries charter, the Fantaasia was {{chartered}} to the Norway-based Kystlink {{for three months}} (with an option for three additional months) from October 2007 onwards to replace their MS Pride of Telemark <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service following an accident when the ship rammed the breakwater at Hirtshals, Denmark. Before entering service for Kystlink, Fantaasia was docked at Cityvarvet, Gothenburg. On 15 November, the Swedish Maritime Authority Sjöfartsinspektionen deemed the ship unsafe and prohibited it from leaving Cityvarvet until 18 faults found during the inspection were fixed. Twelve of the faults were considered severe, including several permanently open watertight doors, a non-functional loudspeaker system, blocked emergency exists and non-functional winches used for lowering lifeboats. According to Tallink, the inspection was made while refitting of the ship was still in process, which they cited as the reason why several onboard systems were turned off-line and normal safety procedures were not observed. On 11 December, the ship entered service with Kystlink on its Langesund–Hirtshals and Langesund–Strömstad routes.|$|E

25|$|USS Ferret {{was part}} of a naval fleet that sailed to the Caribbean to subdue the {{occurrence}} of pirate raids on merchant ships that had increased to almost 3,000 by the early 1820s. The financial losses to the United States was great while murder and the practice of torture were common. Losses to American ships and merchants had increased to such proportions that the situation began making headlines in American newspapers. In little time merchants and shippers along with the American public were demanding that the U.S. Navy take definite action against piracy <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. In November 1822 when the captain of the USS Alligator was killed in a battle with the notorious Cuban pirate Domingo that was the last straw. Response was quick and by 22 December President James Monroe authorized the creation of the West Indies squadron for purposes of seeking and routing out pirates and their numerous strongholds about the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. They were also directed to suppress the international slave trade which also operated out of this region and outlawed in the United States. Following Monroe's authorization the Secretary of the Navy, Smith Thompson, promoted David Porter to commodore, allocated $500,000 to him and appointed him to take commanded of and outfit the squadron for war against the pirates. British interests in the Caribbean also threatened, the West Indies squadron fought piracy in a concerted effort with the Royal Navy.|$|E

By {{the late}} 1950s Mao {{had developed a}} lifestyle <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> touch with Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity. Mao enjoyed a private pool in Zhongnanhai, and had many villas around China built for him, which he would travel to on a private train. Mao enjoyed the companionship of an ever-changing succession of enthusiastic young women whom he met either on weekly dances in Zhongnanhai or on his journeys by train. Mao had a costly office suite built for him in Beijing, including a private, book-lined study. When Peng's wife suggested the couple spend more free time visiting Mao's quarters, Peng was reluctant, stating that Mao's surroundings were [...] "too luxuriously furnished" [...] for him to tolerate. Throughout the 1950s, Peng continued {{to refer to the}} Chairman as [...] "Old Mao", an egalitarian title that was used among senior CCP leaders in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
500|$|Reformers {{included}} William Jennings Bryan, while opponents counted respected {{figures such}} as Elihu Root and George Frisbie Hoar among their number; Root cared so strongly about the issue that {{after the passage of}} the Seventeenth Amendment, he refused to stand for re‑election to the Senate. Bryan and the reformers argued for popular election through highlighting perceived flaws with the existing system, specifically corruption and electoral deadlocks, and through arousing populist sentiment. Most important was the populist argument; that there was a need to [...] "Awaken, in the senators...a more acute sense of responsibility to the people", which it was felt they lacked; election through state legislatures was seen as an anachronism <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> step with the wishes of the American people, and one that had led to the Senate becoming [...] "a sort of aristocratic body – too far removed from the people, beyond their reach, and with no special interest in their welfare".

500|$|Some of the album's {{songs were}} {{recorded}} by Saadiq with his live band, which included drummer Lemar Carter, bassist Calvin Turner, and guitarist Rob Bacon. Bacon, {{who had played}} with Saadiq since 2002, said of their grittier approach to guitar, [...] "I have relative pitch, as opposed to perfect pitch, so there'd be times when I'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument. Then he'd come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was left the day before. On one of the tracks I had to play over all this stuff <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tune. Raphael was like, 'That's what makes it funky!'". Musical guests such as vocalist Yukimi Nagano, keyboardist Larry Dunn, bass player Larry Graham, keyboardist Amp Fiddler, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph {{also contributed to the}} album's recording sessions, with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks. The song [...] "Go to Hell" [...] was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler's Mellotron ideas. Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called [...] "The Perfect Storm", included as a hidden track on the album: [...] "I played bass, but I put my bass down [...] The first day I tried to play bass for him, I couldn't even play.
