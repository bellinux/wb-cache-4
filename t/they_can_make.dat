Similar to [...] "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"'s lifeline with the same name, in the Drop's [...] "Phone a Friend", the contestants <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a telephone call {{to one of their}} relatives before the clock starts. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> only <b>make</b> one phone call in the game.|$|R

Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are gregarious. While they {{sometimes}} live solitarily, {{they are more}} commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist {{of as many as}} 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.|$|E
5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E
50|$|A {{timekeeper}} {{is often}} referred to as a time clock, which tracks employee time. Collecting such data gives employers insight into their workforce. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> then <b>make</b> operational decisions to increase productivity and reduce labor costs.|$|R

5|$|One day, {{after trying}} to make the troublemaker Zhang {{apologize}} for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to go find work in the nearby city of Zhangjiakou. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.|$|E
5|$|Tidus makes few {{appearances}} in {{the plot of the}} 2003 sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, although meeting him is the player's objective. Two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, Yuna sees a sphere with a young man (resembling Tidus) trapped in a prison. She joins the Gullwings, a sphere-hunting group, and travels around Spira in the hope of finding more clues that Tidus is alive. The individual in the sphere is later revealed as Shuyin. Depending on the player's development during the game, the fayth will appear to Yuna at the end and tell her that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> Tidus return to her. He then appears in Spira, and he and Yuna are reunited. In another final scene, Tidus (unsure whether or not he is still a dream) wants to remain with Yuna. He is also an unlockable character as Star Player, a blitzball player. In Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission (the game's updated version), Tidus is a playable character for battles. An extra episode, set after the original game's play-through, reveals that he is living in Besaid with Yuna. An illusion of Tidus also appears as a boss character.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{there was}} {{criticism}} of the increasing commercialism of the Pay-To-Play fringe venues who charge acts to perform {{in advance of the}} fringe. In many cases venue costs such as: venue rents / guarantees, compulsory marketing and various deductions mean that performers are being charged more than <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> back in ticket sales.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of the strong-club system is its vulnerability to preemptive bids. Knowing that <b>they</b> rarely <b>can</b> <b>make</b> game against a strong-club opening, experienced opponents {{will compete in}} the bidding with distributional hands, regardless of strength, and rob bidding space from the opening side.|$|R
50|$|All tuition {{awards are}} interest-free. Applicants sign a pledge stating that upon graduating or discontinuing their education, they will repay their tuition award. Past {{recipients}} determine the pace at which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> comfortably <b>make</b> repayments, and generally {{do so on}} a monthly basis.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} a full online mode, through either Xbox LIVE for Xbox 360 users or PSN for PlayStation 3 users. Players start out online with minimal stats, similar to Legacy Mode. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> then <b>make</b> {{progress through the}} ranks by winning fights.|$|R
25|$|If a team {{makes their}} last cup, {{the other team}} loses unless <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> all of their {{remaining}} cups; {{this is called a}} rebuttal or redemption. If the losing team can hit their redemption shots, then the game is forced into overtime where three cups are used instead of the normal ten cups.|$|E
25|$|Since the Vocaloid or its vocal {{library is}} {{released}} for producers {{to do as}} they please, some producers think of the Vocaloids as dolls and that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> them sing whatever they want. The portrayals of Vocaloids can at times touch controversial issues. Releases put out as young children risk becoming subject to sexual or pedophilic portrayals.|$|E
25|$|AIESEC is the world's {{second largest}} {{non-profit}} youth-run organization. It {{is an international}} non-governmental not-for-profit organization that provides young people with leadership development and cross-cultural global internship and volunteer exchange experiences across the globe, with a focus to empower young people so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> {{a positive impact on}} society.

25|$|Scurvy {{does not}} occur in most animals as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> their own vitamin C. However, humans and other higher {{primates}} (the simians—monkeys and apes—and tarsiers), guinea pigs, most or all bats, and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme (L-gulonolactone oxidase) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet. The gene for L-gulonolactone oxidase is still present in the human genome, but deactivated by DNA mutations.|$|E
25|$|While most medical {{transcription}} agencies prefer {{candidates with}} a minimum of one year experience, formal instruction is not a requirement, and there is no mandatory test. Some hospitals require nothing more than a diploma for employment as a medical transcriptionist. The average pay range for an in-house MT in a hospital setting is $8/hr. However, MT/HDS can expect to receive anywhere from $12-$19 an hour, depending if they are working in a union or non-union environment. This large gap is because the job is based on production, so the more an MT can produce, the more <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alex and Chase rent a {{ship and}} begin a two-month journey through Armstrong space. At their destination, {{they find a}} red dwarf star with two planets in its {{habitable}} zone. One {{appears to be a}} terrestrial world and they move toward it. From a distance, they are able to see something artificial orbiting this world. Moving closer, they can see first that it is a ship, then that it is a warship, and then that it is a Dellacondan warship. Finally, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> out clearly the ship’s insignia – the famous markings of Corsarius, Christoper Sim’s own.|$|E

25|$|Elevation to yokozuna rank is a {{multi-stage}} process. After a tournament, the Yokozuna Deliberation Council, {{a body of}} {{lay people}} (that is, not former sumo wrestlers) who are appointed by the Japan Sumo Association to provide an independent quality control on yokozuna promotion, meet and discuss {{the performance of the}} top-ranked wrestlers. Usually at the instigation of the Japan Sumo Association <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a recommendation that a particular ōzeki-ranked wrestler has the necessary attributes to be promoted. Their recommendation is then passed to the Judging division and then the Board of Directors of the Sumo Association who make the final decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} problem {{are with}} fares. As the minibuses {{do not have}} fixed fares, routes and timetables, the fluctuations in fares can be quite large. Some routes may reduce their fares to an unreasonable price {{in order to win}} more passengers, but when demand increases (e.g. during typhoons, when regulated buses and minibuses services are suspended), <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> increases in fares without limitation. For example, the route from Aberdeen to Wah Fu Estate could increase from $3 to $30 (probably equivalent to the fare travelled on a taxi), and the route from Jordan Road to Yuen Long could increase to $80, such acts have resulted in complaints from passengers.|$|E
25|$|Harry {{travels to}} Nantes with Louise {{and the girls}} while Marie stays in Paris with Victor, who is slowly recovering. Upon their arrival in Nantes, Harry struggles to find a ship that will carry them to England. Louise, {{weakened}} by the long and trying journey, soon falls ill and dies. Jeanne finds passage to England with a fisherman named Adolphe, the husband of a woman whose child Jeanne helped nurse back to health. Before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> the arrangements, however, Jeanne and Virginie are arrested. Harry narrowly rescues them from being drowned in the river with the other prisoners, and they find a trustworthy captain {{to take them to}} England.|$|E
