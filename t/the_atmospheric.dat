5|$|For giant stars, <b>the</b> <b>atmospheric</b> microturbulence {{can result}} in line {{broadening}} that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal.

The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E

5|$|Sperm whales {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere.

By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E
