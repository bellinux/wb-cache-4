5|$|In 2005, 3% of {{the parish}} {{population}} were unemployed and 25% were retired. The retirement figure increased in the Pinelands and Ravenswing areas, with a statistic of 42%. Most residents' places of work are in surrounding towns, with their location in the parish largely dictating where <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The 2005 survey identified that residents in the south {{of the parish}} (Falcon Fields and Ravenswing/Pinelands) travel towards Tadley and Basingstoke whereas those further north in the parish tend to find work in Reading, Newbury and London.|$|E
5|$|Willie Nelson {{was born}} in Abbott, Texas on April 29, 1933, during the Great Depression, to Myrle Marie (née Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson. He was born on April 29, but his birth was {{recorded}} by doctor F. D. Sims on April 30. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> Nelson's grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{played for}} Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897, as an all-rounder {{who opened the}} batting and bowled medium paced seamers. He took 92 wickets in his first season, and {{discovered}} that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success. He decided to change his bowling style to spin, and spent the winter of 1896–97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway, this time as a signalman. Over several months, Rhodes used his practice sessions to develop control of spin and different types of delivery. Consequently, {{in his second season}} at Galashiels, now bowling slow left-arm, he took fewer wickets but at a better average. At the end of the 1897 season, encouraged by a Scottish member of the MCC, he resigned from Gala <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in England.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{the sugar}} industry, on which Vieques was totally dependent, went into decline due to falling sugar prices and {{industrial}} unrest. Many locals {{were forced to}} move to mainland Puerto Rico or Saint Croix <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|With his six {{remaining}} {{daughters to}} provide for, Khan, {{and the young}} Madhubala, began to pay frequent visits to Bombay film studios <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> At the age of 9, this was Madhubala's introduction to the movie industry, which would provide financial help to her family.|$|E
25|$|His {{father died}} on 11 December 1757, leaving Theophilus just £50 in his will, and the {{following}} day Theophilus wrote to the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, asking for work in a theatre. Theophilus' eulogy to his father, delivered on stage dressed in mourning, was not a success, and he was forced <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> elsewhere. Thomas Sheridan offered him work at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. On the trip to Ireland, his ship, the Dublin Trader with about 60 passengers on board, foundered in a storm, and was wrecked on the Scottish coast. He was lost at sea.|$|E

25|$|Levi {{was almost}} unrecognisable {{on his return}} to Turin. Malnutrition edema had bloated his face. Sporting a scrawny beard and wearing an old Red Army uniform, he {{returned}} to Corso Re Umberto. The next few months gave him an opportunity to recover physically, re-establish contact with surviving friends and family, and start looking for work. Levi suffered from the psychological trauma of his experiences. Having {{been unable to find}} work in Turin, he started <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in Milan. On his train journeys, he began to tell people he met stories about his time at Auschwitz.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of female {{circular}} migrants has increased rapidly. In {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century, South Africa's internal policies only permitted men to legally migrate to the city. This influx control was lifted in 1986, thus paving the way for women to begin migrating to urban areas. However, the change first affected permanent migration patterns, as female circular migration did not begin to increase substantially until over a decade later, mostly due to changing economic conditions. Overall, mobility in South Africa is high and continues to grow, as circular migration is carried out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> and raise children in areas with better schools.|$|E
25|$|On a cold {{morning of}} February 1827, John left {{his home and}} went <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> as a farm-servant. At 12, he found life at home {{unbearable}} because of the continuous quarrels with Antonio. Having to face life by himself {{at such a young}} age may have developed his later sympathies to help abandoned boys. After begging unsuccessfully for work, Bosco ended up at the wine farm of Louis Moglia. Although Bosco could pursue some studies by himself, he was not able to attend school for two more years. In 1830 he met Joseph Cafasso, a young priest who identified some natural talent and supported his first schooling. In 1835 Bosco entered the seminary at Chieri, next to the Church of the Immacolata Concezione. In 1841, after six years of study, he was ordained priest on the eve of Trinity Sunday by Archbishop Franzoni of Turin.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this test is <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>works</b> of Celso Furtado and Raymundo Faoro, explanations for the delay Brazilian who currently can still {{be perceived as a}} function of poverty and social inequalities that affect {{a large portion of the}} population. This is a theoretical test and the method is a reinterpretation of these interpreters of Brazil based on a third author (Douglass North) representative of the so-called New Institutional Economics. The main conclusion we emphasize that the three authors, to examine the problems affecting the development of a country have in common the emphasis on institutions, history and the role of elites...|$|R

500|$|Hepburn {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} plays with a summer stock company in Ivoryton, Connecticut, and she proved to be a hit. During the summer of 1931, Philip Barry asked her to appear in his new play, The Animal Kingdom, alongside Leslie Howard. They began rehearsals in November, Hepburn feeling sure the role would make her a star, but Howard disliked the actress and again she was fired. When she asked Barry why she had been let go, he responded, [...] "Well, to be brutally frank, you weren't very good." [...] This unsettled the self-assured Hepburn, but she continued <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> She took a small role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began she was asked to read for the lead in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband.|$|E
500|$|Written {{simultaneously}} with the concluding episode, [...] "The Time Is Now", the episode's script went through several different versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series {{would not be}} renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being {{the result of a}} virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The build-up to, and depiction of, the viral outbreak was seen by the writing staff as conclusive proof that the series would be cancelled, leading to several writers beginning <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> on other projects while still officially under contract to work on Millennium.|$|E
500|$|War {{work again}} brought local {{prosperity}} during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen {{due to the}} Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, {{at a time when}} Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading [...] "Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights." ...|$|E

50|$|Carleton as {{a diplomat}} had a wide general correspondence, {{as well as}} letters from George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury, {{concerned}} with English apostates and possible conversions of Catholics. He exchanged information with intelligencers such as Sarpi who had a large network, and recruited informants, such as the Neapolitan jurist Giacomo Antonio Marta. Encouraged by Walter Cope, he began also <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>works</b> of art <b>for</b> Charles, Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury; Carleton, like his predecessor in Venice Sir Henry Wotton, effectively promoted Italian aesthetics and the Grand Tour to the Stuart upper crust and <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> Venetian <b>works</b> of art that might be acquired by Charles I (then Duke of York) {{and other members of}} the Whitehall group.|$|R

500|$|On 10 February 1964, {{barely a}} month after he turned 16, Lamb confronted a {{physically}} imposing police sergeant outside the Windsor Arena and, {{in front of a}} large crowd of people, leapt upon the far larger man and repeatedly punched him in the face. According to journalist Bob Sutton's account in the Windsor Star (published three years later), Lamb did this [...] "for no apparent reason". Lamb was convicted of assault under the Juvenile Delinquents Act and served six months at the House of Concord, a young offenders' unit near London, Ontario, run by the Salvation Army. Upon his release, Lamb was sent by his step-grandfather to live in East Windsor with his uncle, Earl Hesketh. With Hesketh's support, Lamb briefly attended Assumption College School, where apart from a dislike for learning Latin, he performed creditably. However, with no real motivation to study, the boy soon dropped out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> He was unable to hold down a permanent job and drifted through a series of short-term engagements, none lasting more than three months.|$|E
500|$|Bill Russell {{was born}} to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in West Monroe, Louisiana. Like almost all {{southern}} towns and cities of that time, West Monroe was a highly segregated place, and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives. Once, Russell's father was refused service {{at a gas station}} until the staff had taken care of all the white customers. When his father attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he didn't stay and wait his turn. At another time, Russell's mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a policeman accosted her. He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as [...] "white woman's clothing". Because large numbers of blacks were moving to the West during World War II <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> there, Russell's father moved the family out of Louisiana when Russell was eight years old and settled them in Oakland, California. While there the family fell into poverty, and Russell spent his childhood living in a series of public housing projects.|$|E
