40|$|The {{contribution}} {{comes out}} of the data obtained from graphical outputs analyses of the evaluation combustion process and from the experimental outcomes of compression of materials. The thermoanalytical methods used for the evaluation included the derivational <b>thermic</b> <b>analysis</b> (DTA) and the thermographic analysis (TGA). The paper follows the effect of the weight of lignine content in biopellets on their volume density change...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{electrochemical}} deposition of coatings of highly entropic alloys. These relatively new materials have been recently intensively studied. The paper describes the first results of electrochemical coating with highly entropic alloys by deposition from non-aqueous solutions. An electrochemical device {{was designed and}} coatings were deposited. The coatings were characterised with electronic microscopy scanning, atomic absorption spectrometry and X-ray diffraction methods and the combination of methods of <b>thermic</b> <b>analysis</b> of differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry...|$|E
40|$|Internal erosion, {{linked with}} the leakage presence, is a well known menace for the dams and the dikes safety. In the paper we present a method called Impulse Response Function <b>Thermic</b> <b>Analysis</b> (IRFTA) and its {{application}} to earths dams monitoring. IRFTA model allows precisely describe the coupled heat and water transport in dams body and in consequence recognizing even minimal seepage appearance and changing. Application of IRFTA model to analyze the temperature measurements realized with fiber optic for two earth dams are presented in the article...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOrganophilic {{smectite}} {{were obtained}} by intercalation of hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (HDTMA) in the interlayer space of a purified Tunisian sodic-smectite. The HDTMA amounts were varied from 0. 5 to 3 times the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the purified clay. Adsorption isotherm shows a total adsorption of HDTMA by purified smectite when the quantity of salt is less or equal to 2 CEC. Beyond this value, adsorption becomes limited and tends to saturation. All organoclays were characterized by X-ray diffraction which shows an increase of the basal distance. Infrared spectroscopy and differential <b>thermic</b> and thermogravimetric <b>analysis</b> results confirm the intercalation HDTMA...|$|R
40|$|Plasmapheresis fluids from 20 {{patients}} with clinically active SLE, from three {{patients with}} Waldenstrom's disease, from three patients with rheumatoid arthritis, two patients with myasthenia gravis {{and other diseases}} including active systemic disorders were precipitated using polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG). By applying ethidium bromide staining, plasma nucleic acids (PNA) could be demonstrated in PEG-precipitates of SLE patients exclusively. Purified immunoglobulins of SLE plasma precipitates were shown to form antigen-antibody complexes with PNA as demonstrated by electronmicroscopy. Further characterization of PNA by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a molecular weight up to 20 kbp. Cesium chloride buoyant density gradients showed non-homogeneous molecules, excluding pure microbial origin. In spite of RNase digestion, the PNA contained RNA with 30 - 70 % riboguanosine as shown by nucleoside analysis. The high amount of guanosine-rich RNA was further supported by similarities between PNA and polyriboguanylic acid in hyperchrome shifting due to <b>thermic</b> denaturation. HPLC <b>analysis</b> showed a molecular weight of ribonucleic acids of more than 60 b thus excluding mere oligonucleotides. In contrast to B-type dsDNA, PNA from SLE patients were immunogenic. Antibodies against PNA could be induced in rabbits by subcutaneous injection. The antisera thus obtained showed crossreactivity with polyriboguanylic acid and dsDNA preparations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} {{researches}} {{was to establish}} the optimum conditions in the cleaning process of a waste water with Co content and to retrieve the metal (Co) in form of crystalline CoC 2 O 4 · 3 H 2 O. It had been studied parameters like: the pH, the optimal dose of reagent precipitant, the cobalt concentration and the temperature. For this study were used analysis methods like chemical, spectral and <b>thermic</b> <b>analysis.</b> Basis on the experimental data we obtained a cobalt recovery degre...|$|E
40|$|This bachelor´s thesis {{focuses on}} {{assessment}} of selected properties of emulsion cosmetic product called Soothing face mask, which {{is produced by}} SynCare company. Thesis is targeted on rheological properties of the product. Basic rheological properties were measured by Brookfield viscosimeter in experimental part of the thesis. Short part of the text is dedicated to <b>thermic</b> <b>analysis</b> field, which may provide some useful pieces of information for storage of products in cryogenic temperature and development of emulsion products with good cryogenic-temperature resistance. Chemical properties of Soothing face mask product are expressed by description of particular characteristics of cosmetic ingredients in the product...|$|E

The opportunity of mixed-ligand complex formation in iron(III) -bromoacetic acid system was shown. The first co-ordination sphere of the iron atom in compound 2 includes two different carboxylate anions, CH 2 BrCOO- and CH 2 ClCOO- in the capacity of syn-syn- bidentate-bridged ligands, while Br- and Cl- anions being in the ratio 1 : 1, formulate the external sphere of the complex. The IR spectra, <b>thermic</b> <b>analysis</b> and magnetic properties of complexes were studied...|$|E
