It had been Limbert's general prayer that we would during this period let him quite alone.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} how {{research}} {{works as a}} process of interpretive enquiry. It argues that research is necessarily a heuristic endeavour the outcomes of which cannot be pre-specified. When we ask open questions, we cannot presume <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> <b>The</b> practice of interpretive enquiry requires patience, a waiting mind, a kind of stillness: dispositions that are difficult to acquire. We outline this line of argument in the opening section. The central section is concerned with a specific case: how do we begin to frame questions regarding the experience of students of Chinese origin in an English university that has its own complicated history of institutional development. We build this chapter around that central story of intellectual discovery and conceptualisation. The final section – attempting to weave the various strands into a single thread – returns to the indeterminacy of enquiry. What, under such epistemological circumstances, constitutes a beginning...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Your {{despatch}} {{of yesterday}} has been received, and it disappoints and distresses me. I have shown it to General McClellan, {{who says he}} will write you to-day. I am not competent to criticize your views, and therefore what I offer is in justification of myself. Of the two, I {{would rather have a}} point on the railroad south of Cumberland Gap than Nashville. First, because it cuts a great artery of the enemy's communication, which Nashville does not; and secondly, because it {{is in the midst of}} loyal people who would rally around it, while Nashville is not. Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be a diversion in your favor rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a movement toward Nashville is the main object. But my distress is that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even now, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection. In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South. My despatch, to which yours is an answer, was sent with the knowledge of Senator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East Tennessee, and they will be upon me <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> which I cannot safely show them. They would despair, possibly resign to go and save their families somehow, or die with them. I do not intend this to be an order in any sense, but merely, as intimated before, to show you the grounds of my anxiety.|$|E
