25|$|Patterson {{died from}} 27 stab wounds <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and back. Her body was {{discovered}} naked from the waist down, with her skirt found in a nearby bedroom and her underwear around her ankles. Small pieces of yellow PVC tape were attached to her body and both of her breasts had been removed using a sharp knife. Her handbag and driver's licence were stolen during the attack. The murder weapon and Patterson's breasts have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|Others mate in December with a {{gestation}} period {{of four to}} five months, and give birth in April or May. Mothers {{give birth to a}} single pup in a litter. Mothers take care of the young after birth; the males take no part in raising it. The pup clings to its mother's abdomen during flight and when perched. The young will remain with the mother, clinging <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> wherever she goes, until it is able to fly. The mother nurses the young during this time. The young drink their mother's milk until they are weaned onto their adult diet of insects. The time spent with the mother allows the young to observe hunting behavior as well as learn other skills necessary for survival as an adult. Once the young bat is able to fly, it can forage for itself. It may stay with the mother's colony or find another when it is grown.|$|E
2500|$|A Ride for Liberty – The Fugitive Slaves (1862), which {{depicts a}} slave family riding at dawn to freedom, also invites interpretation. Johnson places the slave family {{squarely}} {{in the center of}} the work, acting as agents of their own destiny. It appears to be dawn and in the distance is light on bayonets, indicating Union lines. A man rides with a child in front of him; behind him, a woman holds an infant close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> She looks behind her as if worried about pursuers, or wondering what she left behind. Curator Eleanor Harvey writes the painting [...] "captures the moment when the full scope of the slavery question begins to loom. Johnson placed these people {{squarely in the}} foreground and, in doing so, elevated their plight in the national debate." ...|$|E
5000|$|He has nicknamed Yoruka [...] "titty-chan" [...] ("Lil' Miss Funbags" [...] in the English translation) due <b>to</b> <b>her</b> large breasts. Although {{he appears}} to have {{developed}} legitimate feelings for her, his main interest remains <b>to</b> be <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|R
50|$|At the {{abandoned}} home next door, the neighborhood children play {{and set up}} a large cardboard box they find. One summer, the narrator enters the box with a boy, who begins <b>to</b> touch <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> The narrator continues to enter the box with the boy.|$|R
50|$|Jordan {{returns to}} the manor and confronts Pamela with his discovery. Pamela drugs Jordan's coffee and then places a scarab beetle on his {{unconscious}} body. The beetle drains his life until he has turned to dust. She then applies the scarab <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>chest.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Guppy, whose incessant smiling {{gave her}} quite a waggish appearance, did as her son {{requested}} {{and then sat}} down in a corner, holding her pocket handkerchief <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> like a fomentation, with both hands.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Matilda was {{laughing}} a little--as {{she always did}} when Randall came. It was a habit with her, hanging over {{from the early days}} of Randall's courtship. Janet went on into their room to tell Avery. And lo, Avery was lying asleep on her bed, tired out from her busy day. Janet, after one glance, flew <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> She took out her pill box and opened it, a little fearfully. The toad ointment was there, dark and unpleasant enough to view. Janet tiptoed breathlessly to the bed and gingerly scraped the tip of her finger in the ointment.|$|E
50|$|This {{limestone}} sculpture depicts Mother Mary at full-length {{holding an}} infant (Christ?) <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> She wears a robe which covers her body fully {{as well as}} her head. She has bare-feet that peek out from under the robe and she has long hair. She looks towards her proper right as she holds the baby, wrapped in a small blanket, <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> She stands on a square-ish pedestal and stands on the stone border of a fountain.|$|E
5000|$|Topfreedom is a {{cultural}} and political movement seeking changes in laws to allow women to be topless in public places where men are permitted to be barechested, {{as a form of}} gender equality. Specifically, the movement seeks the repeal or overturning of laws which restrict a woman's right not <b>to</b> have <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> covered at all times in public.|$|R

[...] This woman had no blood pressure, no pulse, and ordinarily we would have opened up <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> Instead, since we weren’t in the {{operating}} room, we applied external cardiac massage. [...] Her blood pressure and pulse came back at once.

50|$|The patient supine on the {{examination}} table {{and holds the}} uninvolved knee <b>to</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> while allowing the involved extremity to lie flat. Holding the knee to the chest flattens out the lumbar lordosis and stabilizes the pelvis.|$|R
50|$|An {{officer is}} {{transformed}} into a monster after an accident involving an old laboratory belonging to Flash villain Doctor Alchemy. Dr. Alchemy later changes the composition of Renee Montoya's necklace, causing it <b>to</b> permanently scar <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> with the dual venus symbol.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mind your {{starboard}} oar," [...] said a deep voice, {{which caused}} Flora's heart <b>to</b> beat against <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> {{as if that}} dear little receptacle of good thoughts and warm feelings were too small to contain it, and it wanted to get out.|$|R

5000|$|Darling tapes a {{bag over}} the man’s head, suffocating him, {{and puts his}} body in the tub. Darling goes to sleep, {{clutching}} the cross necklace <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and reciting [...] "Abyssus abyssum invocat". Darling dreams of the dead man attacking her in her bed.|$|E
5000|$|Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, former S.T.A.R.S {{member and}} police officer of Raccoon City, who helped Alice during the {{escape from the}} city and went gone missing after the incident. She was later {{captured}} by Umbrella, brainwashed through the scarab device attached <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> and programmed to capture Alice and Ada.|$|E
5000|$|Working at a {{department}} store, Megumi Aoyagi (wall woman) is a career {{woman who is}} popular at her workplace. However, she carries an inferiority complex with regard <b>to</b> <b>her</b> flat <b>chest.</b> One day, a well endowed, well proportioned lady known as Marie Mariya (mountain woman) appears before her. In {{the middle of the}} episode, these two characters found friendship in each other.|$|R
6000|$|Madame and {{the four}} young men had arrived at about six. Madame, said Mrs. Rollings, was a little fat woman, and she was {{complaining}} {{all the time that}} she had got a cold on <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> laying <b>her</b> hand on <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and trying <b>her</b> breathing and going [...] "He-e-e-er! Herr!" [...] to see if she could breathe properly. She, Mrs. Rollings, had suggested that Madame should put her feet in hot mustard and water, but Madame said she must have something <b>to</b> clear <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> The four young men were four nice civil young fellows. They evidently liked Madame. Madame had insisted on cooking the chops for the young men. She herself had eaten one, but she laid her hand on <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> when she swallowed. One of the young men had gone out <b>to</b> get <b>her</b> some brandy, and he had come back with half-a-dozen large bottles of Bass as well.|$|R
5000|$|During several {{episodes of}} season five ("Mr. Monk Makes a Friend," [...] "Mr. Monk Is At Your Service," [...] "Mr. Monk Visits a Farm," [...] "Mr. Monk and the Really, Really Dead Guy" [...] and [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to the Hospital"), Traylor Howard was {{pregnant}} with her son Sabu. Hence, during these episodes, {{it is easy to}} notice that scenes with Natalie were redone to hide the abnormal bulge in <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> in these episodes, such as having her wearing long trenchcoats, carrying boxes, newspapers, a bag, or something large, or sitting/standing behind something like a counter or a desk. For instance, in [...] "Mr. Monk Is At Your Service", when Monk and Natalie are at the crash site, Natalie is seen leaning against her car in close-ups with the driver's side door open <b>to</b> hide <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> In a rare exception, later in the episode, Traylor's real pregnant frame is revealed, when Natalie pretends to be pregnant by stuffing a pillow down her shirt so as to avoid advances from Paul Buchanan (Sean Astin). Noticeably, Natalie is not positioned in such ways as <b>to</b> hide <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> in [...] "Mr. Monk Is on the Air", because (as can be determined from Natalie's clothing, her car model, and a calendar for July 2006 when Monk and Natalie are in Max Hudson's bedroom) that episode was filmed alongside the eight episodes {{in the first half of}} the fifth season, all filmed before Traylor's pregnancy began to show.|$|R
50|$|During a 2006 taping of this soap, Lafon {{was seriously}} injured while taping {{a scene in}} which her {{character}} Rita relapsed into alcoholism and had to be resuscitated. The defibrillator used in the scene was mistakenly turned on, giving Lafon a real electric shock which caused burns <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and bruising on her ribs.|$|E
5000|$|FBI negotiators {{were able}} to free the prisoners and have Oswald {{surrender}} with no injuries or deaths. The bomb that was strapped <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> later emerged to be railroad flares wired to {{what appeared to be}} a doorbell. [...] Robin Oswald was charged as a juvenile with charges not being announced as is the law in Illinois.|$|E
5000|$|He {{gave it to}} {{the mother}} and she took it; with tears {{streaming}} down her face, and hugged the baby <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> The people were watching her and weeping and I (Ibn Shaddad) was standing amongst them. She suckled it for some time and then Saladin ordered a horse to be fetched for her and she went back to camp.|$|E
50|$|Maria and Lucas {{eventually}} {{emerge from}} the swirling water and find one another, with Maria having sustained serious injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> leg and <b>chest.</b> They help a young boy, Daniel, from the wreckage and are soon found by locals who transfer them to a local hospital {{in the city of}} Takua Pa. Daniel is separated from them during the journey. At the hospital, Maria encourages Lucas to help others find their family members while she goes into surgery for <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> injuries.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{states have}} primary {{jurisdiction}} {{in matters of}} public morality. The topfreedom movement has claimed success in a few instances in persuading some state and federal courts to overturn some state laws {{on the basis of}} sex discrimination or equal protection, arguing that a woman should be free <b>to</b> expose <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> in any context in which a man can expose his. Other successful cases have been on the basis of freedom of expression in protest, or simply that exposure of breasts is not indecent (or similar terminology).|$|R
5000|$|During {{the filming}} of seasons one and two, the svelte Nakama, who plays Yamada, had <b>to</b> flatten <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> further with a straight-padded blouse under her clothes because she was not {{modestly}} endowed enough for the producers' liking. However, in season three, Nakama no longer wears the padding, leading to a new gag in which Ueda often comments {{that she has a}} more pronounced chest than before. Yamada replies that it is [...] "high-level magic", to which Ueda snorts and says that it is more likely the result of surgical enhancements.|$|R
5000|$|The statue {{depicts a}} {{kneeling}} woman and {{rests on a}} granite pedestal and concrete base. She holds a water jug in her proper right hand and has her opposite arm raised <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest.</b> The sculpture is set within a brick-lined pool, which displays a plaque that reads: [...] Another plaque {{at the rear of}} the pools displays the text: [...]|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a bronze}} figure of Syrinx {{sitting on a}} {{limestone}} tree stump. Syrinx is nude, and her proper right knee is bent upwards <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> with her other leg hanging {{over the side of}} the stump. She holds her hand to her ear, cupping it, [...] "listening" [...] to the music of the nearby sculpture of the satyr Pan, who plays a flute.|$|E
5000|$|... "Set in Mexico, {{the video}} {{features}} Lopez dancing on a rooftop with the reggaeton stars, shaking {{her hips and}} writhing with alluring fervor and seductive purpose; traipsing through the city while being chased by her friends (and crashing through windows and making massive jumps all the while); and bare-skinned, with the word [...] "lidere," [...] sic Spanish for leader, tattooed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and a giant ink spot on her back." ...|$|E
5000|$|The game {{is set in}} the Anberyl Girls Academy, where a rumor of a [...] "Holy Grail of Beauty (美の聖杯)", {{an object}} said to be able to grant any wish, has surfaced. It is said to be hidden in an ancient cave that is only open on the school's {{founding}} day. Thus, {{at the beginning of the}} game, several girls have come in search of the mysterious grail, with protagonist Aina Akemiya setting out to find the grail in order <b>to</b> increase <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> size, which is smaller than the other girls'.|$|R
50|$|It {{would appear}} that Rabinowitz was at some level an {{autonomous}} leader (someone who tightly holds the reigns of power close <b>to</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>chest),</b> {{the fact is that}} no apparent successor was mentored or raised up by him. Even though he knew about the critical nature of his illness, it appears that he seemed powerless to organise his succession to another.|$|R
60|$|Irma {{surveyed}} {{her daughter}} {{from head to}} foot with growing satisfaction. Then, with a gesture of unwonted impulse, she took the young girl by the shoulders and, drawing <b>her</b> closely <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own bony <b>chest,</b> she imprinted two sounding kisses on the fresh, pale cheeks.|$|R
