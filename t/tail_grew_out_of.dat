50|$|The {{scene where}} Turles forces Gohan to {{transform}} into a Great Ape by holding {{his face and}} forcing {{him to keep his}} eyes open at the power ball was edited, but Turles held him by his shoulders instead. At the same time when Gohan looks at the power ball, absorbing its Blutz Waves through his eyes and beginning to transform into a Great Ape, no heartbeat sound effect were heard in the Japanese and English uncut versions, but were digitally edited in background in the English edited version. During that same scene, when Gohan's <b>tail</b> <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his pants after he was pinned to the ground by Turles, the sound effect of it ripping through his pants were also edited.|$|R
500|$|In {{an early}} {{account of what}} may be Fernando de Noronha, purportedly based on a voyage by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, the island was said to be {{inhabited}} by [...] "lizards with two tails", which is thought be a reference to the Noronha skink. The tail is long and fragile, and it breaks easily, like that of many skinks and other lizards, following which it may regenerate. However, when it does not completely break off, a new <b>tail</b> may nevertheless <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the broken part, so that the tail appears forked.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transformation}} of boys into donkeys {{takes place in}} the span of a few minutes as the rollercoaster still roars down the track, giving the sequence an ominous and foreboding atmosphere. The rollercoaster is built {{in such a way that}} the boys' screams of joy and delight are timed perfectly by a loop in the track to force the cursed water into their mouths. Pinocchio, who had received holes in his wooden body earlier in the film, is spared. It was revealed earlier in the film that the cursed water transforms its drinker into an animal symbolic of his or her behavior. Therefore, the boys' [...] "jackass" [...] behavior causes them to actually physically transform into jackasses. The first revelation of this fate happens when, instead of screams of thrills and joy, Lampwick brays like an ass. After Lampwick's strange bray, the other boys in the car point <b>out</b> a donkey's <b>tail</b> <b>growing</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Lampwick's pants and flapping in the wind. Then the other boys in the car begin to bray uncontrollably as their ears become like those of a donkey. Next, Lampwick's head morphs into a half-donkey-half-human face as he lets out an extremely realistic bray (compared to the previous human-sounding one). Suddenly, the boys begin to grope awkwardly with their hands as they become hooves. Finally with one more screaming bray (this time completely animalistic), Lampwick becomes a complete donkey. It seems that the transformation is somehow timed perfectly to coincide with the end of the rollercoaster. This could either be a way to somehow stimulate the transformation into fruition faster, or just to keep them inside and hidden while they transform in order to keep it from the other children in Terra Magica. Whatever the reason, the transformation always seems to completely finish by the end of the ride. Therefore, the new boys have absolutely transformed into donkeys (somehow their clothes also seem to disappear without explanation) by the time they enter the donkey holding cave at the end of the ride. The rollercoaster cars seem built not only with the boys in mind but also to fit standing donkeys as well. The donkeys simply walk <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car at the end of the ride, seemingly unaware of what had happened to them.|$|R
