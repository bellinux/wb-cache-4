2500|$|This {{component}} is often {{installed at the}} end of the tubing, or [...] "the shoe". [...] It is intended to make pulling out wireline tools easier by offering a guiding surface for the <b>toolstring</b> to re-enter the tubing without getting caught on the side of the shoe.|$|E
50|$|The {{cable head}} is the upper most {{portion of the}} <b>toolstring</b> on any given type of wireline. The cable head is where the {{conductor}} wire is made into an electrical connection that can {{be connected to the}} rest of the <b>toolstring.</b> Cable heads are typically custom built by the wireline operator for every job and depend greatly on depth, pressure and the type of wellbore fluid.|$|E
5000|$|This {{component}} is often {{installed at the}} end of the tubing, or [...] "the shoe". It is intended to make pulling out wireline tools easier by offering a guiding surface for the <b>toolstring</b> to re-enter the tubing without getting caught on the side of the shoe.|$|E
50|$|Tractors are {{electrical}} tools used to {{push the}} <b>toolstring</b> into hole, overcoming wireline's disadvantage of being gravity dependent. These are used for in highly deviated and horizontal wells where gravity is insufficient, even with roller stem. They push {{against the side of}} the wellbore either through the use of wheels or through a wormlike motion.|$|E
50|$|Coiled tubing is {{used when}} it is desired to pump {{chemicals}} directly {{to the bottom of}} the well, such as in a circulating operation or a chemical wash. It can also be used for tasks normally done by wireline if the deviation in the well is too severe for gravity to lower the <b>toolstring</b> and circumstances prevent the use of a wireline tractor.|$|E
5000|$|Lubricating long {{assemblies}} {{in and out}} of {{the hole}} (lubricating is done via a larger than tool overall diameter pipe, joined at surface on top of the wellhead, which houses the valve that shuts the pressure in downhole. The lubricator should be long enough to be able to swallow the <b>toolstring</b> and downhole tools that are to be run or pulled) ...|$|E
50|$|A stroke bailer {{functions}} like a 'Chinese water pump', {{and is used}} {{to collect}} unwanted solids from the wellbore. A stroke bailer is long and tubular looking, with a smaller rod that extends from the top, {{a hole in the}} bottom, and is generally around 7 meters long, but the length depends on how much barrel section is added to the bailer. The barrel 'free floats' on the stroke rod, which is attached to the wireline <b>toolstring.</b> The tool is usually 'spudded' into the downhole solid, then the wireline <b>toolstring</b> is pulled upwards, which in turn pulls the stroke up through the barrel. Ideally, this draws the downhole solid in through the bottom 'shoe' of the tool, past the check and into the barrel for collection. The tool is usually stroked either a predetermined number of times, or until it appears the tool is not stroking, which can mean either it is full, or stuck.|$|E
50|$|Bailers are {{downhole}} {{tools that}} are generally long and tubular shaped, {{and are used}} for both getting samples of downhole solids (sand, scale, asphaltines, rust, rubber and debris from well servicing operations) and for 'bailing' the unwanted downhole solids from the well. Bailers are attached either via threaded connection or releasable downhole tool to the wireline <b>toolstring,</b> and are manipulated from surface by the wireline operator. Bailers usually have an interchangeable bottom (the shoe) which also houses a check to keep the solids from falling or washing out of the bottom.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical jars {{look like}} a long, tubular piece of {{machined}} metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' {{depends on how much}} sinker bar is added above the jars. Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the <b>toolstring</b> and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring.|$|E
50|$|These {{tasks are}} by default {{the realm of}} wireline. Because coiled tubing is rigid, it can be pushed into the well from the surface. This is an {{advantage}} over wireline, which depends on {{the weight of the}} <b>toolstring</b> to be lowered into the well. For highly deviated and horizontal wells, gravity may be insufficient for wireline logging. Roller stem and tractors can often overcome this disadvantage at greatly reduced cost, particularly on small platforms and subsea wells where coiled tubing would require mobilizing an expensive mobile drilling rig. The use of coiled tubing for these tasks is usually confined to occasions where it is already on site for another purpose, for example a logging run following a chemical wash.|$|E
50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline <b>toolstring</b> {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the <b>toolstring</b> returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.|$|E
50|$|The {{separation}} {{tool assembly}} is run on an appropriate running tool {{complete with a}} running prong. The running prong {{is connected to the}} top of the internal seal prong with a shear pin, and the running tool is attached to the lock in the normal manner. After locating the sliding sleeve, the operator jars downward to set the lock, then pulls upward to close the isolation plug in the separation tool. As this happens, a garter spring in the isolation plug moves a steel shear pin into a groove on the sealing prong, and an O-ring on the internal prong seals to isolate the tubing below the sliding sleeve. The running prong that is pinned {{to the top of the}} internal prong is then sheared, and the slickline <b>toolstring</b> may be withdrawn from the well.|$|E
5000|$|Stem {{essentially}} just {{serves to}} add {{weight to the}} <b>toolstring.</b> The weight {{may be necessary to}} overcome the pressure of the well. Some variations of stem, called roller stem, may have wheels built into the tool to allow the tool string to glide more easily down moderately deviated wells. Stem give the hammering action to the tool string which in turn allows the jars to transmit the force given by the movement of the stems bars. Depending on well conditions extra small OD stems are use or extra large. The range can be from [...]75" [...] to 3.50" [...] OD and the stems normally come in 2 ft, 3 ft or 5 ft lengths. The connection to the rope socket or other tools can be a threaded connection or a QLS system (quick connect).|$|E
50|$|When the {{slickline}} parts, {{this can}} create an expensive 'fishing' job. It is called fishing because you {{often have to}} try different 'fishing' tools until you get a 'bite', {{then you have to}} work the original tools downhole free, or cut off the slickline where they join the tools downhole so that you can pull the broken slickline back to surface and out of the way, in order to fish the stuck <b>toolstring.</b> Because of the downtime involved in 'fishing', meaning not being able to flow the oil/gas well, the client is losing money by lack of production and also the cost of the slickline unit to fish, and the cost of what is left in the hole if it is not fished out (in the oil/gas industry, if the cause of the fishing job was not the fault of the slickline company, the oil/gas company is usually responsible to pay for it, and it can be very expensive).|$|E
50|$|A sample bailer is {{generally}} around a meter long, {{and has a}} hollow tube (the barrel) usually around 40 mm in diameter, with a 'ball check' {{on the bottom and}} an opening at the top. This tool is beat downwards into the as yet unknown obstruction using the mechanical jars and weight above of the wireline <b>toolstring.</b> Generally, after a predetermined amount of 'hits', hopefully allowing a usable sample of solids to fill the barrel. When the tool is pulled upwards, the solids usually (hopefully) settle the ball check onto its 'seat', which will keep the solids in the barrel during the return trip to surface, where the solids can be inspected to determine what the downhole obstruction was. This procedure can be 'hit and miss', the success depending on how readily the solid was accepted into the barrel, and if the ball check was properly seated on the return trip to surface. If the ball check is not seated (sometimes a large, hard piece of solid will sit in between the ball and seat) downhole fluids tend to 'wash' the sample out of the bottom of the sample bailer, leaving the inspectors at surface wondering if the tool actually collected a sample. Persistence {{is generally}} a good rule of thumb with this tool.|$|E
40|$|During Leg 199 {{two of the}} drilled sites (1218 and 1219) were logged {{using the}} Triple Combo (geophysical <b>toolstring),</b> FMS-Sonic (borehole imaging and sonic velocity) and the high {{resolution}} Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) Multi-Sensor Gamma Ray Tool (MGT). Site 1218 was drilled on 40 Ma crust and {{will be used to}} investigate paleoceanographic processes in the equatorial Paleogene Pacific Ocean during the transition from the Early Palaeogene ‘greenhouse’ to the Late Paleogene ‘icehouse’. Site 1219 was the southernmost site and was drilled on 55 Ma crust. It contains all the seismic horizons identified for a Paleogene equatorial seismic stratigraphy, and will also be used to study equatorial ocean circulation from the late Paleocene to the Late Eocene. Logging operations at both sites went well with heave of < 2. 5 m experienced at both sites. Conditions in Hole 1218 A were excellent and tools made good contact {{along the length of the}} borehole. In Hole 1219 A there were a number of areas where washouts had widened the borehole beyond the width of both the FMS and Triple Combo callipers. At both sites no bridges were encountered during any logging run and the bottom of the hole was reached on all passes. Wavelet transform analyses on tool acceleration and density data are used to evaluate the effects of ship heave, borehole diameter and rugosity on the log data. Obtaining velocity data from slow sediments such as those drilled on Leg 199 is notoriously difficult. At Site 1219 the potential use of First Motion Detection (FMD) measurement mode for obtaining sonic velocity data was investigated. The results obtained from FMD are compared to those obtained by the ‘normal’ P-wave data acquisition procedure. Log and lithological stratigraphy from site 1218 and 1219 are presented along with selected core and log data sets. The high core recovery at both sites provides excellent core data sets that correlate well with the log data. High-resolution FMS imagery showing sub-metre depth scale cyclicity is presented from both sites. Chert bands and nodules are generally poorly recovered in cores but readily show up on the FMS imagery. An example is presented where the FMS imagery is used to locate and map the chert layers. Core, log and seismic data may be linked using synthetic seismograms which provide a means for interpreting seismic data in terms of the measured formation properties, for example lithological or chronological boundaries may be picked out as specific reflectors. Synthetic seismograms, which have been obtained for both sites, are presented...|$|E
