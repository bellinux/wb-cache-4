5|$|The {{painting}} was produced during an important time in Swedish history. The establishment of modern Sweden {{coincided with the}} introduction of Protestantism and the break-up with Denmark and the Kalmar Union.

During the 20th century the painting became an icon for the history of Stockholm and it is now frequently displayed whenever the history of the city is commemorated.|$|E

5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>context</b> of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical {{social history of}} America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>context</b> of the era.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{text on the}} Rosetta Stone {{provided}} the starting point. Ancient Greek was widely known to scholars, {{but they were not}} familiar with details of its use in the Hellenistic period as a government language in Ptolemaic Egypt; large-scale discoveries of Greek papyri were a long way in the future. Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>context</b> and with administrative and religious jargon. Stephen Weston verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a Society of Antiquaries meeting in April 1802.|$|E

5|$|The novel Quicksilver {{is written}} in various {{narrative}} styles, such as theatrical staging and epistolary, and follows {{a large group of}} characters. Though mostly set in late 17th century England, France, and the United Provinces, the first book includes a frame story set in early 18th century Massachusetts. In order to write the novel, Stephenson researched the period extensively and integrates events and historical themes important to historical scholarship throughout the novel. However, Stephenson alters details such as the members of the Cabal ministry, the historical cabinet of Charles II of England, to facilitate the incorporation of his fictional characters. Within <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>context,</b> Stephenson also deals with many themes which pervade his other works, including the exploration of knowledge, communication and cryptography.|$|E
