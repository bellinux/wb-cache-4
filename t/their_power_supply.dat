25|$|Smart cards, often colloquially {{referred}} to as “chip cards” were {{designed to provide a}} more secure financial transaction than a traditional credit card. They contain simple embedded integrated circuits designed to performed cryptographic functions. They connect directly to a card reader which provides the power necessary to perform an encrypted financial transaction. Many side-channel attacks {{have been shown to be}} effective against smart cards because they obtain <b>their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and clock directly from the card reader. By tampering with a card reader, it is simple to collect traces and perform side-channel attacks. Other works, however, have also shown that smart cards are vulnerable to electromagnetic attacks as well.|$|E

2500|$|Dalek in-universe {{history has}} seen many {{retroactive}} changes, which have caused continuity problems. When the Daleks first appeared, they were presented as {{the descendants of}} the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races 500 years ago. This race of Daleks is destroyed when <b>their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is wrecked. However, when they reappear in The Dalek Invasion of Earth, they have conquered Earth in the 22nd century. Later stories saw them develop time travel and a space empire. In 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in Genesis of the Daleks, where the Dals were now called Kaleds (of which [...] "Daleks" [...] is an anagram), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist and evil genius, Davros. Instead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war of attrition, fought with nuclear, biological and chemical weapons which caused widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in tank-like [...] "travel machines" [...] whose design was based on his own life-support chair.|$|E

50|$|At Aldermaston, the Imperial {{team was}} put under the {{direction}} of Thomas Allibone. Compared to the team at Harwell, the Aldermaston team decided to focus on faster pinch systems. <b>Their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> consisted of a large bank of capacitors with a total capacity of 66,000 Joules (when fully expanded) switched by spark gaps that could dump the stored power into the system at high speeds. Harwell's devices used slower rising pinch currents, and had to be larger to reach the same conditions.|$|E
50|$|It was {{introduced}} in 2005 to replace the Agora. It comes in two varieties: Citelis 12, which is of standard 12 m length, and Citelis 18, which is articulated and has a length of 18 m. Citelis models use Euro 4, Euro 5 & EEV engines. The buses can also be built as trolleybuses, utilising overhead electrical wires for <b>their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> instead of fuel. Trolleybus version of Citelis {{is also known as}} Škoda 24Tr Irisbus (12m) or Škoda 25Tr Irisbus (18m), especially in Eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Access to PAPER became {{critical}} as {{more and}} more functionality was added. It eventually was maintained on two dedicated PDP-10 computers, model KL-1090, accessible via the Tymnet Packet Network as Tymshare hosts 23 and 26. Each computer was the size of 5 refrigerators, and had a string of disks that looked like 18 washing machines. <b>Their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> produced +5 volts at 200 amps (non-switching) making them expensive to operate.|$|R

50|$|BER and jitter are {{functions}} of the entire MGT connection, including the MGTs themselves, their serial lines, their reference clocks, <b>their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> and the digital systems that create and consume their parallel data. As a result, MGTs are often measured by how little jitter they transmit (Jitter Transfer/Jitter Generation), and how much jitter they can tolerate before their BER is too high (Jitter Tolerance). These measurements are commonly taken using a BERT, and analyzed using an Eye diagram.|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the arc in an arc lamp can reach several thousand degrees Celsius. The outer glass envelope can reach 500 degrees Celsius, therefore before servicing one must ensure the bulb has cooled sufficiently to handle. Often, if these types of lamps are turned off or lose <b>their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> one cannot restrike the lamp again for several minutes (called cold restrike lamps). However, some lamps (mainly fluorescent tubes/energy saving lamps) can be restruck {{as soon as they}} are turned off (called hot restrike lamps).|$|E
50|$|Like all early optical mice, {{their debut}} product {{relied on a}} special {{metallic}} and reflective mousepad printed with a square grid of grey and blue tracking lines: as the device moved over the pad, LED feedback was processed by an on-board microchip, which in turn supplied the host computer with machine-readable tracking data via an RS-232 serial port. An external power supply was required. Some mice would derive <b>their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> from the keyboard connector on the motherboard and came with a pass-through connector to be inserted before the keyboard cable.|$|E
50|$|With {{the battle}} over, the Doctor {{explains}} that the radiation from the weapon was what was killing their crops but this limiting factor has now been removed. Earth has agreed to send a real Adjudicator to Uxarieus, and Caldwell has decided to join the colonists.

Having accomplished what the Time Lords intended, the Doctor is once again trapped on Earth.|$|E
5000|$|Active {{devices of}} an {{electronic}} system (transistors, ICs, vacuum tubes, for example) {{are connected to}} <b>their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> through conductors with finite resistance and inductance. If the current drawn by an active device changes, voltage drops from <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> to device will also change due to these impedances. If several active devices share a common path to the <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> changes in the current drawn by one element may produce voltage changes large enough to affect the operation of others - voltage spikes or ground bounce, for example - so the change of state of one device is coupled to others through the common impedance to the <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> A decoupling capacitor provides a bypass path for transient currents, instead of flowing through the common impedance.|$|R
50|$|The term {{derives from}} the vaguely cuboid shape of many {{electronic}} devices (and <b>their</b> detachable <b>power</b> <b>supplies)</b> and {{the suggestion that the}} device can function only as a lifeless, square object, paperweight or doorstop.|$|R
50|$|Many near-future and mid-future games make {{heavy use}} of sentry guns, often to fulfill level {{designer}} objectives: in the Modern Warfare series, {{they were used}} to slow the player's advance at key points and build tension, while in many other games sentry guns, often unseen, are used to constrain the player within a map area. Sometimes these become objectives in and of themselves, such as disabling <b>their</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> to allow the player to proceed, while in other cases they are permanent and serve to prevent the player from exiting the game world or map.|$|R
