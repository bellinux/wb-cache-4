50|$|There {{has always}} been some type of {{differences}} between siblings, especially different sex siblings. Often, different sex sibling may consider things to be unfair because his/her brother/sister is allowed {{to do certain things}} just because of his or her gender, while he or she gets to do something less amusing or just plain different. McHale and her colleague conducted a longitudinal study using middle age children and observed {{the way in which the}} parents contributed to stereotypical attitudes in <b>their</b> <b>kids.</b> <b>In</b> their study the experimenters analysed two different types of families, one with the same sex siblings, and the other with different sex siblings, as well as the children’s birth order. The experiment was conducted over phone interviews, in where the experimenters would ask the children about the activities they performed throughout their day outside of school. Surprisingly, the experimenters found that in the homes where there were mixed gender kids, and the father held traditional values, the kids also held traditional values and therefore also played gender based roles in the home. In contrast in homes where the father did not hold traditional values the house chores were divided more equally among his kids. However, if fathers had two male children, the younger male tended to help more with household chore, but as he reached his teenage years the younger child stopped being as helpful around the house. There are two important factors that need to be taken into account from this study. First, in cases where the father figure had more traditional values it was found that he also had less education than the other dads who participated in the study, and secondly the mother’s attitudes did not have a noticeable impact on her children’s gender role values. Altogether this experiment is a good example of the way in which environment and kinship help develop certain perspectives on gender role association in children.|$|E
30|$|When {{asked about}} the {{principal}} reasons for not herding their cattle, almost 90 % of the respondents {{said that they would}} herd their cattle irrespective of breed or season if they had adequate manpower. However, most of the households cited acute shortage of labour in their villages due to rural-urban migration and increased enrolment of all <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> the schools as mandated by the government’s policy of ‘no child left behind’. Shortage of labour is the main reason why most of the cattle herders are either too old (some even in their 80 s) to work in the agricultural fields or they are mentally and physically challenged, because of which cattle could be vulnerable to predation. Another important reason farmers (8 %) gave for not herding was the lack of adequate pastureland. Only a few respondents (2 %) stated it was an age-old tradition to leave their cattle freely grazing in the forests, completely unattended by humans.|$|E

The addition of organic selenium significantly (P P P < 0. 01) GSH-Px activity in E-I and E-II groups in relation to C group. It was also determined higher GSH-Px in the blood of kids E-II group compared to the EI group. Significant correlations was found between Se levels and GSH-Px activity in goats and kids, but were significant only in the goats of E-II group.

In 2015 the Swedish Schools Inspectorate conducted unannounced audits at 196 randomly selected preschools throughout the country. Several preschools had difficulties living up to their pedagogical duties. Against this background, I think it is interesting to investigate whether this is true also for the preschools in the medium size city in Sweden. The results of my study show that language development for all children in the hallway requires a combination of several strategies. The results also show that it takes more than verbal communication to make a situation language developing. There are strategies that all preschool teachers in the three districts is working with in the hallway. But the result also shows that there are differences in strategies. ...|$|E
