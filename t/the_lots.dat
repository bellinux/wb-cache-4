5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{settlers}} lived in caves dug {{out of the river}} bank, but the city grew with construction of homes, churches, and wharves. The new landowners did not share Penn's vision of a non-congested city. Most people bought land along the Delaware River instead of spreading westward towards the Schuylkill. <b>The</b> <b>lots</b> they bought were subdivided and resold with smaller streets constructed between them. Before 1704, few people lived west of Fourth Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{while the}} Roeriches {{were engaged in}} a long period of travel in Central Asia, Horch began to acquire <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> {{surrounding}} the mansion to construct the Master Building. The Roeriches' extensive travels were almost entirely funded by Louis Horch. As is common when assembling adjacent lots for a single purpose, he used dummies as purchasers. In doing this he followed a pattern he had established in providing an organizational structure for the Master Institute when he installed the Roeriches and their close associates as nominal shareholders and corporate officers.|$|E
5|$|Property {{losses from}} the fire can be {{accounted}} for with relative certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards. City surveyor Søren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The {{differences between the two}} surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43lots, so it is fairly certain that 1,227lots containing about 1,600buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500lots (per the cadastre of 1699), so about 28% of <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%.|$|E

5|$|The Earps {{moved back}} to San Francisco in 1891 in part so Sadie could be closer to her {{half-sister}} Henrietta's family. Earp developed {{a reputation as a}} sportsman and a gambler. He held onto his San Diego properties, but when their value fell, he could not pay the taxes. He was forced to sell <b>the</b> <b>lots.</b> He continued to race horses, but by 1896, he could no longer afford to own them. He raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa that he managed for her. From 1891 to 1897, they lived in at least four different locations in the city: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave. and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. In Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Waller ran as a Republican {{candidate}} for US Congress. He lost the election by 8376 votes to Democratic lawyer Francis Dolan Collins. He did, however, win Columbia County in the election. He {{was also the}} proprietor of a furnace on Roaring Creek and built the Bloomsburg Sanitarium {{at the corner of}} Sixth Street and Market Street in Bloomsburg in 1870. Waller was vice president of the State Agricultural Society. He also extended Market Street in Bloomsburg and built many houses along it. Along with John Ramsay, he built First Street in Bloomsburg and sold <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> on it to Welsh immigrants some time before 1847. He also laid out other residential streets in Bloomsburg. He supported moving the county seat of Columbia County from Danville to Bloomsburg, although he was unable to convince Danville's businessmen to move their industries to Bloomsburg. In 1866, he was made one of three trustees of Bloomsburg's Board of Trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} was {{for most of}} the filming a closed set, with great measures taken to maintain the secrecy of the plot. Scripts were numbered and lists kept of who received each copy. The press was told nothing about the story and only a few production stills were allowed to be published. During construction one young visitor to a soundstage stole a copy of blueprints for the bridge set and sold duplicates of them to any fans who would pay him $75; Paramount reported the matter to the FBI, who turned the case over to the Los Angeles Police Department. The police arrested, convicted, and fined the culprit $750; it was later discovered that the stolen plans were not the final copies. Visitor's badges were created to keep track of guests, and due to the limited number were constantly checked out; among the visitors included friends of the cast and crew, the press, fan leaders, and actors such as Clint Eastwood, Tony Curtis, Robin Williams, and Mel Brooks. Security swept cars leaving <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> for stolen items; even the principal actors were not spared from this inconvenience.|$|E

Formal surveys are done by qualified surveyors, who can make a diagram or map of <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> showing boundaries, dimensions, locations of any structures such as buildings, etc. Such surveys are also used to determine if there are any encroachments to <b>the</b> <b>lot.</b> Surveyors can sometimes place posts at the metes of a lot.|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{all other}} {{stations}} {{on the line}} from Lincoln west, Ayer has no dedicated station parking, despite serving over 400 passengers per day. <b>The</b> <b>lots</b> adjacent to the station are privately owned and serve local businesses, but are often illegally used by commuters using the station. The 30-space Nashua River Rail Trail parking lot is available for commuters on weekdays; some commuters also use street parking and other business lots. In 2003, the town and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) began planning how to increase parking capacity. Five studies in six years concluded with plans for an $11 million, 400-space garage off Park Street, accessibility improvements to the station, and streetscape improvements for pedestrian access. The plans were reduced in scale due to traffic concerns and other issues. $3.2 million in FTA funds (originally intended for expanded parking at Littleton/Route 495 but later rejected) was committed to build a $4 million surface lot. However, the lot was delayed due to conflicts with businesses that would be displaced and the lack of a publicly owned pedestrian entrance (a requirement to use the federal funds).|$|E

25|$|Hepburn {{convinced}} Ross {{to offer}} lots of his property {{to the state}} commissioners for {{the building of a}} county courthouse and jail.

Ross is stated to have had little interest in politics, but being a good businessman was interested in selling his land. Ross agreed to Hepburn's suggestion and <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> were offered to the state commission. The state commission accepted <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> and Williamsport was finally named the county seat of Lycoming County.|$|E

25|$|The Residence Act of 1790, which {{established}} {{the site for}} the nation's capital, provided for the appointment of three commissioners by the President (and without the need for Senate confirmation) to govern the District of Columbia, survey its land, purchase property from private landowners, and construct federal buildings. On September 23, 1793, Greenleaf purchased 3,000 city lots from the commissioners. The city offered him <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> at $66.50 each, a significant discount from the going price of $200 to $300 per lot. To get this low price, Greenleaf was required to construct 70 homes on <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> before 1800, not sell any of the land before 1796, and lend the commissioners $2,200 a month until certain public buildings were constructed. To raise money to improve <b>the</b> <b>lots,</b> Greenleaf executed a power of attorney on November 2, 1793, with Sylvanus Bourne, the American vice consul in Amsterdam. Bourne, who served as vice consul in Amsterdam under Greenleaf, was empowered to sell lots or obtain mortgages on them.|$|E
25|$|Skøyen {{has since}} the 1980s became subject to {{substantial}} de-industrialization and urban redevelopment.

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in <b>the</b> <b>LOT,</b> this leaves him open to the question of why <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (<b>the</b> <b>LOT)</b> in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for <b>the</b> <b>LOT,</b> then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that <b>the</b> <b>LOT</b> is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|R
