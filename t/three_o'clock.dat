5|$|During the 1848 revolution, San Martin left Paris {{and moved}} to Boulogne-sur-Mer, a small city in {{northern}} France. He was almost blind and had many health problems because of his advanced age, but continued to write letters and {{keep in touch with}} the news from South America. Shortly after receiving the news of the Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade, he died, <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> on 17 August 1850.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The home was a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at <b>three</b> <b>o’clock</b> in the morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

The loss was estimated at $200,000 and only $45,000 was recovered from the insurance.

In this capacity, it was used to represent good luck, due to its fortunate connotations in card playing. All four card suits were used for ease of identification of regiments within the airborne division following the confusion of a large scale combat airborne operation.

It burned houses of wood and stone, even the monastery of St. Dominic, the royal hospital for the Spaniards, and the royal warehouses, without leaving a building standing among them. Fourteen people died in the fire, Spaniards, Filipinos and Negroes, among them Licentiate Sanz, canon of the cathedral. In all 260 houses were burned, with much property that was in them. The damage was estimated at more than one million pesos.|$|E
25|$|The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments {{participated in}} the Battle of Prairie Grove under their state designations. It is {{asserted}} that Col. Charles W. Adams treated his regiment of conscripts more like prisoners than soldiers, with the men being held under guard and herded around like cattle, for example. The regiment spent the morning of December 7 near Prairie Grove church facing south. At about <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon it was ordered into the fight. Upon reaching Battle Ridge, the regiment {{was placed in a}} gap between Fagan's Brigade and Shelby's Brigade behind the south fence of the Borden orchard. The regiment fired a volley from behind the fence toward {{the right wing of the}} Twenty-sixth Indiana. When the Hoosiers fell back the regiment climbed over the fence and advanced north through the orchard (which was filled with fearfully mangled Union and Confederate corpses from an earlier clash) directly toward the Borden house. At approximately the place where the modern tour road crosses the orchard the regiment ran into a storm of fire from the left wing of the Thirty-seventh Illinois, including the left flank company which was armed with Colt revolving rifles. That is when the regiment broke. As both Adams and Hindman noted in their reports, many of the company officers went with the men.|$|E

500|$|Bede {{died on the}} Feast of the Ascension, Thursday, 26 May 735, on {{the floor}} of his cell, singing [...] "Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit" [...] and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), {{describing}} Bede's last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, [...] "with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At <b>three</b> <b>o'clock,</b> according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery [...] "a few treasures" [...] of his: [...] "some pepper, and napkins, and some incense". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after. However, by the reckoning of Bede's time, passage from the old day to the new occurred at sunset, not midnight, and Cuthbert is clear that he died after sunset. Thus, while his box was brought at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> Wednesday afternoon the 25th, {{by the time of the}} final dictation it might be considered already Thursday in that ecclesiastical sense, although the 25th in the ordinary sense.|$|E
