5|$|In 1843, John C. Fremont led {{the first}} {{scientific}} {{expedition to the}} lake, but with winter coming on, he did not <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> survey the entire lake. That happened in 1850 {{under the leadership of}} Howard Stansbury (Stansbury discovered and named the Stansbury mountain range and Stansbury island). John Fremont's overly glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition. Stansbury also published a formal report of his survey work which became very popular. His report of the area included a discussion of Mormon religious practices based on Stansbury's interaction with the Mormon community in Great Salt Lake City, which had been established three years earlier in 1847.|$|E
5|$|In December, Longstreet's First Corps {{played the}} decisive {{role in the}} Battle of Fredericksburg. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dig in {{portions}} of his line, methodically site artillery, {{and set up a}} kill zone over the axis of advance he thought the Union attack would follow. Remembering the slaughter at Antietam, in which the Confederates did not construct defensive works, Longstreet ordered trenches, abatis, and fieldworks to be constructed, which would set a precedent for future defensive battles by the Army of Northern Virginia. Subsequently, Longstreet positioned his men behind a stone wall at the foot of Marye's Heights and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces. The Union army suffered almost 8,000 casualties at Marye's Heights, Longstreet only 1,000. His great defensive success was not based entirely on the advantage of terrain; this time it was the combination of terrain, defensive works, and a centralized coordination of artillery.|$|E

5|$|The ship briefly {{operated}} between Glasgow {{and other}} ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service {{before she was}} purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly rounding the breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched {{a letter to his}} financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners because he could not afford to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> deal with the affair lest he and Fingal be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.|$|E

Therefore, horses with dental {{problems}} (e.g. acquired or congenital malocclusion, loose or missing teeth, or excessively sharp dental ridges) that do not allow them to completely grind their food are particularly at risk. In addition, horses that bolt their feed and do not <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> chew properly are more likely to suffer from choke.|$|E

25|$|While SNAP {{participants}} and other low-income nonparticipants spend similar amounts on food spending, SNAP participants tend to still experience greater food insecurity than nonparticipants. This {{is believed to}} be a reflection of welfare of individuals who <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> apply for SNAP benefits than the shortcomings of SNAP. The theory behind this is that those households facing the greatest hardships are the most likely to bear of the burden of applying for program benefits. Therefore, SNAP participants tend to be, on average, less food secure than other low-income nonparticipants.|$|E
25|$|Weber's {{theory can}} {{explain some of}} the causes for current movement, yet such {{discussion}} did not come from Weber himself. Weber found industrial activity the least expensive to produce. Least cost location then implies marketing the product at the least cost to the consumer, much like retailers attempt to obtain large market shares today. Economically, it is explained as one way to make a profit; creating the cheapest product for the consumer market leads to greater volume of sales and hence, greater profits. Therefore, companies that do not <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> locate the cheapest inputs or the largest markets would not succeed, since their product costs more to produce and costs the consumer more.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked why}} the {{mechanism}} of unlocking maps and characters - accomplished in previous titles by purchasing them with points or coins won through battle - was removed, the developers apologized, commenting that after long deliberation, they felt that such a mechanic was detrimental to the enjoyment of gamers who are too busy to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> unlock all of these things. As a result, they designed this game {{in a way that}} allowed players to play any non-story based map they wanted, introducing other mechanics to encourage players to keep playing. The developers commented that Days of Ruin had more strategy than previous entries in the series due to the changes and removals made to the game compared to the other titles.|$|E
500|$|In April 1961, {{shortly before}} the second court case on Thunderball, Fleming {{had a heart attack}} during a regular weekly meeting at The Sunday Times.

Fleming attacked the project with gusto and wrote to his publisher, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape, joking that [...] "There is not a moment, even {{on the edge of the}} tomb, when I am not slaving for you"; the result was Fleming's only children's novel, Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang, which was published in October 1964, two months after his death.|$|E

500|$|Gray {{flew into}} Baltimore to Nothingface's home studio {{to discuss the}} project further. The song [...] "Waging War" [...] was written in two days, {{followed}} by Maxwell tracking it the next day, and Gray completing vocals. During the summer of 2006, schedules were clear, which allowed members to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> record a studio album. The album was recorded at Paul's backyard studio, Chasin' Jason in Arlington, Texas. Filled with photos of his late brother Dimebag, Paul found it tough entering the studio where the last albums by Damageplan and Pantera, and the collaboration Rebel Meets Rebel were recorded, but felt [...] "the dark cloud that was there went away", due to everyone's positive energy. Maxwell and Tribbett were the primary writers of the album, and Paul was there to [...] "steer them in the right direction", with Gray adding his opinion on musical arrangements.|$|E

She hoped that the final episode of the trilogy would cover that ground. The mini-arc featuring the episodes [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] and [...] "The Augments" [...] were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt.

500|$|Rivers {{introduced}} a bill in February 2013 to exempt nonprofit shooting clubs from paying sales and use taxes when they buy clay pigeons.

[...] Along with cosponsors Roach and Benton, Tim Eyman also is cosponsoring the legislation. In March 2013, Rivers reprimanded senate Democrats for taking advantage of Janéa Holmquist Newbry's departure from the senate floor to feed her newborn son, leaving the Democrats in temporary control of the senate floor. Immediately after she left, Democrat David Frockt attempted to pass a bill through the floor. As part of her duties, Rivers has also hosted high-school aged pages for the Washington State Senate Page Program.|$|E

Dan Shaughnessy wrote about the chant: [...] "Can you imagine a Giants or a Jets celebration in New York City in which a New York player would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> chant, 'Red Sox suck? Shaughnessy opined that should such a thing occur, it would be more likely at a Jets celebration, as a Giants celebration, like those of the Mets and the Rangers, {{would be more likely to}} feature such chants made in reference to the Philadelphia teams, as one of the Giants' primary rivalries is with the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the album's lyrics discuss political issues in the United States. Jeff Miers of The Buffalo News calls the album [...] "a response to the oppressive vacuousness of the Bush years". Dealing with specific tracks on the album, AllMusic states that Rise Against [...] "rages against the moral decay rotting {{the core of the}} U.S. on the opening 'Collapse (Post-Amerika),' just as they strike out against the slow dumbing down of America on 'Re-Education (Through Labor)'". In addition to political topics, more personal issues constitute {{a large portion of the}} lyrical content. [...] "Savior" [...] is about forgiveness and broken relationships, while [...] "The Dirt Whispered" [...] is about the need to sacrifice for what a person loves. Bassist Joe Principe said, [...] "The political side of this band is just that -- it's a side. There are political lyrics. There are social awareness and there are lyrics about the environment.
