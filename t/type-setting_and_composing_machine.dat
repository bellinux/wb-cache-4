40|$|The {{relative}} obscurity of Linn Boyd Benton and Morris Fuller Benton, is investigated. The two men, {{father and}} son, {{made significant contributions}} to the technology of typesetting and to typeface design, yet they are not now well known in the industry. Linn Boyd Benton invented a pantographic punch-cutting machine, which he later modified to engrave matrices. This machine made the Linotype machine practical, since it took the tedium and great expense out of the making of Linotype 2 ̆ 7 mats. 2 ̆ 7 Benton 2 ̆ 7 s machine was and still is used at the American Type Founders Company, and was copied for use at type founding companies <b>and</b> <b>composing</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturers around the world. Morris Fuller Benton was the first type designer to develop the concept of the type family, and also revived many beautiful types like Baskerville, Bulmer, Bodoni, and Garamond. He designed more types than any other American type designer, {{and many of them are}} still in wide use. Benton 2 ̆ 7 s father collaborated on the original Century type, and Morris Benton designed Century Expanded, Century Oldstyle, Century Catalogue, Century Schoolbook, and all the italic, bold, condensed and extended versions that went along with them. He designed a variety of types, from gothics to moderns to classic revivals. Some of Benton 2 ̆ 7 s types became popular right away, and others, like Souvenir, became popular years after Benton died. The Bentons were written about in the printing literature of their day, but only a few recent and fairly obscure articles have mentioned them. It is shown that the reason for this is most probably due to the modesty and reticence of the Bentons. Both father and son worked for the American Type Founders (ATF) Company, which did not promote its employees but instead advertised its products. So while ATF became the most influential type founding company in the country, the Bentons remained relative unknowns. The story of their professional and personal lives, and the story of ATF 2 ̆ 7 s rise and decline are included. Morris Benton 2 ̆ 7 s type designs are discussed, and the ATF method of making type is given...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of a system can start {{with the creation of}} a specification. Following this viewpoint, we claim that often a specification can be constructed from the combination of specifications which can be seen as composition. Event-B is a formal method that allows modelling and refinement of systems. The combination, reuse and validation of component specifications are not currently supported in Event-B. We extend the Event-B formalism using shared event composition as an option for developing (distributed) systems. Refinement is used in the {{development of}} specifications using <b>composed</b> <b>machines</b> <b>and</b> we prove that properties and proof obligations of specifications can be reused to ensure valid composed specifications.

40|$|UML-B is a UML-like {{graphical}} {{front end}} for Event-B that provides support for object- oriented modelling concepts. In particular, UML-B supports class diagrams and state machines, concepts {{that are not}} explicitly supported in plain Event-B. In Event-B, refinement is used to relate system models at different abstraction levels. The same abstraction-refinement concepts can also be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the notions of refined classes, refined state machines and extended classtypes to en- able refinement of classes and state machines in UML-B. This work makes explicit the structures of class and state machine refinement in UML-B. This work also introduces seven refinement techniques which are, adding new attributes and associations, adding new classes, elaborating state, elaborating transition, moving a class event (or a state machine transition), adding new attributes and associations, and adding new classtypes. In Event-B, decomposition is used to decompose a system into components. The same decomposition concepts can be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the techniques of flattening state machines and state grouping to facilitate a decomposition of a UML-B machine. This work also introduces the notion of <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> which <b>composes</b> the component <b>machines.</b> The <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> refines a machine which is being decomposed. The <b>composed</b> <b>machine</b> is used to ensure {{the composition of the}} component machines is a valid refinement. Together with the <b>composed</b> UML-B <b>machine,</b> the notions of included <b>machine,</b> <b>composed</b> event <b>and</b> constituent event are introduced. The UML-B drawing tool and Event-B translator are extended to support the new refinement and decomposition concepts. A case study of an auto teller machine (ATM) is presented to validate the extensions of UML-B with regards to the above notions. The ATM case study also demonstrates the above techniques introduced in refinement and decomposition. In addition, this work provides guidelines for performing refinement and decomposition in UML-B and presents a number of generic invariants that may be used when refining a middleware. The middleware is a component via which a requesting component such as an ATM and a responding component such as bank interact in a distributed system.

40|$|Abstract – One of the {{significant}} challenges for current and future manufacturing systems is that of providing rapid reconfigurability in order to evolve and adapt to mass customization. Service-Oriented Architecture has been proposed as a technology facilitator to create systems by encapsulating, <b>composing</b> <b>and</b> reconfiguring <b>machines</b> and devices rather than reprogramming the hard code. The SOA paradigm holds the promise of being applicable across the entire spectrum of manufacturing systems and devices, down to sensors and actuators. One of the pillars of SOA is the mechanism by which service advertisements are published by providers and subsequently discovered and selected by requestors. This paper presents a protocol for the dynamic discovery of services in industrial environments. The protocol is designed for operation in embedded industrial controllers, and operates in a peer-to-peer topology without a need for centralized service registries. Furthermore, the protocol enables conveying information regarding services that are semantically interoperable but that use different invocation syntax. In order to infer such semantic relationships between services, the OWL-S Semantic Web Services Ontology is used. The protocol was deployed in embedded industrial controllers {{in order to facilitate}} the reconfiguration of assembly systems that employ CAMX standards for communications. I...|$|R

As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write, easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be re-used to reduce future programming costs. Conventional languages place conceptual limits on the way problems can be modularised. Functional languages push those limits back. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). Since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional languages are vitally important to the real world. ...|$|R

In the United States, Houghton Mifflin published The Fellowship of the Ring on 21 October 1954, The Two Towers on 21 April 1955, and The Return of the King on 5 January 1956. The Return of the King was especially delayed due to Tolkien revising the ending and preparing appendices (some of which had to be left out because of space constraints). Tolkien did not like the title The Return of the King, believing it gave away too much of the storyline, but deferred to his publisher's preference. He suggested the title The Two Towers in a deliberately ambiguous attempt to link the unconnected books III and IV, and as such the eponymous towers could be either Orthanc and Barad-dûr, or Minas Tirith and Barad-dûr, or Orthanc and Cirith Ungol.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem we}} address {{in this paper}} arises in {{large-scale}} manufacturing of bank cheques. Due to security reasons, the cheques must be printed on special (expensive) paper. The {{first step in the}} printing process is to prepare the plates that will be used by the <b>composing</b> <b>machine.</b> If the imprint (image) of a particular cheque is on a plate, each time the <b>composing</b> <b>machine</b> uses this plate a new cheque of this type is produced. Each plate has a predefined number of positions to be impressed. Due to delivery due dates, there is an additional constraint requiring each cheque not to be present in more than a predefined number of different plates. There are two different production costs that have to be considered: overproduction costs and printing costs. Each overproduced cheque can be either destroyed or stored in a proper location under surveillance. Both these alternatives have a huge environmental impact, indeed, on the one hand, paper waste is produced, while, on the other hand there is a huge energy consumption. The problem consists in defining the pattern (i. e. the configuration of cheque images) of each plate to be used and the corresponding frequency, such that total costs are minimized. We study this real world problem that is strictly related to the cutting stock problem with pattern minimization. Such a problem is addressed actually by a large cheque manufacturer in Southern part of Italy. We define a very efficient heuristic to solve it. The proposed solution methodology is currently used by the above mentioned manufacturer to define the cheque allocation of the plates...|$|R
