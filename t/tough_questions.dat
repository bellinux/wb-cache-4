5|$|Two {{days after}} Brierre's death, the detectives have made little {{progress}} on their lead about Kaja, the victim's abusive ex-boyfriend. Ballard and Gharty suggest they {{look more closely}} at Felix Wilson and his son, Hal (Jeffrey Wright), because Brierre had sex before her death and knew few men socially besides them. Pembleton and Gee, who are both very respectful of Felix Wilson's contributions to the African American community, dismiss the suggestion; Gee refuses to even ask the Wilsons to submit a blood and hair sample. The next day's Baltimore Sun runs a story about the investigation into Kaja, which Pembleton believes was leaked to the press by Gee in order to distance the Wilsons from the crime. Ballard and Gharty question Hal, who denies having sex with Brierre after <b>tough</b> <b>questions</b> from Gharty. After the interview, Gharty tells Ballard that Pembleton and Gee are obstructing the investigation to protect a rich and respected black family.|$|E

Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns.

[...] He noted that accounting scandals were not uniquely Japanese, but that it was [...] "a nice piece of corporate satire to conceal losses by exploiting the widespread habit of paying too much for acquisitions and writing them down [...] the 'advisory fee' was especially creative". Gapper criticised the weakness in governance, particularly how 12 out of 15 directors were either executives or former executives of the company, and that Hideo Yamada, head of the Audit Board, was complicit in the scam.

[...] "Shareholders assume directors are smart, devoted people working for the good of Japan Inc. <b>Tough</b> <b>questions</b> are rarely asked."

500|$|As {{the general}} {{election}} season began, Nixon focused his efforts on the [...] "big seven" [...] states: California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. He hired Roger Ailes, whom he had first encountered during an appearance on The Mike Douglas Show, to produce one hour television programs to advertise the campaign in strategic regions. The campaign also continued to use televised town hall segments throughout the campaign, which aired live, featuring real voters whom were instructed to ask <b>tough</b> <b>questions,</b> following the campaign's belief that Nixon would respond well to such questions. Starting the ground campaign tour, during his first stop in Springfield, Illinois, he discussed the importance of unity, stating that [...] "America [...] needs to be united more than any time since Lincoln." [...] He then traveled to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania before returning to New York, meeting with Governor Rockefeller. In those Gallup polls following the convention, Nixon led Humphrey 45% to 29% and topped McCarthy 42% to 37%. At {{the end of the}} month, Hubert Humphrey narrowly won Democratic presidential nominee over McCarthy at the Democratic convention, which was filled with protest and riots. Analysts saw the Democrat's split, along with lacking [...] "law and order" [...] at the convention, positioning Nixon well. Shortly before the convention and throughout {{the general election}}, Nixon received regular briefings from President Johnson on developments in the Vietnam War. The President made it clear to Nixon {{that he did not want}} the war to be politicized, to which Nixon agreed, although questioning Humphrey's eventual compliance.|$|E
