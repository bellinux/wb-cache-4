5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
2500|$|The last 10 {{years of}} her life were {{shrouded}} in obscurity. Yet Hurston maintained her independence and a determined optimism. [...] She wrote in a 1957 letter. [...] "But … I have made phenomenal growth as a creative artist. … I am not materialistic… If I do happen to die without money, somebody will bury me, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish it to be that way." ...|$|E

"And {{therefore}} {{the following question}} may be very carefully inquired into and discussed by learned men, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know whether it is in man's power to resolve it: At what time the infant begins {{to live in the}} womb: whether life exists in a latent form before it manifests itself in the motions of the living being. To deny that the young who are cut out limb by limb from the womb, lest if they were left there dead the mother should die too, have never been alive, seems too audacious." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012 Cockburn stated [...] "I think gay {{marriage}} {{is an incredibly}} boring subject; <b>though,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> like to hear right-wingers say that it will bring the whole edifice of Western civilization crashing down. It's hard, these days, to find such messages of good cheer." [...] Cockburn took an anti-assimilationist position on same-sex marriage asking [...] "Why would an institution which is basically taking church principles, you know, and applying them to a state license to get marriage be regarded as 'progressive'?" [...] He felt it was inconsistent with a radical position, which sees the state as [...] "intrusive on human freedoms", though he did support equality {{at the level of}} civil partnerships he didn't see why this should be limited to monogamous relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson dislikes the British car brand Rover, {{the last}} major British owned and built car manufacturer. This view {{stretched}} back to the company's time as part of British Leyland. Describing {{the history of the}} company up to its last flagship model, the Rover 75, he paraphrased Winston Churchill and stated [...] "Never in the field of human endeavour has so much been done, so badly, by so many," [...] citing issues with the rack and pinion steering system. In the latter years of the company Clarkson blamed the [...] "uncool" [...] brand image as being more of a hindrance to sales than any faults with the cars. On its demise, Clarkson stated [...] "I cannot even get teary and emotional about the demise of the company itself – <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel sorry for the workforce." [...] Clarkson has also expressed hatred for the Toyota Prius.|$|E
2500|$|Henry David Gray {{writes on}} the {{complexity}} of views that readers have taken while contemplating the sonnets. There are the Southamptonites who date the sonnets from 1592–1596, and believe the first 125 sonnets to be in chronological order, the dark lady being Elizabeth Vernon, and the Rival Poet to be Drayton. Gray continues with the next group of critics being Pembrokists, dating the sonnets from 1598 to 1603, the dark lady being Mary Fitton, and the Rival Poet being Chapman. Gray believes, following with Sir Sidney Lee, that the sonnets are literary exercises, {{it is important to}} figure who the dark lady is, that W.H. is not the youth addressed in the first 125 sonnets, the sonnets are in no chronological order, and he had no idea who the rival poet was. Gray proclaims his view, [...] "I am a free lance among the Sonnets' critics with a special set of conjectures all my own; <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> agree with Butler that that W.H. is William Hughes, with Acheson that the Dark Lady is Mistress Davanant, and with Montmorency that the Rival Poet is Spenser." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the early}} readers of Vestiges, Charles Darwin had {{conceived}} his own theory {{of natural selection}} to explain evolution six years earlier, and in July 1844 had written down his ideas in an '"Essay". For a year he had been tentatively discussing his evolutionary ideas in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker, who wrote to Darwin on 30 December 1844 that he had [...] "been delighted with Vestiges, from the multiplicity of facts he brings together, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> [...] agree with his conclusions at all, {{he must be a}} funny fellow: somehow the books looks more like a 9 days wonder than a lasting work: it certainly is “filling at the price”.— I mean the price its reading costs, for it is dear enough otherwise; he has lots of errors." [...] Darwin had read the book in November, finding that it drew on some of the lines of evidence he had been putting together, and introduced questions that had to be dealt with. He responded that he had been [...] "somewhat less amused at it.... the writing & arrangement are certainly admirable, but his geology strikes me as bad, & his zoology far worse. Darwin had learnt geology from Adam Sedgwick, and was particularly interested in what his former mentor had to say about evolution. In October 1845 he wrote to his friend Charles Lyell that Sedgwick's review was a [...] "grand piece of argument against mutability of species" [...] which he had read with [...] "fear & trembling," [...] but had been [...] "well pleased to find" [...] that he had anticipated Sedgwick's objections and [...] "had not overlooked any of the arguments".|$|E
