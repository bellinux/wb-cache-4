It {{is the only place}} in the New Testament where [...] "saves his people" [...] appears with [...] "sins". <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>is</b> underscored by the fact that Matthew pays more {{attention}} to the name of the child and its theological implications than the actual birth event itself. Matthew 1:21 provides the beginnings of the Christology of the name Jesus. At once it achieves the two goals of affirming Jesus as the saviour and emphasizing that the name was not selected at random, but based on a Heavenly command.|$|E
2500|$|The Transfiguration {{not only}} {{supports}} {{the identity of}} Jesus as the Son of God, (as in his Baptism), but the statement [...] "listen to him" [...] identifies him as the messenger and mouth-piece of God. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>is</b> enhanced {{by the presence of}} Elijah and Moses, for it indicates to the apostles that Jesus is the voice of God, and, instead of Elijah or Moses, he should be listened to, by virtue of his filial relationship with God. [...] echoes the same message: at the Transfiguration, God assigns to Jesus a special [...] "honor and glory" [...] and it is the turning point at which God exalts Jesus above all other powers in creation.|$|E

50|$|All signs {{point to}} the sacred, that which is {{significant}} to the community. The sacred cannot be signified directly, since it is essentially an imaginary or ideal construction of mimetic desire. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>is</b> realized in the human relationships as mediated by the sign. When an individual refers to an object or idea, the reference is fundamentally to {{the significance of that}} object or idea for the human community. Language attempts to reproduce the non-violent presence of the community to itself, even though it may attempt to do so sacrificially, by designating a scapegoat victim.|$|E

It was {{initially}} issued in {{the reign of}} James III with a value of 18 shillings Scots, but rising gold prices {{during the reign of}} James V caused its value to increase first to 20 shillings, and then 22. The obverse of the coin shows a crowned unicorn. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>is</b> that the unicorn is one of the heraldic symbols of Scotland, occurring most notably in the royal coat of arms of Scotland as crowned and chained supporters.|$|E

50|$|Loss of the {{myocardium}} due {{to disease}} {{often leads to}} heart failure; therefore, {{it would be useful}} to be able to take cells from elsewhere in the heart to replenish those lost. This was achieved in 2010 when mature cardiac fibroblasts were reprogrammed directly into cardiomyocyte-like cells. This was done using three transcription factors: GATA4, Mef2c, and Tbx5.Cardiac fibroblasts make up more than half of all heart cells and are usually not able to conduct contractions (are not cardiogenic), but those reprogrammed were able to contract spontaneously. <b>The</b> <b>significance</b> <b>is</b> that fibroblasts from the damaged heart or from elsewhere, may be a source of functional cardiomyocytes for regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{believe that}} the peak had {{religious}} significance to the Bronze Age people who inhabited this area.

It has been suggested as a possible site of the battle of Mons Graupius. An alternative Gaelic etymology from *Beinn a' Chath, i.e. 'hill of the battle', is perhaps a possibility.|$|E
