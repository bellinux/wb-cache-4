The data were compiled in two-axis tables (replicate X concentration) and were statistically analyzed by the Spearman-Kärber method. An increase in the concentration of Bo IFN-alpha I 1 enhanced its protective effect against every test virus strain. Bo IFN-alpha I 1 had a marked in vitro effect on the bovine diarrhea viral strains. It demonstrated less protection against the pseudorabies and parainfluenza 3 viruses.

40|$|Mycoplasma bovis is a wall-less {{bacterium}} causing bovine mycoplasmosis, {{a disease}} showing {{a broad range}} of clinical manifestations in cattle. It leads to enormous economic losses to the beef and dairy industries. Antibiotic treatments are not efficacious and currently no efficient vaccine is available. Moreover, mechanisms of pathogenicity of this bacterium are not clear, as few virulence attributes are known. Microscopic observations of necropsy material suggest the possibility of an intracellular stage of M. bovis. We used a combination of a gentamicin protection assay, a variety of chemical treatments to block mycoplasmas entry in eukaryotic cells, and fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy to investigate the intracellular life of M. bovis in calf <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells.</b> Our findings indicate that M. bovis invades and persists in primary embryonic calf <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells.</b> Moreover, M. bovis can multiply within these cells.

Real-time Q-RT-PCR was compared with quantitative competitive RT-PCR (QC-RT-PCR) and viral titers. Viral mRNA levels were measured in BRSV-infected bovine <b>turbinate</b> <b>cell</b> lysate harvested at eight time points (1. 5, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 h) post-infection. A homologous BRSV cRNA standard was used for quantitation of the mRNA by plotting a standard curve of cycle threshold (Ct) values versus standard 10 -fold dilutions of cRNA of known concentrations. Detection as low as 171 copies/μl of standard BRSV cRNA was possible. For QC-RT-PCR, a competitor RNA molecule having a deletion was designed and used for quantitation of the BRSV viral mRNA. The results of real-time Q-RT-PCR and QC-RT-PCR assays showed a positive correlation. Real-time Q-RT-PCR was a sensitive, specific, rapid, and efficient method that eliminates the post-PCR processing steps when compared to QC-RT-PCR.

40|$|Bovine herpesvirus- 1 (BoHV- 1) is a {{pathogen}} of cattle, {{which most}} commonly affects the {{upper respiratory tract}} to cause infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). It can also spread systemically to cause fatalities in calves and abortion in pregnant cattle. The virally encoded mechanisms of this systemic spread are poorly understood and therefore have been addressed by comparing isolates from the respiratory form of disease with isolates that have previously demonstrated systemic spread. A survey of 400 bovine abortions in Scotland from 2007 - 2009 demonstrated a BoHV- 1 prevalence of 2. 5 %. It also demonstrated the importance of real-time PCR as a diagnostic technique when analysing samples from natural cases. The study of BoHV- 1 distribution in the placenta and foetal tissue provided support for a haematogenous route of viral spread. Whole genome sequencing of 11 BoHV- 1 isolates using Illumina Solexa technology was completed and added significantly to the sequencing data of BoHV- 1. In terms of identifying genetic variation between isolates causing respiratory infection and those causing systemic infection, no differences were observed by SNP or phylogenetic analysis. However, {{there were significant differences}} in the extent of variation between essential and non-essential genes, which may reflect the evolution of BoHV- 1. An in vivo challenge of the natural host to compare two isolates representing the respiratory and systemic forms of infection showed differences in clinical presentation, histopathological analysis, viral distribution and viral transcript expression, measured throughout the infection period. In particular, it was noted that a more severe ocular infection, rather than respiratory based infection was caused by infection with the ‘systemic’ isolate. Differences in the tropism of the virus were observed early in the infection with the ‘systemic’ isolate showing more association with the nasal mucosa than the trachea. The tonsils demonstrated different responses to the virus and differences in viral transcript expression. However, this may simply represent different stages of virus infection. Both isolates demonstrated spread to the brain at day 10 post infection. In vitro methods were used to study the differences in transcript expression in more detail. In a bovine <b>turbinate</b> <b>cell</b> infection faster replication of the respiratory isolate was observed by a significantly faster development of cytopathic effect. This was also reflected in the higher gene expression levels of the respiratory isolate in the first 12 hours of infection. More isolates were studied to investigate whether these differences were consistent, or as suggested by the sequencing, random differences between isolates. Six isolates were used to infect bovine lung slices. Differences in transcript expression were minimal between the two isolate groups. Immunofluorescence did not provide the sensitivity to detect virus in all samples where PCR showed replication. This compromised the study of co-localization but did show promise as a model to study the tropism of respiratory viruses. Overall, this work has showed that systemic spread of BoHV- 1 {{does not appear to be}} controlled by virally encoded mechanisms. The in vivo experimental infection suggested host factors may play a large part. Further work is also needed to consider any differences that may exist between reactivated virus and the original infecting isolate. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Chlamydia abortus is {{the most}} common known {{infectious}} cause of ovine abortion worldwide but is rarely linked with bovine abortion. The reasons for this differential pathogenesis are unknown but may involve differences in innate immune recognition and immune responsiveness. This is supported by the observation that chlamydial abortion in sheep is associated with an inflammatory cytokine/chemokine cascade that is not commonly observed in cattle. Studies with other Chlamydia species have demonstrated that innate inflammatory pathways including inflammasome activation contribute to both pathogen clearance and pathology. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activate these innate immune signalling pathways but are relatively poorly characterized in ruminants. We hypothesize that the ruminant hosts differ in their ability to innately sense C. abortus infection and activate the inflammasome. The main aims of this project were to: analyse PRR expression in innate immune cells; assess cytokine production from innate immune cells in response to C. abortus; investigate the role of PRRs in the induction of innate immune responses to C. abortus; and, conduct RNA-seq analysis on macrophages following infection with C. abortus to identify important immune signalling pathways. Ruminant oro-nasal <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells,</b> monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) express the cell-surface PRRs TLR 2 and TLR 4 and also the intracellular PRRs NOD 1 and NLRP 3. Oro-nasal <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells</b> produce CXCL 8 late into the chlamydial developmental cycle independent of IL- 1 β. In contrast, ruminant MDMs and MDDCs secrete early IL- 1 β in response to C. abortus infection. In MDMs and MDDCs, live and UV-inactivated C. abortus induced TNF-α and CXCL 8 but live infection was required for IL- 1 β secretion. Therefore, intracellular C. abortus multiplication is necessary to stimulate the IL- 1 β processing pathway within these cells. In order to determine PRR function, NOD 1 and NLRP 3 were knocked down in ruminant MDMs using siRNA. In both ovine and bovine MDMs, NOD 1 was identified as a factor in C. abortus mediated IL- 1 β production. NLRP 3 knockdown in bovine but not ovine MDMs also reduced IL- 1 β production, indicating species-specific differences in C. abortus recognition. The RNA-seq analysis of ruminant MDMs identified novel pathways of immune activation by C. abortus and potentially important species-specific differences. An improved understanding of the innate immune pathways activated in susceptible and resistant hosts following C. abortus infection will inform on disease pathogenesis and could contribute to novel chlamydial vaccine design...|$|R

Thus in monolayers of 2, 4, 9 and 11 days of age, infectivity titres of six NCRPVs strains varied by 2 - 4 fold. The interference test in BEL cells is routinely used for the detection and titration of NCRPVs in cell lines, viral stocks, blood and swabs from cattle and sheep and viral antisera but more importantly in Foetal Calf Serum (FCS) which is the common source of infection of tissue culture by non-cytopathic BVDV strains.

40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) {{belongs to}} the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. Both a noncytopathic (ncp) and an antigenically related cytopathic (cp) BVDV can be isolated from persistently infected animals suffering from mucosal disease. In every case studied so far, the genomic changes leading to the cp biotype correlate with {{the production of the}} NS 3 nonstructural protein, which, in the ncp biotype, is present in its uncleaved form, NS 23. This report shows that, in contrast to ncp BVDV, the cp biotype induces apoptosis in cultured embryonic bovine <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells.</b> Early in the process of apoptosis, cells show a rise in the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, which is indicative of oxidative stress. This precedes two hallmarks of apoptosis, caspase activation as shown by cleavage of the caspase substrate poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase, and DNA fragmentation. Cells were protected from apoptosis only by certain antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole and ebselen), whereas others (N-acetylcysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, lipoic acid, dihydrolipoic acid and tiron) turned out to be ineffective. Antioxidants that protected cells from apoptosis prevented oxidative stress but failed to block virus growth. These observations suggest that oxidative stress, which occurs early in the interaction between cp BVDV and its host cell, may be a crucial event in the sequence leading to apoptotic cell death. Hence, apoptosis is no...|$|R
40|$|Orf virus (ORFV), {{a member}} of Parapoxvirus, has evolved various {{strategies}} to modulate the immune responses of host cells.

To explore the mechanism by which ORFV 002 regulates NF-κB signaling, the understanding of ORFV 002 potential binding partners in host cells is critical. In this study, ovine S 100 calcium binding protein A 4 (S 100 A 4), prolylendopeptidase-like (PREPL) and NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex 8 (NDUFA 8) were found to interact with ORFV 002 based on the yeast two-hybrid (Y 2 H) assay using a cDNA library derived from primary ovine fetal <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells</b> (OFTu). GST pull-down and bidirectional co-immunoprecipitation assay results demonstrate that ORFV 002 interacts with S 100 A 4 directly. Following the pEGFP-ORFV 002 (p 002 GFP) transfection, we found that cytoplasmic S 100 A 4 translocates into the nucleus and co-localizes with ORFV 002. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of ORFV 002 on NF-κB signaling was significantly restored by S 100 A 4 knock-down phenotype, suggesting ovine S 100 A 4 participating in the ORFV 002 -mediated NF-κB signaling.

A modified susceptibility assay was also used to measure the effect of low concentrations of clindamycin on T. gondii. Macrophages and bovine <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells</b> were infected with low numbers of tachyzoites and were exposed to low concentrations of clindamycin for 5 days. In these systems, a concentration of 10 ng of cindamycin per ml inhibited 50 %Yo of the growth of the parasite in macrophages, while it completely prohibited the growth of the parasite in epithelial cells. When free tachyzoites were preexposed to clindamycin for 4 h, the reduction of parasite infectivity was proportional to the amount of drug; 100 ng of clindamycin per ml reduced the infectivity of T. gondii to 46. 5 % + 8. 5 % of that of the untreated control. A concentration of 40 pLg of clindamycin per ml reduced protein synthesis by 56. 2 % ± 6. 0 %o but had no effect on RNA synthesis after a 4 -h exposure of free tachyzoites of T. gondii to the drug.

While respiratory disease is a hallmark of influenza infection, H 5 N 1 has {{a high incidence of}} neurological sequelae in many animal species and sporadically in humans. We elucidate the temporal/spatial infection of H 5 N 1 in the brain of ferrets following a low dose, intranasal infection of two HPAI strains of varying neurovirulence and lethality. A/Vietnam/ 1203 / 2004 (VN 1203) induced mortality in 100 % of infected ferrets while A/Hong Kong/ 483 / 1997 (HK 483) induced lethality in only 20 % of ferrets, with death occurring significantly later following infection. Neurological signs were prominent in VN 1203 infection, but not HK 483, with seizures observed three days post challenge and torticollis or paresis at later time points. VN 1203 and HK 483 replication kinetics were similar in primary differentiated ferret nasal <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells,</b> and similar viral titers were measured in the nasal turbinates of infected ferrets. Pulmonary viral titers were not different between strains and pathological findings in the lungs were similar in severity.

VN 1203 was identified adjacent to and within the olfactory nerve tract, and multifocal infection was observed throughout the frontal cortex and cerebrum. VN 1203 was also detected throughout the cerebellum, specifically in Purkinje cells and regions that coordinate voluntary movements. These findings suggest the increased lethality of VN 1203 in ferrets is due to increased replication in brain regions important in higher order function and explains the neurological signs observed during H 5 N 1 neurovirulence...|$|R

40|$|Mx {{proteins}} are interferon-induced {{members of}} the dynamin superfamily of large guanosine triphosphatases. These proteins have attracted much attention because some display antiviral activity against pathogenic RNA viruses, such as {{members of the}} orthomyxoviridae, bunyaviridae, and rhabdoviridae families. Among the diverse mammalian Mx proteins examined so far, we have recently demonstrated in vitro that the Bos taurus isoform 1 (boMx 1) is endowed with exceptional anti-rabies-virus activity. This finding has prompted us to seek an appropriate in vivo model for confirming and evaluating gene therapy strategies. Using a BAC transgene, we have generated transgenic mouse lines expressing the antiviral boMx 1 protein and boMx 2 proteins under the control of their natural promoter and short- and long-range regulatory elements. Expressed boMx 1 and boMx 2 are correctly assembled, as deduced from mRNA sequencing and western blotting. Poly-I/C-subordinated expression of boMx 1 was detected in various organs by immunohistochemistry, and transgenic lines were readily classified as high- or low-expression lines on the basis of tissue boMx 1 concentrations measured by ELISA. Poly-I/C-induced Madin-Darby bovine kidney <b>cells,</b> bovine <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells,</b> and cultured cells from high-expression line of transgenic mice were found to contain about the same concentration of boMx 1, suggesting that this protein is produced at near-physiological levels. Furthermore, insertion of the bovine Mx system rendered transgenic mice resistant to vesicular-stomatitis-virus-associated morbidity and mortality, and embryonic fibroblasts derived from high-expression transgenic mice were far less permissive to the virus. These results demonstrate that the Bos taurus Mx system is a powerful anti-VSV agent in vivo and suggest that the transgenic mouse lines generated here constitute a good model for studying in vivo the various antiviral functions-known and yet to be discovered-exerted by bovine Mx proteins, with priority emphasis on the antirabic function of boMx 1.

40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} is {{the outcome}} of an IgE-mediated allergic response in the nose. Previous studies of IgE produced by B-cells in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients have shown an increased usage of the V H 5 gene family, compared to the normal blood V H gene repertoire, which {{has been attributed to}} superantigen activity. Work reported in this thesis has been undertaken to investigate further how the antibody repertoire is shaped in allergic rhinitis. IgA-expressing B-cells in the nasal mucosa, from allergic and non-allergic donors, were also shown to have an increased usage of VH 5 genes compared to the normal blood repertoire, suggesting the nasal environment favours VH 5 expansion prior to allergy development. Somatic hypermutation patterns in VH 5 -Ca sequences were indicative of superantigen selection. FACS analysis of nasal <b>turbinate</b> <b>cells</b> with antibodies to S. aureus enterotoxins (SE) demonstrated TSST - 1 + cells in allergic nasal tissue only. Incubation of nasal turbinate tissue with SEs appeared not to influence the VH-Cϵ repertoire in 24 hours, but SED + IL- 4 may have inhibited VH-Cϵ transcription in allergic patients. Evidence of local antigen stimulation prior to SE incubation was evident in one of the patients; a large VH 5 clonal family exhibiting extensive somatic hypermutation was present throughout the nasal turbinate. FACS sorting of Phl pl-binding plasma cells and single cell RT-PCR enabled cloning of a scFv fragment representing the V regions of a physiological, allergen-specific antibody expressed in allergic nasal mucosa. The scFv cloning protocol has also been applied to VH 5 genes of interest, thus facilitating the study of their protein structure and function. This research increases the evidence for local, VH 5 -selecting, superantigen activity in the nasal mucosa and has developed a platform for further investigation of nasal antibody- superantigen / allergen interactions in allergic rhinitis.

Sequence analysis of molecular clones revealed an important genetic heterogeneity in G coding region of each population, with mutation frequencies ranging from 6. 8 to 10. 1 10 - 4 substitutions/nucleotide. The non-synonymous mutations of the mutant spectrum mapped preferentially within the two variable antigenic regions of the ectodomain or close to the highly conserved domain.

We tested the hypothesis that turbinate size affects human turbinate-derived MSC (hTMSCs) quantity, proliferation, and differentiation into osteogenic lineages, and that hypertrophic turbinates may predispose to NSD on the contralateral side. Subjects and Methods: The hypertrophic and contralateral inferior turbinate tissues used in our study were obtained and cultured from the tissue discarded from 10 patients who underwent septoplasty and partial turbinectomy. After isolating the hTMSCs from both <b>turbinates,</b> the <b>cells</b> were enumerated using an automated cell counter. The expression of surface markers for MSCs over four passages was assessed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS), and cell proliferation was assessed using a cell counting kit (CCK) - 8 according to turbinate size. In addition, osteogenic differentiation of hTMSCs was identified using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red S staining, after which osteoblastic gene expression was evaluated. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of hTMSCs. FACS analysis revealed that the hTMSCs were negative for CD 14, CD 19, CD 34, and HLA-DR, and positive for CD 29, CD 73, and CD 90, representing a characteristic MS...|$|R
40|$|Common cold {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} human inflammatory diseases caused by viruses and can facilitate bacterial super-infections resulting in sinusitis or pneumonia. The active ingredient of the drug Soledum, 1, 8 -cineole, is commonly applied for treating inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. However, the potential of 1, 8 -cineole for treating primary viral infections of the respiratory tract remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that 1, 8 -cineole potentiates Poly(I:C) -induced activity of the anti-viral transcription factor Interferon Regulatory Factor 3, while simultaneously reducing pro-inflammatory NF-κB-activity in human <b>cell</b> lines, inferior <b>turbinate</b> stem <b>cells</b> (ITSCs) and ex vivo cultivated human nasal mucosa. Co-treatment of cell lines with Poly(I:C) and 1, 8 -cineole resulted in significantly increased IRF 3 reporter gene activity compared to Poly(I:C) alone, whereas NF-κB-activity was reduced. Accordingly, 1, 8 -cineole- and Poly(I:C) -treatment led to increased nuclear translocation of IRF 3 in ITSCs and a human ex vivo model of rhinosinusitis compared to the Poly(I:C) -treated approach. Nuclear translocation of IRF 3 was significantly increased in ITSCs and slice cultures treated with LPS and 1, 8 -cineole compared to the LPS-treated cells mimicking bacterial infection. Our findings strongly suggest that 1, 8 -cineole potentiates the antiviral activity of IRF 3 in addition to its inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory NF-κB-signalling and may thus broaden its field of application...|$|R

Here we describe {{for the first time}} a novel neural crest-derived stem cell population within the respiratory epithelium of human adult inferior turbinate. In contrast to superior and middle turbinates, high amounts of source material could be isolated from human inferior turbinates. Using minimally-invasive surgery methods isolation is efficient even in older patients. Within their endogenous niche, inferior <b>turbinate</b> stem <b>cells</b> (ITSCs) expressed high levels of nestin, p 75 (NTR), and S 100. Immunoelectron microscopy using anti-p 75 antibodies displayed that ITSCs are of glial origin and closely related to nonmyelinating Schwann cells. Cultivated ITSCs were positive for nestin and S 100 and the neural crest markers Slug and SOX 10. Whole genome microarray analysis showed pronounced differences to human ES cells in respect to pluripotency markers OCT 4, SOX 2, LIN 28, and NANOG, whereas expression of WDR 5, KLF 4, and c-MYC was nearly similar. ITSCs were able to differentiate into cells with neuro-ectodermal and mesodermal phenotype. Additionally ITSCs are able to survive and perform neural crest typical chain migration in vivo when transplanted into chicken embryos. However ITSCs do not form teratomas in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Finally, we developed a separation strategy based on magnetic cell sorting of p 75 (NTR) positive ITSCs that formed larger neurospheres and proliferated faster than p 75 (NTR) negative ITSCs. Taken together our study describes a novel, readily accessible source of multipotent human NCSCs for potential cell-replacement therapy...|$|R

They are predominantly freshwater fungi occurring on woody substrata, with Manglicola guatemalensis, Xylomyces chlamydosporus and X. rhizophorae the only species known from marine habitats. The order Jahnulales with 4 teleomorphic genera: Jahnula (15 species), Aliquandostipite (5), Megalohypha (1), Manglicola (2) and the anamorphic genera Brachiosphaera (2), Speiropsis (9), Xylomyces (8), amounting {{to a total of}} 42 species, is reviewed and nomenclatural changes are proposed. Twenty species are treated at the molecular level, with 94 sequences, 13 of which are newly generated for this review. Three species are rejected (Speiropsis irregularis, Xylomyces aquaticus, X. elegans) while the phylogenetic placement of 6 Xylomyces, 7 Speiropsis, 1 Brachiosphaera and 1 Manglicola require molecular data to confirm their placement in the order. Sequences are derived from ex-holotype isolates and new collections made in Thailand. Most taxa are included in the family Aliquandostipitaceae and a new family Manglicolaceae is erected for the marine ascomycete Manglicola guatemalensis with its large ascomata (1, 100 - 1, 750 x 290 - 640 mu m), wide ostioles and ascospores that are fusiform, unequally one-septate with the apical cell larger than the <b>turbinate</b> basal <b>cell</b> and bear apical gelatinous appendages. The genus Jahnula is polyphyletic grouping in three clades with J. aquatica, J. granulosa, J. rostrata, J. potamophila and Megalohypha aqua-dulces in the Jahnula sensu stricto clade.

40|$|Due {{to their}} broad {{differentiation}} potential and their persistence into adulthood, human neural crest-derived stem cells (NCSCs) harbour {{great potential for}} autologous cellular therapies, which include the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and replacement of complex tissues containing various cell types, {{as in the case}} of musculoskeletal injuries. The use of serum-free approaches often results in insuffi cient proliferation of stem cells and foetal calf serum implicates the use of xenogenic medium components. Thus, there is much need for alternative cultivation strategies. In this study we describe for the fi rst time a novel, human blood plasma based semi-solid medium for cultivation of human NCSCs. We cultivated human neural crest-derived inferior <b>turbinate</b> stem <b>cells</b> (ITSCs) within a blood plasma matrix, where they revealed higher proliferation rates compared to a standard serum-free approach. Three-dimensionality of the matrix was investigated using helium ion microscopy. ITSCs grew within the matrix as revealed by laser scanning microscopy. Genetic stability and maintenance of stemness characteristics were assured in 3 D cultivated ITSCs, as demonstrated by unchanged expression profi le and the capability for self-renewal. ITSCs pre-cultivated in the 3 D matrix differentiated effi ciently into ectodermal and mesodermal cell types, particularly including osteogenic cell types. Furthermore, ITSCs cultivated as described here could be easily infected with lentiviruses directly in substrate for potential tracing or gene therapeutic approaches. Taken together, the use of human blood plasma as an additive for a completely defi ned medium points towards a personalisable and autologous cultivation of human neural crest-derived stem cells under clinical grade conditions...|$|R
40|$|The John Cunningham virus (JCV) asymptomatically infects a large {{proportion}} (~ 90 %) of the population worldwide but may be activated in immunodeficient patients, resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Recent reports demonstrated its oncogenic role in malignancies. In this paper, the presence of JCV-targeting T antigen was investigated in tongue carcinoma (TC, n[*]=[*] 39), dysplastic tongue epithelium (DTE, n[*]=[*] 15) and glossitis (n[*]=[*] 15) using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ PCR and immunohistochemistry, and JCV copies were analyzed with the clinicopathological parameters of TCs. The results demonstrated that glossitis and DTEs had significantly lower copies of JCV (410. 5 [*]±[*] 44. 3 and 658. 3 [*]±[*] 53. 3 copies/μg DNA respectively) than TCs (981. 5 [*]±[*] 14. 0, p[*] <[*] 0. 05). When they were divided into three groups with 0 – 200 copies/μg DNA (low), 201 – 1, 000 (moderate) and more than 1001 (high), TCs showed 3 (7. 6 %) in the low group, 21 (53. 8 %) in the moderate group and 15 (38. 4 %) in the high group and glossitis showed 11 (73. 3 %) in the low group, 0 (0 %) in the moderate group and 4 (26. 6 %) in the high group. The DTEs occupied an intermediate position between them (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). In situ PCR demonstrated that the nuclei of TC and DTE cells are sporadically T-antigen positive but not in nasal <b>turbinate</b> epithelial <b>cells.</b> Immunohistochemistry for T-antigen protein revealed four positive cases only in TCs. The existence of JCV T-antigen DNA {{was not associated with}} the clinicopathological variables of TCs. In conclusion, the presence of JCV may be a risk factor of tongue carcinogenesis...|$|R

The cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation potential of the hTMSCs were also not significantly different between the two groups. We conclude that turbinate size does not affect the characterization, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation potential of hTMSCs in vitro test, and therefore should not affect the clinical decision of whether to use autologous or allogenic hTMSCs.

40|$|Human <b>turbinate</b> mesenchymal stromal <b>cells</b> (hTMSCs) are novel {{stem cells}} derived from nasal {{inferior}} turbinate tissues. They {{are easy to}} isolate from the donated tissue after turbinectomy or conchotomy. In this study, we applied hTMSCs to a nonviral gene delivery system using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a gene carrier; furthermore, the cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency of hTMSCs were evaluated to confirm their potential as resources in gene therapy. DNA-PEI nanoparticles (NPs) were generated by adding the PEI solution to DNA and were characterized by a gel electrophoresis and by measuring particle size and surface charge of NPs. The hTMSCs were treated with DNA-PEI NPs for 4 [*]h, and toxicity of NPs to hTMSCs and gene transfection efficiency were monitored using MTT assay, fluorescence images, and flow cytometry after 24 [*]h and 48 [*]h. At a high negative-to-positive charge ratio, DNA-PEI NPs treatment led to cytotoxicity of hTMSCs, but the transfection efficiency of DNA was increased due to the electrostatic effect between the NPs and the membranes of hTMSCs.

40|$|Epitopic {{analysis}} of the 53 kd envelope glycoprotein of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was performed. Monoclonal antibodies that neutralized virus infectivity were used in a competitive binding assay to determine the spatial orientation of epitopes. Results of the assay indicate that the panel of monoclonal antibodies defined at least two distinct antigenic domains: A, and B/C. The majority of monoclonal antibodies recognized overlapping epitopes in domain A. Antigenic domain B/C was defined by the binding of two monoclonal antibodies to gp 53 from either of two viruses. The neutralizing activity of each monoclonal antibody was complement-independent. A dot-immunoblot assay, using denatured viral protein, determined the nature of each epitope. Endoglycosidase treatment indicated that the epitopes were located {{in or near the}} carbohydrate moiety of the glycoprotein;A novel method for rapid production of viral antigen was developed. Viral antigen (Singer isolate of cytopathic virus) was produced by two methods which were compared for ease of production and antigen yield. Virus was propagated in bovine <b>turbinate</b> (BT) <b>cells.</b> In one method, BVDV antigen was purified from infected BT cells by using glycerol-potassium tartrate density gradient centrifugation. In the second method, BVDV-infected BT cells were solubilized and antigen was released with the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS. Detergent was removed by chromatography and antigen was ready for immediate use, or could be stored for future use. Antigen yield by detergent solubilization was greater than gradient-purified antigen. Detergent-solubilized BVDV antigen could be detected by enzyme immunoassay at a sixteen-fold greater dilution than gradient-purified BVDV antigen. This antigen was used in an enzyme immunoassay to detect antibody to BVDV in fetal bovine sera. BVDV antigen obtained from one 150 cm[superscript] 2 cell culture flask supplied sufficient antigen to assay 282 samples of fetal bovine serum. Peroxidase-labeled protein G was used to detect bovine antibody. A good correlation existed between results from enzyme immunoassay and those from viral neutralization tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether a chlamydial isolate recovered from nasal swabs from swine with pneumonia could cause pneumonia and rhinitis in gnotobiotic pigs. The identity of the isolate currently is unknown, but it shares characteristics with Chlamydia trachomatis. After propagation in Vero cells and preparation of the inoculum (2. 5 x 1010 inclusion-forming units/ml), Chlamydiae were instilled into nostrils (1. 0 ml/nostril) and lungs (2. 0 ml intralaryngeally) of 15 anesthetized 3 -day-old gnotobiotic piglets. Five age-matched gnotobiotic piglets were anesthetized and sham infected with uninfected cell culture lysates. Two treated piglets were moribund and 2 were severely dyspneic prior to necropsy 7 days postinfection (DPI), whereas remaining treated piglets showed mild dyspnea upon exertion throughout the study. All treated piglets developed diarrhea. All treated piglets necropsied 7 - 21 DPI had extensive consolidation in cranial, middle, and accessory lung lobes; a majority of these piglets also had extensive consolidation in the caudal lobes. Treated piglets necropsied 28 and 35 DPI had a lobular pattern of consolidation in all lung lobes. Histologically, lesions in lungs from treated piglets necropsied 7, 14, and 21 DPI were characterized by bronchointerstitial pneumonia with foci of type II pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia; pneumocytes and bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells were markedly vacuolated. Alveolar macrophages, peribronchitis, peribronchiolitis, and perivasculitis were seen in lungs from treated piglets necropsied 28 and 35 DPI; those necropsied 28 DPI also had foci of lymphohistiocytic and plasmacytic infiltrates. Turbinate lesions in all treated piglets were characterized by mild multifocal lymphoplasmacytic and occasionally neutrophilic rhinitis. Immunohistochemistry detected chlamydial antigen in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and inflammatory cells in treated piglets necropsied 7, 14, and 21 DPI. Positive staining was limited to alveolar macrophages in treated piglets necropsied 28 and 35 DPI.

40|$|A porcine {{strain of}} Pasteurella multocida (serotype D: 3) {{produced}} a toxin causing turbinate atrophy (TA) in pigs. The toxin (TAT), processed {{on a high}} performance liquid chromatography size exclusion column, eluted as a single peak (molecular weight of about 160, 000) containing trace amounts of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS; protein:LPS, 85 : 1). The eluted fraction migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels as a single band. It could be prevented from dissociating into two prominent polypeptides by addition of a protease inhibitor. A single dose (2. 0 to 79. 0 micrograms/kg) of TAT given to pigs intravenously was lethal. Doses from 0. 02 to 1. 0 microgram/kg caused transient clinical signs of porcine systemic toxicosis with reduced appetite, generalized weakness, depression, lethargy, weight loss, and in some instances, death. Intradermal doses of TAT (greater {{than or equal to}} 0. 1 microgram/site) produced hemorrhagic areas within four hours. Systemically, TAT causes bilateral TA, lymphopenia, liver dysfunctions, and possible renal impairment. Affinity of TAT for cells of epithelial origin was demonstrated in mice given 125 I-TAT.

Excess hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) released by cells propagates oxidative stress, which is {{the primary cause of}} tissue injury leading to failure in tissue regeneration. Hence, preventing tissue from oxidative damage becomes imperative. For the first time, we entrapped catalase, an antioxidant in a scaffold as a novel approach in bioengineering to prevent tissue from H 2 O 2 -induced damage. The gel prepared from the mixture of decellularized adipose tissue and high viscous sodium alginate was used to entrap the catalase, and was coated to 3 D polycaprolactone porous scaffolds.
