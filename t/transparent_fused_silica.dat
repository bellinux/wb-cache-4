40|$|As a {{low cost}} and high {{throughput}} method for nanoscale pattern replication, step and flash imprint lithography (SFIL) with UV transparent masters is gaining prominence for its potential in photonics and integrated-circuit fabrication. However, dielectric materials appropriate for fabricating nanostructured SFIL masters present a challenge when employing electron beam lithography (EBL) because insulator substrates covered by polymeric resists such as PMMA tend to accumulate charge during EBL exposures, thereby degrading the process. In this work we explore the performance of four different EBL anticharging schemes for nanofabrication of dense arrays of dots having diameters 16 - 30 nm in PMMA on UV <b>transparent</b> <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> (FS) substrates. These include overlayers of aluminum or a water-soluble conducting polymer, as well as sandwiching of Al or Cr thin films between the substrate and PMMA.

The ability to maintain near-constant intensity profiles over an appreciable distance along the propagation direction, sustaining nonlinear absorption, recommends ultrafast Bessel beams for high aspect ratio submicron structuring applications. We discuss here {{the characteristics of the}} interaction of <b>transparent</b> materials, especially <b>fused</b> <b>silica,</b> with ultrafast non-diffractive beams of moderate and high cone angle at various laser energies and pulse durations. We define their impact on photoinscription regimes, i. e. formation of isotropic and non-isotropic refractive index structures (Fig. 1) and the stability limits. The laser pulse duration was observed to be key in deciding the type and morphology of the structures. In particular, high aspect ratio void-like structures with submicron cores (down to 100 nm) over hundreds of microns are produced when using laser pulse of longer pulse duration, highlighting the important contribution of delayed ionization and light diffusion on excited carriers. On the contrary, for the same energy, smooth refractive index modified structures are produced for short laser pulses. To understand the formation mechanisms of these structures, we studied the ultrafast dynamics of excitation around the modification threshold using time-resolved microscopy and spectral imaging techniques. We reveal various relaxation mechanisms leading to either permanent refractive index changes accompanied by structural characteristic defect markers or to hydrodynamic phenomena and cavitation in hot states. We observe fast carrier trapping in structural matrix deformations for soft positive index changes accompanied by the formation of non-bridging oxygen centers and long living carriers characteristic of "phase" transition and hydrodynamic expansion for void-like domains. To illustrate the respective material changes we compare the ultrafast laser material interaction mechanisms in terms of energy deposition and relaxation characteristics in <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> associated with Bessel beams [1].

30|$|The {{effects of}} the {{nanostructure}} on <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> substrates, which have a lower defect density than the two other glass substrates and variable strength enhancement under identical test conditions, were further analyzed using Weibull analyses. Randomly distributed surface and subsurface defects cause undesirable variation in the bending strength. Under the same bending conditions, the Weibull modulus (m) defines a statistical variation based on the probability of failure, where a larger variation causes a lower m. A larger m value is indicative of a more predictable failure behavior, which is required for reliability considerations. This modulus was 8.2, 7.8, and 6.8 for plain <b>fused</b> <b>silica,</b> aluminosilicate, and borosilicate glasses, respectively. This result confirms the unpredictable behavior of borosilicate glass, which was caused by random defects and {{a larger number of}} random stress concentration points than in the aluminosilicate and <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> substrates (Fig.  5 a). The fabrication of 750 -nm-deep nanostructured <b>fused</b> <b>silica,</b> aluminosilicate, and borosilicate glass substrates increased the Weibull modulus to 10.9, 10.7, and 11, respectively (Fig.  5 b).
