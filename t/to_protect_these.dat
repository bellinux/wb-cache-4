5|$|The {{plight of}} {{albatross}} and large seabirds, {{as well as}} other marine creatures, being taken as bycatch by long-line fisheries, has been addressed by a large number of non-governmental organizations (including BirdLife International, the American Bird Conservancy and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). This led to the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, a legally binding treaty designed <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> threatened species, which has been ratified by eleven countries as of 2008 (namely Argentina, Australia, Chile, Ecuador, France, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom).|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. <b>To</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E
5|$|In September 1987, B-1B (s/n 84-0052) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 338th Combat Crew Training Squadron, Dyess AFB crashed near La Junta, Colorado while flying on a {{low-level}} training route. This {{was the only}} B-1B crash to occur with six crew members aboard. The two crew members in jump seats, {{and one of the}} four crew members in ejection seats perished. The root cause of the accident was thought to be a bird strike on a wing's leading edge during the low-level flight. The impact was severe enough to sever fuel and hydraulic lines {{on one side of the}} aircraft, the other side's engines functioned long enough to allow for ejection. The B-1B fleet was later modified <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> supply lines.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} since Troude's failure, the French had only sent small supply ships to Guadeloupe, while {{carefully}} preparing a major expedition at Nantes. Two French flûtes, 'Loire, {{under the command of}} lieutenant de vaisseau Joseph Normand-Kergré, and 'Seine, under the coommand of lieutenant de vaisseau Bernard Vincent, took on board large quantities of food supplies and over 200 military reinforcements each. <b>To</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> ships two frigates were detailed to escort the convoy to Guadeloupe: Renommée, under Commodore François Roquebert, and Clorinde, under Captain Jacques Saint-Cricq. The force departed on 15 November 1809 and made rapid progress across the Atlantic, avoiding all contact with British warships. Of the small ships despatched around the same time, none reached Guadeloupe; all were captured in the Western Atlantic or Caribbean by warships sent by Cochrane to patrol for approaching French reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that the area around Chiprovtsi has been {{inhabited}} {{since the time of}} the Thracians and later the Roman Empire, when the local metal deposits were exploited. According to historian V. Velkov, the valley of the Ogosta was inhabited by Thracians since the early 1st millennium BC. According to ancient accounts, the area was populated by the Thracian tribe of the Triballi or a related group of Thracians. The Romans conquered what is today the Bulgarian northwest after 29 BC and consolidated their authority in the region under Emperor Trajan (98–117). There are remains of Roman fortifications around Chiprovtsi, such as the Latin Fortress ruins in the Kula area, where coins dating to the reigns of Marcus Aurelius (161–180) and Commodus (180–192) have been unearthed, and the Big Ruins south of the town. The gold, silver, lead, copper and iron mines brought sizable revenue to the Romans, who took good care <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> from barbarian attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 had {{resulted}} in a Russian withdrawal from the Adriatic and the French takeover of the strategic island fortress of Corfu. The Treaty of Schönbrunn with the Austrian Empire in 1809 had further solidified French influence in the area by formalising their control of the Illyrian Provinces on the Eastern shore. <b>To</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> gains, the French and Italian governments had instigated a shipbuilding program in Venice and other Italian ports {{in an effort to}} rebuild their Mediterranean fleet and challenge British hegemony. These efforts were hampered by the poverty of the Italian government and the difficulty that the French Navy had in manning and equipping their ships. As a result, the first ship of the line built in the Adriatic under this program was not launched until 1810 and not completed until early 1812.|$|E

50|$|Marion Pritchard, (née van Binsbergen; 7 November 1920 - 11 December 2016) was a Dutch-American {{social worker}} and psychoanalyst, who {{distinguished}} herself as a savior of Jews in the Netherlands during the Second World War. Pritchard helped save approximately 150 Dutch Jews, most of them children, throughout the German occupation of the Netherlands. In addition <b>to</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>these</b> people's lives, she was imprisoned by Nazis, worked {{in collaboration with the}} Dutch resistance, and shot and killed a Dutch Nazi.|$|R
5|$|The spit {{is moving}} towards the {{mainland}} at about 1m per year, {{and for the}} last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel, just west of the reserve, was 400m (440yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195m (215yd) {{by the end of the}} twentieth century. The landward movement of the shingle also means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village. The Environment Agency considered a number of remedial options <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> vulnerable areas, and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £1.5million.|$|E
5|$|These men soon saw {{action on}} 27 January, at the Battle of Brienne. Here, two {{companies}} of horse artillery, under an officer called Marin, {{a veteran of}} the campaigns in Italy and Egypt and personal favourite of the Emperor, were almost completely destroyed, with their guns and commander captured by the enemy. Napoleon was extremely irritated about the failure of the heavy cavalry of the Guard <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> gunners. A further loss of cannon of the Guard artillery occurred at the Battle of La Rothière, a rare battlefield defeat for Napoleon. Here, a part of the Guard cavalry charged and was initially successful against enemy cavalry but, faced by steady ranks of the Russian and Prussian Guardsmen and with its flank threatened by enemy dragoons, it soon had to withdraw, leaving behind some of its cannon.|$|E
5|$|The City of London's first {{reconstruction}} {{plan was}} written by the City Engineer F. J. Forty and published in 1944. It had met with considerable criticism and William Morrison, Minister for Town and Country Planning, asked the City of London Corporation to prepare a new plan. Holden was approached, and he accepted provided that William Holford also be appointed. Holden's and Holford's City of London Plan (1946–1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of plot ratio calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the ground area. For the bomb-devastated area around St Paul's Cathedral, Holden proposed a new precinct around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. The heights of buildings would be strictly defined <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>these</b> views. The plan was accepted by the Minister for Town and Country Planning in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan.|$|E
