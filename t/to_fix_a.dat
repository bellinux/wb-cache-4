5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>a</b> bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E

5|$|The {{athletics}} venue suffered with drainage problems, {{and from}} the 1970s {{it was no longer}} used for competitions. This forced Minerva IS to hold many of its trainings at Stovner stadion in Oslo and Jessheim stadion in Ullensaker. In 1976, Minerva IS took initiative to lay all-weather running track, but the proposal was rejected by the municipality. In 1990, Skedsmo Municipal Council initially voted to allocate NOK2 million for all-weather running track, but the funding was reallocated <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>a</b> leaking roof on Skedsmo Church. No further grants were issued for the stadium.|$|E

In spite of several donations of money to the Kumaritashvili family, the tragedy was hard on them; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>a</b> meal for Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple stays in hospital.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{originally}} {{announced that}} users {{who did not}} install the update would not receive any other updates after May 13, 2014. However, meeting this deadline proved challenging: The ability to deploy Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) was disabled shortly after its release following {{the discovery of a}} bug which affects the ability to use WSUS as a whole in certain server configurations. Microsoft later fixed the issue but users continued to report that the update may fail to install. Microsoft's attempt to fix the problem was ineffective, to the point that Microsoft pushed the support deadline further to June 30, 2014.

5|$|Nelson Piquet was {{the only}} driver not {{to start with the}} softer {{compound}} dry-weather tyres on a track which was still drying from morning rain, with the Brazilian opting for the harder tyre available. There was a strong chance of showers predicted during the race. Several cars were slow away on the slippery track, most notably Kovalainen. The main beneficiaries off the line were Piquet and Trulli, who each gained five places. Trulli was hit from behind at the first corner by Bourdais, who also had a quick start. The Toyota suffered diffuser and gearbox damage from the incident, spinning later in the lap. Kovalainen and Heidfeld also collided at the start. This allowed Alonso to gain several places. Sebastian Vettel locked his brakes and ran wide, losing two places. Fisichella collided with Nakajima on the first lap and had to pit <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>a</b> broken front wing and punctures. Hamilton led from Räikkönen who managed to pass his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa on the Kemmel straight.|$|E

When stopped this time, the 62-ton ship had Montenegrin soldiers, weapons, and ammunition aboard. The vessel was seized as a prize and taken back to Kotor. U-16 attempted two more Albanian patrols {{at the end of}} December. The first, departing Kotor on 19 December, was cut short by severe weather that forced the submarine back to port. The next attempt, on 25 December, ended when U-16 suffered engine problems. U-16 sailed for Pula on 27 December for more extensive engine repairs at the naval base there.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seasons}} {{following}} their second league title, Liverpool enjoyed limited success, generally finishing in midtable. They finished {{in second place}} behind Aston Villa in the 1909–10 season, the last for their captain, Raisbeck, who returned to his native Scotland to play for Partick Thistle. Liverpool's form declined after his departure, with their best performance in the League a 12th-place finish in the 1912–13 season. There was improvement in 1914 when the club reached their first FA Cup final, which they lost 1–0 to Burnley at Crystal Palace.The following season four Liverpool players were implicated in the 1915 British football betting scandal, which involved a match with Manchester United. A 2–0 victory for United was required to win the bet, in which players from both sides were involved. With the score at 2–0, Liverpool's Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar with a shot, at which several of his teammates gestured angrily towards him. Subsequently, Tom Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were found guilty by a Football Association (FA) enquiry of conspiring with three Manchester United players (Sandy Turnbull, Arthur Whalley and Enoch West) <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>a</b> United win. All the players involved were banned for life. Following {{the end of the}} First World War, in which Turnbull was killed at the Battle of Arras in 1917, the FA lifted the surviving players' bans in recognition of their service in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2016 (August 29, 1997, {{being the}} date when Skynet becomes self-aware in the films), it was {{announced}} that the film would be digitally remastered in 3D to commemorate its 25th anniversary, with a worldwide re-release planned for summer 2017. The version to be remastered and rereleased in 3D was the original 137 minute theatrical cut, as the extended edition is not James Cameron's preferred version. Only one camera shot from the opening chase sequence was digitally altered <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>a</b> minor continuity error which had bugged Cameron since the 1991 release. DMG Entertainment and Studiocanal worked together with Cameron to convert the film using the StereoD technology. The 3D version premiered on February 17, 2017, at the Berlin International Film Festival, with the theatrical re-release being scheduled for August 25, 2017. Similar to Cameron's Titanic 3D, Lightstorm Entertainment oversaw the work on the 3D version of Terminator 2, which took nearly a year to finish. The film was released by Distrib Films US which typically handles the release of French films. The studio released the film exclusively for one week in AMC Theatres nationwide, and said that it will expand depending on the film's performances in its first week.|$|E
