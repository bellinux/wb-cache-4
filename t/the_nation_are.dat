25|$|India {{has been}} using {{imported}} enriched uranium and are under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed {{various aspects of the}} nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors.

While Uranium deposits in <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>are</b> extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of Thorium and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel.
