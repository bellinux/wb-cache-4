5|$|Throughout the years, {{the unusual}} nature of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> Chimaeras {{has given rise}} to a number of stories {{occasionally}} repeated in guide-books or newspapers, which are however either untrue or lacking any verifiable source.|$|E
5|$|A {{curtain wall}} {{to the north of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> a gazebo is also {{designated}} as a listed building. It includes 14th century masonry {{at the bottom of the}} wall; however most of the structure as it is now dates from the 18th and 19th centuries. The corner gazebo was built in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|After {{attempts}} to persuade Muchlisin {{to keep the}} original design fail, Sakera overhears that the house is on disputed land.

40|$|In {{the former}} study, the authors {{proposed}} an empirical formula to predict excess attenuation of road traffic noise by detached <b>houses</b> on <b>the</b> {{basis of the}} experiment in which model <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> flat roofs and the same height were used. On the other hand, most of detached houses have slanted roofs, and <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> various heights are mixed in <b>the</b> actual residential <b>houses</b> in Japan. Two experiments were performed in this paper to examine the validity of applying the formula to real residential area. In the first experiment, <b>the</b> model <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> gable roofs were used, {{and in the second}} one <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> various height were mixed in the residential area. The results were compared with the predicted values by the authors 2 ̆ 7 formula, and good agreement was found between them. This shows that the formula is applicable to <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>with</b> gable roofs or various heights...|$|R
5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> the police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran {{up one of the}} staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E

Carla has decided to take one year parental leave, and Laverne, Ted, and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ("Gonna Miss You, Carla"). Carla begins {{to realize that she}} does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E

Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
