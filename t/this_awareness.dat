5|$|The {{ability to}} plan and strategize, much like {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen in}} the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, <b>this</b> <b>awareness</b> would have been essential for survival and the {{ability to plan}} subsistence strategies based on <b>this</b> <b>awareness</b> demonstrates an ability to think beyond the present tense and act upon this knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Samkhya school {{suggests}} that jnana (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha, Patanjali {{suggests that}} systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is {{the path to}} moksha. Patanjali holds that ignorance {{is the cause of}} suffering and saṁsāra. Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminative discernment, knowledge and self-awareness. The Yoga Sūtras is Yoga school's treatise on how to accomplish this. Samādhi is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, and this is how one starts the process of becoming aware of Purusa and true Self. It further claims that <b>this</b> <b>awareness</b> is eternal, and once <b>this</b> <b>awareness</b> is achieved, a person cannot ever cease being aware; this is moksha, the soteriological goal in Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{either from}} {{religious}} belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether {{we are concerned}} with a Creator or the substratum which underlies our experience of phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, religion and science agree in the supreme truth that the human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called <b>this</b> <b>awareness</b> of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, {{he thought that the}} Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{hours of}} the game, before the player started to acquire {{some of the more}} potent powers, were {{considered}} to be difficult and may be off-putting to some. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer noted the remainder of the game continues to have some difficult sections, such as sections where the player must defend a moving target against a large number of foes, and considered these to be [...] "repetitive and overlong". Bramwell further commented that the electrical powers in the game are simply electricity-based reimaginings of standard video game weapon archetypes, such as shotguns and sniper rifles, and, with <b>this</b> <b>awareness,</b> leaves the difficulty of the game up to the enemy placement during encounters. [...] The game is also considered to be rough around the edges in technical execution, with the lack of anti-aliasing and occasional [...] "pop-in" [...] rendering, as well as drops in frame rates when there was a significant amount of action on the screen.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, American {{livestock}} breed enthusiasts, including scientists, farmers, and historians, {{became increasingly}} {{aware of the}} disappearance of many traditional livestock breeds in the US. <b>This</b> <b>awareness</b> was partially due to difficulties encountered in obtaining heritage breeds for living history sites. This was particularly evident when historians were searching for historically authentic breeds to display at the Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts and were unable to find sheep of the Vermont strain of Merino, as they had gone extinct. As a result, these historians and others decided to attempt preservation of other rare breeds facing extinction. On March 16, 1977, the American Minor Breeds Conservancy was incorporated in Vermont. It was the first United States organization focused on preserving rare breeds of livestock and promoting genetic diversity among livestock breeds, and remains the preeminent organization in this field in the United States. A similar organization in Great Britain, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, had been formed in 1973. The organization conducted its first comprehensive survey of American livestock breeds in 1985. Since then, the survey has been repeated every five years, with the status of endangered breeds being monitored in between. The initial survey was called [...] "the most comprehensive assessment of livestock genetic resources ever conducted in the United States". In 1986, a fellow organization, Rare Breeds Canada, was formed, and the two bodies have worked together closely to preserve and promote breeds that have populations in the US and Canada. [...] In 1993, the organization {{changed its name to}} the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy (ALBC). In 2013, the organization again shortened its name to [...] "The Livestock Conservancy".|$|E
