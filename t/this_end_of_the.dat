5|$|The 13th-century chancel has two rib vaulted bays, {{making it}} one of only six extant Early English vaulted chancels. Its walls were raised in the 15th century by {{constructing}} a chamber above the vaulting using stone from the demolished 13th-century nave, but, from the outside, <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church is still lower than the western section. Internally, the chancel vault is much lower than the adjacent nave because of the room above. It has three 15th-century Perpendicular windows down each side, and is notable for the unusual east window with seven stepped lights, a feature found in only two other Early English churches, Lincoln Cathedral and St Martins in Ockham. The chancel contains three simple sedilia, or priest's seats, with trefoil arches and round columns. The sacristry behind the altar has a small lancet window, and the chamber above the chancel, which is floored only by the curved upper surface of the vault below, is lit by a single two-light window.|$|E
5|$|The west front has two {{flights of}} broad, balustraded steps {{leading up to}} the central door. Inside is a full-height hall with a part-hipped valley roof. On either side of this are {{octagonal}} turrets with cupolas and delicately pierced parapets. To the left of the hall is the former medieval kitchen with a balustraded parapet and buttresses. To the right is a range of parapetted rooms with a stepped buttress at the corner. The south front was plain, being the inside north wall of the original abbey church which was pulled down, but was rebuilt by William Talbot in 1828 to include bay windows. At <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building is Sharington's tower, an octagonal, three-storey tower, topped with a belvedere, balustrade and stair turret.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Farmer made typical Anti-Federalist arguments, {{claiming}} that the Constitution would tear down the sovereign states {{in favor of a}} consolidated government, and that <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal system would be destructive of American liberties. The letters were praised at the time for their thoughtfulness, composition, and persuasiveness, and today are among the most widely read works in the Anti-Federalist canon.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} half of {{the district}} is more residential and contains many council housing estates and new-build private residences. Residents are typically older and the unemployment and crime rates, with the exceptions of drug offences, robbery and theft, are relatively high compared to {{some parts of the}} borough. Hoxton Street Market is the focal point of <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district. The market sells a wide range of household goods during the week and specialises in independent fashion, art and design products on Saturdays. Nearby is the Geffrye Museum and Hoxton War Memorial.|$|E
25|$|Tunnelling resumed after a {{delay of}} several months, and by 1971 the TBM {{was ready to}} {{commence}} work. A three-month trial period had been allocated to assess the suitability of the TBM for work at the western portal. It soon {{became apparent that the}} nature of the rock at <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel was too fractured for efficient operation of the TBM, resulting in the cutters and fill extraction systems of the machine being continually blocked by rock. By the end of the trial period, the TBM had only advanced 106 m and was wearing out far more quickly than was hoped, so it was decided to dismantle it and move it to the eastern portal.|$|E
25|$|One of Dunedin's older {{suburban}} areas is Caversham, {{lying in a}} valley close to the Dunedin Southern Motorway (part of State Highway 1), the main transport access to Dunedin from the south. The suburb contains a small retail area, but is mainly residential. Carisbrook, the city's former main rugby venue, is situated at {{the eastern end of}} the suburb. <b>This</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suburb is dominated by one of Dunedin's largest industrial sites, the Hillside Railway Workshops. At the western end of the suburb, the valley rises steeply, culminating in a saddle of the motorway at Lookout Point. From here, there are views over the outer suburbs of Burnside, Green island, and Abbotsford. Caversham's 2001 population was 5,019.|$|E

25|$|In early August, Banks' corps, {{now part}} of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, was {{stationed}} at Culpeper, Virginia. With reports of Jackson's Confederate troops marching in their direction, the 46th {{and the rest of}} their brigade under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford were ordered to attack them near a promontory named Cedar Mountain. Advancing across a wheat field, Crawford's brigade smashed into the left of Jackson's line and collapsed elements of two brigades there, including the vaunted Stonewall Brigade. During the confusion of battle, the 46th split in two directions, with the right half engaging the right flank of the Stonewall Brigade, and the left half tangling with the left end of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett's brigade. The fighting here was close and savage, including hand-to-hand combat. However, with no Union reinforcements immediately sent to sustain this breakthrough, and with pressure from additional Rebel troops sent to shore up and rally <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, Crawford's men were soon outflanked and forced to retreat back across the wheat field.|$|E
25|$|In 428 the Vandals and Alans {{were united}} under the able, ferocious, and {{long-lived}} king Genseric; {{he moved his}} entire people to Tarifa near Gibraltar, divided them into 80 groups nominally of 1,000 people, (perhaps 20,000 warriors in total), and crossed from Hispania to Mauretania without opposition. (The Straits of Gibraltar were not an important thoroughfare at the time, {{and there were no}} significant fortifications nor military presence at <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean.) They spent a year moving slowly to Numidia, defeating Boniface. He returned to Italy where Aetius had recently had Felix executed. Boniface was promoted to magister militum and earned the enmity of Aetius, who may have been absent in Gaul at the time. In 432 the two met at the Battle of Ravenna which left Aetius's forces defeated and Boniface mortally wounded. Aetius temporarily retired to his estates, but after an attempt to murder him he raised another Hunnic army (probably by conceding parts of Pannonia to them) and in 433 he returned to Italy, overcoming all rivals. He never threatened to become an Augustus himself and thus maintained the support of the Eastern court, where Valentinian's cousin Theodosius II reigned until 450.|$|E
25|$|Planning {{permission}} was {{sought in}} 2002 and received in December 2004 {{for a new}} South Stand to raise capacity to 82,000, together with a hotel and conference centre, with redevelopment commencing in June 2005. The RFU's revised application to build the new south stand at Â£80 million was unanimously approved by Richmond Council's planning committee on 2 December. As well as increasing the stadium's capacity to 82,000, the redevelopment introduced a four-star Marriott hotel with 156 rooms and six VIP suites with views over the field, a performing arts complex, a health and leisure club, open a new rugby shop and also increase the current function space. On Sunday 10 July 2005 the south stand was demolished {{to make way for}} the new development. The festivities that were planned for the implosion of <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium were cancelled in the wake of the 7 July terror attacks in the centre of London. The new seating was complete by 5 November 2006 for the England vs New Zealand game of the 2006 Autumn internationals series, in which England lost in a near-record defeat.|$|E

500|$|<b>This</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground, {{closest to}} the River Wensum, was {{originally}} known as the [...] "River End", a name that still persists among fans. [...] An old stand was demolished in April 1979 and a two-tiered replacement was completed in December 1979. The stand was officially named the Norwich & Peterborough Stand in the 1990s, after a sponsorship deal with the Norwich & Peterborough Building Society. [...] An extra 160 seats were installed {{in the summer of}} 2010. The stand was renamed the Regency Security Stand after a deal with Regency Security, the current security firm of the club.|$|E
500|$|The tidal new cut was {{constructed}} from Netham to Hotwells, with another dam installed at <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour. The Feeder Canal between Temple Meads and Netham provided {{a link to}} the tidal river so that boats could continue upstream to Bath. However, the new scheme required a way to equalise the levels inside and outside the Dock for the passage of vessels to and from the Avon, and bridges to cross the water. Jessop built Cumberland Basin with two entrance locks from the tidal Avon, of width [...] and , and a [...] wide junction lock between the Basin and {{what became known as the}} Floating Harbour. This arrangement provided flexibility of operation with the Basin being used as a lock when there were large numbers of arrivals and sailings. The harbour was officially opened on 1 May 1809.|$|E
500|$|The North Stand is {{the only}} part of the stadium built after the Commonwealth Games, during the stadium's conversion. The {{temporary}} unroofed north stand it replaced had been dubbed the New Gene Kelly Stand by supporters, a reference to the unroofed corner between the Kippax and the North Stand at the club's former Maine Road home, because, being exposed to the elements, they frequently found themselves [...] "singing in the rain". Commencing season 2010â11, seating in the North Stand has been restricted to only supporters accompanied by children, resulting in <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground now being commonly referred to as the Family Stand. [...] Although the North Stand has never been officially renamed and is still frequently referenced that way, most external ticketing offices and stadium guides, in addition to the club itself, now preferentially label and refer to this section of the ground as the Family Stand when discussing seating and ticket sales. Supporters initially dubbed the South Stand the Scoreboard End (the former name of the North Stand at Maine Road), and it houses the majority of City's more vocal fans. Supporters of visiting teams are also normally allocated seats in this stand. From 2003 to 2006, it was renamed the Key 103 Stand for sponsorship reasons, though this was largely ignored by regular patrons.|$|E

2500|$|This station {{opened on}} July 14, 1928, {{and is one}} of the highest {{elevated}} platforms in the city, sitting above the already-elevated BMT Jamaica Line. As high as this station platform is, it plunges abruptly into a tunnel at the north end. <b>This</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station slopes sharply downward, and the platform end is about [...] away from the tunnel's portal.

2500|$|Although {{these regions}} are well defined for {{sufficiently}} large applied voltage, they overlap somewhat for small (less {{than a few}} hundred millivolts) biases. For example, in the typical grounded-emitter configuration of an NPN BJT used as a pulldown switch in digital logic, the [...] "off" [...] state never involves a reverse-biased junction because the base voltage never goes below ground; nevertheless the forward bias is close enough to zero that essentially no current flows, so <b>this</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward active region {{can be regarded as}} the cutoff region.|$|E
