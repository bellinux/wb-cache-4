50|$|Hall effect sensors {{typically}} use {{a rotating}} target {{attached to a}} wheel, gearbox or motor. This target may contain magnets, {{or it may be}} a toothed wheel. The teeth on the wheel vary the flux density of a magnet inside the sensor head. The probe is mounted with its head a precise distance from the <b>target</b> <b>wheel</b> and detects the teeth or magnets passing its face. One problem with this system is that the necessary air gap between the <b>target</b> <b>wheel</b> and the sensor allows ferrous dust from the vehicle's underframe to build up on the probe or target, inhibiting its function.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, the Hall effect varies greatly with temperature. The sensors’ {{sensitivity}} {{and also the}} signal offset therefore depend {{not only on the}} air gap but also on the temperature. This also very much reduces the maximum permissible air gap between the sensor and the <b>target</b> <b>wheel.</b> At room temperature an air gap of 2 to 3 mm can be tolerated without difficulty for a typical <b>target</b> <b>wheel</b> of module m = 2, but in the required temperature range of from −40°C to 120°C the maximum gap for effective signal registration drops to 1.3 mm.Smaller pitch target wheels with module m = 1 are often used to get a higher time resolution or to make the construction more compact. In this case the maximum possible air gap is only 0.5 to 0.8 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} {{principles of}} the two encoders are similar: a multichannel magneto-resistive sensor scans a <b>target</b> <b>wheel</b> with 256 teeth, generating sine and cosine signals. Arctangent interpolation is used to generate rectangular pulses from the sine/cosine signal periods. The precision encoder also possesses amplitude and offset correction functions. This {{makes it possible to}} further improve the signal quality, which greatly improves traction regulation.|$|E

50|$|Modern Hall effect sensors of {{this type}} {{make use of the}} {{principle}} of magnetic field modulation and are suitable for ferromagnetic <b>target</b> <b>wheels</b> with a module between m =1 and m = 3.5 (D.P.=25 to D.P.=7). The form of the teeth is of secondary importance; <b>target</b> <b>wheels</b> with involute or rectangular toothing can be scanned. Depending on the diameter and teeth of the wheel it is possible to get between 60 and 300 pulses per revolution, which is sufficient for drives of lower and medium traction performance.|$|R
50|$|For {{the design}} engineer, the visible air gap that the sensor {{ends up with}} is {{primarily}} {{the result of the}} specific machine design, but is subject to whatever constraints are needed to register the rotary speed. If this means that the possible air gap has to lie within a very small range, then this will also restrict the mechanical tolerances of the motor housing and <b>target</b> <b>wheels</b> to prevent signal dropouts during operation. This means that in practice there may be problems, particularly with smaller pitched <b>target</b> <b>wheels</b> of module m = 1 and disadvantageous combinations of tolerances and extreme temperatures. From {{the point of view of}} the motor manufacturer, and even more so the operator, it is therefore better to look for speed sensors with a wider range of air gap.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to Hall effect sensors with gears are sensors or encoders which use magnetoresistance. Because the <b>target</b> <b>wheel</b> is an active, multipole magnet, air gaps {{can be even}} larger, up to 4.0 mm. Because magnetoresistive sensors are angle-sensitive and amplitude-insensitive, signal quality is increased over Hall sensors in fluctuating gap applications. Also the signal quality is much higher, enabling interpolation within the sensor/encoder or by an external circuit.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{limit on}} the number of pulses {{achievable}} by Hall sensors without integrated bearings: with a 300 mm diameter <b>target</b> <b>wheel</b> it is normally not possible to get beyond 300 pulses per revolution. But many locomotives and electric multiple units (EMUs) need higher numbers of pulses for proper operation of the traction converter, for instance when there are tight constraints on the traction regulator at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|Some sensors {{now offer}} an {{integrated}} signal processor {{that attempts to}} correct the offset and amplitude of the Hall sensor signals. This correction enables a larger maximum permissible air gap at the speed sensor. On a module m = 1 <b>target</b> <b>wheel</b> these new sensors can tolerate an air gap of 1.4 mm, which is wider than that for conventional speed sensors on module m = 2 target wheels. On a module m = 2 <b>target</b> <b>wheel</b> the new speed sensors can tolerate gap {{of as much as}} 2.2 mm. It has also been possible to markedly increase the signal quality. Both the duty cycle and the phase displacement between the two channels is at least three times as stable in the face of fluctuating air gap and temperature drift. In addition, in spite of the complex electronics it has also been possible to increase the mean time between failures for the new speed sensors by a factor of three to four. So they not only provide more precise signals, their signal availability is also significantly better.|$|E
50|$|Some {{transport}} {{companies are}} faced with a special problem: the circulating air that keeps the motors cool carries swarf abraded from the wheels and rails. This collects on the heads of magnetic sensors. There are also increasingly motors in which sensors have to scan aluminium <b>target</b> <b>wheels,</b> for instance because the impellers are made of an aluminium alloy and the manufacturer does not wish to have to shrink on a separate ferromagnetic gear rim.|$|R

40|$|Paired {{polishing}} process (PPP) is {{a variant}} of the chemical mechanical polishing process which facilitates defect mitigation via minimization of maximum force as well as effective planarization via profile driven determination of force gradient. The present embodiment of PPP machine employs two polishing wheels, radially spanning the wafer surface on a counter-gimbaled base. The PPP machine is deployed to experimentally investigate the role of the process parameters on the surface roughness evolution, and the effective material removal rate. Two sets of copper and aluminum blanket layers were polished under a range of applied down force, polishing wheel speed and transverse feed rate to examine the scalability of the process parameters for different material constants. The experimental measurements along with the topological details of the polishing pad have been utilized to develop a mechanistic model of the process. The model employs the soft wheel-workpiece macroscopic contact, the polishing wheel roughness and its amplification to the local contact pressure, the kinematics of abrasive grits at the local scale, and the collective contribution of these individual micro-events to induce an effective material removal rate at the macroscale. The model shows the dependence of the material removal on the ratio of wheel rotational to feed speed for the PPP process, in a form of an asymptote that is scaled by the surface hardness of each material. The PPP machine exploits this insight and utilizes an oblique grinding technique that obviates the traditional trade-off between MRR and planarization efficiency. High speed grinding with cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheels are industrially attractive options for hard-to-machine metallic alloys, due to their low cost, reliability, reduced thermal damage and superior workpiece surface finish. However, thermal issues and transient behavior of the grinding wheel wear directly affect the workpiece surface integrity and tolerances. This thesis investigates the topological evolution of an electroplated CBN grinding wheel, characterization of its wear and life expectancy, when utilized in nickel-based alloy grinding. Depth profiling, digital microscopy and scanning electron microscopy are utilized to investigate topological evolution and mechanisms of grit failure. The results are used to elucidate the statistical evolution of the grinding wheel surface. It is found that when a grit is pulled out, load redistribution commences in its neighboring domain, with localized rapid grit wear. The unique experimental findings are used to develop a novel phenomenological model for the progressive wheel wear, including the combination of grit pullout (Stage I) and grit wear (Stage II). For Stage-I, the model employs the grinding kinematics, thermal shock to the grit-wheel interface, Paris law type fatigue approach. For Stage-II, Preston type wear approach is employed. The molding framework is utilized to infer electroplated CBN grinding wheels’ life expectancy for the high speed grinding and high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG) processes. The model provides the process design domain for different grinding process parameters, while maintaining a <b>targeted</b> <b>wheel</b> life, and averting potential damage of the workpiece...|$|R
