The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, they would have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> airline representative at the counters.|$|E

Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused to raise their child, Claire decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{adoption}} agency out of a belief that she will struggle to raise it alone. Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it. In the present, Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins to suspect that somebody is trying to harm her unborn child. In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census {{of all of the}} survivors.|$|E
25|$|Round 4: One {{player from}} each team is {{nominated}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> artefact. They each have 60 seconds {{to try to}} guess the eight predetermined key words that describe the artefact. Each word is worth 10 points.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{to higher education}} policies in the knowledge-based society makes {{important to understand the}} relationship between socio-economic family characteristics and educational choices. This paper considers the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college in Argentina as a family's economic decision. The goal is to investigate the impact of family income on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university versus the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college in Argentina. Using a probit model of the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college, the results of this paper show that the income {{of the rest of the}} family has a positive and statistically significant impact on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college. <b>A</b> multinomial logit model (where the choices are no college, community college or university) shows that the income of the rest of the family is important in order to determine the probability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college versus the other two possibilities. Family income also has a positive impact in the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university versus the other two choices. This model also shows that parents education is an important factor in explaining the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> university as well as <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> community college.

25|$|Piper {{received}} numerous {{phone calls}} and apologies from Lynch. On 31 March 2008, {{two days after the}} initial attack, Lynch persuaded Piper <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account. Lynch gave her details to Stefan Sylvestre, who identified her on Golders Green Road. Wearing a hoodie to obscure his identity, Sylvestre approached Piper, who {{thought he was going to}} ask for money, and then threw sulphuric acid at her face.|$|E
25|$|Baer {{was born}} in 1922 to Lotte (Kirschbaum) and Leo Baer, a Jewish family living in Germany, and was {{originally}} named Rudolf Heinrich Baer. At age 14, he was expelled from school because of his ancestry and had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> all-Jewish school. His father worked in a shoe factory in Pirmasens at the time. Baer's family, fearing increasing persecution, moved from Germany to New York City in 1938 two months prior to Kristallnacht while Baer was a teenager. Baer would later become a naturalized United States citizen.|$|E

50|$|The game {{is notable}} {{because it is}} the longest Game 7 in Stanley Cup playoffs history and one of two series-deciding games to need more than three {{overtime}} periods.

500|$|Returning to New Zealand in late 1902, Davies resumed {{command of}} the Auckland {{military}} district. He held command until 1906, when he was appointed inspector-general of the New Zealand Military Forces and {{became a member of}} the Council of Defence, the body responsible for controlling the dominion's military forces. The position of inspector-general, newly created that year, was originally expected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> [...] "Imperial" [...] – that is, British – officer, but the government had announced it planned to rotate New Zealand officers in the role, on up to five-year terms, so as to allow them to gain experience.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{had long}} enjoyed {{excellent}} health, except for occasional attacks of gout, but by July 1940, {{he was in}} almost constant pain. He sought treatment, and later that month entered hospital for surgery. Surgeons discovered that {{he was suffering from}} terminal bowel cancer, but they concealed it from him, instead telling him that he would not require further surgery. Chamberlain resumed work in mid-August. He returned to his office on 9 September. However, renewed pain, compounded by the night-time bombing of London which forced him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> air raid shelter and denied him rest, sapped his energy, and he left London for the last time on 19 September, returning to Highfield Park in Heckfield. He offered his resignation to Churchill on 22 September. The Prime Minister was initially reluctant to accept; but as both men realised that Chamberlain would never return to work, Churchill finally allowed him to resign. The Prime Minister asked if Chamberlain would accept the highest order of British chivalry, the Order of the Garter, of which his brother had been a member. Chamberlain refused. He said he would [...] "prefer to die plain 'Mr. Chamberlain' like my father before me, unadorned by any title".|$|E

500|$|As the tornadoes {{approached}} the Oklahoma City metro, thousands of residents {{decided to leave}} the area for safety, possibly due to the still fresh memories of the devastation caused by the EF5 tornado that struck Moore on May20. Already congested with rush hour traffic, Interstates 35, 40, 44 and 240, became [...] "parking lots" [...] as the storms neared. Residents reported the highways to be a scene of chaos, [...] "people were going southbound in the northbound lanes. Everybody was running for their lives." [...] It has been suggested that the evacuation was partially caused by a controversial call to action on-air by KFOR-TV chief meteorologist Mike Morgan, who suggested on-air during coverage of the storm – as the tornado was projected to track into Oklahoma City – that residents without underground storm shelters or safe rooms get into their cars and evacuate south of the track. This advice was contrary to the recommended plan <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> interior room, bathtub or closet with no windows if no underground shelter is available, such as a basement. These locations are typically much safer than an automobile in tornadic winds. Dr. Jeff Masters of Weather Underground stated that had the tornado tracked directly over one of the congested highways, the death toll could have easily exceeded 500.|$|E

When she was a junior high school student, she used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Italian restaurant called Chianti, started in 1960. In those days, many celebrities went to the restaurant; Akira Kurosawa, Yukio Mishima, Kōbō Abe, Seiji Ozawa, Ryu Murakami, Taro Okamoto, [...] Kishin Shinoyama, and Hiroshi [...] "Monsieur" [...] Kamayatsu, who eventually became her first record producer.

Pablo Iglesias celebrated the fact that his proposal had caused Rajoy to step back and urged Sánchez to [...] "rise to the challenge". The PSOE, on the other hand, attacked Rajoy and dubbed his decision as [...] "irresponsible" [...] while regarding Podemos' offer as [...] "blackmail".
