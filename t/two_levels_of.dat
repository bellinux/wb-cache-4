40|$|Part 6 : Enterprise Modelling CasesInternational audienceGlobal {{trends in}} the {{worldwide}} economy lead to new challenges for manufacturing enterprises and to new requirements regarding modeling industrial organizations, like integration of real-time information from operations and information about neighboring enterprises in the value network.

The paper presents an approach to a specific aspect of enterprise modeling, product-process-machine modeling, derived from two real life case studies. It assumes ontology-based integration of various information sources and software systems and distinguishes four <b>levels.</b> The upper <b>two</b> <b>levels</b> (<b>levels</b> <b>of</b> product manager and product engineer) concentrate on customer requirements and product modeling.
