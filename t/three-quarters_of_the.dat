5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1836, Congress {{proposed}} a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and approximately <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper Peninsula. The compromise was considered a poor outcome for Michigan. Voters in a state convention in September soundly rejected the proposal.|$|E

Under the usual treatment of {{prisoners of war}} in the American Revolutionary War, only 800 survived their captivity to be released 18 months later in a prisoner exchange; nearly <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoners died.|$|E
5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds. A pilot engine had travelled northbound {{through the tunnel}} earlier the same day with no problems {{but this time the}} train ran into a pile of stone debris and was derailed when it was <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way into the tunnel. The debris was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E

25|$|Work on this {{technology}} continued {{and a new}} step was taken in 1833. The Royal Edward managed to cross the Atlantic by using steam power on <b>three-quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course. The sail was used only when <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boilers was cleaned. However, there were still many skeptics, and in 1836, scientific writer Dionysius Lardner declared that: As <b>the</b> project <b>of</b> making <b>the</b> voyage directly from New York to Liverpool, it was perfectly chimerical, and {{they might as well}} talk <b>of</b> making <b>the</b> voyage from New York to the moon.|$|R

5|$|American {{swimmers}} {{have been}} the most successful in winning awards, with 52 titles, more than three times that of Australia (13). Michael Phelps of the United States has won the global award eight times, followed by Katie Ledecky of the United States and Ian Thorpe of Australia with four. Regionally, German, Hungarian and Dutch swimmers have had the most success in Europe, while Australians have won more than <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific awards.|$|E
5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} {{would have created}} a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E
5|$|In the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, 22people were killed. The {{hurricane}} demolished <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{structures on}} Grand Turk Island, while the remaining intact buildings were damaged. The cyclone also produced heavy damage on Long Island, though damages were not reported in Nassau. Peak gusts were estimated near 40mph (65km/h) in Nassau.

5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw {{the creation of a new}} constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
5|$|Offsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had {{excellent}} and professional leadership in its General Staff organisation. These officers came from four schools developed {{for this purpose}} and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was {{in marked contrast to}} the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours notice.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{the growth of}} Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has {{transformed}} the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy {{is dominated by the}} service industry, which employs about <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's workforce. However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components.|$|E

5|$|The Nazis began {{shipping}} {{large numbers}} of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz {{in the middle of}} 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total, included almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were told they were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the gas chamber.|$|E
5|$|The Third Amendment was {{introduced}} in Congress in 1789 by James Madison {{as a part of}} the United States Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress proposed the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789, and by December 15, 1791, the necessary <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> states had ratified it. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment on March 1, 1792.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{culminated in}} what has become known as the Toledo War, as Michigan and Ohio militia took up arms in the area. As a {{condition}} for entering the Union, Michigan was forced to accept the eastern <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper Peninsula in exchange for ceding its claim to the Toledo Strip. After a state convention first rejected this condition, a second convention, assembled under some duress in December 1836, reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26, 1837, with Detroit as its first capital.|$|E

Methods: The study was based on secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Multilevel multivariable logistic regression models were applied to the data on 5, 754 children aged 12 – 23 months who were fully immunized or not (level 1), nested within 896 communities (level 2) from 37 states (level 3).

5|$|The {{earthquakes}} of Iran {{are a large}} {{concern to}} the populace and are an impediment to economic development. Twelve earthquakes with a Richter magnitude of over seven have occurred within the last century. <b>Three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major cities of Iran are in areas prone to major earthquakes.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} still much debate about the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting founder effect and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.|$|E

5|$|As {{the riders}} entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around <b>three-quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peloton {{had been dropped}} or had {{withdrawn}} from the race {{by the time the}} riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards.|$|E
