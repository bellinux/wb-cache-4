The learning models compared were learning model Pairs Check (PC), Think Pair Share (TPS) and Problem Based Learning (PBL). This research was a quasi-experimental research with 3 × 3 factorial design. The population of research was all grade VIII students of Junior High School (SMP) in Surakarta. The samples were chosen by using stratified cluster random sampling. The instruments used were achievement test and questionnaire of learning styles.
