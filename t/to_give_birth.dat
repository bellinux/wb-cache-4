5|$|While Queen Maya {{felt that}} it was the time <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth,</b> she went to the Lumbini park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a plaksa tree, holding one branch with her right hand, and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha. The story on the panels {{continues}} until the prince becomes the Buddha.|$|E
5|$|As Presley {{had refused}} to carry Jackson's children, Rowe offered <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to a child for the pop singer. Shortly after Presley and Jackson's separation, Rowe became {{pregnant}} but suffered a miscarriage in March 1996. The event devastated Rowe, who feared {{she would never be}} able to have a baby. Jackson comforted and consoled Rowe throughout the ordeal, which remained hidden from the media and public.|$|E

5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin. Their son Eweka went on <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of Benin today.|$|E
5|$|Larissa Lai's novel Salt Fish Girl (2002) depicts lesbian {{relationships}} {{in the context of}} a dystopian corporate future. The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial and ethnic identity into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The Queen, {{pregnant}} again, {{was aware}} of the dangers if she failed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to a son. With Catherine dead, Henry would be free to marry without any taint of illegality. At this time Henry began paying court to Jane Seymour. He gave her a locket with a miniature portrait of himself inside and Jane, in the presence of Anne, began opening and shutting it. Anne responded by ripping off the locket with such force her fingers bled.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} {{consequences of}} the collapse of their company were mitigated be a series of three benefit performances, in coordination with the local Russian-language theater company. Sonya returned to Odessa <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to their daughter Rivka; Adler stayed on six weeks in Zhytomyr and had sort of a belated apprenticeship with two Russian character actors of national fame, Borisov and Philipovsky. However, he returned to Odessa thinking that he would most likely leave theater behind.|$|E
5|$|Thorne-Begland {{lives with}} his husband, {{originally}} Michael Begland, a Richmond attorney. They have combined their original surnames, and both use the surname Thorne-Begland. They had a commitment ceremony in 2001 after 8 years together and soon decided they wanted to have children. Using eggs from Michael Thorne-Begland's sister and sperm from Tracy Thorne-Begland, they used a surrogate <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to their twins in 2004 in a Maryland hospital.|$|E

Later on, two healthy puppies were delivered.|$|R
50|$|Dührssen was a {{prominent}} figure in modern German gyncecology, being remembered for his pioneer work in surgical practices such as vaginal Caesarean section (vaginalen Kaiserschnitt). He was an advocate of institutional births for all pregnancies, and proposed that pregnant women undergo screening processes to uncover possible difficulties prior <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>birth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additional {{educational}} facilities included a 24-hour PC lab, wireless internet access in specified areas, world class equipment for nursing courses (including life sized dummies that simulate human beings, from breathing <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>birth),</b> a TV studio, an Aerospace Centre (with its own plane), an on-campus radio studio, and two theatres.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth.</b> This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Li {{returned}} to the international stage in February 2010 after taking a year off from competitive table tennis <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to a child. Her first major competition – the World Team Table Tennis Championships in Moscow – saw her and her teammates beating China in the finals to clinch gold. Li also {{had a series of}} good performances after her return. She guided the women's team to gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi and {{went on to win the}} women's doubles title with Sun Beibei. She ended 2010 with a bang by winning the silver medal in the women's team event of the 16th Asian Games.|$|E

5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death as they attempt <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth.</b> Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E
5|$|When Sarah became pregnant, her {{marriage}} was announced publicly (on 1 October 1678), and she {{retired from the}} court <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> to her first child, Harriet, who died in infancy. When the Duke of York went into self-imposed exile to Scotland {{as a result of}} the furore surrounding the Popish Plot, John and Sarah accompanied him, and Charles II rewarded John's loyalty by creating him Baron Churchill of Eyemouth in Scotland, Sarah thus becoming Lady Churchill. The Duke of York returned to England after the religious tension had eased, and Sarah was appointed a Lady of the Bedchamber to Anne after the latter's marriage in 1683.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} 400 North Atlantic {{right whales}} live in the western North Atlantic Ocean. In {{northern}} spring, summer and autumn, they feed in areas off the Canadian and northeast U.S. coasts in a range stretching from New York to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they head south towards Georgia and Florida <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth.</b> There have been a smattering of sightings further east {{over the past few}} decades; several sightings were made close to Iceland in 2003. These are possibly the remains of a virtually extinct eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers' records suggests {{they are more likely to}} be strays. However, a few sightings are regular between Norway, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and even Italy and Sicily; at least the Norway individuals come from the Western stock.|$|E

5|$|Cetaceans are widespread, but some, as {{with the}} mysticetes, specialise in certain environments. Most mysticetes prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth.</b> Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on mammals, such as pinnipeds. Gray whales are {{specialized}} for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate {{every two to three}} years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Some whales produce a variety of vocalizations, notably the songs of the humpback whale. Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.|$|E
5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E
5|$|Details {{of giant}} otter {{reproduction}} and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided {{much of the}} information. Females appear <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation. At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, {{with an average of}} two. Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after her}} {{departure}} from Thuy Nga in mid-2006, Nhu Quynh <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> {{a baby girl}} in 2007, named Melody Dong Nghi.

Prior <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> Melody, she didn't disclose her personal information. After <b>giving</b> <b>birth,</b> some pictures {{of her husband and}} daughter were released and she also informed the public about her marital status including her husband’s name, Nguyễn Thắng, an aviation engineer, working for U.S Federal Aviation Administration.|$|R

She was born on May 20, 1851, about a month after the publication of The House of the Seven Gables. Sophia went into labor early, before the midwife could arrive; Rose was delivered with the help of Sophia's father.|$|R
