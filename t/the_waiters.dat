25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, {{and if there were}} fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, Hirtzler again cooked a dish {{which had}} {{political}} consequences. The Crocker family were fervent Republicans, and they hosted a {{dinner at the}} hotel for Charles Evans Hughes, the Republican candidate for President of the United States, who was locked in a close race with incumbent Woodrow Wilson. Twenty minutes before the banquet began, <b>the</b> <b>waiters,</b> {{who were members of}} the culinary workers union, went on strike. Hughes wondered if the banquet should be canceled, but Hirtzler insisted upon it going ahead, and served the meal himself. When the Union learned that Hughes had crossed a picket line and eaten the dinner, they distributed thousands of leaflets denouncing him as anti-union. On election night, Hughes went to bed believing he had won the election. The next morning he awoke and learned that he had lost California by only 3,673 votes, and by losing California had lost the election to Wilson. The margin of his defeat was less than the turnout of union voters in San Francisco. By saving the dinner, Hirtzler had lost the election for Hughes.|$|E

As Sonya puts her drink down on his tray, she spots Mason's belt buckle and remembers it from the robbery earlier. With most of the party outside, Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes inside to get a drink, while Priya tells her husband, Ajay (Sachin Joab), that she is going to text Rani.

He can count to a thousand, though his tact in bringing up the subject {{in the presence of the}} numbers-hating King Azaz is not the best. Mindful of his mother's admonition to eat lightly when a guest, he initially orders a light meal at the banquet, only to find <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> bringing in insubstantial light beams.

500|$|In 1955, limited {{integration}} came to heavily segregated Las Vegas {{when the}} Sands first allowed Nat King Cole {{to stay at}} the hotel and perform. Sinatra noticed that he never saw Cole in the dining room, always eating his meals in solitude in his dressing room. When he asked his valet George to find out why, he learned that [...] "Coloreds aren't allowed in the dining room at the Sands". Sinatra subsequently saw to it that if blacks were not permitted to eat their meals in the dining room with everybody else he would see to it that all of <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> and waitresses were fired, and invited Cole to dine with him the following evening. Cole was allowed permission into the casino, as was another black performer, Harry Belafonte, who took a more aggressive approach by walking into the casino on his own accord and sitting at a blackjack table, which was not challenged by the bosses. Belafonte became the [...] "first black man to play cards on the Las Vegas Strip".|$|E
50|$|Böhm-Bawerk's {{essential}} {{argument that}} employers are compensated for shouldering some risk in paying their employees ahead of time, however, appears unable {{to explain how}} profit can be accumulated in cases where workers are reliant on commissions, tips, etc. for their income, which are received only after they sell their services. However, Böhm-Bawerk's does provide such an explanation. In {{the context of a}} <b>waiter</b> earning tips, <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> himself is not a wage-earner. The restaurant owner does not make of profit from the tips earned by <b>the</b> <b>waiter.</b> <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> is essentially an entrepreneur, taking the risk that customers will sufficiently compensate him for the labor he provides, while the customers are under no legal obligation to do so. <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> is making an investment of services in anticipation of future return from <b>the</b> customers. <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> is compensated by an aggregate amount of earnings from tips that exceeds that labor value provided to the customers, thereby including a return on <b>the</b> <b>waiter's</b> investment. If <b>the</b> tips were not sufficient to provide this return on investment, then <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> would rationally seek other employment, such as a wage-earning job with similar compensation that does not include the risk element or an entrepreneurial job with similar risk that provides a better return.|$|R

500|$|The video {{begins at}} a formal party in which Spears {{seems to be}} looking for someone. The opening shot of her was {{inspired}} by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her. He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her [...] "So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. The waiter asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies [...] "Now I'm okay." [...] She and the waiter climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{important}} {{case was}} O'Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc. Some waiters worked various dinner {{functions in the}} Grosvenor House Hotel. They tried to form a union. They were dismissed. They claimed that this was unfair, and to do that, they had to show they were [...] "employees" [...] {{within the meaning of}} the unfair dismissal legislation. [...] The word [...] "employee" [...] had hitherto always been taken to mean someone who is obviously not in business on his own account (i.e. not [...] "self employed"), but recognised as subordinate labour, economically dependent on the employer. However, Alexander Irvine QC argued that <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> had no [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] with the employer: they were not bound to accept work engagements when they were called up, and the employer was under no obligation to call them up. They could leave, or be fired, at will. Sir John Donaldson accepted this argument and deemed <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> to fall outside of the scope of unfair dismissal legislation.|$|E

When he learnt to cook, he was influenced by the cookbook series Les recettes originales, with French chefs such as Alain Chapel.|$|E

2500|$|The Beefsteak Club {{that today}} has {{premises}} at 9 Irving Street, London, {{was established in}} 1876.

[...] As that room was not available, the club held its first meeting, on 11 March 1876, in rooms above the Folly Theatre in King William IV Street. [...] Two features of the club were, and are, that all members and guests sit together at a single long table, and that by tradition the club steward and <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> are all addressed as [...] "Charles".|$|E

2500|$|Blumenthal {{calls his}} {{scientific}} approach to cuisine [...] "multi-sensory cooking", arguing that eating is [...] "one {{of the few}} activities we do that involves all of the senses simultaneously". One of the catalysts for this culinary approach was a visit at 16 to the restaurant L'Oustau de Baumanière in Provence, {{which at the time}} had three Michelin stars. The trip prompted a passion for cooking, above all because of [...] "the whole multisensory experience: the sound of fountains and cicadas, the heady smell of lavender, the sight of <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> carving lamb at the table". One of the other main inspirations for a multi-sensory style of cooking was the lack of space and opulence at the Fat Duck. [...] "Places like the Baumaniere had a view and a history and architecture that took its diners to a world of beauty and indulgence. The Fat Duck didn’t have any of that, so it had had to capture the diners’ imagination in a different way – taking them to the mysteries of flavour perception and multi sensory delight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ebbitt House {{struggled}} {{to compete against}} the larger and more lavish Willard Hotel and the Raleigh Hotel (built in 1893). From the late 1860s until the 1910s, it was considered [...] "Army and Navy Headquarters" [...] {{because of the number}} of military personnel who lived there and the large number of veterans' meetings held there. In November 1889, Caleb Willard hired Henry C. Burch and Charles E. Gibbs (both veteran hotel managers in the city) to run Ebbitt House. Over the next two years, Burch and Gibbs completely refurnished all the rooms (adding new furniture and Belgian carpets), re-papered or added painted frescoes to the ceilings, and installed new furniture in the hallways. [...] On the east side was the now-famous Red Parlor, a gentleman's lounge fitted with rich red and gold draperies, fabric wall coverings, and upholstered furniture. [...] The restaurant, called [...] "cheerful and sunny" [...] by the Washington Post, fronted onto 14th Street NW, was lit with crystal chandeliers, and could seat up to 225 people. [...] It was completely remodeled by Burch and Gibbs: guests dined at tables set with tablecloths imported from Scotland, using Haviland & Co. Limoges porcelain china, silver-handled knives and forks manufactured by Reed & Barton, and Bohemian glassware. [...] Cut-glass flower vases, finger bowls, and water bottles were used for serving. [...] Diners sat in high-backed leather chairs. [...] At breakfast, <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> wore brown cutaway jackets, vests, and pants with a gold stripe, while in the evening they changed into black tuxedos. [...] The kitchen was renovated, with new steam tables and massive coffee urns (manufactured by Brambull, Deane & Co. of New York City) installed. [...] The menu — served buffet-style — included Blue Point oysters, green sea turtle, Kennebec River salmon, mutton, chicken, hominy fritters, stewed diamondback terrapin, canvasback duck, English pheasant, and a variety of vegetables, fruits, cheese, crackers, nuts, pies, and puddings. [...] Wines, whiskeys, and brandies were served from two large storerooms. Despite the success of the changes, Gibbs left Ebbitt House in 1893 after purchasing Wormley's Hotel. Burch became the sole manager of the hotel. He conducted extensive renovations to the exterior of the hotel in 1895. An enormous two-story mansard roof, with central and corner pavilions influenced by the French Beaux-Arts movement, was added to the top floor, replacing the original single-story, restrained mansard roof.|$|E

50|$|Another {{approach}} is to guarantee that a philosopher can only pick up both forks or none by introducing an arbitrator, e.g., a waiter. In order {{to pick up the}} forks, a philosopher must ask permission of <b>the</b> <b>waiter.</b> <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> gives permission to only one philosopher at a time until the philosopher has picked up both of their forks. Putting down a fork is always allowed. <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> can be implemented as a mutex.In addition to introducing a new central entity (<b>the</b> <b>waiter),</b> this approach can result in reduced parallelism: if a philosopher is eating and one of their neighbors is requesting the forks, all other philosophers must wait until this request has been fulfilled even if forks for them are still available.|$|R
