40|$|AbstractThis {{communication}} {{introduces a}} simple method {{to determine the}} pKs of microscopic ionizations from complex <b>titration</b> <b>curves.</b> We used this approach to study the alkaline transition (pH-dependent ligand exchange) of mitochondrial cytochrome c. The linearization of <b>titration</b> <b>curves</b> permitted resolution of two to three limiting microscopic ionizations. By combining these data with studies of the temperature dependence of ligand-exchange equilibria, we found evidence that the alkaline transition comprises two chemically distinct processes: the deprotonation of the alternative ligands and the break of the iron-methionine ligation bond. We also noted that, in the horse and untrimethylated S. cerevisiae iso- 1 cytochromes c, the permissible deprotonation of the ϵ-amino group of Lys 72 allows formation of an alkaline isomer at lower pH, with lesser stability, which leads to hysteresis in the <b>titration</b> <b>curves.</b> The linearization of the <b>titration</b> <b>curves</b> for different cytochromes c thus brings insight on the microscopic contributions to conformational stability...|$|R

In conductimetric titration with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide {{all of the}} compounds exhibited conventional stoichiometric <b>titration</b> <b>curves</b> in 2 -propanol.

The microenvironments surrounding the residues and the effects of inhibitors are discussed on the basis of these results.

50|$|Titrations {{between a}} weak acid and a weak base have <b>titration</b> <b>curves</b> which are highly irregular. Because of this, no {{definite}} indicator {{may be appropriate}} and a pH meter {{is often used to}} monitor the reaction.|$|R
50|$|If one reagent is a {{weak acid}} or {{base and the}} other is a strong acid or base, the <b>titration</b> <b>curve</b> is {{irregular}} and the pH shifts less with small additions of titrant near the equivalence point. For example, the <b>titration</b> <b>curve</b> for the titration between oxalic acid (a weak acid) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base) is pictured. The equivalence point occurs between pH 8-10, indicating the solution is basic at the equivalence point and an indicator such as phenolphthalein would be appropriate. Titration curves corresponding to weak bases and strong acids are similarly behaved, with the solution being acidic at the equivalence point and indicators such as methyl orange and bromothymol blue being most appropriate.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order for}} a {{reaction}} to be amenable to potentiometric titrimetry, the free energy change must be sufficient for an appropriate sensor to respond with a significant inflection (or [...] "kink") in the <b>titration</b> <b>curve</b> where sensor response is plotted against the amount of titrant delivered.|$|E
50|$|The second method {{utilizes}} nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy to calculate the free energy of the salt bridge. A titration is performed, while recording the chemical shift corresponding to the protons of the carbon adjacent to the carboxylate or ammonium group. The midpoint of the <b>titration</b> <b>curve</b> corresponds to the pKa, or the pH where the ratio of protonated:deprotonated molecules is 1:1. Continuing with the T4 lysozyme example, a <b>titration</b> <b>curve</b> is obtained through observation of {{a shift in the}} C2 proton of histidine 31 (Figure 5). Figure 5 shows the shift in the <b>titration</b> <b>curve</b> between the wild-type and the mutant in which Asp70 is Asn. The salt bridge formed is between the deprotonated Asp70 and protonated His31. This interaction causes the shift seen in His31’s pKa. In the unfolded wild-type protein, where the salt bridge is absent, His31 is reported to have a pKa of 6.8 in H20 buffers of moderate ionic strength. Figure 5 shows a pKa of the wild-type of 9.05. This difference in pKa is supported by the His31’s interaction with Asp70. To maintain the salt bridge, His31 will attempt to keep its proton as long as possible. When the salt bridge is disrupted, like in the mutant D70N, the pKa shifts back to a value of 6.9, much closer to that of His31 in the unfolded state.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} titration behavior of strongly interacting titratable residues in proteins. Strongly interacting titratable residues exist in many proteins such as for instance bacteriorhodopsin, cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome bc 1, or the photosynthetic reaction center. Strong interaction between titratable groups can lead to irregular titration behavior. We analyze under which circumstances <b>titration</b> <b>curves</b> can become irregular. We demonstrate that conformational flexibility alone can not lead to irregular titration behavior. Strong interaction between titratable groups is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for irregular <b>titration</b> <b>curves.</b> In addition, the two interacting groups also need to titrate in the same pH-range. These two conditions together lead to irregular <b>titration</b> <b>curves.</b> The mutation of a single residue within a cluster of interacting titratable residues can influence the titration behavior of the other titratable residues in the cluster. We demonstrate this effect on a cluster of four interacting residues. This example underlines that mutational studies directed at identifying {{the role of a}} certain titratable residue in a cluster of interacting residues should always be accompanied by an analysis of the effect of the mutation on the titration behavior of the other residues...|$|R
