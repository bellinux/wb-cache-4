Many of the contaminants present in natural gas at source are removed for its <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> and prior to open flame use in the home for cooking and heating, and almost all contaminants must be removed before it can be cooled down and liquefied to LNG for cost efficient long distance bulk batch transport, shipping and storage at close to atmospheric pressure. LNG regassifies as it absorbs heat from the surroundings, the rate of which depends on contact area. Therefore, in addition to the cryogenic challenges, small tank volumes of LNG regassify quickly without good insultation/ active cooling, making LNG rather unsuited for private vehicles that are not in continuous use.|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) is a {{technology}} for mitigating {{the contribution of}} fossil fuel emissions to global warming. The technology is based on capturing carbon dioxide (CO 2) from point sources and storing it in geological formations {{in such a way}} that is does not enter the atmosphere. CCS requires the transport of CO 2 from source to sink. This can involve one or a combination of transport media: truck, train, ship or pipeline. <b>Transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> is the preferred option for transporting large quantities of CO 2 over long distances. The majority of CO 2 pipelines are in the USA and Canada, along with substantial in-field pipework for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) projects (Kelliher et al, 2009, Kadnar, 2008). The USA experience cannot be easily applied to other regions or situations, because the CO 2 pipelines are located in areas with low population density. In general, as stated in the report of the IPCC on CCS (IPCC, 2005), there is a lack of knowledge regarding the safety of pipeline transmission of CO 2 in densely populated areas. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of the art in the analysis of risk for CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline.</b> A brief review is presented of current models for CO 2 release, the assessment of impact from such release, and overall risk analysis. For a simple case study, a comparative analysis is presented of alternative models for the calculation of consequences.

One of the problems is the difficulty in comparing and assessing results due to lack of experimental data. Key unresolved problems and some directions for research needed are identified...|$|E

Reducing extraction costs or stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations would not alter this picture drastically. Although less than under a coal based scenario, carbon emissions would still increase under the B 2 scenario, especially when gas extraction costs decrease. Sulphur emissions in Asia would, however, be significantly lower than in a coal- based scenario...|$|E

The DPSIR framework, describing environmental Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses, {{is used to}} systematically review environmental impact assessment procedures and scientific literature on CCS. Also, it is investigated whether crucial knowledge on environmental impacts is lacking that may postpone the implementation of CCS projects. The {{findings of this study}} are that the capture of CO 2 from power plants results in a change in the environmental profile of the power plant. This change encompasses trade-offs and synergies in the reduction of key atmospheric emissions, being: NOx, SO 2, NH 3, particulate matter, Hg, HF and HCl. The largest trade-offs are found for the emission of NOx and NH 3 when equipping power plants with post-combustion capture. Synergy is expected for SO 2 emissions, which are low for all power plants with CO 2 capture. An increase in water consumption ranging between 32 % and 93 % and an increase in waste and by-product creation with tens of kilotonnes annually is expected for a large-scale power plant (1  GWe), but exact flows and composition are uncertain. The cross-media effects of CO 2 capture are found to be uncertain and not quantified. For the assessment of the safety of CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> at high pressure an important knowledge gap is the absence of validated release and dispersion models for CO 2 releases due to pipeline failures. There is also uncertainty in estimating the failure rates for CO 2 pipelines. Furthermore, uniform CO 2 exposure thresholds, detailed dose-response models and specific CO 2 pipeline regulation are absent. Most gaps in environmental information regarding the CCS chain are identified and characterized for the risk assessment of the underground, non-engineered, part of the storage activity. This uncertainty is considered to be larger for aquifers than for hydrocarbon reservoirs. Failure rates are found to be heavily based on expert opinions and the doseresponse models for ecosystems or target species are not yet developed. Integration and validation of various sub-models describing fate and transport of CO 2 in various compartments of the geosphere is at an infant stage. Concluding, {{it is not possible to}} execute a quantitative risk assessment for the non-engineered part of the storage activity with high confidence.

40|$|The {{transportation}} of heavy crude oils through pipelines {{is very hard}} due to their high viscosity and low mobility. Nowadays, high intensity ultrasound is being explored as a new potential alternative to reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oils and facilitate the <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline.</b> This work studies the effects of ultrasonic energy on the viscosity of heavy crude oil. This is done through a systematic experimental study in a pilot scale continuous flow system, in which the influence of process variables such as treatment temperature (308 y 319 K), exposure time (5. 66 y 16. 98 s), and sonic intensity (170 - 250 y 400 - 680 kW/m 2) is analyzed. The study revealed that the treatment temperature in the proven range has not a significant effect in the efficiency of ultrasonic vibrations to reduce the heavy crude viscosity.

Therefore it was necessary to build an experimental database of physics properties for mixtures. Secondly, effect distances in accidental scenarios that could happen on pipelines have been calculated with existing models adapted to the mixtures.

To provide a consistent comparison of technologies, all three plants analyzed herein operate with the same coal (Illinois No 6), the same site conditions, and the same supercritical pressure steam turbine (459 MWe). In the first oxygen-based plant, the pulverized coal-fired boiler operates with oxygen supplied by a conventional, cryogenic air separation unit, whereas, in the second oxygen-based plant, the oxygen is supplied by an oxygen ion transport membrane. In both oxygen-based plants a portion of the boiler exhaust gas, which is primarily CO{sub 2 }, is recirculated back to the boiler to control the combustion temperature, and the balance of the flue gas undergoes drying and compression to pipeline pressure; for consistency, both plants operate with similar combustion temperatures and utilize the same CO{sub 2 } processing technologies. The capital and operating costs of the pulverized coal-fired boilers required by the three different plants were estimated by Foster Wheeler and the balance of plant costs were budget priced using published data together with vendor supplied quotations.

40|$|The {{combination}} of Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) {{can reduce the}} level of CO 2 in the atmosphere. It is, therefore, seen as an interesting tool in the CO 2 abatement portfolio. In a Swedish context, BECCS could contribute {{to the goal of}} CO 2 neutrality by 2045. This thesis aims to investigate the application of BECCS in the district heating system of Stockholm region with a case study at the energy utility Fortum Värme. The focus of the study is the technical and economic feasibility of such an application. The applicability of Fortum Värme´s plants to implement carbon capture is investigated together with costs and technical implications on each applicable plant and the district heating system as a whole. Three plants are deemed feasible for carbon capture with a cost of about 45 €/tonne of captured CO 2 (not including transport or storage). A model for transport of CO 2 to promising storage sites in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is constructed for <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> and ship. Ship transport is estimated to be the most cost-efficient option in all scenarios. The total cost for BECCS is calculated at 70 - 100 €/tonne depending on size of emissions and distance to storage locations. Furthermore, the total cost is calculated to decrease by 10 - 25 % if some current promising technologies for carbon capture reach maturity, a market for transport services of CO 2 evolves, and a number of actors are sharing the costs for storage. Calculated costs are on a similar price level as other CO 2 abatement strategies such as CCS in industries, biogas, and biodiesel in the vehicle fleet. If the cost is applied directly to the heat price, without any subsidies, it would increase the price of heat by 14 - 21 %. The major challenge of BECCS in combined heat and power production, compared to other studies based on power production, is the seasonality of heat demand. The capacity of the carbon capture system will be oversized during the summer, or undersized during the winter. This is an optimization challenge which has to be further studied...|$|E

40|$|Carbon Capture and Storage {{technology}} (CCS) requires transporting {{large amounts}} of CO 2 over large distances, as capture plants {{are expected to be}} situated near power plants and other large industrial sources such as steel and cement works, while storage locations are expected to be in remote geological formations, typically offshore. CO 2 can be transported using one or a combination of transport media: truck, train, ship or pipeline. <b>Transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> is considered the preferred option for large quantities of CO 2 over long distances, and {{is the subject of this}} paper. The CO 2 pipeline network most appropriate for a country is clearly a function of the specific location of sources and storage points, their capacity and a number of other factors such as population centers and geographical features (rivers, mountains, railroads, motorways, etc). The phased roll-out and initial design of the onshore part of a CO 2 pipeline network for the UK, suitable to deal with the distribution of forecasted CO 2 amounts captured at major sources, was proposed by Lone et al, 2010, based on a techno-economics analysis. The analysis resulted in proposed sizing and location of various pipeline segments in a three-phase rollout, dealing with largest duties first, and details of CO 2 flows and pressures for each segment in each roll-out phase. This paper describes the quantitative risk analysis of this pipeline network, and in particular an assessment of consequences due to the possible CO 2 releases. First, the probability of various accidental events is determined. Then, the estimation of consequences is made with the PHAST software using its “long pipeline” release model, for two types of release: i) from a whole with diameter equal to 20 % of section area and ii) from full bore rupture (catastrophic release). Accidental events in a CO 2 pipeline can produce a spray release followed by a dense gas dispersion, and the high concentration of CO 2 can cause fatalities. To determine possible health effects it is not only the CO 2 concentration but also the duration of the exposure, as the gas cloud evolves are quantified. For the calculation of risk, the consequences are associated to the Probit function, which calculates the fraction of individual deaths in a population. The network examined passes near residential areas. For this situation, the consequences produced by a possible release are calculated and various corridors of risk are identified in terms of population at risk, utilising population distribution data. Finally, the trade-offs achievable between population risk decrease and additional pipeline costs arising from alternative pipeline pathways are demonstrated by means of a specific example...|$|E
40|$|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is {{increasingly}} gaining attention {{as a strategy}} for the abatement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. CCS includes the capture of CO 2 emissions from electricity generation plants and/or industrial processes, its <b>transport</b> (<b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> or ships) and sequestration in underground reservoirs such as deep aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields. As a novel technology, CCS is an ideal case study for testing the Prosuite methodology. The sustainability is tested using the five end-points established in Prosuite: human health, natural environment, exhaustible resources, social well-being and prosperity. This case study uses the scope defined across WP 3 - 5 of PROSUITE. The analysis is undertaken in a prospective framework for the year 2030 under the economic scenarios developed in WP 2, which themselves {{are based on the}} IEA Energy Technology Perspectives. A key component of the scenarios from WP 2 relevant for the economic analysis of the CCS case is the inclusion of a cost of carbon, which in the main scenario investigated is taken from the BlueMap scenario of the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives. With the cost of carbon, coal fired power without carbon capture and storage is more expensive than coal fired power with carbon capture and storage and viceversa. The tax per kWh for the reference system is € 0. 07, which is markedly more than the tax of € 0. 02 for the prospective system. This {{is a result of the}} BLUE Map scenario assumption of a 110 $/t CO 2 tax. In fact, CCS is only cheaper per functional unit when taxes (including a carbon tax) are included as an input. This indicates that that the technology is economically “non-sustainable” in the sense that it cannot compete on costs with the reference technology when a carbon tax is not levied. For the scenario evaluated, key results can be summarized as follows:  Implementation of CCS results in lower impact on the human health indicator than in the reference scenario (without CCS). In both scenarios, the decrease is mainly driven by changes in the environmental human health indicator while the role of occupational health is minor.  Implementation of CCS results on a score on impacts on the natural environment that is 70 % lower than the reference scenario. This is mainly due to the significant decrease on the climate change indicator which counteracts increases shown in other environmental indicators.  Implementation of CCS results on a significant increase in the impact on exhaustible resources, which is due to an increase on fossil depletion. The effect of metal depletion is negligible compared to the large amount of fossil depletion.  With a high tax (110 $/tonne Blue map scenario), as used in this study, applying CCS results in a marked increase in economic activity, when results are analysed at the technology level. The results also show a substantial increase in working hours per functional unit. However, the results also indicate that the producer price increase more than 80 % when implementing CCS.  The results for social well-being indicate that in the scenario with CCS there is an increase in total employment and knowledge intensive jobs, and a decrease in income and global inequality. However, increases in child and forced labour are also observed. The qualitative indicators reveal that issues such as trust in risk information, long term control functions, stakeholder involvement can become bottlenecks for the deployment of the technology and need to be carefully addressed as part of project development and implementation  There is a large difference in order of magnitude in the end-points. This makes the integration of results troublesome. Until this problem is solved, it is recommended to assess the results without a formal aggregation methodology. The evaluation of the Prosuite framework in the case study CCS provided support for the applicability of the developed methods, but also illustrated remaining shortcomings and challenges...|$|E
40|$|Underwater {{pipelines}} {{have become}} {{a vital part of}} modern civilisation. <b>Transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> is relatively inflexible compared to other means of transport, however it consumes less energy. Most offshore pipelines carry oil or gas, but they can also transport water or other fluids. More and more oil and gas is produced from offshore fields. The product has to be carried onshore and that is usually done by pipeline. Pipelines can be laid uncovered on the seabed, or can be embedded in the seafloor when stabilisation or protection is required. Pipelines are primarily covered when they are located in shallow waters. The material used to refill an excavated trench is called backfill. The typical material used as artificial backfill is coarse granular soil (rock, gravel, or coarse sand). When there is no suitable backfill material available close to the pipeline route, then material has to be transported from another location. A subsea pipeline should remain stable during its entire lifetime. Normal engineering practice focuses on the operational phase, while the installation phase is almost neglected. However, this study focuses on the installation phase and particularly on dredge-based backfilling. Dredge-based backfilling means using the suction pipe of a Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger (TSHD) as discharge pipe. It is not always clear if a particular soil can be used as backfill material. In the past this lack of knowledge resulted a few times in pipeline floatation during the installation phase. This lack of knowledge can also result in the disposal of perfectly suitable backfill material. A pipeline can be lifted up {{from the bottom of the}} trench if the weight of the pipeline is lower than the weight of the liquefied backfill. Pipeline floatation occurs if a soil-water mixture remains liquefied over a too large distance. In general, coarse granular soils remain liquefied for only a short period of time. If the backfill is composed of fine material, it will take a relatively long period of time before the soil settles and develops structural density. G. C. Sills (1998) defines structural density as the density which marks the change from a fluid-supported suspension to a soil in which effective stresses exist. The subject of this study is prevention of pipeline floatation during dredge-based backfilling. It is therefore necessary to understand which characteristics cause pipeline floatation. Due to economic reasons, pipelines have become lighter than a typical soil-water mixture. This is a potential risk if the sedimentation time of a soil-water mixture is relatively long. Sedimentation time is the time required for soil particles to settle out of suspension. The sedimentation time and the backfilling process are analysed using the two dimensional (horizontal and vertical) sedimentation model (2 DV model) developed by Van Rhee. The 2 DV model is designed to simulate the sedimentation process inside a TSHD. However, in this thesis the model is used to simulate the backfilling of an offshore trench. To simulate this process correctly, it is necessary to implement a moving discharge point in the model. Loads due to waves and currents are not considered, since pipelines are usually installed during relatively calm weather. These considerations make it possible to use the 2 DV model. The backfilling process is studied in three steps. First, the process is simulated as a one-dimensional sedimentation test. Secondly, the backfilling of a trench using a stationary TSHD is evaluated. Finally, the backfilling of a trench using a moving TSHD is simulated. The moving TSHD tests produce a distribution of the soil-water mixture density. This distribution is converted to a grid which is used as input for the beam-model (Matlab). The beam-model simulates pipeline displacement at a certain moment during the backfilling operation. The beam-model is based on the theory of the beam on elastic foundation. In this model only static loads are considered; the own weight of the pipeline and the buoyant force caused by the displaced fluid. The beam-model combined with the 2 DV model provides an approach to model pipeline displacement during dredge-based backfilling. The 2 DV sedimentation model is tested to its limits in this thesis. The simulation of the backfilling operation of a moving hopper requires a model area with a great length and a relatively small height. This results in a model composed of stretched grid cells (in longitudinal direction). The 2 DV model is at his numerical boundaries due to these stretched grid cells. The results of the ‘moving hopper’ simulations are therefore questionable. The results of the static simulations can be considered as reliable, since in these simulations the 2 DV model remains well within the boundaries.

40|$|The {{growth of}} natural gas <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{has led to the}} {{establishment}} of a large network of pipelines throughout the world [1]. Transport {{of natural gas}} through a network of pipelines is a challenging issue, mainly due to the hydrate risk associated with it. Hydrates are crystalline compounds in which hydrogen bonded water enclatherate one or more type of `guest' molecules inside cavities. Natural gas hydrates can be formed both in pipelines and process equipment's, as a result of abnormalities in the flow operation [2]. I. e. when pressure drop occurs across a restriction or turbine causing the water to expand and eventually drop out as liquid and during emergency shut downs due to failure of a component in the system for e. g. compressor failure. Natural gas hydrates can form in pipelines as a result of vapor deposition and or splashing of water with subsequent conversions [2]. In view of the above, the maximum allowable content of water that can be permitted in a gas stream, [in this project methane (CH 4) with impurities carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) ] under transportation without risking the hydrate formation is a very complex issue [3]. Very complex because generally the system cannot reach equilibrium and many different competing phase transitions occur which leads to hydrate formation and phase transitions that can lead to re-dissociation. The dynamic situation further complicates the picture, which due to 1 st and 2 nd laws of thermodynamics may lead to a range of different hydrates depending on which phase the hydrate former is coming from. This is because chemical potentials for guest molecules in different phases are not the same in non- equilibrium situations. Yet another reason is that the most stable hydrates will form first even with liquid water and hydrate former from fluid phase mixture. In this MSc project three different routes to hydrate formation have been studied and analyzed. This also includes impact of solid surfaces that can induce phase transitions. For transport in pipelines this is essentially rusty surfaces of the pipe-wall. The main aim of the study is to bring more clarity to the most important and possible events that can lead to hydrate formation and as such will dominate the hydrate risk evaluation. The first of these routes to hydrate formation involves water condensing out as liquid and then subsequently forming hydrate together with hydrate formers from the gas. This sequence of events is the most used basis for hydrate risk analysis in industry today, i. e. hydrate risk evaluation based on dew-point calculations. A second possibility is that hydrate forms directly from water dissolved in the gas. A third route involves the possibility that water can adsorb on the rusty walls and then hydrate can be formed from water which is slightly (1 nm) outside the wall, by extracting hydrate formers from the gas. Since the systems [water, gas, adsorbed phase and hydrate] generally cannot reach equilibrium (Gibbs phase rule) and the combination of 1 st and 2 nd law of thermodynamics will always direct the system to have lowest free energy possible [3]. Hence a primary tool for comparison will be free energy analysis. The natural choice of method in free energy analysis is classical thermodynamics using residual thermodynamics (ideal gas as a reference state). The software developed for this purpose is developed by Professor Bjørn Kvamme. In addition, external software from DTU (Danish Technical University) has also been utilized to determine thermodynamic properties of the gas mixture. These codes are in FORTRAN language and Microsoft developer has been used as compiler. Water available for hydrate formation can exist in three different states. The first being able to form CH 4 hydrate directly from water dissolved in CH 4 (mass transport is a limitation though), the second being hydrate formed with water either condensing out, to create a liquid water phase and the third being hydrate formation from water adsorbed on solid surfaces (hematite in our case) [4]. In routes involving liquid water drop-out the impurities like CO 2 and H 2 S may follow water from the first condensation. Sensitivity analysis was made and the maximum allowable concentration of water, before the water drop out was analyzed for different systems. The findings were that with the presence of H 2 S in a system with CH 4 and CO 2 the hydrate formation process could be faster i. e. the maximum allowable water concentration which can be permitted in a gas stream (CH 4) during transportation of gas decreased with increasing pressures {{as well as for the}} concentration of H 2 S as compared to a system with only CH 4 and CO 2. Hence it can be observed from the results how even a small amount of H 2 S is able to affect the limit of water concentration in the gas stream...|$|E

Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline.</b>|$|R
