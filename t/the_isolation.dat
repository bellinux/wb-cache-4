5|$|During {{the period}} 1918 to 1939, <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> {{hospital}} remained the sole medical provision in Sheriff Hill. Faced {{with an increase}} in population, Gateshead Council decided that a new general hospital should be built. In March 1938, preliminary work started on the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on the site of <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> hospital; the foundations were laid in 1939 but the outbreak of World War II delayed the building work. The new hospital was opened by Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI, on 18 March 1948. It is the largest hospital in Gateshead and has since been expanded, most notably {{with the opening of the}} North East NHS Surgery Centre in 2008, which cost £13.3 million.|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{isolation}} {{is a direct}} and effective approach to improve the ultraprecise pointing capability of an imaging satellite. To have a good trade-off between the resonance amplitude and the high frequency attenuation for <b>the</b> original vibration <b>isolation</b> platform, a novel vibration isolation system for reaction wheel (RW), including a multistrut vibration isolation platform and multiple tuned mass dampers, is proposed. The first step constructs the integrated satellite dynamic model including the RWs and <b>the</b> vibration <b>isolation</b> systems, while <b>the</b> static and dynamic imbalances of the rotor and base movements are considered in the modeling process. The transmissibility matrix of <b>the</b> vibration <b>isolation</b> system is then obtained, and its frequency domain characteristics are described. The third part presents the application of <b>the</b> vibration <b>isolation</b> system for RWs. The effective attenuation of RW disturbances by <b>the</b> new vibration <b>isolation</b> system is illustrated, and its safety performance is also verified. Finally, using the reasonable parameters of <b>the</b> vibration <b>isolation</b> system, its performance on the satellite is testified by numerical simulations. The study shows that <b>the</b> novel vibration <b>isolation</b> system presented cannot only be successfully applied to a satellite but also improve the attitude stability...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, novel {{structures}} {{are reported to}} improve <b>the</b> cross-talk <b>isolation,</b> <b>the</b> performance of on-chip inductors, and the self-heating in a thin-film silicon-on-insulator (TFSOI) technology. In these structures, p(+) substrate contact rings are used to improve <b>the</b> cross-talk <b>isolation,</b> appropriately doped TFSOI layers are used for high-Q inductors, and source contacts connected to the substrate are used to minimize the self-heating problem. The p+ substrate contact rings provide - 57 dB isolation (typically characterized for a device spacing of 100 jam) at 10 GHz, {{which is the best}} ever reported in TFSOI technology. A maximum Q-factor of 10. 4 is obtained for TFSOI-layer shielded on-chip inductors. <b>The</b> inductor-to-inductor <b>isolation</b> is - 62 dB (for a spacing of 100 mum) at 10 GHz, which is close to <b>the</b> ideal <b>isolation</b> of <b>the</b> open probes. The source contacts connected to the substrate improves the self-heating by 16 %. <b>The</b> excellent cross-talk <b>isolation</b> performance, high-Q on-chip inductors, and reduced self-heating make the TFSOI technology a very suitable candidate for mixed signal system-on-a-chip (SOC) applications...|$|R
