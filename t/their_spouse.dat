5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E
5|$|In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{have been}} told to express {{appreciation}} for the things <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> does for them, be frank about things that make them unhappy, and refer to anything {{they do not want to}} do but must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with Michael, Dwight and the gang, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him.|$|E
5|$|She began a {{four-year}} term on 10 December 2007, facing challenges including: inflation, poor public security, international credibility, a faulty energy infrastructure, and protests from the agricultural sectors over {{an increase of}} nearly 30% on export taxes. Kirchner was the second female president of Argentina, after Isabel Martínez de Perón but, unlike Perón, {{was elected to the}} office, whereas Isabel Perón was elected Juan Perón's vice president, and automatically assumed the presidency on his death. The transition from Néstor Kirchner to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was also the first time a democratic head of state was replaced by <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> without the death of either. He remained highly influential during his wife's term, supervising the economy and leading the PJ. Their marriage has been compared with those of Juan and Eva Perón and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Media observers suspected that Mr. Kirchner stepped down as president to circumvent the term limit, swapping roles with his wife.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{types of}} foreign {{visitors}} are allowed dual intent, and other categories of visitors are not.

25|$|In the United States Alfred Kinsey {{found in}} his studies that 50% of males and 26% of females had extramarital sex at least once during their lifetime.

Other authors say that between 20% and 25% of Americans had sex with someone other than <b>their</b> <b>spouse.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of a sex education program for middle aged men patients with diabetes and <b>their</b> <b>spouses.</b> Methods: The research design for this study was a non-equivalent control group quasi-experimental study. The subjects were 23 diabetic patients and <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> with half of the subjects exposed to a structured sex education program. Sexual Beliefs and Information Questionnaire, Dyadic Sexual Communication Scale, Sexual Frequency Scale, Derogatis Sexual Function Inventory and International Index of Erectile Function- 5 were used for data collection. Results: In the experimental group, sexual knowledge of diabetic patients and sexual communication with <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> were improved after two weeks following the program. Also, in the experimental group, sexual knowledge, sexual communication, and sexual frequency in both diabetic patients and <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> were improved after six weeks following the program. In the experimental group, sexual satisfaction of diabetic patients was improved after six weeks following sex education program, however <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> in the experimental group showed no significant differences than those of the comparison group. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that sex education program for both diabetic patients an...|$|R

25|$|The Queen is the fount of all honours in the Canadian provinces, {{the first}} being the Order of the Dogwood for the British Columbia's centennial in 1957. Unlike {{in the federal}} sphere, however, where new orders, decorations, and medals may only be created with the {{approval}} of the sovereign through letters patent, the same in the provinces are formed through Order in Council by the relevant lieutenant governor in the Queen's name. Hence, the insignia and medallions for these awards bear a crown, cypher, and/or effigy of the monarch. Further, in 1999 Queen Elizabeth II approved the design and issuance of the Viceregal Badge of Service, which features a diamond shape framing a red circle bearing a maple leaf; the lieutenant governors' badge is gold in appearance and the one for <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> is silver.

25|$|In early June 2008, the White House {{signaled}} {{the president might}} be willing to sign {{a modified version of the}} Webb bill, along with the war funding bill, if transferability between spouses and dependents was added onto the new GI Bill. This would make the benefits more valuable to career military personal that would like to pay for <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> or child's education. On June 19, this provision was added to the war funding bill. With the added transferability provisions for continued military service, McCain said he now supported the bill, because it encouraged additional service beyond three years, mitigating his earlier concerns. McCain, who had not voted in the Senate since April 8, was campaigning in Ohio on June 26 and was not present for the final senate vote on the bill, which passed 92–6 (The only other senator not voting was Ted Kennedy, who was recovering after surgery to remove a brain tumor). Bush signed the war funding bill, along with the veterans education benefits, into law on June 30, 2008.|$|E
25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that the willingness {{to do this kind of}} trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer have no one to confide in except <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.|$|E
