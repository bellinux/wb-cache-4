5|$|An {{important}} aspect of race preparation is grooming the course to provide a surface for skate-skiing and setting tracks for classic events. <b>This</b> <b>takes</b> into account snow physics, methods for packing snow and surface shaping, and the equipment used for these functions. Also key is the layout of grooming and track setting in the stadium with various formats for starts, finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens {{generally}} walk {{when moving}} {{around on the}} ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting {{in the middle of}} the day. They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. <b>This</b> <b>takes</b> place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. <b>This</b> <b>takes</b> the form of a handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is always made for the College's own register.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E

5|$|Captivated by Hedren's Nordic looks, Hitchcock becomes {{infatuated}} with her. While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances {{to her in}} the back of a limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes through the back door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks the apparently shatterproof glass of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's face with splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. <b>This</b> <b>takes</b> a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E
5|$|Each {{season of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall theme episodes tie into. Roz Kaveney identifies family and belonging as the overall {{theme of the}} fifth season. Buffy's mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) begins experiencing headaches {{at the beginning of}} the season, once collapsing and requiring hospitalization. She subsequently has a brain tumor removed. She has been recovering well. In the previous episode, she receives flowers from a male suitor, which Buffy finds at the end of that episode. The fifth season also introduces Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Buffy's 14-year-old sister. Each season has a primary antagonist called the Big Bad; in the fifth season <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> the form of a powerful goddess named Glory (Clare Kramer).|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. <b>This</b> <b>takes</b> advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Viviparous mammals {{are in the}} {{subclass}} Theria; {{those living}} today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located {{in the front of}} the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods. They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake.|$|E
5|$|When {{displayed}} alongside other flags, {{the national}} flag takes {{the position of}} honour; it is raised first and lowered last. Other national flags should be arranged in alphabetical order. Where two (or more than three) flags appear together, the national flag should be placed to the right (left of the observer); in a display of three flags in line, the national flag occupies the central position. The European flag is also flown from government buildings on a daily basis. In {{the presence of a}} foreign visitor belonging to a member state, <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> precedence over the Italian flag. As a sign of mourning, flags flown externally shall be lowered to half-mast; two black ribbons may be attached to those otherwise displayed. Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a golden fringe surrounding the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E

5|$|Gwen becomes {{consumed}} {{with the issue}} of the missing individuals and <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> its toll on her relationship with her husband Rhys (Kai Owen). They argue, and he states that if Gwen is working to safeguard ordinary life then she has not been successful. Returning to Torchwood's headquarters, Gwen interrupts Jack and fellow Torchwood employee Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) during a sexual encounter. After apologising, she tells Jack that she wants to continue the investigation. Jack refuses to help, but Ianto later gives Gwen a GPS device with coordinates to a hidden location, leading Gwen to a facility on Flat Holm, a sort of care home for seventeen individuals taken by the riftwho have returned. Gwen finds Jack there, and demands access to Jonah. An older Jonah (Robert Pugh) is shown to have been physically deformed whilst on a burning planet {{in the midst of a}} burning solar system. Jack reveals that he set up the facility when he first took command of Torchwood, in order to care for the victims of the rift, who had previously been locked away in the Torchwood vaults.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> the form of a sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E
5|$|Other images, such as Thalaba {{reclaiming}} his father's magic sword, are {{symbols that}} effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, these events represent the {{minority of the}} plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little explanation as to how it works {{and there is no}} moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, the poem is able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing <b>this</b> <b>takes</b> away from their meaning and effect. In terms of religious imagery, Islam within the poem is more similar to Zoroastrian thought and morality. Other religious images lose their power as Southey removes any mystical aspects of them, including Simorgh being stripped of it being a symbol of harmony with life. In terms of the divine, there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.|$|E
