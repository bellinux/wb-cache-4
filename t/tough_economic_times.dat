5|$|Increasingly <b>tough</b> <b>economic</b> <b>times</b> in {{the early}} 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new {{construction}} and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1921, Snively became a {{candidate}} for mayor of Duluth, was elected, and kept the position {{for a total of}} sixteen years--a record for Duluth mayors. Snively was sixty-one years old when {{he was elected to the}} office, and his first proclamation as mayor was his promise to make Duluth the most beautiful city in the Northwest, if not the country. The completion and promotion of Skyline Parkway, the city's hilltop boulevard, became Snively's personal project throughout his four terms in office. The idea for the city-wide boulevard is credited to William King Rogers of Ohio, who also oversaw construction of its initial segment from 1889 to 1891. After that, work on the boulevard fell off, and was piecemeal at best until Snively came into office. During his administration, the boulevard's expansion served as both a way to beautify the city and provide jobs during <b>tough</b> <b>economic</b> <b>times</b> in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} there was a great deal of animosity between the chain and its franchises over its Buck Double promotion, which was driving average checks and profits. The Buck Double had been running for since October 2010 to the introduction of the XT, eventually had taken upwards 10% of all sales in the restaurants - cannibalizing sales from other higher priced items. Combined with the ongoing economic downturn at the time, the value- oriented promotion had sent overall profits for the chain down by as much as 3.3%. The introduction was seen as a way to help stop the sales slide and prop up the chain's flagging sales. By mid-2011, the financial crisis was also still lingering and many chains, Burger King included, had moved to a discounting as a way to attract customers who were unwilling to spend money during <b>tough</b> <b>economic</b> <b>times.</b> The discounting fit into the barbell strategy as these deals would often encourage people to purchase more food, often at higher price points.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} on the rationality of early releases of industrial production (IP) and producer price index (PPI) data. Rather than following the usual practice of examining only rst available and fully revised data, we examine the entire revision history for each variable. Thus, {{we are able to}} assess, for example, whether earlier releases of data are in any sense "less" rational than later releases, and when data become rational. Our ndings suggest that seasonally unadjusted IP and PPI become rational after approximately 3 - 4 months, while seasonally adjusted versions of these series remain irrational for at least 6 - 12 months after initial release. For all variables examined, we nd evidence that the remaining revision is predictable from its own past or from publicly available information in other economic and nancial vari-ables. Additionally, we nd that there is a clear increase in the volatility of revisions during recessions, suggesting that early data releases are less reliable in <b>tougher</b> <b>economic</b> <b>times.</b> Fi-nally, we explore whether nonlinearities in economic behavior manifest themselves in the form of nonlinearities in the rationality of early releases of economic data, by separately analyzing expansionary and recessionary economic phases and by allowing for structural breaks. These types of nonlinearities are shown to be prevalent, and in some cases lead to incorrect inferences concerning data rationality when they are not taken account of...|$|R

Four couples were shortlisted for the show, competing in pairs for each of the two houses.

Instead, one of the couples originally picked to compete for the Yellow house was chosen to renovate the Blue House and competed as the [...] "Blue Team". The way the judges come to their decision as to who is the winner each week was changed. Each of the three judges rate each team a score out of ten. The scores are added together and the team with the highest score wins for the week. This makes it possible for the judges decision to be a tie, which was the result in the first week. In this case, both teams won a prize for winning the room for that week. The Yellow Team won this series, and the Blue Team were successful in buying their house at the auction.|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] environment in which organizations operate has changed dramatically {{over the last few}} years. Increased competition, globalization, the influence of the Internet and international events affect the performance and survival of organizations on a world-wide scale. The Internet has changed the way organizations do business, from the acquisition and servicing of customers to the management of their relations with suppliers. This is not only revolutionizing the way people access information, communicate, shop and entertain themselves, but also the way organizations compete and operate. With the extensive use and familiarity of the Internet, a trend has developed where organizations are moving their information systems to Web-centered information systems. A Web-centered information system interrelates all the different information systems in an organization using Web-based technologies and interfaces. Organizations also use the Internet to electronically provide innovative products and services. Users in organizations are demanding that the information systems used by the organization should become more efficient and effective. Therefore, organizations are forced to invest heavily in the deployment of information systems to obtain value and benefit, and to stay competitive in this new environment. According to the Gartner Group (2002), world-wide spending on information communication technology alone totaled over $ 2, 7 trillion in 2001, with an estimated wastage of 20 % on corporate information technology budgets with purchases failing to achieve their objectives. Although information systems expenditure is regarded as costly and risky, many information systems investments appear to go ahead without the use of formal investment appraisal and risk management techniques (Ward 1996). However, <b>tougher</b> <b>economic</b> <b>times</b> are forcing businesses to treat information technology (IT) investments just like other fixed investments that are driven by sound business considerations and not hype (Van der Merwe 2002 : 116). The old argument, that {{it is not necessary to}} formally justify the investment in information systems because they are strategically important to stay 'in business', is being questioned. In a business environment where senior managers and decision makers are held more and more accountable to the shareholders for their investment decisions, the need for using generally accepted techniques and methods to justify the investment decisions exists. This research investigated some relevant issues regarding the decision to invest in information systems, as well as the methods that organizations currently employ to justify their investment in information systems.
