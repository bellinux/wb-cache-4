5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach.</b> They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony Froude published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts {{the causes and}} consequences of a young priest's crisis of faith. Like many of his contemporaries, Froude came to question his Christian faith in light of early nineteenth century developments in history, theology, and science. Froude was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> to religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the testing and estimation of change-points, locations where the distribution abruptly changes, {{in a sequence}} of multivariate or non-Euclidean observations. We study a nonparametric framework that utilizes similarity information among observations, which {{can be applied to}} various data types as long as an informative similarity measure on the sample space can be defined. The existing approach along this line has low power and/or biased estimates for change-points under some common scenarios. We address these problems by considering new tests based on similarity information. Simulation studies show that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> exhibit substantial improvements in detecting and estimating change-points. In addition, under some mild conditions, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> test statistics are asymptotically distribution free under the null hypothesis of no change. Analytic p-value approximations to the significance of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> test statistics for the single change-point alternative and changed interval alternative are derived, making <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> easy off-the-shelf tools for large datasets. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> are illustrated in an analysis of New York taxi data...|$|R

5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol and the {{effectiveness}} of the operation to free them prompted the British government to increase its support of UNAMSIL, both politically and through the provision of staff officers to assist UNAMSIL's operational headquarters (though not with a significant contribution of peacekeepers, despite considerable lobbying). The British also applied political pressure through the United Nations Security Council on the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)—the second main party to the civil war after the government—and on Sierra Leone's neighbour Liberia, which had provided support to the RUF. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach,</b> combined with a larger and more powerful UNAMSIL, hastened the demobilisation of the RUF and thus the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War.|$|E

25|$|In 2006-07 nine {{small towns}} (between 5,000 and 25,000 inhabitants) across Peru {{introduced}} a new water and sanitation management model, under which the community is being more empowered, including through deciding themselves about {{a certain level of}} service quality, such as low-cost technologies, and corresponding tariffs. Subsequently the municipality hires a specialized operator who is being regulated by a Community Supervision Board under a Public-Private-Social Partnership. The specialized operator can be a private or a mixed company. The aim of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> was to break with the low-level equilibrium of poor service quality and poor cost recovery that prevails throughout small towns in Peru, under which poor quality water services are provided directly by the municipality. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> was supported through the Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) of the Ministry of Housing, with technical support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and financial support of US$ 6.6 million from the Canadian International Development Agency for limited infrastructure investments and training for both the operator and members of the Community Supervision Boards. After the municipal elections of 2007, 3 new mayors decided to abandon <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> and to return to the old model of direct municipal management.

40|$|In {{order to}} select an optimal {{threshold}} for image thresholding that is relatively robust {{to the presence}} of skew and heavy-tailed class-conditional distributions, we propose two median-based approaches: one is an extension of Otsu's method and the other is an extension of Kittler and Illingworth's minimum error thresholding. We provide theoretical interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approaches,</b> based on mixtures of Laplace distributions. The two extensions preserve the methodological simplicity and computational efficiency of their original methods, and in general can achieve more robust performance when the data for either class is skew and heavy-tailed.

40|$|Recent {{approaches}} to the notions of randomness and proofs are surveyed. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> notions differ from the traditional ones in being subjective to {{the capabilities of the}} observer rather than reflecting &quot;ideal &quot; entities. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> notion of randomness regards probability distributions as equal if they cannot be told apart by efficioent procedures. This notion is constructive and is suited for many applications. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> notion of a proof allows the introduction of the notion of zero-knowledge proofs: convincing arguments which yield nothing but the validity of <b>the</b> assertion. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>approaches</b> to randomness and proofs are based on basic concepts and results from the theory of resource-bounded computation. In order to make the survey as accessible as possible, we have presented elements of the theory of resource bounded computation (but only to the extent required for the description of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approaches).</b> This survey is not intended to provide an account of the more traditional {{approaches to}} randomness (e. g. Kolmogorov Complexity) and proofs (i. e. traditional logic systems). Whenever these approaches are described it is only in order to confront them with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approaches...</b>|$|R

25|$|Within {{the school}} {{concerned}} with ideological differences, another theory seeks clarification in externalization of the Spanish case; instead of pointing to unique Spanish character of Carlism, it highlights general European patterns of change.

25|$|The {{novel was}} made into the film Lady in the Lake, {{starring}} and directed by Robert Montgomery.

Reviews of the film were not appreciative of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach.</b> Most critics gave the director credit for trying an experimental technique but felt the experiment had been a failure.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{the plan}} has gained little {{traction}} among member states.

As of July 2017, the UN had raised just $9.22 million of the promised $400 million total. Advocates have voiced their displeasure with these results, and the public outcry has grown more forceful as of late; The UN has announced the MINUSTAH mission will be ending in October 2017, and many are calling for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> to be funded {{by the time of the}} mission's departure.|$|E
25|$|In early 1944, Portal's view of {{strategic}} bombing changed; {{he felt that}} bombers could also play a more auxiliary role in the allied offensive.

25|$|By the 1930s it {{was seen}} that water supply would be an issue for the canal; this {{prompted}} {{the building of the}} Madden Dam across the Chagres River above Gatun Lake. Completed in 1935, the dam created Madden Lake (later Alajeula Lake) which provides additional water storage for the canal. In 1939, construction began on a further major improvement: a new set of locks for the canal, large enough to carry the larger warships that the United States was building at the time and planned to continue building. The work proceeded for several years, and significant excavation was carried out on <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> channels, but the project was canceled after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Although Cage {{had used}} chance {{on a few}} earlier occasions, most notably in the third {{movement}} of Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra (1950–51), the I Ching opened new possibilities in this field for him. The first results of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> were Imaginary Landscape No. 4 for 12 radio receivers, and Music of Changes for piano. The latter work was written for David Tudor, whom Cage met through Feldman—another friendship that lasted until Cage's death. Tudor premiered most of Cage's works until the early 1960s, when he stopped performing on the piano and concentrated on electronic music. The I Ching became Cage's standard tool for composition: he used it in practically every work composed after 1951.|$|E
