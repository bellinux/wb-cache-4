Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Morrison notched two assists during the series. After initially failing {{to come to terms}} on a new contract with the Canucks in the off-season, Morrison filed for arbitration. He won his hearing and was awarded a two-year, US$4.6 million contract on August 3, 2002, more than doubling his previous year's salary of US$775,000.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries {{the castle}} {{continued}} to be maintained and modified; the seaward half of the castle {{was turned into a}} solid gun platform and additional accommodation was built for the fort's gunners. A bulwark was built {{on the east side of}} the castle and an additional gun battery was placed on the town's quay, just to <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>For</b> most of the English Civil War of the 1640s it was held by Parliament; following the Restoration, it was refortified by Charles II in the 1670s.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, and {{particularly}} in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a strategy of destabilisation of Western powers by disruption of their hold on African colonies. Nikita Khrushchev, in particular, viewed the 'underdeveloped third of mankind' as a means to weaken <b>the</b> <b>West.</b> <b>For</b> the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create a rift between western powers and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with which to foster future relations.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} {{second wave of}} {{immigration}} did not begin until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished national origins quotas. After the passage of that act, Armenians from the Soviet Union, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating in large numbers, many fleeing political instability in their host countries. In the 1950s, most Armenian immigrants in the US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> a safe and more prosperous life.|$|E

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei is a post-apocalyptic {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atlus. Originally released for the Super Famicom in 1992 in Japan, it has been ported to multiple systems and eventually released in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> iOS in 2014. It is the third game in the Megami Tensei series and {{the first in the}} central Shin Megami Tensei series. The gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{emperors}} {{appealed to}} <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid {{in return for}} a reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the See of Rome. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented the authority of Rome and the Latin Rite. Some Western troops arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a success}} for the western {{development}} project at some level, for statistics show a substantial growth in foreign investment in the western regions. However, the rate of progress was not equal in all regions, partially due {{to the creation of}} the West Triangle Economic Zone, which sped up development in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Xi'an, but slowed down development in other areas of <b>the</b> <b>West.</b> <b>For</b> example, while foreign direct investment in Chongqing grew, foreign investment in other Western Chinese cities like Guizhou, Guangxi, and Ningxia declined significantly, dropping about USD $19.71, $250.96 million, and $34.54 million respectively.|$|E

5|$|Yet {{over the}} next few weeks, Poland's risky, {{unconventional}} strategy at the August 1920 Battle of Warsaw halted the Soviet advance. The Polish plan was developed by Piłsudski and others, including Tadeusz Rozwadowski. Later, some supporters of Piłsudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, while opponents would seek to minimize his role. In <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> a long time a myth persisted that it was General Maxime Weygand of the French Military Mission to Poland who had saved Poland; modern scholars, however, are in agreement that Weygand's role was minimal at best.|$|E
5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took charge in <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>For</b> the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> the free fall of the currency.|$|E

5|$|Although the Silk Road from China to the West was {{initially}} formulated {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu (141–87) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.|$|E
5|$|As the {{perimeter}} shrank and the surviving defenders fell back, they became concentrated {{into a small}} area in the city centre. By now there were about 10,000 German soldiers in the city centre, which was being assaulted from all sides. One of the other main thrusts was along Wilhelmstrasse on which the Air Ministry, built of reinforced concrete, was pounded by large concentrations of Soviet artillery. The remaining German Tiger tanks of the Hermann von Salza battalion took up positions in {{the east of the}} Tiergarten to defend the centre against Kuznetsov's 3rd Shock Army (which although heavily engaged around the Reichstag was also flanking the area by advancing through the northern Tiergarten) and the 8th Guards Army advancing through the south of the Tiergarten. These Soviet forces had effectively cut the sausage-shaped area held by the Germans in half and made any escape attempt to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>for</b> German troops in the centre much more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Despite declining health, Vivekananda {{left for}} <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> {{a second time}} in June 1899 {{accompanied}} by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, {{he went to the}} United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011–12 NBA season, Parker {{helped the}} Spurs reach {{the best record}} in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> the second {{straight}} season; the team tied the Chicago Bulls for the best overall record in the league. On 4 February 2012, Parker became the all-time assist leader of the franchise with 4,477, surpassing Avery Johnson, adding 42 points in a victory against Oklahoma City Thunder. The Spurs secured their 13th straight 50 win season despite the lockout (a new NBA record), and Parker received his fourth All-Star nod. He finished fifth in MVP award voting, receiving four first-place votes. Late in the season, the Spurs signed Parker's longtime friend Boris Diaw, who was claimed off waivers from the Charlotte Bobcats. In the 2012 NBA Playoffs, Parker averaged 20.1 points and 6.8 assists as the Spurs swept through the first two rounds, defeating the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers. In the Western Conference Finals the Spurs faced the young Oklahoma City Thunder. After winning Game 1 and Game 2, 101–98 and 120–111 respectively, and taking a 2–0 series lead, the Spurs lost four consecutive games, thus losing the series 4–2.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{games into}} the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played. Along the way, the Spurs {{compiled}} a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors. 12 days later, {{in a game}} against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>for</b> the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
