It is {{of so much}} {{importance}} that the part of <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> truth, discussed in this chapter, should be rightly understood, that I think it is desirable to restate the results we have arrived at, in a somewhat different mode of expression.|$|E
60|$|I answer, we {{have that}} right {{whenever}} the scientific canons of induction give it to us; that is, whenever the induction can be complete. We have it, for example, {{in a case of}} causation in which there has been an experimentum crucis. If an antecedent A, superadded to a set of antecedents in all other respects unaltered, is followed by an effect B which did not exist before, A is, in that instance at least, the cause of B, or an indispensable part of its cause; and if A be tried again with many totally different sets of antecedents and B still follows, then it is the whole cause. If these observations or experiments have been repeated so often, and by so many persons, as to exclude all supposition of error in the observer, a law of nature is established; and so long as this law is received as such, the assertion that on any particular occasion A took place, and yet B did not follow, without any counteracting cause, must be disbelieved. Such an assertion is not to be credited on any less evidence than what would suffice to overturn the law. The general truths, that whatever has a beginning has a cause, and that when none but the same causes exist, the same effects follow, rest on the strongest inductive evidence possible; the proposition that things affirmed by even a crowd of respectable witnesses are true, is but an approximate generalization; and—even if we fancy we actually saw or felt the fact which is in contradiction to the law—what a human being can see {{is no more than a}} set of appearances; from which the real nature of the phenomenon is merely an inference, and in this inference approximate generalizations usually have a large share. If, therefore, we make our election to hold by the law, no quantity of evidence whatever ought to persuade us that there has occurred any thing in contradiction to it. If, indeed, the evidence produced is such that it is more likely that the set of observations and experiments on which the law rests should have been inaccurately performed or incorrectly interpreted, than that the evidence in question should be false, we may believe the evidence; but then we must abandon the law. And since the law was received on what seemed a complete induction, it can only be rejected on evidence equivalent; namely, as being inconsistent not with any number of approximate generalizations, but with some other and better established law of nature. This extreme case, of a conflict between two supposed laws of nature, has probably never actually occurred where, in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> both the laws, the true canons of scientific induction had been kept in view; but if it did occur, it must terminate in the total rejection of one of the supposed laws. It would prove that there must be a flaw in the logical process by which either one or the other was established; and if there be so, that supposed general truth is no truth at all. We can not admit a proposition as a law of nature, and yet believe a fact in real contradiction to it. We must disbelieve the alleged fact, or believe that we were mistaken in admitting the supposed law.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemistry)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. In Africa, herbal {{medicines}} {{are often}} used as primary treatments {{for a variety of}} ailments and diseases including HIV/AIDS and for HIV-related problems. In general, traditional medicines are not well researched scientifically in controlled studies, and are poorly regulated. Since the pharmacological effectiveness of natural products is affected by several native and foreign factors, studies on the variations of chemical composition and biological activity of these medicines are necessary. <b>The</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> plants to identify chemical substances are of great interest to natural product researchers because {{there is a need to}} discover new drugs for treating old and new diseases. These facts underscore an urgent need to develop new anti HIV and AIDS drugs with fewer or no side effects. Research into drug discovery and development using natural products is increasingly becoming better established. Marine organisms as a source of natural products delivered numerous novel compounds with multiple pharmacological properties. Natural products give endless opportunities for discovering novel compounds that can be used as drugs or backbones of drug leads. Manayi is a natural product that has been used to treat and manage people with HIV, but no scientific studies have been done to prove its efficacy on the HIV under controlled conditions. For the purposes of this study, cooked and uncooked Manayi product was evaluated for its efficacy on HIV in vitro. Manayi samples were collected in East London, Eastern Cape and sequentially extracted with hexane, chloroform, dichloromethane, butanol, methanol, and water as a series of increasingly polar solvents for its bioactive chemical constituents...|$|R
