Molecular analyses have been similarly equivocal regarding the blacknose shark's phylogenetic relationships: Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found this species {{to be the most}} basal member of Carcharhinus, while Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis indicated affinity between it and the blacktip shark (C. limbatus) or the smalltail shark (C. porosus). The whitenose shark (Nasolamia velox), found along the tropical western coast of the Americas, may be descended from blacknose sharks that experienced the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of incipient cyclopia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, {{thalidomide}} {{has always}} {{been used as a}} racemate.

Moreover, thalidomide enantiomers have been shown to be interconversed in vivo due to the acidic chiral hydrogen in the asymmetric center (shown, for the EM-12 analog, in Figure 3), so the plan to administer a purified single enantiomer to avoid the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> will most likely be in vain.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{performed on}} preimplantational mouse embryos showed that copper ”in excess” administered to pregnant mouse {{females in the}} first 4 days of gestational period, followed by recovery of embryos at 12 hours after last administration has no <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effect.</b> In these experiments, the embryos were examined before implantation, meaning that the evaluation was made at a short time after the last administration of CuCl 2.

25|$|Hence, while {{initially}} considered safe, {{the drug}} was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide {{was taken off the}} market due to massive pressure from the press and public. Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in West Germany. The regulatory authorities in East Germany did not approve thalidomide. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs {{did not have to be}} tested for <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects.</b> They had been tested on rodents only, as was usual at the time.|$|E
25|$|Discontinuing benzodiazepines or {{antidepressants}} abruptly due {{to concerns}} of <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of the medications {{has a high}} risk of causing serious complications, so is not recommended. For example, abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepines or antidepressants has {{a high risk of}} causing extreme withdrawal symptoms, including suicidal ideation and a severe rebound effect of the return of the underlying disorder if present. This can lead to hospitalisation and potentially, suicide. One study reported one-third of mothers who suddenly discontinued or very rapidly tapered their medications became acutely suicidal due to 'unbearable symptoms'. One woman had a medical abortion, as she felt she could no longer cope, and another woman used alcohol in a bid to combat the withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines. The study reported physicians generally are not aware of the severe consequences of abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Incremental {{health risk}} is the {{increased}} risk that a receptor (normally {{a human being}} living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of incremental health risk is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, <b>teratogenic)</b> <b>effects</b> and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected rate of increase in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected rate of increase is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist {{at the same time}} causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking.|$|E

40|$|Sodium arsenate induces {{developmental}} malformations in {{a variety}} of experimental animals. In the golden hamster, the intravenous (or intraperitoneal) administration of 20 mg/kg of sodium arsenate during day 8 to 9 of gestation induces a rather specific spectrum of congenital malformations. This period corresponds to the period of very rapid differentiation and major organogenesis in this animal. The spectrum of defects produced by arsenate in the hamster includes exencephaly, encephaloceles, skeletal defects, and malformations of the genito-urinary system. This <b>teratogenic</b> <b>effect</b> can be significantly reduced by the simultaneous administration of selenium. Recent studies in this laboratory have demonstrated the permeability of the placenta to 74 As during the early critical stages of embryogenesis and the distribution of this isotope in maternal, placental and embryonic tissues.
