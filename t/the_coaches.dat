30|$|In {{line with}} the extant {{commitment}} literature, we conceptualize commitment to <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> as a strong belief in the goals and values (normative); a willingness to exert considerable effort on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> (affective); and {{a strong desire to}} continue working (continuance) with <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> (Mowday et al. 1979; Sturges et al. 2005). In this manner, commitment refers to a sense of duty that a student-athlete feels to achieve <b>the</b> <b>coach’s</b> goals and to the willingness to do what is needed to perform well (Kline and Peters 1991). Such cohesion and identification with <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> emerges, for instance, when <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> properly demonstrates leadership in leading the team to success (Carron et al. 2002).|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms that one can do to practice co-coaching. One form involves each individual taking turns to be coach in half hour sessions.

During this time, <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> practices their <b>coaching</b> techniques, while <b>the</b> coachee ultimately gives feedback to <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> on how they are doing (both good and bad). After <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> finishes, <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> becomes <b>the</b> coachee and the previous coachee becomes <b>the</b> <b>coach.</b> This process of half hour sessions utilizes a quick feedback tool for self development in coaching.
