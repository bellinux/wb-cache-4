5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Cornerstone article, English Heritage stepped in to begin legal proceedings that would lead to the compulsory purchase of the barn. It carried out emergency repairs of the barn in November 2009, without the owners' consent, under an Urgent Works Notice. The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works, declassifying the barn from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building. This enabled the notice <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> more speedily, overriding the owners' objections.|$|E

5|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, {{the penny}} was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic {{shortage}} of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for circulation, and the copper penny continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> until 1860.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{apartheid}}, when apartheid legislation {{had been}} repealed, Springbok colours started <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> to non-whites again. In 1994, following the election of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress, the National Colours Board {{was set up to}} control the distribution of Springbok colours. Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours following the replacement of the Springbok by the Protea following a government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

To begin demobilization, the AFL Chief of Staff published Special Orders No. 1 on January 1, 1998, demobilizing and retiring 2,250 personnel. The demobilization process was delayed and badly managed, and only on April 22, 1998 did payments began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> to the demobilizing personnel, without prior explanation of what exactly the payments represented.|$|E

5|$|Springbok colours {{are only}} awarded to South Africans. Australian Eddie Jones, {{who worked as}} a {{technical}} advisor to South Africa for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> with Springbok colours as a non-South African and was obliged to wear a South Africa tracksuit when pitchside. Following South Africa's victory in the Rugby World Cup, all players and coaching team members were expected to wear their Springbok colours to the post-tournament awards dinner. In protest at Jones not being issued with colours, Bryan Habana gave Jones his Springbok colours and the team attended the awards dinner in suits instead of in Springbok colours.|$|E

5|$|The barons {{anticipated}} that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by {{the advice of the}} nobility. Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>issued</b> under his own seal. This brought into question the validity of the previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn the Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid. In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.|$|E
