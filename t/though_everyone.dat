Haddou took fifth {{in a field}} sprint at the Châteauroux Classic, behind 's Anthony Ravard. Voeckler took a podium finish at the GP Ouest-France. 's Grega Bole broke away in the final kilometer to win the race, and Simon Gerrans and Voeckler tried to bridge up to him. <b>Though</b> <b>everyone</b> in the peloton had the same time at the finish, Bole, Gerrans, and Voeckler finished {{just ahead of the}} main field, in that order to round out the podium. Voeckler also turned in the team's best ride at the Tour de la Somme, finishing ninth in the field sprint. At the Tour de Vendée, which took place not far from the team's headquarters, they had two riders take top-ten placings, Charteau in sixth and Quemeneur in seventh.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, <b>though</b> <b>everyone</b> finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E

The bridal feast is interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a stranger, the god Odin in disguise, who drives a sword into a tree-trunk. <b>Though</b> <b>everyone</b> tries to draw the sword, Volsung's son Sigmund is the only man who can do it. The disappointed Siggeir takes his new wife home, inviting Volsung to visit him. When Volsung does so he is killed by Siggeir, and his sons are taken prisoner. While in captivity they are all killed by a wolf, apart from Sigmund who escapes into the forest. Signy sends Sigmund her two sons to help him in avenging their family, but Sigmund only accepts Sinfjotli, the hardier of the two. Sigmund and Sinfjotli kill Siggeir and burn down his hall, then return to their ancestral home, the hall of the Volsungs. Sigmund marries Borghild, while Sinfjotli goes abroad with Borghild's brother, quarrels with him, and kills him. On his return Sinfjotli is poisoned by Borghild, and she is turned out by Sigmund, who instead marries Hiordis. Sigmund is killed in battle, and the pregnant Hiordis is taken to live in the hall of King Elf in Denmark.|$|E

25|$|Although Shockley {{was never}} {{diagnosed}} by psychiatrists, historians characterized Shockley's {{state of mind}} in 1956–1957 as paranoia or autism.

Even <b>though</b> <b>everyone</b> else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right ("A Cockeyed Optimist").

Even <b>though</b> <b>everyone</b> tells Jessica about Chester's continual affairs, she does not believe them until she sees his philandering with her own eyes: while out to lunch with Mary, Jessica spots Chester necking with his secretary Claire (Kathryn Reynolds). Heartbroken, she sobs in her sister's arms. On later occasions, it becomes clear Jess has always known on some level about Chester's affairs but never allowed herself to process the information.|$|E
