40|$|The Effect {{of various}} NaCl levels on <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> content <b>of</b> trace elements, in the {{seedlings}} of five citrus species namely: Bakraei (Citrus reteculata X C. limetta), Volkamer lemon(C. volkameriana), Sour orange(C. aurantium), Sweet lime (C. limetta) and Mexican lime(C. aurantifolia), were studied in a glasshouse, by a randomized complete block design with factorial arrangement and four replications. One-year old seedlings of each species were {{grown in the}} pots, containing native soil (pH= 8. 2) and irrigated with water supplemented with 0 (control), 20, 40 and 60 mM NaCl. At the end of experiment, the amount of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cl and B in <b>shoots</b> were determined. <b>The</b> amount of trace elements varied among the species even in the control plants (no salt). Salinity had different effects on <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> content <b>of</b> trace elements. Salinity reduced Fe content in <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> all species except in Bakraii and sweet lime and increased the amount <b>of</b> Zn in <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> all species except in Bakraii. The Mn content was reduced in the all species but increased in sour orange. Salinity reduced the amount <b>of</b> Cu in <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> volkamerina but had no effect in the other species. The amount of Cl increased in <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> all species with salinity. Boron content in <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> all species except in sour orange, increased with low salinity level but decreased with increased salinity levels. However in sour orange, salinity in the all levels decreased the amount <b>of</b> B in <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>of</b> seedlings...|$|R

5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician Gulbrand Lunde, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, such as <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>of</b> ten well-known residents of Trøndelag {{and its environs}} in October 1942. In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the Final Solution, would destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad.
