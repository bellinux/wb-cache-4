5|$|The {{reason for}} this is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> {{difference}} across a fluid interface is proportional to the mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E
5|$|By May, Harrison {{had agreed}} {{distribution}} terms with A Records {{and was therefore}} able to formally launch Dark Horse Records, although he would remain contracted to Apple as a solo artist, like the other Beatles, until January 1976. After announcing the staging of the Music Festival from India in September 1974, Harrison also confirmed {{that he planned to}} tour North America, together with Ravi Shankar's ensemble, during November and December. Despite his stated aversion to performing live, Harrison would be the first of his former bandmates to undertake a tour of Beatle-hungry America; the expectations that this created, together with his role as a hands-on record company boss, meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> on Harrison was immense.|$|E

5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E

5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship required <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> {{of both the}} lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Crisis Core {{originated}} when Hajime Tabata {{was chosen}} as director for an upcoming Final Fantasy title for the PlayStation Portable. After discussion with Tetsuya Nomura and Yoshinori Kitase, Tabata decided that the game should be another installment in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of producing a game from a popular series would motivate both the staff and himself. The original idea {{was to make a}} PlayStation Portable port of Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, as it had been released for mobile-phones and the staff wanted to expand it. However, after deciding Zack {{was going to be the}} protagonist of the new game, the idea of a Before Crisis port was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The story reveals that, long ago, the Bridge {{had been}} closed to vehicle traffic (for three years) and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to find somewhere to live had forced {{homeless}} people to seize the bridge {{and set up a}} squatters' town there.

40|$|The {{measurement}} system for <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> between <b>the</b> blade of a laryngoscope {{and the upper}} airway tract during orotracheal intubation has been investigated with a film of microcapsules.

The measurement was applied to 20 cases of the orotracheal intubation. In the pressed part of the film, the microcapsules burst and release chemicals, which react with chemicals out of microcapsules and show a red color. The color density was photoelectrically measured, and converted to <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> value in three regions on the blade; the epiglottis, the tongue, and the upper incisor. <b>The</b> results show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> are 1. 2 ± 0. 6 MPa on the epiglottis, 0. 8 ± 0. 4 MPa on the tongue, and (11 ± 3) × 10 MPa on the upper incisor, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> on <b>the</b> epiglottis are 2. 0 ± 0. 3 MPa in bled cases, and 0. 8 ± 0. 4 MPa in non-bled cases...|$|R

5|$|Around this time, and {{particularly}} after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that Walter Robins, {{one of the}} selectors, should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job. However, Robins' age counted against him; the selectors were satisfied with Yardley's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test. In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings. England lost the series 4–0. Yardley managed 150 runs {{at an average of}} 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings. However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66. Bowes believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of captaincy had affected Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Bevin's {{administration}} sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky ordering it to stop performing abortions at its clinic in Louisville {{because it did not}} have the required license. The clinic claimed it had been given permission to perform the procedures by Beshear's inspector general just prior to Bevin taking office, but nonetheless halted the procedures on January 28. Bevin filed suit against Planned Parenthood in February, claiming it had illegally performed 23 abortions without a license; the suit said Planned Parenthood's licensure application was deficient because it did not include agreements with a hospital and ambulance service to transport and care for patients in case of complications, as required by state law, and that Beshear's inspector general was wrong in instructing the organization to begin performing abortions before the license was approved. Planned Parenthood countered that, before the license could be finalized, the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection, requiring that abortions were already being performed there. In March, the University of Louisville Hospital announced that it had backed out of a transfer agreement with Planned Parenthood, saying it had been pressured to do so and felt that its state funding was in jeopardy by continuing in the agreement. A spokesman for Bevin denied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> had come from anyone in the administration.|$|E
5|$|Radar {{was also}} {{employed}} {{to determine the}} size of the hurricane's eye, stated to be roughly 13mi (20km) in diameter, following a 6-mile (10km) decrease due to the strengthening. Light wind shear surrounding the hurricane allowed further strengthening to take place. Late on August2, the system attained winds of 135mph (215km/h), making it a Category4 storm. During the afternoon of August3, Guillermo nearly attained Category5 intensity as it reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) along with a barometric pressure estimated at 925mbar (hPa; 27.32inHg). A brief period of weakening took place later that day before further strengthening ensued. Late on August4, Guillermo intensified into a Category5 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h). Operational analysis of satellite information indicated a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg); however, post-storm studies stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> was more likely around 919mbar (hPa; 27.14inHg).|$|E

5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E
