5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, {{is filled}} with whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must retain their heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} to gaze at the stars. The position of the fish allows <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>that</b> is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E

Brown pelicans and other coastal birds were found on the beaches covered in oil, and despite the best efforts of volunteers, over 250 birds did not survive their ordeal. Other marine species, such as razor clams, were also thought to be in danger.|$|E

Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they got me oil. I tell you I was mad, mad clean through. We needed water for ourselves and for our cattle to drink." ...|$|E

The company leveraged its international drilling experience to other areas of the world, and by mid-1943 had established a presence in the eastern oil fields of Venezuela as Mene Grande Oil Company. Much of the company's retail sales expansion was through the acquisition of privately owned chains of filling stations in various countries, allowing Gulf outlets to sell product (sometimes through [...] "matching" [...] arrangements) from <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "lifting" [...] in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, Kuwait, and Venezuela. Some of these acquisitions were to prove less than resilient in the face of economic and political developments from the 1970s on. Gulf invested heavily in product technology and developed many specialty products, particularly for application in the maritime and aviation engineering sectors. It was particularly noted for its range of lubricants and greases.|$|E

2500|$|While glass fuses {{have the}} {{advantage}} of a fuse element visible for inspection purposes, they have a low breaking capacity (interrupting rating), which generally restricts them to applications of 15 A or less at 250 VAC. Ceramic fuses {{have the advantage}} of a higher breaking capacity, facilitating their use in circuits with higher current and voltage. Filling a fuse body with sand provides additional cooling of the arc and increases the breaking capacity of the fuse. [...] Medium-voltage fuses may have liquid-filled envelopes to assist in the extinguishing of the arc. Some types of distribution switchgear use fuse links immersed in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>that</b> fills the equipment.|$|E

The pollutants escaped from the dumping ground through the esker around it, and with ground and surface waters flowed further into the small wood below it. From there it flowed through ditches of the fields and the Mustapuro brook to the vicinity of the Marjaniemi allotment garden and on to the sea near the Marjaniemi public beach. Helsingin Sanomat reported this in July 1957 in an article headed [...] "Waste oil destroys woods in Herttoniemi". The article noted: ...|$|E

[...] "You're {{right in the center}} where the best wheat grows and you've got your share of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>that</b> flows," [...] his lyrics read. These were the early staples of the Enid economy. Enid's economy saw oil booms and agricultural growth {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. The Great Depression, however, caused both of these staples to lose value, and many businesses in Enid closed. However, Enid recovered, prospering and growing in population until a second wave of bad economic times hit in the 1980s, when competition with the local mall and economic factors led Enid's downtown area to suffer. Since 1994, Enid's Main Street program has worked to refurbish historic buildings, boost the local economy, and initiate local events such as first Friday concerts and holiday celebrations on the town square.|$|E

And the Sages calculated that a half-log of oil (roughly 5 ounces) would burn from evening to morning. The Gemara reported that some said that they calculated this by reducing the original quantity of oil, first filling each lamp with a large quantity of oil and on finding in the morning that there was still oil in the lamp, gradually reducing the quantity until they arrived at a half-log. [...] Others said that they calculated it by increasing it, first filling the lamp with a small quantity of oil and the next evening increasing the quantity of oil until they arrived at the standard of the half-log. [...] Those who said that they calculated it by increasing the quantity of oil said that the Torah has consideration for the Israelites' resources and to calculate by using the larger quantity of oil in the first instance wasted <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>that</b> was still in the lamp in the morning.
