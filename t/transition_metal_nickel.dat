40|$|The <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>nickel</b> plays {{a central}} role in the human gastric {{pathogen}} Helicobacter pylori because it is required for two enzymes indispensable for colonization, the nickel metalloenzyme urease and [NiFe] hydrogenase. To sustain nickel availability for these metalloenzymes while providing protection from the metal's harmful effects, H. pylori is equipped with several specific nickel-binding proteins. Among these, H. pylori possesses a particular chaperone, HspA, that is a homolog of the highly conserved and essential bacterial heat shock protein GroES. HspA contains a unique His-rich C-terminal extension and was demonstrated to bind nickel in vitro. To investigate the function of this extension in H. pylori, we constructed mutants carrying either a complete deletion or point mutations in critical residues of this domain. All mutants presented a decreased intracellular nickel content measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and reduced nickel tolerance. While urease activity was unaffected in the mutants, [NiFe] hydrogenase activity was significantly diminished when the C-terminal extension of HspA was mutated. We conclude that H. pylori HspA is involved in intracellular nickel sequestration and detoxification and plays a novel role as a specialized nickel chaperone involved in nickel-dependent maturation of hydrogenase...|$|E

40|$|Helicobacter pylori is {{dependent}} upon {{the production of the}} highly abundant and active metalloenzyme urease for colonization of the human stomach. Thus, H. pylori has an absolute requirement for the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>nickel,</b> a required cofactor for urease. To investigate the contribution of genes that are factors in this process, microarray analysis comparing the transcriptome of wild-type H. pylori 26695 cultured in brucella broth containing fetal calf serum (BBF) alone or supplemented with 100 μM NiCl 2 suggested that HP 1512 is repressed in the presence of 100 μM supplemental nickel. When measured by comparative real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), HP 1512 transcription was reduced 43 -fold relative to the value for the wild type when cultured in BBF supplemented with 10 μM NiCl 2. When grown in unsupplemented BBF, urease activity of an HP 1512 ::cat mutant was significantly reduced compared to the wild type, 4. 9 ± 0. 5 μmol/min/mg of protein (n = 7) and 17. 1 ± 4. 9 μmol/min/mg of protein (n = 13), respectively (P < 0. 0001). In silico analysis of the HP 1511 -HP 1512 (HP 1511 - 1512) intergenic region identified a putative NikR operator upstream of HP 1512. Gel shift analysis with purified recombinant NikR verified nickel-dependent binding of H. pylori NikR to the HP 1511 - 1512 intergenic region. Furthermore, comparative real-time qPCR of four nickel-related genes suggests that mutation of HP 1512 results in reduced intracellular nickel concentration relative to wild-type H. pylori 26695. Taken together, these data suggest that HP 1512 encodes a NikR-nickel-regulated outer membrane protein...|$|E
40|$|The <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>nickel</b> (Ni) is {{critical}} for the pathogenicity ofHelicobacter pylori. Indeed the element is a required compo-nent of two enzymes, hydrogenase and urease, that {{have been shown to}} be important for in vivo colonization of the host gastric mucosa. Urease accounts for up to 10 % of the total cellularH. pylori protein content, and therefore the bacterial Ni demand is very high. H. pylori possess two small and abundant histidine-rich, Ni-binding proteins, Hpn and Hpn-like, whose physiological role in the host have not been investigated. In this study, special husbandry conditions were used to control Ni levels in the host (mouse), including the use of Ni-free versus Ni-supplemented food. The efficacy of each diet was confirmed bymeasuring the Ni concentrations in sera of mice fed with either diet. Colonization levels (based on rank tests) of thehpnhpn-like double mu-tants isolated from the mice provided Ni-deficient chow were statistically lower than those for mice given Ni in their diet. In con-trast,H. pyloriwild-type colonization levels were similar in both host groups (e. g., regardless of Ni levels). Our results indicate that the gastric pathogenH. pylori can utilize stored Ni via defined histidine-rich proteins to aid colonization of the host. Helicobacter pylori is a spiral, Gram-negative, microaerophilicbacterium that has been shown to be the etiological agent of chronic atrophic gastritis and peptic ulcers (1), which can eventu-ally develop into gastric cancers (2).

40|$|This present thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of active olefin polymerization catalysts based on late <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> (<b>nickel</b> and iron) imino-pyridine complexes supported on nanomaterial. Chapter I gives a comprehensive literature review of unsupported and supported ethylene polymerization catalyst. In Chapter II we report the ethylene polymerization studies using nickel complexes containing an –NH 2 group for covalent immobilization on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) of the corresponding precatalysts. Comparison of the homogeneous catalysts with their supported counterparts evidenced higher catalytic activity and higher molecular weights for the polymers produced. In Chapter III, iron complexes containing a pyrene group have been synthesized and immobilized on MWCNTs through non-covalent π-π interactions between pyrene group and surface of MWCNTs. Activated by MMAO, both the iron complexes and immobilized catalysts show high activities for ethylene polymerization. It was possible to evidence that MWCNTs have a great influence on the catalytic activity and on the structure of the resulting polyethylenes. Imino-pyridine nickel complexes containing various kinds of aromatic groups have been synthesized in Chapter IV and polymerization conditions in the presence {{and in the absence of}} nanocarbon materials, such as MWCNTs or few layer graphene (FLG), are discussed. For those nickel catalysts bearing 1 -aryliminoethylpyridine ligands, the presence of MWCNTs in the catalytic mixture allows the formation of waxes of lower molecular weight and polydispersity, whereas the presence of FLG proved to be beneficial for the catalytic activity. In Chapter V, isoprene polymerization catalyzed by iron complexes containing polyaromatic groups and non-covalently supported on nanoparticles and confined into the inner cavity of MWCNTs (Cat@NPs and Cat@NPs@MWCNTs) are investigated. Iron complexes show excellent activity for the isoprene polymerization and produced high glass temperature polyisoprene with a high trans- 1, 4 -polyisoprene selectivity.

40|$|The <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>nickel</b> is an {{essential}} cofactor {{for a number of}} bacterial enzymes, one of which is urease. Prior to its incorporation into metalloenzyme active sites, nickel must be imported into the cell. Here, we report identification of two loci corresponding to nickel-specific transport systems in the gram-negative, ureolytic bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The loci are located {{on each side of the}} chromosomal urease gene cluster ureABCEFGD and have the same orientation as the latter. The yntABCDE locus upstream of the ure genes encodes five predicted products with sequence homology to ATP-binding cassette nickel permeases present in several gram-negative bacteria. The ureH gene, located downstream of ure, encodes a single-component carrier which displays homology to polypeptides of the nickel-cobalt transporter family. Transporters with homology to these two classes are also present (again in proximity to the urease locus) in the other two pathogenic yersiniae, Y. pestis and Y. enterocolitica. An Escherichia coli nikA insertion mutant recovered nickel uptake ability following heterologous complementation with either the ynt or the ureH plasmid-borne gene of Y. pseudotuberculosis, demonstrating that each carrier is necessary and sufficient for nickel transport. Deletion of ynt in Y. pseudotuberculosis almost completely abolished bacterial urease activity, whereas deletion of ureH had no effect. Nevertheless, rates of nickel transport were significantly altered in both ynt and ureH mutants. Furthermore, the ynt ureH double mutant was totally devoid of nickel uptake ability, thus indicating that Ynt and UreH constitute the only routes for nickel entry. Both Ynt and UreH show selectivity for Ni 2 + ions. This is the first reported identification of genes coding for both kinds of nickel-specific permeases situated adjacent to the urease gene cluster in the genome of a microorganism...|$|E
40|$|The <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>nickel</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in gastric colonization and persistence of the important human pathogen Helicobacter pylori, as it is the cofactor of the abundantly produced acid resistance factor urease. Nickel uptake through the inner membrane is mediated by the NixA protein, and the expression of NixA is controlled by the NikR regulatory protein. Here we report that NikR also controls the nickel-responsive expression of the FecA 3 (HP 1400) and FrpB 4 (HP 1512) outer membrane proteins (OMPs), as well as the nickel-responsive expression of an ExbB-ExbD-TonB system, which may function in energization of outer membrane transport. Transcription and expression of the frpB 4 and fecA 3 genes were repressed by nickel in wild-type H. pylori 26695, but they were independent of nickel and derepressed in an isogenic nikR mutant. Both the frpB 4 and fecA 3 genes were transcribed from a promoter directly upstream of their start codon. Regulation by NikR was mediated via nickel-dependent binding to specific operators overlapping either the + 1 or − 10 sequence in the frpB 4 and fecA 3 promoters, respectively, and these operators contained sequences resembling the proposed H. pylori NikR recognition sequence (TATWATT-N 11 -AATWATA). Transcription of the HP 1339 - 1340 - 1341 operon encoding the ExbB 2 -ExbD 2 -TonB 2 complex was also regulated by nickel and NikR, but not by Fur and iron. In conclusion, H. pylori NikR controls nickel-responsive expression of the HP 1400 (FecA 3) and HP 1512 (FrpB 4) OMPs. We hypothesize that these two NikR-regulated OMPs may participate in the uptake of complexed nickel ions and that this process is energized by the NikR-regulated ExbB 2 -ExbD 2 -TonB 2 system, another example of the specific adaptation of H. pylori to the gastric lifestyle...|$|E

The faces of all four elements have the same dimensions so that a geometry similar to Fresnel zones can be achieved. A method of calculating the efficiency of wave front splitting interferometers is derived, permitting the optimisation of their efficiency.

40|$|Metal {{affinity}} tags {{have been}} fused to proteins and demonstrated {{to function as}} tools in protein purification, protein stabilisation, quantitative metal analysis and metal tolerance of bacteria and plants. In biotechnological applications proteins frequently have to function in nonnatural environments with harsh conditions which impose requirements for high stability on the proteins. Metal affinity tags fused to the N-terminal of lactate dehydrogenase increased {{the stability of the}} enzyme under thermal and urea denaturing conditions in the presence of metal ions. Metal affinity tags have frequently been used in purification of proteins with immobilised metal affinity chromatography. The most commonly used tag contains six consecutive histidines. Other tags comprising less histidines may offer less impact on protein activity, stability and expression level. Moreover, a higher degree of selectivity and thus purity may be obtained. A tag folding into an a-helix with surface exposed histidines (His-X 3 -His-X 3 -His), where X is any amino acid, was fused to the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and expressed in tobacco. The amount of lactate dehydrogenase produced in transgenic tobacco was increased as compared to a His 6 tagged enzyme. Plants can be used as bioreactors for the production of technical and industrially interesting enzymes. The applicability of producing enzymes in plants is partly determined by the availability of a good purification method. His tagged lactate dehydrogenase was produced in transgenic tobacco and the enzymes could be purified from a crude extract with metal affinity chromatography and metal affinity precipitation. His tagged glucose isomerase was expressed in transgenic potato tubers and the fructose levels were increased in the tubers. Pollution of heavy metals is an increasing environmental problem. The use of micro-organisms and plants for bioremediation has been proposed as an alternative to conventional methods. By expressing metal binding proteins and peptides in bacteria and plants the metal tolerance or accumulation of the organism can be increased. A cadmium binding hexapeptide, His-Ser-Gln-Lys-Val-Phe, was selected from a phage display peptide library. Expression of this peptide on the surface or intracellularly increased the metal tolerance of Escherichia coli. The cadmium binding peptide fused to the N-terminal of green fluorescent protein also endowed tobacco plants with an increased cadmium tolerance. Metal affinity tags fused to green fluorescent protein was demonstrated to function in quantification of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> (<b>nickel,</b> copper and zinc) and cadmium ions.

For functional annotation of genes, we used two comparative genomic approaches: identification of regulatory signals and analysis of the genomic positions of genes encoding candidate nickel/cobalt transporters. The nickel-responsive repressor NikR regulates many nickel uptake systems, though the NikR-binding signal is divergent in various taxonomic groups of bacteria and archaea. B 12 riboswitches regulate most of the candidate cobalt transporters in bacteria. The nickel/cobalt transporter genes are often colocalized with genes for nickel-dependent or coenzyme B 12 biosynthesis enzymes. Nickel/cobalt transporters of different families, including the previously known NiCoT, UreH, and HupE/UreJ families of secondary systems and the NikABCDE ABC-type transporters, showed a mosaic distribution in prokaryotic genomes.

Agreement was obtained for larger clusters with n> 10 when the dynamic polarization was taken into account, emphasizing the multielectron nature of the ionization suppression.

40|$|Abstract. - Intermetallic {{compounds}} {{with low}} densities and high melting temperatures are prime structural material candidates for advanced heat engines. The close link between crystal structure and mechanical properties {{has led the}} search for new cubic pseudo-binary <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> aluminides. Compositing leads the way for improved mechanical properties of refractory metal silicides. In all cases {{there is a strong}} competition for oxide scale frequency between the energetic oxide formers of the intermetallic compounds. In the case of titanium aluminides, efforts are directed towards modification of the concentration of oxygen vacancies to reduce growth rates and influence scale dominance. Glass formers are added to the disilicides to pro-mote scale fluidity to seal cracks which are pathways for oxidation. 1. Introduction. The most successful intermetallics are coatings. The most successful coatings are the inter-metallics based upon the aluminides of the <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> notably <b>nickel,</b> cobalt and iron. The remarkable growth of the gas turbine superalloys is based in part upon the ability of the material engineer to concentrate efforts to improve mechanical properties and emplo...|$|R
50|$|The {{filler metal}} (FM) alloys {{that can be}} {{produced}} as amorphous brazing foils (ABF) are eutectic compositions formed by <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> such as <b>nickel,</b> iron, copper, etc., in combination with metalloids, such as silicon, boron and phosphorus. In conventional crystalline state, all these materials are inherently brittle and cannot be produced in continuous forms such as foil, wire, etc. Therefore, they were available only as powders, pastes, or their derivates. On the other hand, the very presence of metalloids {{at or near the}} eutectic concentration promotes the rapid solidification (RS) conversion of such alloys into a ductile amorphous foil.|$|R

The importance of these reactions is reflected in the patents for the ARCO and Halcon processes from the late 19602 ̆ 7 s. It is very difficult to find literature that shows other indications for metal dioxo complexes. Catalytic olefin dimerization has become significant in the realm of green chemistry for 2 ̆ 2 atom economical 2 ̆ 2 reactions. Many <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> have been examined as catalysts for olefin dimerization, but the largest volume of work has been performed using group 8 <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> particularly <b>nickel,</b> palladium and platinum. This is especially true for the specific case of styrene dimerization. Herein, we wish to report the synthesis and X-ray crystal structure for Cp*W(=O) 2 CH 3 (1), as well as the X-ray crystal structure for Cp*W(CO) 3 CH 3 (2). The tungsten dioxo complex (1) was found to have high selectivity for the dimerization of some para-substituted styrenes, yielding the desired trans- 1, 3 -diaryl- 1 -butene products. We also wish to report the X-ray crystal structure of trans- 1, 3 -di-(4 -bromophenyl) - 1 -butene which helped to confirm the structure of our products...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{microscopic}} model that explains quenching of the magnetization of ferromagnetic <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> such as <b>nickel</b> within a picosecond after laser excitation. Our model describes {{the interactions between}} a Fermi sea of (spinless) electrons, an ensemble of two level oscillators representing the phonon system, and a magnetic degree of freedom described by the Weiss model. An Elliot–Yafet type of spin-flip probability aEY is included for each electron–phonon (e–p) scattering event. We show {{that even though the}} demagnetization in our model is mediated by phonon scattering, it is possible to obtain a demagnetization time that is shorter than the e–p equilibration (and even thermalization) time...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Molecularly {{targeted}} research and diagnostic tools {{are essential to}} advancing understanding and detection of many diseases. Metals often impart the desired functionality to these tools, and conjugation of high-affinity chelators to proteins is carried out to enable targeted delivery of the metal. This approach has been much more effective with large lanthanide series <b>metals</b> than smaller <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> Because chemical conjugation requires additional processing and purification steps and yields a heterogeneous mixture of products, inline incorporation of a peptide tag capable of metal binding is a highly preferable alternative. Development of a <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> binding tag would provide opportunity to greatly expand metal-based analyses. The metal abstraction peptide (MAP) sequence was genetically engineered into recombinant protein to generate the claMP Tag. The effects of this tag on recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) protein expression, disulfide bond formation, tertiary structural integrity, and <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> incorporation using <b>nickel</b> were examined to confirm the viability of utilizing the MAP sequence t...|$|R
