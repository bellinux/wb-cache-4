5|$|Sometime in April or May, De Soto's crew began {{coming down}} with yellow fever and the steamer was sent north in early June, {{arriving}} at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 16 June. As per normal practice, the warship was decommissioned that same day and the crew quarantined until the fever burned out. On 12 January 1865, De Soto was sent to Baltimore, Maryland for the installation of new boilers. She was still <b>there</b> <b>when</b> the war ended on 9 April 1865.|$|E

This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing Frankenstein. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed <b>there</b> <b>when</b> not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E
5|$|A {{man from}} Northern Ireland was {{discussed}} in the media {{in connection with the}} disappearance. After being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was <b>there</b> <b>when</b> Madeleine went missing. He died in 2013. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning.

5|$|A western rock lobster fishery {{developed}} {{on the island}} in the early 20th century. There are records of the island {{being used as a}} base for crayfishers as early as 1902, and for many years it was used as an anchorage by anglers. It was not until 1947, however, that a seasonally inhabited permanent camp was established there. According to former crayfisher Ron Bertelsen, the first camp was established by skippers George Barker and George Nelson and deckhand John Long, who relocated <b>there</b> <b>when</b> lobsters around Pigeon Island grew scarce. They camped {{at the southern end of}} North Island in a camp initially built from packing case timbers. A local carrier boat, the Betty Margaret, serviced the camp. From about 40 seasonal inhabitants in 1940, the population grew to about 130 by 2003. An airstrip was built in 1979.|$|E
5|$|After working up, Pioneer sailed for Australia on 30 March 1945.

Pioneer arrived in Hong Kong in late September {{to help with the}} rebuilding of the colony's infrastructure. Her sailors restored power, telephone service and repaired trains and buses. She made one trip back to Manus, but was back in Hong Kong in late November. The ship sailed for Sydney the following month and departed for the UK on 17 February 1946. Upon her arrival, she was placed in reserve. Pioneer was sold to Thos W Ward for scrap in September 1954 and broken up in Inverkeithing.|$|E
5|$|Banksia epica {{is known}} only from two {{population}}s in eastern {{parts of the}} Esperance Plains region of the South West Botanical Province, near {{the western edge of}} the Great Australian Bight.

A smaller population occurs about 70 kilometres (45mi) further east at Toolinna Cove; when surveyed in August 1991, this locality had around 350 plants. This latter population represents the easternmost limit of the western Banksia species; east of Toolinna Cove no Banksia species occurs for over 900 kilometres (550mi).|$|E
