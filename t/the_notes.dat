5|$|Silcott {{was arrested}} for Blakelock's murder on 12 October 1985, six days after the riot; he was interviewed five times over 24 hours, Det Ch Supt Melvin asking the {{questions}} and Detective Inspector Maxwell Dingle taking <b>the</b> <b>notes.</b> During the first four interviews, he stayed mostly silent and refused to sign the detectives' notes, but during the fifth interview on 13 October, when Melvin said he knew Silcott had struck Blakelock with a machete or sword, his demeanour changed, according to <b>the</b> <b>notes.</b>|$|E
50|$|A turn {{is a short}} figure {{consisting}} of <b>the</b> <b>note</b> above <b>the</b> one indicated, <b>the</b> <b>note</b> itself, <b>the</b> <b>note</b> below <b>the</b> one indicated, and <b>the</b> <b>note</b> itself again. It {{is marked by a}} mirrored S-shape lying on its side above the staff.|$|R
50|$|An {{inverted}} turn (<b>the</b> <b>note</b> below <b>the</b> one indicated, <b>the</b> <b>note</b> itself, <b>the</b> <b>note</b> above it, and <b>the</b> <b>note</b> itself again) {{is usually}} indicated {{by putting a}} short vertical line through the normal turn sign, though sometimes the sign itself is turned upside down.|$|R
50|$|Trills {{may also}} be played {{beginning}} on <b>the</b> <b>note</b> above <b>the</b> one indicated (<b>the</b> auxiliary <b>note).</b> Additionally, a trill is often ended by playing <b>the</b> <b>note</b> below <b>the</b> one indicated followed by <b>the</b> <b>note</b> itself.|$|R
5|$|The Chiremba Balancing Rocks near Harare is {{the main}} artwork used for obverse sides {{of the first two}} {{banknote}} designs of the first Zimbabwean dollar. Notes of these design also feature on either side major landmarks and landscapes such as the Kariba Dam and fauna. As hyperinflation took hold {{at the end of the}} 20th century the quality of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> deteriorated as printing plates from previous issues were reconstituted for printing emergency notes. Although <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> of the first design were gradually phased out from 1997, all remaining notes of the first dollar were forcibly demonetised on 22 August 2006.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>notes</b> had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} {{security}} measures to identify forgeries. These were often {{assumed to be}} printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore an alphanumeric serial designation and the signature of the Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. Prior {{to the release of}} any notes by the Bank of England, all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> circulated back through the bank.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>note</b> is {{held against}} the light, the printed {{areas on the}} back of <b>the</b> <b>note</b> fill <b>the</b> {{unprinted}} areas on the front of <b>the</b> <b>note.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{banknotes}} {{have clearly}} contrasting, striking colours. <b>The</b> €5 <b>note</b> is grey, <b>the</b> €10 <b>note</b> red, <b>the</b> €20 <b>note</b> blue, <b>the</b> €50 <b>note</b> orange, <b>the</b> €100 <b>note</b> green, <b>the</b> €200 <b>note</b> yellow and <b>the</b> €500 <b>note</b> is purple.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>note</b> is {{held up to}} the light, printed {{areas on}} the back of <b>the</b> <b>note</b> fill {{unprinted}} areas on the front of <b>the</b> <b>note</b> to form <b>the</b> value '500'.|$|R
5|$|To age <b>the</b> <b>notes,</b> between 40 and 50 prisoners {{stood in}} two columns and passed <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> among them to {{accumulate}} dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some {{of the prisoners}} would fold and refold <b>the</b> <b>notes,</b> others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark {{the value of a}} bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|As Secretary of Administration and Finance, Baker was a main {{architect}} of the Big Dig financing plan. In 1997 {{the federal government was}} planning to cut funding for the Big Dig by $300 million per year. The state set up a trust and sold Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs) to investors. <b>The</b> <b>notes</b> were secured by promising future federal highway funds. As federal highway dollars are awarded to Massachusetts, the money is used to pay off the GANs.|$|E

5|$|Enron {{capitalized}} the Raptors, and, in {{a manner}} similar to the accounting employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|E
5|$|From 1978 until 1988, {{an image}} of Newton {{designed}} by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England). Newton was shown on the reverse of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and {{a map of the}} Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Hell money: Hell {{money is}} a form of joss paper printed to {{resemble}} fake legal tender bank notes. <b>The</b> <b>notes</b> are not an official form of recognized currency or legal tender since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors financial problems. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, Rand made {{notes for}} a proposed, but never written, novel titled The Little Street. Rand's notes for it contain {{elements}} that {{carried over into}} her work on The Fountainhead. David Harriman, who edited <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> for the posthumously published Journals of Ayn Rand (1997), described the story's villain as a preliminary version of the character Ellsworth Toohey, and this villain's assassination by the protagonist as prefiguring the attempted assassination of Toohey.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Laucke {{signed with}} the Waterloo Music Publishing Company, which that year {{published}} the sheet music of his transcription of Trois Gymnopédies, {{the first of many}} of his transcriptions to be published by Waterloo and arguably the only version for guitar to include all of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> of the original piano composition. In 1985, the company created The Michael Laucke Series of guitar arrangements and transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{two giant}} murals of Evita were {{unveiled}} {{on the building}} facades of the current Ministry of Social Development, located on 9 de Julio Avenue. The works were painted by Argentine artist Alejandro Marmo. On 26 July 2012, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Evita's death, notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos. The controversial effigy of Julio Argentino Roca was replaced by that of Eva Duarte, making her the first actual woman to be featured on the currency of Argentina. The image in <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> {{is based on a}} 1952 design, whose sketch was found in the Mint, made by the engraver Sergio Pilosio with artist Roger Pfund. The printing totals 20 million notes; {{it is not clear whether}} the government will replace <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> that feature Roca and the Desert Campaign.|$|E

5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not to stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed <b>the</b> <b>notes,</b> and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E
5|$|In tone clusters, <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> are sounded {{fully and}} in unison, {{distinguishing}} them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect {{also tends to}} be different: where ornamentation is used {{to draw attention to}} the harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, tone clusters are for the most part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), a tone cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen are contributing to the cluster.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the policy}} of the Bank of England to redeem all {{withdrawn}} notes for current currency at the face value shown on the note, except for counterfeit currency. Examples of counterfeits from Operation Bernhard have appeared at auction and been sold through dealers for a higher face value than the original £5. There are also examples of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> in the museum of the National Bank of Belgium and the Bank of England Museum.|$|E
50|$|A trill {{provides}} rhythmic interest, melodic interest, and—through dissonance—harmonic interest. Sometimes it {{is expected}} that the trill will end with a turn (by sounding <b>the</b> <b>note</b> below rather than <b>the</b> <b>note</b> above <b>the</b> principal <b>note,</b> immediately before <b>the</b> last sounding of <b>the</b> principal <b>note),</b> or some other variation. Such variations are often marked with a few appoggiaturas following <b>the</b> <b>note</b> that bears <b>the</b> trill indication.|$|R
