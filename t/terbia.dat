5000|$|Erbium (for Ytterby, {{a village}} in Sweden) was {{discovered}} by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843. Mosander was working {{with a sample of}} what was thought to be the single metal oxide yttria, derived from the mineral gadolinite. He discovered that the sample contained at least two metal oxides in addition to pure yttria, which he named [...] "erbia" [...] and [...] "terbia" [...] after the village of Ytterby where the gadolinite had been found. Mosander was not certain of the purity of the oxides and later tests confirmed his uncertainty. Not only did the [...] "yttria" [...] contain yttrium, erbium, and terbium; in the ensuing years, chemists, geologists and spectroscopists discovered five additional elements: ytterbium, scandium, thulium, holmium, and gadolinium. [...] Erbia and <b>terbia,</b> however, were confused at this time. A spectroscopist mistakenly switched the names of the two elements during spectroscopy. After 1860, <b>terbia</b> was renamed erbia and after 1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed <b>terbia.</b> Fairly pure Er2O3 was independently isolated in 1905 by Georges Urbain and Charles James. Reasonably pure metal wasn't produced until 1934 when Klemm and Bommer reduced the anhydrous chloride with potassium vapor. It was only in the 1990s that the price for Chinese-derived erbium oxide became low enough for erbium to be considered for use as a colorant in art glass.|$|E

30|$|The {{synthesis}} of nanopowders of <b>terbia</b> compounds with scandia, yttria, and lutetia {{was carried out}} using a self-propagating high-temperature synthesis method involving a mixture of nitrates of metals and glycine as a precursor. The nanopowder phase transformations were investigated using X-ray diffraction analysis. It was found that lutetia has a negligible effect on the phase formation in <b>terbia.</b> On the other hand, yttrium and scandium ions significantly suppressed crystallization. The densification kinetics of nanopowders of the Tb 2 O 3 compounds and the microstructure of ceramics after microwave sintering were studied using dilatometry and scanning electron microscopy. The introduction of scandia, yttria, or lutetia contributed to the intensification of the densification of the <b>terbia</b> ceramics when heated in a microwave field. Near full-density materials of <b>terbia</b> solid solutions with lutetia and yttria were obtained at about 1600 – 1640 °C. The ceramics of scandia–terbia compounds contained the second phase, which causes light scattering.|$|E

The films were grown on quartz optical polished substrates heated at 800 degrees C by EB-PVD codeposition. EXAFS and XANES spectroscopies were used for determining the local structure around the lanthanide ion, whereas thin film XRD and HREM were employed to characterize the bulk microstructure. For a given dopant and concentration, the light emissions {{were found to be}} more intense for films having scandia as host.

40|$|Rare earth oxides in {{combination}} with transition metals are under intense investigation due to their versatile catalytic properties. Even though especially ceria is already successfully used in today's catalytic converters, many fundamental aspects of their active role in catalytic processes are still unclear. Using well-defined metal-on-oxide and so-called inverse oxide-on-metal model catalysts is a widely accepted approach to gain insights into the active nature of rare earth oxides. Whereas the preparation of (111) oriented rare earth oxide inverse model catalysts are quite standard today, the synthesis of inverse model catalysts with different orientations, which are suspected to be different in activity and selectivity in chemical reactions, on well established transition metal surfaces is still challenging. Enabled by time-resolved low-energy electron microscopy the reactive growth of the rare earth oxides of cerium and terbium on Cu(111) {{as well as the}} growth of ceria on Ru(0001) are investigated. Both oxides grow on the Cu(111) surface in a Volmer-Weber growth mode but in two different orientations: ceria islands exhibit (100) and (111) oriented surfaces, <b>terbia</b> islands grow in (112) and (111) orientation. It is demonstrated that growth of CeO 2 (100) on Cu(111) depends on the Ce/O ratio on the substrate surface, permitting the exclusive growth of CeO 2 (100) in the low Ce/O regime and exclusive growth of CeO 2 (111) in the high regime. In case of <b>terbia</b> a favorable lattice matching enabled by a coincidence of the TbOx (112) unit cell with the Cu(111) unit cell was supposed to facilitate formation of the high- index surface. In addition, the emergence of CeO 2 (100) on Ru(0001) is presented, which is also attributed to the local oxygen chemical potential. These findings illustrate {{that it is possible to}} manipulate the orientation of rare earth oxide surfaces, which can be applied to synthesize new kinds of model catalysts. The reactivity and selectivity of ceria not only depends on the orientation of the ceria surface but also on the presence of oxygen vacancies. Thus stable phases and phase transitions from CeO 2 to Ce 2 O 3 are of special interest to understand cerias catalytic properties. Observing structural changes during hydrogen reduction of ceria grown on ruthenium in real-time using low-energy electron microscopy and micro electron diffraction as well as micro x-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the formation of ordered oxygen vacancies. Moreover three stable phases, which coexist for intermediate oxidation states, demonstrate a spatially varying stoichiometry of the ceria surface during reduction. These results shed new light on the changes of structure in chemical reactions, which have to be considered in view of structure-function relationship...|$|E

The {{materials have}} been characterised {{by means of}} ICP-MS, TEM, EDX, XPS, XRD, BET, TPR, TPO and TPD. Catalytic testing {{was carried out in}} a temperature programmed mode as well as isothermally, using synthetic exhaust gas mixtures with different air-to-fuel ratios. The obtained results were compared with those of traditionally impregnated Pd/ceria-alumina and PtRh/ceria-alumina. Evaluating the catalysts potential as three-way converters, {{it has been shown that}} as a result of the sol-gel preparation chosen, highly homogeneous materials were produced. These had (i) much higher oxygen storage potential (especially at low temperatures, T ≈ 400 - 500 K), (ii) improved metal support interactions and (iii) lower CO and propane light-off temperatures (T 50 %(CO) ≈ 423 K, T 50 %(C 3 H 8) ≈ 593 K for R ≥ 1). Under fuel-rich conditions an improved low temperature NO activity was shown for the ceria-containing materials. This was attributed to a ceria-mediated redox mechanism and an improved Pd-ceria interaction for these sol-gel-derived samples. The addition of <b>terbia</b> was found to promote the catalysts propane activity, especially under fuel-rich conditions. The application of the different catalysts as three-way converters has been discussed, with special emphasis on their potential during the cold-start period. In a further set of catalytic experiments, using less complex gas mixtures, a more comprehensive view of the detailed Pd chemistry involved in these new three-way catalysts was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Rare earth oxides (REOs) {{have shown}} {{considerable}} capacities for performing certain catalytic reactions. However, only ceria (CeOx) has been systematically studied regarding the surface chemistry and the factors for catalytic behavior. The fundamental understanding {{with respect to}} the connections between the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of other REOs is still in a very limited scope. Major part of this PhD dissertation reports on surface science studies of samaria (SmOx) conducted in ultra-high vacuum. In addition, the dissertation briefly introduces recent studies on praseodymia (PrOx), PrOx-CeOx mixed oxides, and <b>terbia</b> (TbOx) which were carried out by my working group (AG Bäumer) and our collaborators. Sm 2 O 3 thin films grown on a Pt(111) substrate were employed as SmOx model systems. Structural and film morphologic studies were conducted by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Such thin films grow as a defective-fluorite structure, i. e., Sm atoms arrange into a hexagonal sublattice whereas surface vacancies randomly distribute on the thin films. A film wetting/dewetting behavior responding to the SmOx reduction/oxidation conditions was observed. To learn about the chemical/catalytic properties of the SmOx model system, carbon monoxide (CO), water (D 2 O), and methanol (MeOH) were dosed onto the system for adsorption-reaction experiments conducted by temperature programmed desorption spectroscopy (TPD). The MeOH-TPD study was further combined with infrared absorption-reflection spectroscopy (IRRAS) to gain the whole picture of the MeOH reaction mechanism on the model system. The influence of the SmOx reduction/oxidation conditions on the chemical responses of these adsorbates were also investigated. The existence of the perimeter sites between SmOx islands and uncovered Pt areas obviously promotes the reactivity and alters chemical properties of the SmOx model system. A spillover of adsorbed species from the SmOx surface to exposed Pt areas was observed. It is particularly important in increasing the SmOx reactivity towards the MeOH decomposition...|$|E
40|$|We used {{temperature}} programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and synchrotron-radiation based photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) {{to investigate}} the adsorption and oxidation of methanol (CH 3 OH) on Tb 2 O 3 (111) and TbO 2 (111) thin films grown on Pt(111). We find that methanol mainly desorbs from the Tb 2 O 3 surface through both molecular and recombinative processes, and that a relatively small amount of adsorbed methanol (< 20 %) dehydrogenates to CH 2 O and H 2 O with these species desorbing between about 160 and 300 K. Oxidation of the <b>terbia</b> film enhances the surface reactivity as ~ 50 % of the adsorbed methanol on TbO 2 oxidizes to mainly CH 2 O and water as well as CO 2 that desorbs near 600 K during TPRS. Quantification of the product yields suggests {{that all of the}} excess surface O-atoms, resulting from oxidation of Tb 2 O 3 to TbO 2, are removed during TPRS by reaction with adsorbed CH 3 OH. We did not detect CO or H 2 production under any conditions. PES measurements show that several adsorbed intermediates form on the TbOx surfaces at temperatures as low as 140 K, including mainly methoxy (CH 3 O) as well as smaller quantities of a more oxidized species, thought to be either CH 2 O 2 or CHO 2. XPS spectra collected {{as a function of the}} surface temperature provide evidence that the adsorbed CH 3 O groups serve as the main intermediate for both CH 2 O and CH 3 OH formation at temperatures below 400 K, while the more oxidized species is a spectator to CH 2 O formation but undergoes complete oxidation on TbO 2 at temperatures above 450 K. The high reactivity of the TbO 2 surface correlates with the presence of labile oxygen atoms that are generated during oxidation of the Tb 2 O 3 film...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} cerium to cycle between Ce+ 3 and Ce+ 4 {{is crucial for}} ceria-based {{materials}} in many catalytic applications. However, our fundamental understanding of how structure and composition affect ceria reducibility is really rather poor. The primary goal of this thesis {{was to provide a}} better understanding of the redox properties for ceria-based catalysts and also to establish a connection between the redox ability of ceria and the activity of catalytic reactions carried out by ceria-based catalysts. ^ The energetics for oxidation of ceria-based mixed oxides were determined from the equilibrium oxygen isotherms measured at a temperature range between 873 and 1073 K using both flow-titration and coulometric-titration measurements. First, the thermodynamic properties of surface ceria were examined on ceria/La-modified-alumina (LA) samples because the surface area of pure ceria was found to be unstable under redox conditions. Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from − 500 kJ/mol-O 2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of − 760 kJ/mol O 2 at higher extents. ^ The redox properties were also investigated for the following ceria-based mixed oxides: ceria-zirconia, ceria-titania, ceria-manganese, ceria-hafnia, and ceria-terbia. The oxidation enthalpies for each of the ceria-zirconia solid solutions were between − 500 and − 550 kJ/mol-O 2 and essentially independent of the extent of reduction, but the oxidation entropies depended strongly on the sample composition and the extent of reduction. A model was presented which views reduction of the solid solutions in terms of the local atomic structure, with the formation of 2 ̆ 2 pyrochlore-like 2 ̆ 2 clusters. The solid solutions of ceria-titania were also significantly more reducible than bulk ceria, with enthalpies for reoxidation being approximately − 500 kJ/mol-O 2. Following calcination at 1323 K, the solid solutions separated into ceria and titania phases. Investigation of mixed oxides of cerium and manganese showed that oxygen isotherms exhibited steps associated with MnO-Mn 3 O 4 and Mn 3 O 4 -Mn 2 O 3 equilibria, implying that manganese oxide must exist as separate phases in the solids. The P(O 2) for the MnO-Mn 3 O 4 equilibrium is shifted to lower values in the mixed oxides, indicating that the manganese-oxide phase is affected by interactions with ceria. The redox properties of ceria-hafnia are nearly identical to that of ceria-zirconia. Finally, mixed oxides of ceria with <b>terbia</b> and praseodymia also formed single-phase, fluorite structures at 1323 K, but the oxidation isotherms for the solid solutions were similar to what would be expected for physical mixtures of these oxides. ^ Both WGS and hydrocarbon-oxidation rate measurements were used to characterize the catalytic properties of the mixed oxides. The activities and activation energies of the WGS reaction for both 1 wt...|$|E
40|$|Cerium dioxide (ceria) {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} the subject of intense academic and industrial interest. Ceria has a host of applications but academic interest largely stems from their use in the modern automotive catalyst but it is also of interest because of many other application areas notably as the abrasive in chemical-mechanical planarisation of silicon substrates. Recently, ceria has been the focus of research investigating health effects of nanoparticles. Importantly, the role of non-stoichiometry in ceria nanoparticles is implicated in their biochemistry. Ceria has well understood non-stoichiometry based around the ease of formation of anion vacancies and these can form ordered superstructures based around the fluorite lattice structure exhibited by ceria. The anion vacancies are associated with localised or small polaron states formed by the electrons that remain after oxygen desorption. In simple terms these electrons combine with Ce 4 + states to form Ce 3 + states whose larger ionic radii is associated with a lattice expansion compared to stoichiometric CeO 2. This is a very simplistic explanation and greater defect chemistry complexity is suggested by more recent work. Various authors have shown that vacancies are mobile and may result in vacancy clustering. Ceria nanoparticles are of particular interest because of the high activity and surface area of small particulates. The sensitivity of the cerium electronic band structure to environment would suggest that changes in the properties of ceria particles at nanoscale dimensions might be expected. Notably many authors report a lattice expansion with reducing particle size (largely confined to sub- 10 nm particles). Most authors assign increased lattice dimensions to the presence of a surface stable Ce 2 O 3 type layer at low nanoparticle dimensions. However, our understanding of oxide nanoparticles is limited and their full and quantitative characterisation offers serious challenges. In a series of chemical preparations by ourselves we see little evidence of a consistent model emerging to explain lattice parameter changes with nanoparticle size. Based on these results and a review of the literature it is worthwhile asking if a model of surface enhanced defect concentration is consistent with known cerium/cerium oxide chemistries, whether this is applicable to a range of different synthesis methods and if a more consistent description is possible. In Chapter one the science of cerium oxide is outlined including the crystal structure, defect chemistry and different oxidation states available. The uses and applications of cerium oxide are also discussed as well as modelling of the lattice parameter and the doping of the ceria lattice. Chapter two describes both the synthesis techniques and the analytical methods employed to execute this research. Chapter three focuses on high surface area ceria nano-particles and how these have been prepared using a citrate sol-gel precipitation method. Changes to the particle size have been made by calcining the ceria powders at different temperatures. X-ray diffraction methods were used to determine their lattice parameters. The particles sizes were also assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and BET, and, the lattice parameter was found to decrease with decreasing particle size. The results are discussed in light of the role played by surface tension effects. Chapter four describes the morphological and structural characterization of crystalline CeO 2 nanoparticles prepared by forward and reverse precipitation techniques and compares these by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), nitrogen adsorption (BET) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis. The two routes give quite different materials although in both cases the products are essentially highly crystalline, dense particulates. It was found that the reverse precipitation technique gave the smallest crystallites with the narrowest size dispersion. This route also gave as-synthesised materials with higher surface areas. HRTEM confirmed the observations made from PXRD data and showed that the two methods resulted in quite different morphologies and surface chemistries. The forward route gives products with significantly greater densities of Ce 3 + species compared to the reverse route. Data are explained using known precipitation chemistry and kinetic effects. Chapter five centres on the addition of <b>terbia</b> to ceria and has been investigated using XRD, XRF, XPS and TEM. Good solid solutions were formed across the entire composition range and there was no evidence for the formation of mixed phases or surface segregation over either the composition or temperature range investigated. Both Tb 3 + and Tb 4 + ions exist within the solution and the ratios of these cations are consistent with the addition of Tb 8 O 15 to the fluorite ceria structure across a wide range of compositions. Local regions of anion vacancy ordering may be visible for small crystallites. There is no evidence of significant Ce 3 + ion concentrations formed at the surface or in the bulk by the addition of <b>terbia.</b> The lattice parameter of these materials was seen to decrease with decreasing crystallite size. This is consistent with increased surface tension effects at small dimension. Chapter six reviews size related lattice parameter changes and surface defects in ceria nanocrystals. Ceria (CeO 2) has many important applications, notably in catalysis. Many of its uses rely on generating nanodimensioned particles. Ceria has important redox chemistry where Ce 4 + cations can be reversibly reduced to Ce 3 + cations and associated anion vacancies. The significantly larger size of Ce 3 + (compared with Ce 4 +) has been shown to result in lattice expansion. Many authors have observed lattice expansion in nanodimensioned crystals (nanocrystals), and these have been attributed to the presence of stabilized Ce 3 + -anion vacancy combinations in these systems. Experimental results presented here show (i) that significant, but complex changes in the lattice parameter with size can occur in 2 - 500 nm crystallites, (ii) that there is a definitive relationship between defect chemistry and the lattice parameter in ceria nanocrystals, and (iii) that the stabilizing mechanism for the Ce 3 + -anion vacancy defects at the surface of ceria nanocrystals is determined by the size, the surface status, and the analysis conditions. In this work, both lattice expansion and a more unusual lattice contraction in ultrafine nanocrystals are observed. The lattice deformations seen can be defined as a function of both the anion vacancy (hydroxyl) concentration in the nanocrystal and the intensity of the additional pressure imposed by the surface tension on the crystal. The expansion of lattice parameters in ceria nanocrystals is attributed to a number of factors, most notably, the presence of any hydroxyl moieties in the materials. Thus, a very careful understanding of the synthesis combined with characterization is required to understand the surface chemistry of ceria nanocrystals...|$|E
