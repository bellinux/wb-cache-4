30|$|In <b>the</b> cross-regional <b>emergency</b> scenario, {{we witness}} three effects. First, when <b>the</b> maximum <b>emergency</b> {{capability}} on line 2 is changed, {{the change in}} the scheduling quantity in the cross-regional mode coincides with it in the single one. However, the variational change of cross-regional emergency dispatching is smaller. Second, when <b>the</b> maximum <b>emergency</b> capability is increased, <b>the</b> minimum <b>emergency</b> costs decrease, and these costs are greater than those in the single one. However, when <b>the</b> maximum <b>emergency</b> capability is decreased, <b>the</b> minimum <b>emergency</b> costs increase and the costs are less than the single mode. Third, <b>the</b> generalized <b>emergency</b> costs are less than the single mode. When <b>the</b> maximum <b>emergency</b> capability is decreased, <b>the</b> generalized <b>emergency</b> costs sharply decline. Furthermore, the increase in <b>the</b> maximum <b>emergency</b> capability leads to an argument with <b>the</b> petroleum <b>emergency</b> quantity. Then, <b>the</b> total network coordination quantity increases and <b>the</b> generalized <b>emergency</b> costs sharply decline. All of these show that <b>the</b> cross-regional <b>emergency</b> coordination mode is better than single region emergency dispatching.|$|R

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> setting can {{be difficult}} with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E
