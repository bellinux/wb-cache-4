6000|$|Cagn had two sons, Cogaz and Gcwi. He {{and they}} were [...] "great chiefs," [...] but used stone-pointed digging sticks <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> <b>up</b> edible roots! Cagn's wife brought forth a fawn, and, like Cronus when Rhea {{presented}} him with a foal, Cagn was put to it to know the nature and future fortunes of this child of his. To penetrate the future he employed the ordinary native charms and sorcery. The remainder of the myth accounts for the origin of elands and for their inconvenient wildness. A daughter of Cagn's married [...] "snakes who were also men," [...] the eternal confusion of savage thought. These snakes became the people of Cagn. Cagn had a tooth which was [...] "great medicine"; his force resided in it, and he lent it to people whom he favoured. The birds (as in Odin's case) were his messengers, and brought him news of all that happened at a distance.* ...|$|E

Only he wouldn't let me marry Alice here; and it will always be said that he was right enough. Well, you can form your own conclusions, and you won't want me to go into details. That is my whisky bottle half emptied in the corner; that is my revolver quite emptied on the carpet. It was the rope from my box that was found on the corpse, and it was from my window the corpse was thrown.

They have never taken the trouble <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> <b>up</b> the stumps, and each man must look out for shelter. I {{want to make it}} so hot for them that they will try to bolt to the swamp, and in that case they will be covered by the men there. I told them not to fire until they got quite close; so they ought to dispose of three of them, and as they have got pistols {{they will be able to}} master the others; besides, when we hear firing behind, we shall jump up and make a rush round. Do you, sir, and James Wilkins here, stop in front. Two of them might make a rush out behind, and the others, when they have drawn us off, bolt in front." ...|$|E
60|$|The swede-field {{in which}} she and her {{companion}} were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets--the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes. The upper half of each turnip had been eaten off by the live-stock, {{and it was the}} business of the two women <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> <b>up</b> the lower or earthy half of the root with a hooked fork called a hacker, that it might be eaten also. Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the whole field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin. The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone. So these two upper and nether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face looking down on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the white face, without anything standing between them but the two girls crawling over the surface of the former like flies.|$|E
6000|$|The poor pious woman, who {{had always}} religiously abstained from seeing her lord's face, and from knowing his name, was now reduced to destitution. There was no one <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> <b>up</b> pig-nuts for her, nor to extract insects of an edible sort from beneath the bark of trees. As she could not {{identify}} her invisible husband, {{she was unable to}} denounce him to the wizards, who would, for a consideration, have frightened him out of his life or into the performance of his duty. Thus, even with the aid of Why-Why, existence became too laborious for her strength, and she gradually pined away. As she lay in a half-fainting and almost dying state, Why-Why rushed out to find the most celebrated local medicine-man. In half an hour the chief medicine-man appeared, dressed in the skin of a wolf, tagged about with bones, skulls, dead lizards, and other ornaments of his official attire. You may see a picture very like him in Mr. Catlin's book about the Mandans. Armed with a drum and a rattle, he leaped into the presence of the sick woman, uttering unearthly yells. His benevolent action and [...] "bedside manner" [...] were in accordance with the medical science of the time. He merely meant to frighten away the evil spirit which (according to the received hypothesis) was destroying the mother of Why-Why. What he succeeded in doing was to make Why-Why's mother give a faint scream, after which her jaw fell, and her eyes grew fixed and staring.|$|E

I will leave them the slipp'd collar in their hands on the first opportunity, and let them execute their own devices by their own proper force. It may save them both from peril, for I guess what they meditate is not likely to prove either safe or easy--the Earl of Murray and his heresy are too well rooted <b>to</b> be <b>grubbed</b> <b>up</b> by two old women." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{premise of}} this paper is that {{viticulture}} is an expression of history and social relations. In this sense, we embrace a post-modern vision of development that characterized both economic and cultural geography and agricultural economics. Such an approach does consider culture as an element of mediation between humans and the nature, placing it {{at the heart of the}} wine-growing territory. So history and social relations have influenced the today spatial densification by types of grape and the persistence, the reduction and/or disappearance of vines’ cultivations due to the different level of integration between humans and wine territories in the Italian region of Sardinia. In this region, there are selected areas where winegrowers have been forced <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> vineyards <b>up,</b> depleting the regional viticultural heritage, others–within which the fabric of the system of social relationships were denser–and where we saw a real rush to purchase of replanting rights for the expansion of the production surface for the increasing of production. The aim {{of this paper}} is to highlight the role of history and social relations in the determination of the structure of the regional viticulture through the identification and analysis of diverse case studies...|$|R
6000|$|There was a short, very black, and {{somewhat}} bowlegged negro {{man on the}} place, named Israel Bonaparte, {{who lived in a}} little cabin by himself, and was noted for his unsocial disposition, and his taciturnity. To him Mr Brandon went one day, and said: [...] "Israel, I want you to go to work on the fence rows on my side of the road <b>to</b> Howlett's. <b>Grub</b> <b>up</b> the bushes, clear out the vines and weeds, and see that the rails and posts are all in order. That will be a job that I expect will last you until the roads begin to get heavy. And, by the way, Israel, while you are at work, I want you to keep a lookout for any visitors that may turn into our road, especially if they happen to be ladies. Now that Miss Rob is away, I am very particular about knowing, beforehand, when ladies are coming to visit me; and when you see any wagon or carriage turn in, I want you to make a short cut across the fields, and let me know it, and I will give you a quarter of a dollar every time you do so." [...] This was a very pleasant job of work for the meditative Israel. He was not very fond of grubbing, but he earned the greater part of his ten dollars a month and rations, by sitting on the fence, smoking a corn-cob pipe, and attending to the second division of the work which his employer had set him to do.|$|R
60|$|Having thus happily got my readers on {{this side}} of the Atlantic, I picture them to myself, all impatience to enter upon the {{enjoyment}} of the land of promise, and in full expectation that I will immediately deliver it into their possession. But if I do, may I ever forfeit the reputation of a regular bred historian! No--no--most curious and thrice-learned readers (for thrice learned ye are if ye have read all that has gone before, and nine times learned shall ye be if ye read that which comes after), we have yet a world of work before us. Think you the first discoverers of this fair quarter of the globe had nothing to do but go on shore and find a country ready laid out and cultivated like a garden, wherein they might revel at their ease? No such thing. They had forests to cut down, underwood <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> <b>up,</b> marshes to drain, and savages to exterminate. In like manner, I have sundry doubts to clear away, questions to resolve, and paradoxes to explain before I permit you to range at random; but these difficulties once overcome we shall be enabled to jog on right merrily through the rest of our history. Thus my work shall, in a manner, echo the nature of the subject, in the same manner as the sound of poetry has been found by certain shrewd critics to echo the sense--this being an improvement in history which I claim the merit of having invented.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{beginning}} of the end. He recovered and relapsed, and recovered again; but never for long. Late in the spring I came out, and he had me stay to dinner, which was somehow as it used to be at two o'clock; and after dinner we went out on his lawn. He got a long-handled spud, and tried <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> <b>up</b> some dandelions which he found in his turf, but after a moment or two he threw it down, and put his hand upon his back with a groan. I did not see him again till I came out to take leave of him before going away for the summer, and then I found him sitting on the little porch in a western corner of his house, with a volume of Scott closed upon his finger. There were some other people, and our meeting was with the constraint of their presence. It was natural in nothing so much as his saying very significantly to me, as if he knew of my heresies concerning Scott, and would have me know he did not approve of them, that there was nothing he now found so much pleasure in as Scott's novels. Another friend, equally heretical, was by, but neither of us attempted to gainsay him. Lowell talked very little, but he told of having been a walk to Beaver Brook, and of having wished to jump from one stone to another in the stream, and of having had to give it up. He said, without completing the sentence, If it had come to that with him! Then he fell silent again; and with some vain talk of seeing him when I came back in the fall, I went away sick at heart. I was not to see him again, and I shall not look upon his like.|$|E
6000|$|Priests {{may be good}} servants, {{but they}} are, mundanely speaking, bad masters. The ecclesiastical tyranny {{exercised}} upon {{the people from the}} highest to the lowest goes far to account for the extinction of Christianity in the country where so much was done to spread it. The kings of Congoland, who [...] "tread on the lion in the kingdom of their mothers" [...] must abjectly address their spiritual lords. [...] "I conjure you, prostrate at your holy feet, to hearken to my words." [...] Whilst the friars talk of [...] "that meekness which becomes a missioner," [...] their unwise and unwarrantable interference extends to the Count of Sonho himself; whose election was not valid unless published in the church, owning withal that, [...] "though a Black, he is an absolute Prince; and not unworthy of a Crown, though he were even in Italy, considering the number of his Servants and the extent of his Dominions." [...] They issue eight ordinances or [...] "spiritual memorandums" [...] degrading governors of cities and provinces who are not properly married, who neglect mass, or who do not keep saints' festivals. Flogging seems to have been the punishment of all infractions of discipline, for those who used [...] "magic guards" [...] to their fields instead of [...] "setting the sign of the Cross;" [...] and for all who did not teach their children [...] "to repeat, so many times a day, the Rosary or the Crown, in honour of the Blessed Virgin, to fast on Saturdays, to eat no flesh on Wednesdays, and such things used among Christians." [...] One of the Mwanis (governors) refuses <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> <b>up</b> and level with his own hands a certain grove where the [...] "hellish trade" [...] (magic) was practised; he is commanded to discipline himself in the church during the whole time of celebrating mass. If the governor is negligent in warning the people that a missioner has arrived, [...] "he will receive a deserved punishment, for we make it our business to get such a person removed from his employment, even within his year,"--a system of temporal penalties affixed to spiritual lâches not unknown elsewhere. The following anecdote will show the style of reproof. Father Benedict da Belvedere, a Neapolitan who had preached at Rome and was likewise confessor to the nuns, heard the chief elector, one of the principal nobles, asking the heretical question, [...] "Are we not all to be saved by baptism?" [...] A [...] "sound box on the ear" [...] was the reply, and it led to a tumult. The head of the mission sent for the offended dignitary, and offered him absolution if he would sincerely recant his words and beg pardon of the churchman militant. The answer was, [...] "That would be pleasant indeed; he was the aggressor, yet I must make the excuse! Must I receive a blow, and, notwithstanding, be thought to have done wrong?" [...] But the peace-maker explained that the blow was given not to offend, but to defend from hearkening to heresies; that it was administered, moreover, out of paternal affection by a spiritual father, whom it did not mis-become, to a son who was not dishonoured by receiving it. The unfortunate elector not only suffered in the ear, but was also obliged to make an abject apology, and to kiss the offender's feet before he was re-admitted to communion. At Maopongo the priests lost favour with the court and the women by whipping the queen, and, by the same process they abated the superhuman pretensions of the blacksmith.|$|E
60|$|These {{are only}} a few {{selected}} examples of the infinite dodges employed by enlightened herbs and shrubs to propagate their scions in foreign parts. Many more, equally interesting, must be left undescribed. Only for a single case more can I still find room--that of the subterranean clover, which has been driven by its numerous enemies to take refuge at last in a very remarkable and almost unique mode, of protecting its offspring. This particular kind of clover affects smooth and close-cropped hillsides, where the sheep nibble down the grass and other herbage almost as fast as it springs up again. Now, clover seeds resemble their allies of the pea and bean tribe in being exceedingly rich in starch and other valuable foodstuffs. Hence, they are much sought after by the inquiring sheep, which eat them off wherever found, as exceptionally nutritious and dainty morsels. Under these circumstances, the subterranean clover has learnt to produce small heads of bloom, pressed close to the ground, in which only the outer flowers are perfect and fertile, while the inner ones are transformed into tiny wriggling corkscrews. As soon as the fertile flowers have begun to set their seed, by the kind aid of the bees, the whole stem bends downward, automatically, of its own accord; the little corkscrews then worm their way into the turf beneath; and the pods ripen and mature in the actual soil itself, where no prying ewe can poke an inquisitive nose <b>to</b> <b>grub</b> them <b>up</b> and devour them. Cases like this point in certain ways to the absolute high-water-mark of vegetable ingenuity: they go nearest of all in the plant-world to the similitude of conscious animal intelligence.|$|R

50|$|Nine-banded {{armadillos}} {{are generally}} insectivores. They forage for meals by thrusting their snouts into loose soil and leaf litter and frantically digging in erratic patterns, stopping occasionally <b>to</b> dig <b>up</b> <b>grubs,</b> beetles (perhaps the main {{portion of this}} species' prey selection), ants, termites, and worms, which their sensitive noses can detect through 8 in of soil. They then lap up the insects with their sticky tongues. Nine-banded armadillos have been observed to roll about on ant hills to dislodge and consume the resident ants. They supplement their diets with amphibians and small reptiles, especially in more wintery months when such prey {{tends to be more}} sluggish, and occasionally bird eggs and baby mammals. Carrion is also eaten, although perhaps the species is most attracted to the maggots borne by carcasses rather than the meat itself. Less than 10% of the diet of this species is composed by nonanimal matter, though fungi, tubers, fruits, and seeds are occasionally eaten.|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the local}} French work in the {{vineyards}} which provide grapes for the wine producing co-operatives at Montlaur and Monze, the one at Serviès having merged in 2006 with that at Fabrezan. In this respect life has hardly changed since the French Revolution, except for the introduction of farm machinery and other improvements which have been {{made possible by the}} EU's Common Agricultural Policy.The closure of the independent Serviès co-operative in 2006 coincided with the beginnings of a radical change in the appearance of the valley, as a large number of vineyards have been, and continue <b>to</b> be <b>grubbed</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be replaced, mainly by cereal crops, most commonly barley and rye. The consequent reduction in the percentage of local land under vines, as well as altering the appearance of the landscape, will have a fundamental effect on the local economy.Economic change has been brought about by a combination of factors, mainly concerning a loss of wine markets, and time alone will tell how climatic change will exacerbate this change and how local farmers will attempt to cope with it.The declining state of local wine production, particularly that based on local co-operatives, has led to a change of policy by the Regional Authorities of Languedoc Roussillon, and a conscious attempt by them to encourage and develop tourism in the area. This is very largely in its infancy, although there is an increasing amount of accommodation available in, and particularly near the valley in nearby Carcassonne, Lagrasse, Lézignan-Corbières and Narbonne, and local hotels and restaurants are being encouraged to remain open throughout the year. However in the valley itself there are few of these, and only time will tell if there are any developments within the service sector to attract tourists in future years.In addition to the influx of non-French residents, some local houses provide second homes for French families, so that in most villages there is a tendency towards a falling percentage of permanent residents. This brings its own changes in terms of lowering levels of viability for schools, bars, shops, etc., and {{this is all part of}} the current economic transformation of the valley.|$|R
