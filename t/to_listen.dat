5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to a taped {{broadcast of the}} final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone {{at the base of the}} flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{conventional}} instructional strategy {{has failed to}} address negative attitude <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension. This study, therefore, determined the effects of listening strategies’ instruction on senior secondary school students’ attitude <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> comprehension. This research adopted a pretest, treatment and posttest quasi- experimental factorial design. A total sample of one hundred and twenty participants were randomly selected and assigned to three treatment groups of listening strategies, discourse markers instructions and the control which was not exposed to instruction. The instruments used were: The Listening Attitude Questionnaire, Teachers’ Instructional Guide on listening strategies’ instructions; Teachers Instructional Guide on Modified Conventional Strategy and Evaluation sheet for Assessing Teachers’ Performance {{on the use of}} the Strategies (ESAT). Data were analyzed using ANCOVA at 0. 05 level of significance. There was a significant difference in the attitude <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> [F(1, 117) = 94. 64, p < 0. 05]. Those exposed <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> strategies instruction had a better attitude <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> and a better listening comprehension than those exposed to other instructions...|$|R

40|$|Recognized {{musicians and}} {{researchers}} {{in the field of}} music improvisation, like George Lewis and Vijay Iyer, claim that listeners to improvised music improvise as well and, in so doing, they employ the notion of improvisation in the aesthetics of reception, as opposed to its more usual employment in the aesthetics of production. In this paper I aim to discuss if and how should we make sense of this claim. Furthermore I will try to answer a more general question, that is, whether, and in which sense, we can extend the idea of improvisational <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> every <b>listening,</b> <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> as such, not only <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> an improvisation...|$|R
