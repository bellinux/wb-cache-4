50|$|By 2002 the Bondevik's Second Cabinet {{wanted to}} further deregulate the Norwegian railway sector, and made NSB a limited company NSB AS on 1 July. NSB {{had been through}} a process of making the company more of a corporation, with the IT section made the {{subsidiary}} Arrive and the maintenance transformed to Mantena. NSB also purchased part of the Swedish Tågkompaniet while the old freight <b>train</b> <b>section</b> NSB Gods was transformed to CargoNet. 45% of the subsidiary was then sold to the Statens Järnvägar successor Green Cargo. In 2004 the government also split NSB Gardermobanen in two, deleting the companies debt, transferring the track it owned to Jernbaneverket and the train operations to a new, government-owned enterprise, the Airport Express Train.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the section}} from Arlöv to Ängelholm {{consisted}} of two private railways, from Arlöv to Billesholm, which opened in 1888, and from Billeshollm to Ängelholm, which opened in 1876. Both were nationalized in 1896 {{along with many other}} railways to establish the West Coast Line. The section from Arlöv to Ängelhom was regarded as part of the West Coast Line until 2001, when a new line was opened between Ängelholm and Lund. The Freight Line was electrified in 1933 and 1934. Regional passenger transport was terminated in 1975 from Ängelholm to Teckomatorp, and in 1983 from Malmö to Arlöv and Kävlinge. The section from Kävlinge to Teckomatorp remains as a passenger <b>train</b> <b>section</b> and is used by the Skåne commuter rail.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accident}} was investigated by Captain Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate; {{there was also}} a coroner's inquest on those who had died in the crash. [...] Tyler showed by experiment that when a string of carriages matching the runaway <b>train</b> <b>section</b> was allowed to run back down the incline for quarter of a mile before the brake was applied, application of the brake then brought the carriages to rest well before the site of the collision. Furthermore, he considered that the severity of damage showed that no braking at all had been applied to the runaway. The brakescrew on the runaway brake van had been bent in the collision, and the nut was {{at the bottom of the}} working section of the screw, indicating that the brake had been off at the time of collision.|$|E

50|$|City Night Line trains were {{operated}} in a through coach system. From their joint departure station, they covered {{part of the}} route together as one train; on arrival at a certain station, they were split up and joined to other trains, with which they then continued to the different destination stations. The same procedure applied on the return journey. For example, the trains on the Amsterdam - Munich and Amsterdam - Zurich routes ran as a joint train as far as Mannheim, where the train was split up. The <b>train</b> <b>section</b> travelling to Munich was joined to a train coming from Paris with destination Munich, while the section travelling to Zurich was joined to a CNL coming from Hamburg. On the changeover to the 2009/2010 timetable, the number of these shunting processes was reduced to one per network.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to set out}} the {{influence}} of the flow field around high speed trains in open field. To achieve this parametric analysis of the sound pressure inside the train was performed. Three vibroacoustic models of a characteristic <b>train</b> <b>section</b> are used to predict the noise inside the train in open field by using finite element method FEM, boundary element method (BEM) and statistical energy analysis (SEA) depending on the frequency range of analysis. The turbulent boundary layer excitation is implemented as the only airborne noise source, in order to focus on the study of the attached and detached flow in the surface of the train. The power spectral densities of the pressure fluctuation in the train surface proposed by [Cockburn and Roberson 1974, Rennison et al. 2009] are applied on the exterior surface of the structural subsystems in the vibroacoustic models. An increase in the sound pressure level up to 10 dB can be appreciated due to the detachment of the flow around the train. These results highlight the importance to determine the detached regions prediction, making critical the airborne noise due to turbulent boundary layer...|$|E

ORNL frequently benchmarks its own research against commercially available hybrid components currently used in the market.

This study examines the new 2007 Camry hybrid model for changes in technology and cost relative to the Prius. The work effort involved a detailed review of the Camry hybrid and the system control strategy to identify the hybrid components used in the drive <b>train.</b> <b>Section</b> 2 provides this review while Section 3 presents our detailed evaluation of the specific drive train components and their cost estimates. Section 3 also provides a summary of the total electrical drive train cost for the Camry hybrid vehicle and contrasts these estimates to the costs for the second generation Prius that we estimated in 2005. Most of the information on cost and performance were derived from meetings with the technical staff of Toyota, Nissan, and some key Tier I suppliers like Hitachi and Panasonic Electric Vehicle Energy (PEVE) and we thank these companies for their kind cooperation...|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{implications}} of implementing and using experimental data in the statistical energy analysis (SEA) framework was investigated, especially when dealing with complex structures, such as entire vehicles. Having experimental results on the real structure becomes always more important for quick and accurate assessment of the vibrational behavior of complex assemblies, especially at higher frequency, where SEA is optimally used. Such data are particularly important in the aerospace and automotive industry nowadays, with {{the increasing use of}} new materials such as CFRP to reduce structural weight. Measurements were carried out on structures with increasing complexity, to end with a complete regional <b>train</b> <b>section.</b> Thanks to the gathered data, various parameters key to SEA were computed, so that they could either be implemented in numerical models or used as validation for these models. The growing complexity of the analyzed assemblies allowed to define the experimental setups and parameters correctly and establish a proper computation routine for the post-processing of the measurements. Furthermore, basic SEA assumptions were verified by using a relatively simple assembly, which provided a good platform for a first evaluation of the challenges encountered in experimental statistical energy analysis. A section of a regional train was measured with accelerometers and impulse hammer, the whole section being divided in subsystems. Parallely, numerical models of the train were created in the software VA One, with different configurations of materials and subsystems. The experimental and numerical data were then used to observe the impact of various key parameters on either the calculation of SEA variables with the measured data or on the results obtained from the numerical models. While the vibration levels of the subsystems had significant discrepancies between the experiment and the models for this assembly, the various investigations led to good understanding of the system behavior, such as {{to pave the way for}} further analysis. Overall, parameters of interest in SEA were obtained from various experiments, and their sensitivity to the experimental parameters and setups was assessed. Similar work was carried out on numerical models, by varying the properties and configurations of the models. This thesis therefore provides a good overview of the experimental practices in the context of statistical energy analysis, the modeling and computation of numerical SEA models, as well as the bridge between experiments and numerical analysis, with concluding remarks on the possible further investigations in this critical field. ...|$|E
