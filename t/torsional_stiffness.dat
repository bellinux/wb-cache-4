40|$|Abstract. When using {{structural}} mechanics {{to study the}} deformation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), one has to pick the {{structural mechanics}} properties that are equivalent to the molecular mechanics properties. In a previous publication [1], we have determined {{the relation between the}} bending stiffness EI/a used in structural mechanics and the bond bending stiffness C used in molecular mechanics for zigzag carbon nanotubes under simple tension. This paper extends the concept and determines the corresponding relation for simple torsion. We show that the relation obtained is different than that of simple tension; in simple torsion, EI/a is load and chirality dependent. However, for the particular case of a graphene sheet, simple tension and torsion lead to the same value of EI/a, namely C/ 2. We also include the structural mechanics deformation of the tube that accounts for axial, bending and <b>torsional</b> structural <b>stiffnesses.</b> Unlike simple tension, the deformation in the case of simple torsion has the axial stiffness coupled to the bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>stiffnesses...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Aluminum has a {{different}} optimal wall thickness to tubing diameter than steel. [...] It is at its strongest at around 200:1 (diameter:wall thickness), whereas steel is {{a small fraction of}} that. [...] However, at this ratio, the wall thickness would be comparable to that of a beverage can, far too fragile against impacts. [...] Thus, aluminum bicycle tubing is a compromise, offering a wall thickness to diameter ratio that is not of utmost efficiency, but gives us oversized tubing of more reasonable aerodynamically acceptable proportions and good resistance to impact. This results in a frame that is significantly stiffer than steel. [...] While many riders claim that steel frames give a smoother ride than aluminum because aluminum frames are designed to be stiffer, that claim is of questionable validity: the bicycle frame itself is extremely stiff vertically because it is made of triangles. Conversely, this very argument calls the claim of aluminum frames having greater vertical stiffness into question.

The fibers are assumed: i) to be continuously distributed over the sample, ii) to be endowed of bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> and iii) tied together at their points of intersection to avoid relative slipping by means of internal (elastic) pivots. This last condition characterizes {{the system as a}} pantographic lattice [1, 2, 34, 35].

Some relevant numerical examples are exhibited in order to highlight the main features of the model adopted: in particular buckling and post-buckling behavior of pantographic parabolic lattices is investigated.

Gearing is {{perhaps one of the}} most critical components in power transmission systems. The transmission error of gears in mesh is considered to be one of the main causes of gear noise and vibration. Numerous papers have been published on gear transmission error measurement and many investigations have been devoted to gear vibration analysis. There still, however, remains to be developed a general non-linear Finite Element Model capable of predicting the effect of variations of gear <b>torsional</b> mesh <b>stiffness,</b> transmission error, transmitted load and load sharing ratio. The primary purpose of this study was to develop such a model and to study the behaviour of the static <b>torsional</b> mesh <b>stiffness,</b> load sharing ratio, and transmission error over one completed cycle of the tooth mesh. The research outlined in this thesis considers the variations of the whole gear body stiffness arising from the gear body rotation due to tooth bending deflection, shearing displacement, and contact deformation. Many different positions within the meshing cycle were investigated and then compared with the results of a gear mesh having a single cracked tooth. In order to handle contact problems with the finite element method, the stiffness relationship between the two contact areas must be established. Existing Finite Element codes rely on the use of the variational approach to formulate contact problems. This can be achieved by insertion of a contact element placed in between the two contacting areas where contact occurs. For modelling of gear teeth in mesh, the penalty parameter of the contact element is user-defined and it varies through the cyclic mesh. A simple strategy of how to overcome these difficulties is ++also presented. Most of the previously published finite element analysis with gears has involved only partial teeth models. In an investigation of gear transmission errors using contact elements, the whole body of the gears in mesh must be modelled, because the penalty parameter of the contact elements must account for the flexibility of the entire body of the gear not just the local stiffness at the contact point...|$|R
