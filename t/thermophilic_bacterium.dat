25|$|Acinetobacter {{has been}} found to {{partially}} degrade low molecular weight polyethylene oligomers. When used in combination, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Sphingomonas can degrade over 40% of the weight of plastic bags in less than three months. The <b>thermophilic</b> <b>bacterium</b> Brevibacillus borstelensis (strain 707) was isolated from a soil sample and found capable of using low-density polyethylene as a sole carbon source when incubated at 50 degrees Celsius. Pre-exposure of the plastic to ultraviolet radiation broke chemical bonds and aided biodegradation; the longer the period of UV exposure, the greater the promotion of the degradation.|$|E

The DNA polymerase isolated from T. aquaticus is stable at high temperatures remaining active even after DNA denaturation, thus obviating the need to add new DNA polymerase after each cycle. This allowed an automated thermocycler-based process for DNA amplification.|$|E

Bacteria {{were identified by}} morphological analysis, colony characters and biochemical reactions according to Burgey’s manual. E. coli was used as Mesophilic bacteria. DNA from both bacteria {{was isolated}} and subjected to various procedures i. e. diphenylamine test, spectroscopic analysis and electrophoresis, which confirmed the obtaining of pure DNA samples. Melting temperature of DNA from both bacteria were determined by incubating DNA samples at different temperature i. e. 30 0 C, 50 0 C, 70 0 C, 90 0 C for 5 minute and observing A 260. Graph was plotted between temperature and A 260 and melting temperature was determined. Considerable change was found in melting temperature of both organisms. Melting temperature of E. coli was 60 0 C and melting temperature of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> was 80 0 C. These results explain one of the mechanisms of adaptation of bacteria to high temperature.
