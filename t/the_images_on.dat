5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by a comparison of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> coins {{initially}} changed rapidly, {{but increasingly}} each community {{settled on a}} single image or set of images. Some of these were the symbol or image of an important deity in the city or visual puns on the city's name, {{but in many cases}} their meaning is obscure and may not have been chosen for any special reason.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> the {{two sides}} of actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to {{slightly}} favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing.

25|$|Beit She'arim is {{an archaeological}} {{site of a}} Jewish town and necropolis, {{near the town of}} Kiryat Tiv'on, 20km east of Haifa in the {{southern}} foothills of the Lower Galilee. Beth She'arim was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and Nahman Avigad in the 1930s and 1950s. Most of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE and include the remains {{of a large number of}} individuals buried in the more than twenty catacombs of the necropolis. Together with <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> walls and sarcophagi, the inscriptions show that this was a Jewish necropolis.|$|E

25|$|In 56 AD the Romans {{restored}} {{the city and}} made it part of the colonial province of Lower Moesia. A series of its coins exist that feature heads of Roman emperors from Domitian to Severus Alexander. Soon after {{the time of the}} latter, the city was destroyed again, this time by the invasion of the Goths. Its government was in the hands of five archons, a senate, a popular assembly and a registrar. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> its coins from this period suggest a trade in wheat, wine and fish. The few inscriptions extant are mostly concerned with trade.|$|E
25|$|During the Yayoi Era (400 B.C.E. – 300 C.E.), a {{great number}} of {{technological}} innovations occurred. Unlike the earlier nomadic Jomon people, the Yayoi emphasized having large community settlements and the cultivation of rice. Along with these, they learned how to cast bronze and iron in order to create various metal objects such as weapons, mirrors, and several tools. Among the bronze objects, dotaku, one of the most distinctive objects of the era, were created. In recent years, dotaku have been studied by researchers in order to decipher their origins, how they were created, their various purposes, and the reasons for <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> the main body.|$|E
25|$|Representations {{of sexual}} acts are widely found in Roman art, {{although}} surviving male-female scenes greatly outnumber same-sex couples. It cannot {{be assumed that}} homoerotic art was uncommon as the modern record may be biased due to selective destruction or non-publication of pederastic works in later times. Illustrated drinking cups, often in pairs, were intended as dinner-party conversation pieces. Roman artwork on pottery, glass and wall-paintings with sexual acts represented were popular and were intended {{to be seen by}} all sections of society. The Romans had no word for homosexuality and <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> the Warren Cup provide an important insight into this aspect of their culture.|$|E
