40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{relative}} <b>worst</b> order {{ratio is}} a measure {{for the quality of}} online algorithms. Unlike the competitiveratio, it compares algorithms directly without involving an optimal offline algorithm. The measure has been successfully applied to problems like paging and bin packing. In this paper, we apply it to machine scheduling. Weshow that for preemptive scheduling, the measure separates multiple pairs of algorithms which have the same competitive ratios; with <b>the</b> relative <b>worst</b> order ratio, <b>the</b> algorithm which is &quot;intuitively better &quot; is also provably better. Moreover, we show one such example for non-preemptive scheduling. 1 Introduction <b>The</b> relative <b>worst</b> order ratio is a new quality measure for online algorithms, defined in [4]. Since it comparestwo algorithms directly, it sometimes gives more detailed information than the competitive ratio. So far, the results on <b>the</b> relative <b>worst</b> order ratio have been either consistent with competitive analysis or closer toempirical results and/or intuition than results on the competitive ratio. In this paper we analyze several scheduling problems where the competitive ratio does not give the rightseparation of algorithms, in the hope that <b>the</b> relative <b>worst</b> order ratio would do better. In most of the cases considered, <b>the</b> relative <b>worst</b> order ratio prefers the intuitively best algorithm whereas the competitive ratiodoes not distinguish the algorithms. Analyzing <b>the</b> relative <b>worst</b> order ratio is typically more straightforward than competitive analysis. Unlike the optimal offline algorithm, which is generally not known, we knowexactly what the two compared algorithms do on a given input...|$|R
