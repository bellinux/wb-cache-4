5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>mass</b> media (especially comic books) {{was responsible for the}} rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders <b>that</b> <b>mass</b> killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of factory workers contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E

5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the top speed of Tyrannosaurus was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The speed of Tyrannosaurus was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals reach their maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion dictate <b>that</b> <b>mass</b> has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like Tyrannosaurus exhaust their energy reserves long before they reach their theoretical top speed, resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. The equation can calculate the top speed of an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E
5|$|As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in {{the core}} of a main-sequence star, the {{reduction}} in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within <b>that</b> <b>mass.</b> Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy that supports the higher layers of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the higher layers further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value. As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; it is not simply a narrow line.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1990s, New World Order conspiracism {{was limited to}} two American countercultures, {{primarily}} the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned <b>that</b> <b>mass</b> hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E

It is based on suppositions <b>that</b> <b>masses</b> of black holes can be smaller than Planck’s <b>mass,</b> <b>that</b> dimensionless <b>masses</b> of particles or black holes are a first hint toward development of quantum gravity. It is shown a new way at development of principle of uncertainty, and this principle is more fundamental than wave function. Virtual gravitons are based on a wave function and if it does not exist, they also do not exist. Thus, it is excluded contradiction that ”virtual photons exist in background space-time”. At the same time all is based on the principle that ”gravity is not a force”. 1...|$|R
5|$|Following the Bisho massacre, {{in which}} 28 ANC {{supporters}} and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, Mandela realised <b>that</b> <b>mass</b> action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September. He {{agreed to do}} so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures intended to prevent further Inkatha attacks; de Klerk reluctantly agreed. The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition {{government of national unity}} and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for federalism and Mandela's for unitary government.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the army}} into the Soviet Union, the Einsatzgruppen rounded up and killed Jews and others deemed {{undesirable}} by the Nazi state. Hitler was sent frequent reports. In addition, 2.8 million Soviet {{prisoners of war}} died of starvation, mistreatment or executions in just eight months of 1941–42. As many as 500,000 Soviet prisoners of war died or were executed in Nazi concentration camps {{over the course of}} the war; most of them were shot or gassed. By early 1941, following Himmler's orders, ten concentration camps had been constructed in which inmates were subjected to forced labour. Jews from all over Germany and the occupied territories were deported to the camps or confined to ghettos. As the Germans were pushed back from Moscow in December 1941, signalling that the expected quick defeat of the Soviet Union had failed to materialize, Hitler and other Nazi officials realised <b>that</b> <b>mass</b> deportations to the east would no longer be possible. As a result, instead of deportation, many Jews in Europe were destined for death.|$|E
5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was <b>that</b> <b>mass</b> absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except adjustment to the vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E

5|$|The {{accounts}} differ as {{to exactly}} how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure {{was the result of}} disputes within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al-Dinkizli. Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir not to pay Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury did not have the funds to pay the miri dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al-Dinkizli pressed Zahir to pay the amount, arguing <b>that</b> <b>mass</b> bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh to pay the amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the miri dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships.|$|E
