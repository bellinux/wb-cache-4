25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> across the unit.

The following is a summary of the background of the project, and what occurred during individual concrete placements. The following conclusions were drawn: 1) Side temperatures are cooler and more greatly affected by ambient air temperatures; 2) When the 35 deg F limit was exceeded, it was almost exclusively the center to side differential; 3) The top temperature increases substantially when a new pour is placed; 4) The use of ice and different cement types did seem to affect the overall temperature gain and the amount of time taken for any one placement to reach a peak, but did not necessarily prevent the differentials from exceeding the 35 deg F limit, nor prevent cracking in any placement; and 5) Larger placements have a greater tendency to exceed the differential limit...|$|R

25|$|A {{secondary}} {{effect of the}} superheater was to increase the <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> between inner and outer tubes of the bank, thus encouraging circulation.

25|$|When {{there is}} a high <b>{{temperature}}</b> <b>differential</b> (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0°C (32°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to Carnot efficiency limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18°C (0°F) for air source heat pumps.|$|E

25|$|Air source {{heat pumps}} are {{relatively}} easy and inexpensive {{to install and}} have therefore historically been {{the most widely used}} heat pump type. However, they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source. The higher <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency. In mild weather, COP may be around 4.0, while at temperatures below around 0°C (32°F) an air-source heat pump may still achieve a COP of 2.5.

25|$|Observations of the Red Spot Jr. storm suggest Jupiter {{could be}} in a period of global climate change. This is {{hypothesized}} to be part of an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in Jupiter's atmosphere. These vortices facilitate the heat exchange between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, heat exchange is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles cooling down and the equator region heating up.

40|$|The {{failure to}} {{correctly}} identify {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) significantly contributes to the misdiagnosis of infectious disease. Contrary to the strategy of creating shorter probes to improve SNP differentiation, we created larger probes that appeared to increase selectivity. Specifically, probes with enhanced melting <b>temperature</b> <b>differentials</b> (> 13 × improvement) to SNPs were generated by linking two probes that consist of both a capture sequence and a detection sequence; these probes act cooperatively to improve selectivity over {{a wider range of}} reaction conditions. These cooperative probe constructs (Tentacle probes) were then compared by modeling thermodynamic and hybridization characteristics to both Molecular Beacons (stem loop DNA probes) and Taqman probes (a linear oligonucleotide). The biophysical models reveal that cooperative probes compared with either Molecular beacons or Taqman probes have enhanced specificity. This was a result of increased melting <b>temperature</b> <b>differentials</b> and the concentration-independent hybridization revealed between wild-type and variant sequences. We believe these findings of order of magnitude enhanced melting <b>temperature</b> <b>differentials</b> with probes possessing concentration independence and more favorable binding kinetics have the potential to significantly improve molecular diagnostic assay functionality...|$|R
25|$|Heat {{pumps are}} more {{effective}} for heating than for cooling an interior space if the <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has {{the net effect of}} heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.|$|E
25|$|If a {{glass of}} water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent, the bird will {{continue}} to absorb water and the cycle will continue {{as long as there is}} enough water in the glass to keep the head wet. However, the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water, as long as the head is wet, or as long as a <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> is maintained between the head and body. This differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head; for instance, a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine.

25|$|Stirling engines, {{especially}} those that run on small temperature differentials, are quite large {{for the amount of}} power that they produce (i.e., they have low specific power). This is primarily due to the heat transfer coefficient of gaseous convection, which limits the heat flux that can be attained in a typical cold heat exchanger to about 500W/(m2·K), and in a hot heat exchanger to about 500–5000W/(m2·K). Compared with internal combustion engines, this makes it more challenging for the engine designer to transfer heat {{into and out of the}} working gas. Because of the thermal efficiency the required heat transfer grows with lower temperature difference, and the heat exchanger surface (and cost) for 1kW output grows with (1/ΔT)2. Therefore, the specific cost of very low temperature difference engines is very high. Increasing the <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> and/or pressure allows Stirling engines to produce more power, assuming the heat exchangers are designed for the increased heat load, and can deliver the convected heat flux necessary.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high <b>temperature</b> <b>differential</b> (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a safety concern if released from the engine.|$|E
