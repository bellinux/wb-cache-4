2500|$|In June 1982, an all-new Cervo was presented. Based on the {{underpinnings}} {{of the recently}} changed Alto/Fronte, the Cervo now sported front-wheel drive with a <b>transversally</b> <b>mounted</b> four-stroke engine. The F5A engine {{was the same as}} used in the SS40 Fronte. A twin-choke carb meant a whopping [...] was available, rather than the [...] in the [...] "cooking" [...] Alto/Mighty Boy. The Cervo offered a lower, much more sporty driving position than its Alto/Fronte sister cars. Anyone over 172cm (5ft 8 in) would certainly hit their head on the ceiling. Strangely, considering its supposedly sporty character, the Cervo was higher geared than its Fronte sister car. Top speed, however, either remained the same as the [...] of the Fronte (according to one source), or a little bit higher, at , according to another. To distinguish the Cervo from the other SS40 versions, its model code was SS40C (Alto: SS40V, Fronte: SS40S, Mighty Boy: SS40T).|$|E

5000|$|The H1 has an I4, 20V {{turbocharged}} 1.8L engine, {{the same}} as used in the Brazilian Volkswagen Golf GTI, <b>transversally</b> <b>mounted</b> {{in front of the}} rear axle. It attains [...] at 5700 rpm, and makes the H1 go from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds. With this engine, the car has a maximum speed of 225 km/h.|$|E
25|$|Scottish seiners are {{basically}} configured {{the same as}} anchor seiners. The only difference is that, whereas the anchor seiner has the coiler and winch <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> amidships, the Scottish seiner has them <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> in the forward part of the vessel.|$|R
25|$|Anchor seiners {{have the}} {{wheelhouse}} and accommodation aft {{and the working}} deck amidships, thus resembling side trawlers. The seine net is stored and shot from the stern, and they may carry a power block. Anchor seiners have the coiler and winch <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> amidships.|$|R
5000|$|The 3.0 L (2927 cc) V8 was <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> {{integrally}} {{joined with}} the 5-speed transaxle gearbox.The engine had an aluminium alloy block and heads, 16-valves and dual overhead camshafts driven by toothed belts; it produced [...] in the European version and [...] in the American. The induction system used four Weber 40 DCNF carburetors.|$|R
50|$|The 1980-1985 Skylark was Buick's badge {{engineered}} {{version of}} GM's new X-body architecture, {{shared with the}} Chevrolet Citation, Pontiac Phoenix, and Oldsmobile Omega and would bear some resemblance to the larger G-body mid-size cars. GM's X-body would become the basis for GM's A-body mid-size cars that would be introduced as 1982 models. The new front-wheel drive Skylark {{was introduced in the}} spring of 1979 as an early 1980 model featuring front wheel drive, MacPherson strut front suspension and <b>transversally</b> <b>mounted</b> engine. The new optional 60 degree 2.8 L V6 was designed specifically for the X-cars. This platform became the basis for nearly all future GM front wheel drive vehicles, but like the other X-body cars was plagued by numerous reports of a tendency to lock the rear wheels upon braking, causing it to lose control and crash.|$|E
5000|$|The Soviet T-44 {{incorporated}} many of {{the lessons}} learned with the extensive use of the T-34 model, {{and some of those}} modifications were used in the first MBTs, like a modern torsion suspension, instead of the Christie suspension version of the T-34, and a <b>transversally</b> <b>mounted</b> engine that simplified its gearbox. It's also seen as direct predecessor of the T-54, as the T-44 was the first Soviet tank with a suspension sturdy {{enough to be able to}} mount a 100 mm cannon. The legendary T-54 was the first Soviet MBT, with the first prototype produced in 1945, and [...] "was used more extensively that any other Cold War or modern MBT to date... being largely associated with colonial or independence wars all around the globe and still one of the most common pieces of equipment of any armored force today".|$|E

50|$|Both Marussia sports {{models are}} mid-engined, {{with the engine}} <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> on the back axle.The English company Cosworth {{supplies}} Marussia with two different V6 engines. One is a naturally aspirated 3.5 litre producing about 300 horsepower {{and the other is}} a 2.8 litre turbo-charged engine offered in 360 or 420 horsepower variants. The 420 horsepower engine allows Marussia cars to reach a claimed top speed of 250 km/h and acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The high-revving {{character}} and {{dry-sump oil system}} both meant that the 1300's engine should be a natural for racing, and soon the RSC (Racing Service Club, Honda's competition department) built the mid-engined, tubular framed Honda R·1300. Next, in the 1969 Japan GP the similar Can-Am style Carman-Apache made its racing debut, with a Honda 1300 engine tuned to 135 PS (at 7,000 rpm) <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> in the middle. Weight was a mere 490 kg. The car only made 29 laps (out of 120) before retiring, but continued to race with some modest success through the next year.|$|R
50|$|Dielectric {{resonators}} are {{pieces of}} dielectric material {{inserted into the}} waveguide. They are usually cylindrical since these {{can be made with}}out machining but other shapes have been used. They can be made with a hole through the centre which is used to secure them to the waveguide. There is no field at the centre when the TE011 circular mode is used so the hole has no adverse effect. The resonators can be mounted coaxial to the waveguide, but usually they are <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> across the width as shown in figure 8. The latter arrangement allows the resonators to be tuned by inserting a screw through the wall of the waveguide into the centre hole of the resonator.|$|R
40|$|A vehicle start/stop {{engine system}} is {{investigated}} with focus on human perception of discomfort. The FRF between engine rotational acceleration around the neutral torque axis (NTA) and seat rail acceleration {{with the specific}} interest in start up and shut down events is estimated from measurements, using a shaker torque excitation. The inverted torque sensitivity formulates a frequency dependent target of powertrain torque related to seat rail acceleration. The main rotation direction for the <b>transversally</b> <b>mounted</b> engine is the pitch-direction, yielding high acceleration levels in both longitudinal x-, and vertical z-direction compared to the lateral y-direction. Specific weighting functions are used to normalize these accelerations to human perception. Acceleration levels in x-, and z-direction at the seat rail are similar after weighting curves have been applied. The amount of discomfort experienced by a person depends on vibration amplitude, frequency, direction and time duration. However, {{there is no evidence}} on in what way a specific time dependence affects the perceived comfort. The NTA around which the engine as a rigid body rotates is experimentally estimated and verified by comparing to the reference CAD NTA. The powertrain mounting system center of gravity is assumed to be known from the CAD model. The seat rail is found to be a more convenient measurement position to use in order to achieve reproducible results rather than the seat cushion. This, since the acceleration at the cushion also depends on several other factors such as person size, weight and body posture and also on the non-linear properties of the seat foam padding...|$|E

50|$|Z-bar and roll-inducing springs: Mercedes-Benz introduced, to {{help their}} low-pivot swing-axle, a coil spring <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> above the differential, which would {{transfer}} load {{from one side to}} the other, so as to force down one wheel when the other side went up. This coil spring increases the load bearing capacity of the rear suspension, so a new lower pressure set of springs was substituted for the usual ones to maintain ride suppleness. A similar effect was achieved by VW's Z-bar, a roll-bar, as opposed to anti-rolling bar. Both devices increase the rolling tendency of the rear axles, thus reducing the oversteering tendency. Aftermarket roll-inducing springs, also called camber compensators, are available for Porsche, VW and early Corvairs, which reduce oversteering tendencies at the cost of increasing suspension harshness.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was equipped}} with four identical motors which were mounted fixed in the frames. The fully sprung drives were different on each frame, therefore the locomotive was also nicknamed Bastard. On side 1Tschanz driveswere mounted. The basic feature of this drive was the gimbal principle for the transmission of the torque between the big gearwheel, {{which was part of}} the gearbox connected to the unsprung motor, and the suspended drive axle. Because the gimbal-drives were able to be very short it was possible to omit - in contrast to the Be 2/5 - the hollow shaft {{to the other side of}} the locomotive. The diameter of the big gearwheel was limited by the loading gauge, therefore the cog transmission had to be cascaded in two steps because the engine speed of all four motors was identical. Side 2 contained single side mounted Buchli drives. Due to the great weight of those drives they were <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally.</b> The installation of the drive on both sides - as was used on the Be 2/5 - was not considered necessary any more.|$|R
5000|$|The car uses a {{fiberglass}} {{body with}} two-seats and a mid-mounted engine, either from Volkswagen do Brasil or from Fiat Automóveis. The Fiat-engined car {{was the first}} one to appear and has a single overhead cam of 1.3 litres with [...] which was also used in the Fiat Spazio TR and Uno SX. It was called the ML 929 to honor the mother of Alfio Russo, Maria Luisa, who was born in 1929. The more powerful TS 1.6 appeared in April 1981 and uses the engine (and badging) from the Volkswagen Passat TS, it has [...] Both models have a four-speed manual transmission, but as is the case for their donor cars the TS 1.6 has a longitudinally mounted engine while the ML 929s engine is <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally.</b> In 1984 the Beta appeared, very similar to the TS 1.6 but fitted with 1.8 or 2.0 liter engines from the Chevrolet Monza (a Brazilian-built Opel Ascona C). A year later a convertible version of the Beta was also added to the pricelist. A version of the Beta/Spider, fitted with Chryslers 2.2 litre [...] "Turbo I" [...] engine, was meant to spearhead Farus entry into the US market. However, although 1,500 reservations were taken after showing the car at the 1987 New York Auto Show, the investments needed to enter series production were too high and the project ended up cancelled. Meanwhile, the mid-engined Farus also became available with the 2.0 liter Volkswagen engines (petrol or alcohol) used in the Volkswagen Santana.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{experimental}} results of Magica II are presented and discussed; Magica II is a parallel hybrid prototype entirely {{designed by the}} Department of Nuclear Engineering and Energy Conversions at University of Rome “La Sapienza” [1], realized and tested in collaboration with ENEA - the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment [2]. Magica II {{is characterized by a}} mechanical layout directly derived from the original Ma. Gi. Ca. (an acronym from Eng. MArtellucci, Eng. GIuffrida and Prof. CAputo) Project: it is a two-seat spider, or convertible, with space frame rolling chassis and fiberglass body. An engine and an electric drive acting respectively on rear and front wheels make up the propulsion system. The engine is placed in central position, <b>mounted</b> <b>transversally</b> behind the seats. It is equipped with mechanical gearbox and final drive that transmit the traction power to the rear wheels. The electric drive is placed on front axle, in transversal position, connected to the final drive by a single speed gearbox. In central position, just under the two seats, takes place the energy storage system, made up by ultracapacitors - 90 elements of 1200 Farad each. The supervising CPU (central processing unit) is a PC/ 104 -standard platform based on x 86 microprocessor architecture that realizes also the acquisition of electrical and mechanical data; it has been programmed with rapid-prototyping and realtime techniques in Matlab/Simulink® and its xPC Target toolbox environment. In ENEA Research Center “Casaccia” road tests have been performed and the collected data are presented in this paper; energy flow evaluations of this HEV configuration and software management optimization are discussed, in order to evaluate in particular the benefits of adopting a light ultracap storage system...|$|R
