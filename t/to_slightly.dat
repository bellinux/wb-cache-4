5|$|Lactarius deterrimus {{belongs to}} the section Deliciosi of the genus Lactarius. According to {{molecular}} phylogenetics studies, this section forms a definite phylogenetic group within the milk cap relatives. Deliciosi species mainly have an orange or reddish-coloured latex and taste mild <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> bitter. They are strict mycorrhizal associates of conifers. The next closest relative of L.deterrimus is L.fennoscandicus.|$|E

5|$|While {{some wild}} {{narcissi}} are specific {{in terms of}} their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions, however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage. The optimum soil is a neutral <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> acid pH of 6.5–7.0.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek is a {{perennial}} stream with relatively poor water quality. However, {{it is not}} considered to be impaired. Its pH ranges from slightly acidic <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> alkaline and has a daily sediment load of nearly 14 million pounds (31 million kilograms) per day. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Catskill Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. The main soils include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil.|$|E
5|$|Background {{selection}} {{is the opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E

5000|$|Upland Soils: Upland {{soils are}} found on <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> {{severely}} dissected lowland, high volcanic and metamorphic hills. These soils have complex smooth and sharp ridges, undulating to very steep slopes, clayey to fine loamy textures, well drained, shallow <b>to</b> moderately <b>slightly</b> <b>to</b> moderately erode, and no flooding. A total of 15,886 ha or 26% of the municipality’s total land area {{is covered by}} upland soils.|$|R
5|$|Little {{can be said}} of the {{evolutionary}} history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a pinkish color, but has no reaction with the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) has no reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction or a brownish reaction with the flesh. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution does not have a reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare is {{endemic to}} the central Ethiopian Highlands, occurring in the Afroalpine regions of Ethiopia. It occurs on the central plateau of the Shoa Province, and {{in the mountains of}} Bale and Arsi Province except in the Great Rift Valley which parts the two provinces. The complete distribution of the Ethiopian highland hare, according to Angermann, falls in between 6° 50' N and 9° 35' N latitudes, and 38° E and <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> east of 40° E longitudes.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is fairly}} narrow-bodied and has greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head lack distinct lobes. The eyes are oval and widely spaced; closely behind are crescent-shaped spiracles with large, boxy projections inside their anterior rims. Each nostril is large and preceded by a small flap of skin bearing two barbels; the outer barbel is thin, while the inner barbel has a spoon-like tip and a smooth <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> fringed flange at the base. The wide mouth is terminally placed and has furrows at the corners. There are 10 tooth rows on either side of both jaws, separated by a gap in the middle; the teeth are small, narrow, and pointed. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{engaged in}} trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare, exotic goods {{not found in}} Egypt. In the Predynastic Period, they {{established}} trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense. They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs. An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> before the First Dynasty. Narmer had Egyptian pottery produced in Canaan and exported back to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of magnesium {{in the waters}} of Buffalo Creek ranges from nearly 0 to almost 15 milligrams per liter. The concentration is close to 0 for the first third of the creek's course, but then rises to two or three milligrams per liter. The magnesium concentration reaches its peak around halfway between the source and the mouth, then steadily declines <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> under ten milligrams per liter at the mouth. However, one of Buffalo Creek's tributaries has a magnesium {{concentration of}} nearly 35 milligrams per liter.|$|E

5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by hammering the boss from the inside <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland collapsed dramatically {{during the second}} half of the 19th century. A {{population of}} over 8 million in 1841 was reduced <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was due to death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|According to its literature, the Livestock Conservancy {{is funded}} by grants, sales of {{publications}} and promotional materials, membership dues and public donations. Publications sold include books on conservation and genetics, livestock husbandry, farming operations and breed guides. In the 1998 fiscal year, the organization claimed slightly over US$308,000 in income, coming mainly from public donations and membership dues, but also including service revenue, investment income and sales of goods. By 2009, this amount had jumped <b>to</b> <b>slightly</b> more than US$440,000, mainly from donations, grants and service revenue, but also including investment income. In 1998, the organization claimed slightly over US$288,000 in expenses, allocated mainly to program services, but with just under US$30,000 stemming from management, fundraising and general expenses. By 2009, expenses stood at almost US$490,000, spent mostly on employee salaries, benefits and other compensation (which includes program service expenses), but with almost US$150,000 stemming from management, fundraising and general expenses. The organization claims around 3,000 members as of 2009, a number up from 2,300 in 1989. It operates {{with a staff of}} nine, headed by an executive director, and a nineteen-member board of directors.|$|E
