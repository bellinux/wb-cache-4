The Károlyi government planned <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> on 21 March 1919, but {{the establishment of the}} Soviet Republic postponed these plans. Finally, the banknotes (the denominations from 10 to 10000 Krone / korona) were overstamped from 18 March 1920. Hungary used a red, round stamp to mark the banknotes.|$|E
25|$|Secondary flight {{controls}} include the rotor transmission clutch, {{also known as}} a pre-rotator, which when engaged drives the rotor <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> spinning before takeoff, and collective pitch to reduce blade pitch before driving the rotor. Collective pitch controls are not usually fitted to autogyros, but {{can be found on the}} Air & Space 18A and McCulloch J-2 and the Westermayr Tragschrauber and are capable of near VTOL performance. Unlike a helicopter, autogyros without collective pitch or another jump start facility need a runway to take off; however, they are capable of landing with a very short or zero ground roll. Like helicopters, each autogyro has a specific height–velocity diagram for safest operation, although the dangerous area is usually smaller than for helicopters.|$|E

But they lost 2–1. In the {{following}} game Jim Lonborg pitched a no-hitter until the 8th inning when Julián Javier hit a leadoff double. Carl Yastrzemski hit two home runs in a 5–0 victory. The Series then shifted to St. Louis. In the third game Cardinal Nelson Briles pitched a 5–2 victory, Reggie Smith homered for the Sox. In game 4 Gibson shut out Boston 6–0 in a complete game victory. Down 3 games to 1 the Red Sox had Jim Lonborg to start game five. He pitched a 3-hitter and catcher Elston Howard hit a bloop single that gave them the win. In game six at Fenway Park, Manager Dick Williams started rookie pitcher Gary Waslewski <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> in an 8–4 victory. In the 4th inning Carl Yastrzemski, Reggie Smith and Rico Petrocelli hit home runs. Rico also homered in the 2nd inning. In game 7 Gibson won against Lonborg 7–2 to end the season.|$|E
25|$|By 1984, the Canavia STOL plan using Dash-7s {{was still}} not in service, {{grounded}} {{due to a lack}} of financing. The Government of Canada was waiting for Canavia before spending on a new microwave navigation system, but committed $4 million to the airport for various improvements, such as a new sewage system and a new seawall. Canavia faced a deadline of June 30, 1984, but had not raised the capital to purchase the needed Dash 7s, and found itself unable to buy any in April 1984 until October 1984 as the DeHaviland assembly line was booked. The Government of Canada refused to extend the deadline and company president John Gilmore made a special visit to see Transport Minister Lloyd Axworthy to appeal for more time. Approaching the deadline, Axworthy gave Canavia another year to launch, but revoked the monopoly on the routes and allowed Bradley Air Services (First Air) and Air Atonabee to both purchase and operate Dash 7s on the route. Air Atonabee, sold by founder Joseph Csumrik to Victor Pappalardo and renamed City Express, purchased a Dash 7 and planned <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> on the route in August.|$|E
25|$|Otto Grunf is a {{naturalized}} German-born inventor. He is {{a former}} Luftstreitkräfte mechanic who fought in the First World War, and he defected from the German army after his mechanical incompetence caused the airplane of the Red Baron to crash. He moved to America and changed his last name from Grunt to Grunf to avoid detection, and is mentioned to also serve in Second World War. He serves as the inventor, fabricator and the mechanic of the TNT group. Running gag in the series is his incompetence: he usually designs various Rube Goldberg machines that end up in failure, fails to properly service or change the vehicles or weaponry (driving a 1910s era car that usually explodes while attempting <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> or brandishing an 1880s revolver), or invents things that already exist (he claims to have invented the skateboard, which he named Skate-Grunf). Despite his heroic-like behavior and staunch belief in bravery (as seen by quotes stamped on his T-shirts), {{he is a very}} cowardly man, constantly running from danger. He usually dresses in a World War I-era flying ace uniform with goggles. He is very loyal and devoted to Number One and never is on his odds. His job is usually to drive Number One around New York (in other words, push his wheelchair around).|$|E

500|$|He {{then began}} his project {{of writing a}} book of one {{thousand}} mainly French quatrains, which constitute the largely undated prophecies {{for which he is}} most famous today. Feeling vulnerable to opposition on religious grounds, however, he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using [...] "Virgilianised" [...] syntax, word games and a mixture of other languages such as Greek, Italian, Latin, and Provençal. For technical reasons connected with their publication in three installments (the publisher of the third and last installment seems to have been unwilling <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> {{in the middle of a}} [...] "Century," [...] or book of 100 verses), the last fifty-eight quatrains of the seventh [...] "Century" [...] have not survived in any extant edition.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 1790, Forster and the young Alexander von Humboldt started from Mainz on a long journey through the Southern Netherlands, the United Provinces, and England, {{eventually}} finishing in Paris. The impressions from the journey were described in a three volume publication Ansichten vom Niederrhein, von Brabant, Flandern, Holland, England und Frankreich im April, Mai und Juni 1790 (Views of the Lower Rhine, from Brabant, Flanders, Holland, England, and France in April, May and June 1790), published 1791–94. Goethe said about the book: [...] "One wants, after one has finished reading, <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> over, and wishes to travel with such a good and knowledgeable observer." [...] The book includes comments on the history of art that were as influential for the discipline as A Voyage Round the world was for ethnology. Forster was, for example, one of the first writers who gave just treatment to the Gothic architecture of Cologne Cathedral, which was widely perceived as [...] "barbarian" [...] at that time. The book conformed well to the early Romantic intellectual movements in German-speaking Europe.|$|E

500|$|Sébastien Mitton, {{who acted}} as art {{director}} {{on the first}} game, returned to the position for Dishonored 2. Viktor Antonov, who also helped conceive of Dishonoreds [...] "painterly" [...] look, had moved on as a general creative consultant for Bethesda and thus was less involved {{in the art of}} Dishonored 2. Arkane drew on paintings and sculptures for the art design, and had Lucie Minne mold several clay busts. The game begins and ends in the city of Dunwall, the setting of the first game, with most of the game taking place in Karnaca, [...] "the jewel of the south". The change in setting in part was out of a desire to show another corner of the series' Empire. On using both settings, Harvey Smith commented that Arkane felt [...] "we need <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> at home ... and then venture out into an exotic place and come back". Mitton wanted Dishonored 2 to be a visual [...] "journey to a new city", though keeping the same sensibility of the first game and elements like oppression, disease, magic, and decay.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} in the subway was {{initially}} {{going to be on}} top of a building so that the episode would begin and end the same, but co-creator J.J. Abrams thought it would be better <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> underground and [...] "move up throughout the episode". The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a [...] "sense of unease". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the [...] "hardest set to shoot at on the planet" [...] because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving {{back and forth on the}} 59th Street Bridge.|$|E

Marcus then walks over to his car and tries <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it,</b> but notices a bomb in the car's engine and runs away shortly before it explodes. Soon after, at the police station, Michael and Bird tell Marcus that they will protect him. Marcus' wife, Alina (Ayelet Zurer), comes into the station, where Marcus explains what has happened. Shortly after talking with Marcus and Alina, Michael and Bird take the couple to a hotel for temporary shelter.

500|$|Christy also {{calculated}} {{the area that}} would become contaminated if an accidental explosion occurred. A site in Los Alamos Canyon was selected that was a safe distance from the township and downstream from the water supply. Known as Omega, it {{was approved by the}} Governing Board on 19 August 1943. The Water Boiler was not simple to construct. The two halves of the [...] stainless steel sphere that was the boiler had to be arc welded because solder would be corroded by the uranium salt. The CM-7 (Miscellaneous Metallurgy) Group produced beryllia bricks for the Water Boiler's tamper in December 1943 and January 1944. They were hot pressed in graphite at [...] at [...] for 5 to 20 minutes. Some 53 bricks were made, shaped to fit around the boiler. The building at Omega Site was ready, if incomplete, by 1 February 1944, and the Water Boiler was fully assembled by 1 April. Sufficient enriched uranium had arrived by May <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> up, and it went critical on 9 May 1944. It was only the third reactor in the world to do so, the first two being the Chicago Pile-1 reactor at the Metallurgical Laboratory and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works. Improved cross-section measurements allowed Christy to refine his criticality estimate to 575 grams. In fact, only 565 grams were required. The accuracy of his prediction surprised Christy more than anyone.|$|E
500|$|Although its {{gameplay}} {{was mainly}} well received, the game's long loading times were criticised. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb noted Wipeout 2048 technical issues, particularly its loading times. IGN's Cam Shea called the 30-second loading times frustrating [...] "when {{all you want}} to do is race", and Gameplanet's Adam Goodall also described the long loading times as awful, though he felt they were not enough to make the game a failure and assured the overall gameplay experience [...] "deeply satisfying". GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey said that the game's online mode was well-executed, highly accessible and a [...] "credit to Wipeout." [...] She said that its user interface appeared clean and shiny, and called the touchscreen-based menu system [...] "a pleasure to behold". The Guardian Simon Parkin criticised the game's protracted loading times; a pause at least twenty seconds too long had a negative effect in the era of [...] "insta-fix mobile gaming on the rival platforms". Willington found the lengthy load times an issue which plagues the game, [...] "totally at odds" [...] with the normal pace of gameplay. Gaston said that the loading times were [...] "simply unforgivable"; he routinely waited over 50 seconds after selecting a race <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it,</b> which minimised the ability to comfortably play the game [...] "on the go". Walton also found the long loading times infuriating in a handheld game, and said that having to wait more than 40 seconds to start a race was far longer than it should have been. Although Furfari found that the game had one of the longest loading times on the PlayStation Vita, it was not a [...] "deal breaker" [...] and Wipeout 2048 was one of the few racing titles for the console that he recommended. Although Haley noted the game's substantial loading times, he said that was a common feature in PlayStation Vita launch titles.|$|E

2500|$|Another type of tube {{does not}} have {{filaments}} <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>it</b> at all. [...] Instant start fluorescent tubes simply use a high enough voltage {{to break down the}} gas and mercury column and thereby start arc conduction. These tubes can be identified by a single pin {{at each end of the}} tube. The lamp holders have a [...] "disconnect" [...] socket at the low-voltage end which disconnects the ballast when the tube is removed, to prevent electric shock. In North America, low-cost lighting fixtures with an integrated electronic ballast use instant start on lamps originally designed for preheating, although it shortens lamp life. This ballast technology isn't common outside North America.|$|E

In cold weather, the oil congealed on the cylinder walls and on the clutch plates. The engine had to be hand cranked repeatedly with great effort.
