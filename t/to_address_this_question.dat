25|$|William I of the Netherlands {{appealed to}} the great powers that had placed him on the throne after the Napoleonic Wars to {{maintain}} his rights. The London Conference of 1830 was called <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> The British solution involved the independence of Belgium, which Palmerston believed would greatly contribute {{to the security of}} Britain, but any solution was not straightforward. On the one hand, the northern powers were anxious to defend William I; on the other, many Belgian revolutionaries, like Charles de Brouckère and Charles Rogier, supported the reunion of the Belgian provinces to France. The British policy was a close alliance with France, but one subject to the balance of power on the Continent, and in particular the preservation of Belgium. If the northern powers supported William I by force, they would encounter the resistance of France and Britain united in arms. If France sought to annex Belgium, it would forfeit the British alliance and find herself opposed by the whole of Europe. In the end the British policy prevailed. Although the continent had been close to war, peace was maintained on London's terms and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, the widower of a British princess, was placed upon the throne of Belgium.|$|E

2500|$|Controversy {{persists}} {{over whether}} the Rus' were Varangians (Vikings) or Slavs. This uncertainty is due largely to a paucity of contemporary sources. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> instead rely on archaeological evidence, the accounts of foreign observers, legends and literature from centuries later. To some extent the controversy {{is related to the}} foundation myths of modern states in the region. According to the [...] "Normanist" [...] view, the Rus' were Scandinavians, while Russian and Ukrainian nationalist historians generally argue that the Rus' were themselves Slavs. Normanist theories focus on the earliest written source for the East Slavs, the Russian Primary Chronicle, although even this account was not produced until the 12th century. Nationalist accounts have suggested that the Rus' were present before the arrival of the Varangians, noting that only a handful of Scandinavian words can be found in modern Russian and that Scandinavian names in the early chronicles were soon replaced by Slavic names. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence from the area suggests that a Scandinavian population was present during the 10th century at the latest. On balance, {{it seems likely that the}} Rus' proper were a small minority of Scandinavians who formed an elite ruling class, while the great majority of their subjects were Slavs. Considering the linguistic arguments mounted by nationalist scholars, if the proto-Rus' were Scandinavians, they must have quickly become nativized, adopting Slavic languages and other cultural practices.|$|E

First, the sequence of economic vs political reforms matters: countries liberalizing their economy before extending political rights do better. Second, different forms of democratic government lead to different economic policies, and this might explain why presidential democracy leads to faster growth than parliamentary democracy. Third, it is important to distinguish between expected and actual political reforms. Taking expectations of regime change into account helps identify a stronger growth effect of democracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ A central {{question}} in strategic management is why some firms perform better than others. One approach <b>to</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> empirically is <b>to</b> decompose {{the variance in}} firm-level profitability into firm, industry, location, and year components.

We conduct a meta-regression and variance decomposition study and conclude that the variation in the results from previous studies is driven—to a considerable extent—by the number of observations per group within a component. Based on these findings, we draw conclusions regarding the validity and reliability of previo us variance decomposition studies and provide implications for current debates in the strategic management literature...|$|R

An Oklahoman like Rogers, Brown was curious about Rogers' influence and popularity in the 1920s and 1930s. Brown researched the source of Rogers' ability to be persuasive and authoritative and concluded that it arose from Rogers' ability to embody and reflect characteristics that the U.S. public associated with the American dream. The book describes American dream attributes, such as [...] "the dream of the dignity and worth of the individual, of freedom and equality, of success, and of progress," [...] and shows how Rogers symbolically identified with them. Although Brown acquired an in-depth understanding of American dream ideology, he later reported that the research left him wondering how social systems construct ideology. <b>To</b> <b>address</b> <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> Brown began reading books and articles on language, philosophy, rhetoric, and linguistics.|$|E
