5|$|VP4 is on {{the surface}} of the virion that {{protrudes}} as a spike. It binds to molecules {{on the surface of}} cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell. VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin, which is found in the gut, into VP5* and VP8* before <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> infectious. VP4 determines how virulent <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> and it determines the P-type of the virus.|$|E

5|$|Like most arboviruses, dengue {{virus is}} {{maintained}} in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts. The viruses are maintained {{in the forests}} of Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female Aedes mosquitoes—of species other than A. aegypti—to their offspring and to lower primates. In towns and cities, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> primarily transmitted by the highly domesticated A. aegypti. In rural settings <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> transmitted to humans by A. aegypti and other species of Aedes such as A. albopictus. Both these species had expanding ranges {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating dengue viruses, in a process called amplification.|$|E
5|$|HIV can infect {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, {{but another}} route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN {{can also be}} used. DCs {{are one of the}} first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought {{to play an important role}} by transmitting HIV to T-cells when <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs naturally in neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.|$|E

5|$|The {{incubation}} period between contraction {{and the first}} obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days. Once inhaled, variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the respiratory mucosa, migrates to regional lymph nodes, and begins to multiply. In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, lysis of many infected cells occurs and <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> found in the bloodstream in large numbers (this is called viremia), and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.|$|E

5|$|Doomsday is a 2008 {{science fiction}} action horror film written and {{directed}} by Neil Marshall. The film takes place in the future in Scotland, which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> found in London, political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including Mad Max, Escape from New York and 28 Days Later.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the {{neurological}} {{phase of}} infection {{is thought to}} be an accidental diversion of the normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary viremia. The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the blood into the central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier independent of CD155. A second hypothesis suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been bathed in the viremic blood, for example muscle tissue, to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via retrograde axonal transport. A third hypothesis is that <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> imported into the CNS via infected monocytes or macrophages.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the tonsils (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> {{isolated}} from <b>the</b> A. americanum nymph, it was inoculated into many test animals including: newborn and full-grown mice, woodchucks, raccoons, {{as well as}} chicken and duck eggs. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> most pathogenic to the newborn mice, causing death in many of them. In the full grown mice, their reaction to <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> determined by how <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> inoculated in them. Mice who received <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> intraperitoneally, showed no reaction or symptoms to <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> However about seventy-five percent of mice who were inoculated in their cerebrum showed sickness or even death, due to <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> One out of the six woodchucks studied showed signs of being infected while the others had no response to the inoculation. Only raccoons developed antibodies against <b>the</b> <b>virus,</b> and did not show any other signs of being exposed. The chicken and duck eggs were not affected in any way.|$|R
5000|$|The alleged {{author of}} <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> {{questioned}} by <b>the</b> Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) soon after <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> discovered.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Avian {{encephalomyelitis}} virus-infected chick embryo homogenate was precipitated with polyethyleneglycol 6000 (PEG), extracted with fluorocarbon, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and purified by isopycnic gradient centrifugation. The {{physical and}} chemical properties of <b>the</b> purified <b>virus</b> <b>were</b> studied. <b>The</b> examination of purified avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV) with electron microscopy using negative stain revealed <b>virus</b> particles which <b>were</b> icosahedral in shape, lacked an envelope, and had a mean diameter of 26 ± 3 nm. It was suggested that the viral capsid was composed of 12 capsomers located at the vertices of an icosahedron. <b>The</b> <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> tentatively given a triangulation number of one, and included in the icosahedral class P = 1. The sedimentation coefficient (S₂₀, w) of AEV was determined to be 148 ± 3 S.

5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of {{hantavirus}} infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, {{have been found in}} marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Another pathogenic bacterium, Bartonella, is known from Georgia marsh rice rats.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> {{spread through the}} air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both {{before and during the}} time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E
