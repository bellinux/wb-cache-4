The Blue Crystal Rod was in reality the Dark Crystal Rod, which resonated with a seed planted in Ki's body. Although this seed had been repressed by Ishtar's providence, by agreeing to marry Gil, Ki was required {{to give up her}} position as a shrine maiden and with it, Ishtar's protection. The seed then awakened and killed everyone but Ki. Skulld, Ishtar reveals, is none other than Ki, who had transcended time with Ishtar's blessing. Although Skulld/Ki succeeded in saving Gil, this was by kidnapping Ki before her marriage to Gil. By preventing Ki from marrying Gil, Ki never loses Ishtar's protection and thus, the seed inside her is never unleashed. However, this also means that Ki is herself trapped in a time loop in which she abducts her past self; transfers her knowledge of the seed to the imprisoned Ki; and is defeated by Gil. Thus Gil and Ki are trapped in Druaga's [...] "nightmare". Ishtar informs Gil that the only way <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> is to return to from before Druaga's original defeat at Gil's hand, and there retrieve the true Blue Crystal Rod.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{behavioral}} activation approach utilized {{a different}} methodology: clients {{are asked to}} {{develop an understanding of}} relationship between actions and emotions, with actions being seen as the cause of emotions. An hourly self-monitoring chart is created to track activities and the impact on the mood they create for a full week. A rating scale from 1 to 10 is used for each mood change per hour. The goal is to identify depression loops. A depression loop is when a temporary coping method increases the overall depression, such as the temporary relief provided by alcohol or other drugs, escape or avoidance or rumination. When patterns of dysfunctional responding, or loops, are identified alternative coping responses are attempted <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop.</b> This method is described with the acronym [...] "TRAP" [...] (Trigger, Response, Avoidance Pattern [...] ) which is to be replaced with a [...] "TRAC" [...] (Trigger, Response, Alternate Coping response). Particular attention is given to rumination, which is provided with its own acronym RCA (Rumination Cues Action). Rumination is identified as a particularly common avoidance behavior which worsens mood. The client is to evaluate the rumination in terms of it having improved the thing being ruminated about, providing understanding, and its emotional effects on the client. Attending to experience is suggested as an alternative to rumination as well as other possible distracting or mood improving actions.|$|E

40|$|Current leisure {{mobility}} {{patterns are}} not sustainable. Because energy efficiency measures appear insufficient to accommodate predicted future volume growth, changes in transportation modes and volume are needed. Short-haul {{should be the}} preferred distance, public transportation the preferred mode and length of stay should increase rather than trip frequency. However, tourists are unwilling to adopt these changes. This paper proposes a new conceptual “three-gear model” demonstrating how happiness, travel motivations and perception of distance set barriers for desirable behavioral change. The model improves understanding of the gap between awareness of, and attitudes to, tourism mobility and the gap between environmentally friendly everyday behaviors and unsustainable vacation behaviors. The paper shows that happiness is integral to all stages of the tourist experience. Understanding happiness enhances the understanding of tourist behavior, and how it drives, via <b>the</b> speed–distance–demand <b>loop,</b> <b>the</b> three-stage model presented here. Key practical implications include the need for effective policies <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> speed–distance–demand <b>loop,</b> changes <b>to</b> transport infrastructure policies, and recognition {{of the role of}} happiness in sustainable tourism strategies. Theoretical contributions include a synthesis of theories to interrogate key behavioral gaps and a theoretical basis for future empirical studies...|$|R

But it also create a very critical problem of looping, means different bridges add the different information of the node in the their table of different sub-network, so that the data move again and again in same subnetworks and creates a infinite loop.

Current asynchronous design tools require a significant re-education of designers, and their capabilities are far behind synchronous commercial tools.

40|$|Many {{improved}} differential Evolution (DE) algorithms {{have emerged}} as a very competitive class of evolutionary computation {{more than a decade}} ago.

This paper developed a convergent DE algorithm in theory, which employs a self-adaptation scheme for the parameters and two operators, that is, uniform mutation and hidden adaptation selection (haS) operators. The parameter self-adaptation and uniform mutation operator enhance the diversity of populations and guarantee ergodicity. The haS can automatically remove some inferior individuals in the process of the enhancing population diversity. The haS controls the proposed algorithm <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> of current generation with a small probability.

40|$|We {{introduce}} BETS, {{a behavioral}} test synthesis system, for {{the synthesis of}} high-throughput, area-efficient testable designs. While hardware sharing is a powerful technique to achieve area efficiency, it may adversely affect the testability of the synthesized design by introducing new loops. Besides CDFG loops, hardware sharing introduces three other types of loops: assignment loops, sequential false loops, and register files cliques. We provide a comprehensive analysis and a formal grammar characterization of <b>the</b> sources of <b>loops</b> in <b>the</b> data path during behavioral synthesis. Partial scan is a cost-effective technique for sequential circuit testing. Hardware sharing of scan registers {{can be used to}} minimize the number of scan registers required to synthesize data paths with minimal number of <b>loops.</b> <b>The</b> scan registers can be shared amongst several variables of <b>the</b> CDFG, <b>to</b> <b>break</b> not only <b>the</b> <b>loops</b> in <b>the</b> CDFG, but also <b>the</b> very <b>loops</b> introduced in <b>the</b> data path by hardware sharing.

40|$|Musicians {{are subject}} {{to a wide range}} of medical and {{performance}} problems related to the physical and psychological demands of their profession. Such problems are usually diagnosed and treated in relation to a specific cause, for example direct treatment to reduce inflammation. While holistic factors are increasingly acknowledged, currently lacking is a mechanistic understanding of how cognitive, physiological and mechanical factors combine to cause specific symptoms. This thesis provides a conceptual explanation and experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that most specific symptoms arise from a common general mechanism. The first section “Review of Literature” provides a general, mechanistic explanation of how injury and dysfunction can arise from misconception, the rules of neuromuscular function, lack of awareness and reinforcement (wind-up) of symptoms. Within a perception-selection-action feedback loop, misconception and lack of awareness of the consequences of maladaptive selection, ensures consequences {{are subject to}} destructive (positive) feedback, until the system “breaks” at the individual’s weakest point. This hypothesis suggests that a general solution lies in educational feedback and inhibitory action <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> at the point of selection. The second section presents an experimental study (i) to establish whether in playing, violinists and violists exhibit a common diagnosable musculokinematic pattern unnecessary for performance, and (ii) to test a methodology for revealing and reducing that pattern in individuals. Full-body, kinematic and electromyographical data showed that external feedback (ultrasound feedback of the neck muscles and verbal feedback of movement) resulted in progressive reductions in the extent to which a common musculokinematic pattern was exhibited.
