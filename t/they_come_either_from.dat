40|$|In agent {{models of}} {{manufacturing}} {{it is hard}} to reconcile autonomy and cooperation. The paper proposes a solution to this problem {{within the context of a}} dynamic production scheduling problem. Our organizational model is based on economic concepts, uses market rules and an incentive mechanism. The solution integrates dynamic order processing, advance least-commitment scheduling and dispatching. 1 INTRODUCTION Manufacturing needs new organizational principles and structures to face new challenges: customer{driven production in a volatile market environment, globalization, the potential of electronic commerce and virtual enterprises, and the need of integrating human resources. Redundant functions and distributed responsibilities, tasks and resources are necessary for responding to changes, let <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>either</b> <b>from</b> internal disturbances or from external market conditions [11]. Transformations of manufacturing organizations already point toward network-like, dynamic and recongurabl [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The course {{timetable}} {{construction is}} {{a procedure that}} every academic department has to carry out at least twice annually, more times {{if some of the}} requirements change. These requirements indicate that a collection of elements must be taken in mind in order for an acceptable solution to be found. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>either</b> <b>from</b> the inherent constraints of the problem or from the involved parties, namely teachers and students. A requirement that is very dicult to satisfy is the one of optimality, which means that the constructed timetable should be the best among the legal ones, according to some quantied quality criteria. In this paper, a method for tackling the course timetable construction problem for academic departments is presented, which is based on Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) for the early pruning of the search space and on the usage of intelligent heuristics in order to guide the search to the generation of nearly optimum solutions. A specic system is presented, named ACTS (Automated Course Timetabling System), which has been implemented in the ECL i PS e language. This system is currently in use by the Department of Informatics of the University of Athens for the purpose of aiding the semester course timetable construction...|$|E
40|$|The {{attraction}} of Schistosoma mansoni miracidea by snails genetically selected for susceptibility to infection is considered. Miracidea {{were exposed to}} snails or to snail conditioned water in a specially devised three-chamber glass apparatus. Ten miracidea were used for each test and were deposited in the middle chamber (a passage); after 15 minutes, them {{in each of the}} number of the three chambers were recorded. In one of the chambers, chosen randomly at each trial, either snails or SCW were used. The snails and the SCW were chosen <b>from</b> <b>either</b> selected snails (highly susceptible) or unselected. The miracidea were of two groups: <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>either</b> <b>from</b> susceptible snails in previous generation or were of unselected traits. The results show that only snail generation has importance for the attraction: selected molluscs of susceptible traits do attract the miracidea more...|$|R
60|$|In the {{neighbourhood}} of the emirs' tents {{there was}} some sort of attempt at order, in the arrangement of the little shelters, showing where the men of their tribes were encamped. Beyond, straggling out for some distance, were small encampments, in some of which the men were still erecting shelters, with the bushes the women and boys brought in. Most of these were evidently fresh arrivals, who had squatted down as soon as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> up; <b>either</b> <b>from</b> ignorance as to where their friends had encamped, or from a preference for a quiet situation. This fringe of new arrivals extended along the whole semicircle of the camp; and as several small parties came up while Gregory wandered about, and he saw that no notice was taken of them by those already established, he thought that he could bring Zaki, and the horses up without any fear of close questioning. He therefore walked down again to the spot where he had left them; and, mounting, they rode to the camp, making a wide sweep so as to avoid the front facing Metemmeh.|$|R
50|$|The term Igorot or Ygolote was {{the term}} used by Spanish conquerors for {{mountain}} people. The Ifugaos, however, prefer the name Ifugao {{which came from}} the word ipugo(human beings in English). Although majority of them already converted to Roman Catholic from their original animistic religion, from their mythology, they believed that they descended from Wigan and Bugan, who are the children of Bakkayawan and Bugan of the Skyworld (Kabunyan). Scholars, however, have differing theories about the true origin of Ifugaos. The two most prevailing theories are that <b>they</b> <b>either</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> the Magat area because of the Spanish military penetration there before, or from the western Mountain Province if you base it on the similarities of their language and culture. The Ifugao popular epic, The Hudhud of Dinulawan and Bugan of Gonhadan, however, favors the theory that <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from the Magat Area.|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest that}} the highest energy> ∼ 1020 eV cosmic ray {{primaries}} may be relativistic magnetic monopoles. Motivations for this hypothesis are that conventional primaries are problematic, while monopoles are naturally accelerated to E ∼ 1020 eV by galactic magnetic fields. By matching the cosmic monopole production mechanism to the observed highest energy cosmic ray flux we estimate the monopole mass to be ∼ 1010 ± 1 GeV. 1 Since their identification more than eighty years ago[1], cosmic rays have been {{a constant source of}} mystery and discovery. Of particular interest is the recent intriguing discovery of cosmic rays with energies above the GZK[2] cut–off at ∼ 5 × 1019 eV. Any proton energy above the cut–off is degraded by resonant scattering of the proton primary off the 3 K cosmic background radiation to produce the ∆ ∗ which then decays to nucleon plus pion. The mean free path for this process is ∼ 6 Mpc for protons above the cut–off energy, and so if protons are the primaries for the highest energy cosmic rays <b>they</b> must <b>either</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a rather nearby source (< ∼ 50 Mpc according to [3] and < ∼ 100 Mpc according to [4]) or have an initial energ...|$|R
40|$|Learning {{to program}} is difficult. The skill {{requires}} one to model {{a real problem}} in abstract form and expressing it in a logical structure and detail programming language. Teaching programming to student is also a challenging task to instructors. In Universiti Utara Malaysia, introductory programming course is a compulsory for various program such as Bachelor in Information Technology, Bachelor in Multimedia, Bachelor in Decision Science and Bachelor in Education specializing in Information Technology. The unique characteristic of the students taking this course is that <b>they</b> may <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>either</b> the science or non-science background. This is in contrast with previous studies related to predicting student's potential in first programming course that usually involved computer science undergraduate students. The current student's achievement in programming courses is not very encouraging and this could add with the current problem of high unemployment statistics of IT graduates who are lacking in the technical and communication skill besides business knowledge. This study is an initial step in identifying the possible factors that influence a student's success in programming. This knowledge will assist teaching instructor in designing the appropriate pedagogical approach that is suitable for the students that we anticipate {{not be able to}} perform well. Respondents for this study were selected using systematic sampling based on list of students who has taken introductory programming given by Academic Affairs Department. The instruments were distributed to the respondents. As for the data analysis, data mining process is used to help identify the possible factors based on the data selected. Classification technique is used to obtain the predictive model and clustering technique for the descriptive model. SAS Enterprise Miner was used to assist in the data analysis. Based on the findings, mathematical and aptitude test score is a strong explanatory variable for student's success in programming. In terms of personality, Investigative is a dominant type among students who are good in programming. Teaching instructor need to use alternative approach for other students in order to improve their understanding and skill in the subject...|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest that}} the highest energy> ∼ 10 20 eV cosmic ray {{primaries}} may be relativistic magnetic monopoles. Motivations for this hypothesis are twofold: (i) conventional primaries are problematic, while monopoles are naturally accelerated to E ∼ 10 20 eV by galactic magnetic fields; (ii) the observed highest energy cosmic ray flux is just below the Parker limit for monopoles. By matching the cosmic monopole production mechanism to the observed highest energy cosmic ray flux we estimate the monopole mass to be < ∼ 10 10 GeV. The recent discoveries by the AGASA [1], Fly’s Eye [2], Haverah Park [3], and Yakutsk [4] collaborations of cosmic rays with energies above the GZK [5] cut–off at Ec ∼ 5 × 10 19 eV present an intriguing challenge to particle astrophysics. The origin of the cut–off is degradation of the proton energy by resonant scattering on the 3 K cosmic background radiation; above threshold, a ∆ ∗ is produced which then decays to nucleon plus pion. For every mean free path ∼ 6 Mpc of travel, the proton loses 20 % of its energy on average. So if protons are the primaries for the highest energy cosmic rays <b>they</b> must <b>either</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a rather nearby source (< ∼ 50 to 100 Mpc [6]) or have an initial energy far above 10 20 eV. Neither possibility seems likely, although the suggestion has been made that radio galaxies at distances 10 to 200 h − 1 100 Mpc in the supergalactic plane may be origins [7]. A primary nucleus mitigates the cut–off problem (energy per nucleon is reduced by 1 /A), but has additional problems: above ∼ 1019 eV nuclei should be photo–dissociated by the 3 K background [8], and possibly disintegrated by the particle density ambient at the astrophysical source. Gamma–rays and neutrinos are other possible primary candidates for these highest energy events. However, the gamma–ray hypothesis appears inconsistent [9] with the time–developmen...|$|R
60|$|Most of the {{passengers}} at starting were English and American; but they showed no prescience of the international affinition which has since realized itself, in their behavior toward one another. They held silently apart, and mingled only in the effect of one young man who kept the Marches in perpetual question whether he was a Bostonian or an Englishman. His look was Bostonian, but his accent was English; and was he a Bostonian {{who had been in}} England long enough to get the accent, or was he an Englishman who had been in Boston long enough to get the look? He wore a belated straw hat, and a thin sack-coat; and in the rush of the boat through the raw air they fancied him very cold, and longed to offer him one of their superabundant wraps. At times March actually lifted a shawl from his knees, feeling sure that the stranger was English and that he might make so bold with him; then at some glacial glint in the young man's eye, or at some petrific expression of his delicate face, he felt that he was a Bostonian, and lost courage and let the shawl sink again. March tried to forget him in the wonder of seeing the Germans begin to eat and drink, as soon as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> on boards <b>either</b> <b>from</b> the baskets they had brought with them, or from the boat's provision. But he prevailed, with his smile that was like a sneer, through all the events of the voyage; and took March's mind off the scenery with a sudden wrench when he came unexpectedly into view after a momentary disappearance. At the table d'hote, which was served when the landscape began to be less interesting, the guests were expected to hand their plates across the table to the stewards but to keep their knives and forks throughout the different courses, and at each of these partial changes March felt the young man's chilly eyes upon him, inculpating him for the semi-civilization of the management. At such times {{he knew that he was}} a Bostonian.|$|R
