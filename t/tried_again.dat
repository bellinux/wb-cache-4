5|$|In 2012, Allen {{along with}} his {{research}} team and the Royal Navy attempted to retrieve the bell from , which sank in the Denmark Strait during World War II, but the attempt failed due to poor weather. On August 7, 2015, they <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> and recovered the bell in very good condition. It was further restored and put on display in May 2016 in the National Museum of the Royal Navy in remembrance to the 1,415 men lost at sea.|$|E

5|$|Treatt {{first entered}} {{politics}} at the 1927 state election as an Independent Nationalist candidate for the Legislative Assembly seat of Willoughby. He narrowly lost on a margin of 49.47%. After several years Treatt <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> to enter parliament at the 26 March 1938 state election as the United Australia Party candidate for the seat of Woollahra. On this occasion he was successful, gaining 53.62% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking on}} a load of steel, Empire Cheetah sailed for Halifax, {{and then on to}} Newport, Monmouthshire as a part of convoy HX 122, {{arriving}} on 9 May.

5|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman <b>tried</b> <b>again.</b> This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion and tanks. Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to better {{conditions}} for the farmer (by which Tillman always meant white males only), in 1884 he founded the Edgefield Agricultural Club. It died for lack of members. Undeterred, Tillman <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> in January 1885, beginning the Edgefield County Agricultural Society. Its membership also dwindled, but Tillman was elected one of three delegates to the August joint meeting of the state Grange and the state Agricultural and Mechanical Society at Bennettsville, and was invited {{to be one of}} the speakers.|$|E
5|$|Marthinus Pretorius {{hoped to}} achieve either {{federation}} or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, {{but before he}} could contemplate this he would have to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but Stephanus Schoeman, Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts.|$|E
5|$|Mölders joined an {{infantry}} regiment of the Reichswehr in Allenstein, East Prussia on 1 April 1931. After {{completing his}} basic military training in October 1932, {{he transferred to}} the Military School Dresden. On 1 June 1933, he successfully completed his training in Dresden and was promoted to ensign. He again was transferred, this time to the 1st Prussian Pioneer Battalion (Infantry Regiment 2) at the Pioneer School in Munich. During his training years, Mölders made his first attempt to fulfil his dream of flying and volunteered for pilot training, but was declared unfit for flying. He <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> and was given conditional permission (bedingt tauglich—with constraints) to begin flight training.|$|E

5|$|On November 31, Smyth <b>tried</b> <b>again,</b> {{ordering}} his men {{to embark}} two hours before dawn {{in order to avoid}} enemy fire. This time, the embarkation was so slow that, two hours after daylight, only 1,500 men were on board. Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight, Smyth once again postponed the invasion. By this time, morale in Smyth’s command had plummeted: “all discipline had dissolved; the camp was a bedlam”. This, and widespread illness among the troops, persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{insurers}} {{applied to}} the Earl of Mansfield to have the previous verdict set aside and for the case to be <b>tried</b> <b>again.</b> A hearing {{was held at the}} Court of King's Bench in Westminster Hall from 21–22 May 1783, before Mansfield and two other King's Bench judges, Mr Justice Buller and Mr Justice Willes. The Solicitor General, John Lee, appeared on behalf of the Zong owners, as he had done previously in the Guildhall trial. Granville Sharp was also in attendance, together with a secretary he had hired to take a written record of the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than Hamilton, and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren {{on the inside of}} turn four. His first attempt was on lap three, but Hamilton braked late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner. Massa <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> at the same place on the next two laps. He passed Hamilton briefly into the turn on lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass. He dropped to fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the {{autonomous}} Arab {{ruler of the}} Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. In order to build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but {{did not succeed in}} taking the city. In 1773, he <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.|$|E
5|$|Jane Pierce died of {{tuberculosis}} in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in May 1864; {{he was with}} Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the 1864 presidential election unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December, Canadian forces <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> and The Royal Canadian Regiment {{attacked}} Cider Crossroads at noon. This time, Vokes {{was determined}} that the operation would be successful, with armoured forces of the Three Rivers Regiment moving to the start lines well before 07:00. Due to shortages of fuel and poor weather, H-Hour was postponed until 14:15. When H-Hour came, a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the Royal Canadian Regiment eastward. By evening, B Company controlled the Cider Crossroads, having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective. However, German forces had already evacuated The Gully, falling back {{to prepare for a}} strong defence of Ortona, with elements of the powerful 1st Parachute Division firmly entrenched in the town.|$|E

5|$|On 29 May 2000, Suharto {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} when Indonesian {{authorities}} began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, {{it was announced that}} he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to {{one of a number of}} foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. But in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> in 2002 but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110m (£55m).|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Panzer Army was {{monitoring}} the operation closely. The {{report of a}} special troop, which had been sent into the Partisans’ rear {{with the help of}} disguised Chetniks several days earlier, drew particular attention from Rendulic. According to this report, received late on 25 May, Tito was in the area of Potoci, halfway between Drvar and Ribnik. Rendulic ordered the commander of the 7th SS Division to immediately form a special company-strong detachment, with a mission to infiltrate behind the Partisan lines in order to kill Tito and destroy the Partisan Supreme Command. The detachment was formed on the night of 25/26 May from the 11th Company of the 13th SS Regiment, a number of pioneers, and a group of specially trained personnel from the Brandenburg Division. As the detachment failed to penetrate into the Partisan territory that night, it <b>tried</b> <b>again</b> the following night.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Tone and {{his companions}} <b>tried</b> <b>again,</b> this time persuading {{the government of the}} Batavian Republic, which was under French occupation, to prepare their own expedition. During 1797, the Dutch fleet was readied and provisioned, intending to combine with the French fleet and launch a second invasion attempt. The Batavian fleet sailed on a preparatory raiding cruise in the North Sea in October 1797 and on their return were confronted off the Dutch coast by the Royal Navy's North Sea Fleet under Admiral Sir Adam Duncan. Duncan immediately attacked, and in the ensuing Battle of Camperdown captured or destroyed ten ships and scattered the rest, ending the Batavian invasion threat.|$|E
