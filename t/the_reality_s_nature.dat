Theoretically, I develop a more general model for the causal interrelationship between incarceration and unemployment that integrates admission, release, and employment effects. Empirically, I show that the causal effect of incarceration on unemployment is (1) considerably smaller than previously reported; (2) not large enough to noticeably impact U. S. -European performance differentials; and (3) potentially increasing, rather than decreasing the official U. S. unemployment rate. I further demonstrate that the forced inactivity of the U.

The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via [URL] France was struggling {{to find ways to}} shape its national history and cultural heritage following the Revolution, an unknown author in a minor genre was reflecting on what the recent social and political upheaval meant for the celebrated protagonists of France’s past and present.

This article explores this question first as it appeared in <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of 1790 <b>s</b> France – from the ‘impossible’ Panthéon, to the reimagining of pre-revolutionary cultural icons – then as it is set out in Pagès’ text, which brings together pre- and post-revolutionary greats, and examines their relative ‘gloire’. I underline the contentious nature of the ‘grand homme’ in the revolutionary decade, and suggest that the capacity of literary creation to provide a durable but flexible form of cultural memory is one of the reasons for the renewed popularity of the dialogue des morts in this period...|$|R

40|$|Through {{this paper}} {{we have tried}} to {{question}} <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of EU’ <b>s</b> integration and to identify the factors that shaped it. The complexity of this process led to multiple perspectives of analyzing it. We believe that Neo- Gramscian theory of European integration, although not so well-known, can be considered the most appropriate methodological support in explaining the events that have redefined the European integration: the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty, the financial crisis and the emergence of the Lisbon Treaty. We started from the assumption that the EU has obvious neo-liberal connotations, which led to the emergence of functional obstacles difficult to overcome, {{especially when it comes to}} the social dimension of the EU. Therefore, we divided the work into two basic parts, the first explains the methodology used, the main concepts, what neo-liberalism is and which are the EU’ s neo-liberal expressions and in the second part we focused on the social dimension of the EU, talking about the lack of substance that we found in the rhetoric of Fundamental Rights. Using the trade unions we have exemplified the inability of the EU to cope with social challenges, especially since there are forms of skepticism focused strictly on social discontent. The conclusions confirm that the Neo-Gramscian theory is the most suitable methodological support in an attempt to capture the nuances of EU’ s neo-liberal expressions...|$|R

40|$|Suomalaisilla lapsilla yli 20 %:lla on ainakin yksi pitkäaikaissairaus, ja yli 5 %:lla todetaan kasvuiän lopussa pysyvä vamma tai sairaus. Täten olisi kiinnitettävä enemmän huomiota siihen, miten perheet selviävät lapsen sairauksien, diagnosoinnin ja hoidon henkisestä kuormituksesta. Perhekeskeisyyttä on pidetty perinteisesti terveydenhuollossa tapahtuvan hoitamisen periaatteena, vaikkakin sen toteutumisessa on ollut puutteita. Tutkimuksen tarkoituksena on kuvata, miten terveydenhuollon ammattilaiset voivat edistää perheen terveyttä lapsen sairaalahoidon aikana. Tulosten mukaan sairaanhoitajat toimivat kolmella eri tavalla hoitaessaan perheitä: systemaattisesti, selektiivisesti ja tilannesidonnaisesti. Systemaattisesti toimivat hoitajat kohtasivat kaikkien perheiden todellisuuden: he vahvistivat vanhemmuutta, huolehtivat lapsen hyvinvoinnista, auttoivat perhettä purkamaan tunnekuormaansa, tukivat arjessa selviytymistä sekä rakensivat luottamuksellista hoitosuhdetta perheen kanssa. Selektiivisesti toimivat hoitajat valikoivat perheet, joiden he olettivat tarvitsevan apua ja joihin he siis paneutuivat työssään. Tällöin perheiden hoitaminen perustui hoitajien käsitykseen perheen tilanteesta ja avun tarpeesta eikä perheen yksilölliseen näkökulmaan ja tilanteen määrittelyyn. Tilannesidonnaisessa hoitotyössä lähtökohtana oli hoitaa eteen tulevat tilanteet hyvin. Tämänkaltainen toiminta ei edellyttänyt perheeseen tutustumista eikä systemaattista tiedon keruuta perheen tilanteesta, minkä takia myöskään tilanteiden kärjistymistä perheissä ei pystytty ennakoimaan. Hoidon kohteena pidettiin lasta. Perhettä kohdanneisiin tilanteisiin puututtiin vain, jos lapsen turvallisuus oli uhattuna. Selektiivisesti ja tilannesidonnaisesti toimivat hoitajat sivuuttivat perheen todellisuuden. He eivät kokeneet tarpeelliseksi perehtyä perheen muuttuneeseen tilanteeseen eivätkä aktivoineet perheen voimavaroja. Tällöin hoidon lähtökohtana oli hoitajien käsitys perheen tilanteesta ja avun tarpeesta. On syytä pohtia, miksi osa hoitajista huomioi perheen yksilöllisen tilanteen ja avun tarpeen kohdaten perheen todellisuuden, ja miksi osa hoitajista sivuutti perheen todellisuuden nojautumalla omaan käsitykseensä perheen tarpeista. Kaikki perheenjäsenet eivät aina koe tarvitsevansa apua terveydenhuollon ammattilaisilta. Perheen terveyden edistämisen lähtökohtana ovatkin perheen yksilölliset tarpeet, halu tulla autetuksi ja perheen ja terveydenhuollon ammattilaisten avoin ja vastavuoroinen yhteistyö. Promoting {{health of}} a somatically and chronically ill child's family - an action {{research}} on a paediatric ward The purpose of the research was to build a substantive theory of promoting family health during the child s somatic chronically illness, as well as assess and promote family nursing on a pediatric ward by means of action research. Action research took a critical, participatory approach that acted {{as the basis of}} theory development. The aim of the development was to create an intervention to the nursing which would promote the health of the family. The data consisted of 31 family interviews (n= 82 family members), nurses (n= 40) group interviews (n= 9) and observation of the interaction between families and nurses (84 h). The data were collected in pediatric wards in two different hospitals where chronically ill children below the age of 16 are being cared. One of the wards was a target unit of family nursing development, and from the other ward, data were collected in order to confirm the validity of the results and to ensure the anonymity of the participants. Data analysis was based on the grounded theory -method with its straussian approach applied. Cooperation between the researcher and the nurses resulted in a family consultation ­intervention in the nursing. Family consultations were applied in the target unit for 10 months, after which the nurses (n= 17) described their experiences of the functionality of the intervention in practice in essays they wrote. Head nurses (n= 2) were interviewed about the same subject. Essays and interviews were analysed by using deductive content analysis -method. Nurses faced family <b>s</b> <b>reality</b> or they bypassed it during the child s illness and the hospital stay. When <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of a family was faced, the basis of the nursing was family s individual situation and need of help. When <b>the</b> family <b>s</b> <b>reality</b> was bypassed, <b>the</b> basis of the nursing was the nurses view on the situation of the family and their need of help. Nurses who worked systematically faced family <b>s</b> <b>reality.</b> Systematically operating nurses faced <b>the</b> family <b>s</b> <b>reality</b> since they observed the changes that had occurred within the family s health and their effects on the whole family, not to mention that they activated family s resources. Changes occurred in the functions of the ill child, the siblings, the parents and their relationship {{as well as those of}} the whole family during the child s illness and the hospital stay. The families expected the nurses to reinforce parenthood, look after the child s welfare, share the emotional burden, support everyday coping and to create a confidential care relationship. Systematically operating nurses promoted above-mentioned constituent systems of family health. Family consultation -intervention, which was developed in the research, enhanced systematically performed nursing. Selectively and situation-specifically operating nurses bypassed family <b>s</b> <b>reality,</b> for neither did they observe the changes that occurred within a family, nor did they activate the resources of a family. Furthermore, they promoted constituent systems of family health only randomly. In that case the basis of the nursing was the nurses view on the situation of the family and their need of help. According to the results, parents of a chronically ill child need help in reinforcing parenthood, sharing the emotional burden as well as in everyday coping. Nurses have particularly good possibilities to respond to this need by facing <b>the</b> family <b>s</b> <b>reality</b> during <b>the</b> child <b>s</b> illness and the hospital stay. It is necessary to consider why some of the nurses regarded the individual situation of the family to be the basis of their work and why some nurses bypassed family <b>s</b> <b>reality</b> by considering their work s very basis to be their own view on the family s situation and need of help. Family-centred care was a central guiding principle in both children s wards concerned. The substantive theory built in the research strengthens the knowledge base of family nursing science by making the promotion of families health a more visible part in the nurse s work. In the future the theory must be tested and developed further in different contexts and with various patient groups. In the research, family consultation -intervention was created in cooperation between the researcher and the nurses. In the research, family nursing was also developed while applying the methods of action research. The functionality and the stability of the family consultation in nursing, as well as its application on different nursing environments and the effects of consultation on families health give indication for further research...|$|R
