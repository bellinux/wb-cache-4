5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high {{premiums}} for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured. Studies by the CBO, Gruber and Rand Health concluded that a mandate was required. The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs. Experience in New Jersey and Massachusetts offered divergent outcomes.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans to}} reform <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> were delayed {{due to the}} Second World War, but the {{increased}} need of medical care due to injuries to the soldiers may have enhanced {{the development of the}} hospital network. In the 1950s, Finland had two university hospitals, in Helsinki and Turku. Due to the increased demand of medical care and lack of medical doctors, more medical faculties and university hospitals were established.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} a {{commercial}} organ trade is linked to economic reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s that saw a steep decline in government funding to <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>system.</b> Healthcare moved toward a more market-driven model, and hospitals devised new ways to grow their revenue. This pattern also applies to military hospitals; since the mid-1980s, the People’s Liberation Army has engaged in commercial and profit-making ventures to supplement its budget.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To compare {{perceptions}} {{of the quality of}} ophthalmological services offered to outpatients from <b>the</b> public <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> to those from <b>the</b> private <b>healthcare</b> <b>system,</b> and to determine which measures are seen as necessary and a priority for improving the quality of care. Methods: This was a prospective observational study on 200 patients, 101 and 99 of whom were from the public and private <b>healthcare</b> <b>systems,</b> respectively. All patients underwent an ophthalmological examination at an ophthalmology hospital in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Personal interviews were conducted using two structured questionnaires adapted from the modified SERVQUAL scale. Results: Overall, patients from <b>the</b> private <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> were significantly more dissatisfied than those from <b>the</b> public <b>healthcare</b> <b>system.</b> In both systems, reliability was considered {{to be the most important}} determinant of quality, and it presented the highest level of dissatisfaction. Satisfaction with <b>the</b> public <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> was significantly greater than that with <b>the</b> private <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> in terms of the tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, and assurance determinants of the SERVQUAL scale. Conclusions: Institutions must plan, execute, evaluate, and monitor measures that seek to improve the overall patient satisfaction with the quality of services provided, particularly in <b>the</b> private <b>healthcare</b> <b>system,</b> and special attention must be paid to reliability in both <b>healthcare</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>The</b> identification and monitoring of <b>the</b> quality of <b>healthcare</b> services through <b>the</b> periodic use of the SERVQUAL scale may provide healthcare managers with information so that they can identify, plan, and monitor necessary and priority measures. This could be a key strategy for improving the quality of outpatient health services in the public and private systems...|$|R

In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis. This places a large economic burden on <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population.

25|$|By 2007, it was {{recognized}} that outreach to most patients who would need personal assistance from health advocates {{would have to}} come from the private sector.

A new organization, The Alliance of Professional Health Advocates, was founded to support those new private advocates, plus those considering such a career, with legal, insurance, marketing and other business advice.|$|E

Since then, the PRC has taken a much more active and transparent role in combating the SARS epidemic.|$|E
