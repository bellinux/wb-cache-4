2500|$|George Devol {{applied for}} the first {{robotics}} patents in 1954 (granted in 1961). [...] The first company to produce a robot was Unimation, founded by Devol and Joseph F. Engelberger in 1956. Unimation robots were also called programmable <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> since their main use at first was to transfer objects from one point to another, less than a dozen feet or so apart. They used hydraulic actuators and were programmed in joint coordinates, i.e. the angles of the various joints were stored during a teaching phase and replayed in operation. [...] They were accurate to within 1/10,000 of an inch (note: although accuracy is not an appropriate measure for robots, usually evaluated in terms of repeatability - see later). [...] Unimation later licensed their technology to Kawasaki Heavy Industries and GKN, manufacturing Unimates in Japan and England respectively. [...] For some time Unimation's only competitor was Cincinnati Milacron Inc. of Ohio. This changed radically in the late 1970s when several big Japanese conglomerates began producing similar industrial robots.|$|E

50|$|The idea of {{the first}} hand-transfer {{machining}} line, which was operated by 21 men, evolved in 1923. Then, in 1924, the first automated <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> was introduced {{for the production of}} gearbox cases, which were moved from station to station by compressed air. A second automated <b>transfer</b> <b>machine,</b> for the production of flywheels, was also set up in 1924. These machines were something Morris Engines Ltd. were justifiably proud of and they encouraged the public to see the process. American engineers judged the production systems to be 20 years ahead of their time.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} part of the 4CV's success was due to the new methodologies used in its manufacture, pioneered by Pierre Bézier. Bézier had begun his 42-year tenure at Renault as a tool setter, moving up to tool designer and then becoming head of the Tool Design Office. As Director of Production Engineering in 1949, he designed the transfer lines (or <b>transfer</b> <b>machines)</b> producing most of the mechanical parts for the 4CV. The <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> were high-performance work tools designed to machine engine blocks. While imprisoned during World War II, Bézier developed and improved on the automatic machine principle, introduced before the war by General Motors (GM). The new transfer station with multiple workstations and electromagnetic heads (antecedents to robots), enabled different operations on a single part to be consecutively performed by transferring the part from one station to another.|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} the first to develop {{mechanical}} materials handling equipment known as automatic <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> to facilitate flow production, which some 25 years later would become common in the global automotive industry. Overall, Woollard’s contribution to progressive manufacturing management practices is substantial and comparable to Taiichi Ohno at Toyota. He was a great early 20th century pioneer in progressive management, flow production, and industrial automation.|$|E

50|$|Rotary <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> are {{commonly}} used for mass-production of metal parts in the automotive industry and for pneumatic and hydraulic fittings. The parts can range from simple to complex, depending on {{the layout of the}} machining tool, which is often custom designed for manufacturing of a single part or family of parts. Rotary arrangement presents a compact arrangement which saves floor space. Annual production capacity of one rotary transfer machine can range from 100'000 units to tens of millions of units.|$|E
50|$|In rotary <b>transfer</b> <b>machines,</b> the {{workpieces}} {{are located}} and clamped in pallet type fixtures that are indexed {{in a circular}} path. During one cycle, sequential machining operations are performed simultaneously on the workpieces. The indexed table turns vertically or horizontally, and its movement could be continuous or intermittent. As the indexing table turns, the subsequent machining operation is repeated on the workpiece which was just machined by the previous station. This design combines automated part feed with simultaneous operations, enabling rapid completion of parts.|$|E
5000|$|Barrier <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> can {{typically}} {{move their}} barrier segments anywhere between 4 and 24 ft in one pass, usually {{at a speed}} between 5 and 10 mph. Some models of the machine hold 50 ft of barrier at a time as they are engaged in transferring. [...] The machine can transfer within the regular traffic flow without hindering other vehicles:“Admirably engineered, the barrier-moving process does not compromise traffic flow in either direction, and the truck is shielded by the blocks it's moving. If you're traveling {{in the same direction}} as the truck, the lane it's working behind is already blocked. And if you pass the vehicle at the speed limit, you can safely move into the lane ahead of it. Oncoming motorists, meanwhile, are prevented from entering the zipper's lane by the concrete barriers in front of it, and they can move into a lane after they have passed the truck.” --Ann L. Rappoport, Philly.comUpon completing its pass, some barrier <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> can be moved across outside traffic lanes away from the area. However, other systems simply park in a median between their movable barrier and an affixed barrier to keep them from impeding traffic flow. [...] A barrier transfer machine that operates outside of Honolulu has its own garage in the space between viaducts.|$|E

40|$|A {{problem of}} the optimal design of a rotary <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> with turrets for {{machining}} multiple parts is considered. Parts are located at the loading position of rotary table in a given sequence and they are processed simultaneously on several working positions. At each working position, several machining modules can be installed to process the operations assigned to this position. They are activated sequentially or simultaneously. Constraints related {{to the design of}} machining modules, turrets, and working positions, as well as precedence constraints related to operations, are given. The problem consists in minimizing the estimated cost of the <b>transfer</b> <b>machine,</b> while reaching a given output and satisfying all the constraints. The proposed method is based on solving a sequence of subproblems generated using MIP-recombination...|$|R
50|$|In {{its last}} years, Cinema Products was still innovative. A film to HD video <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> was introduced, novel {{in that the}} HD camera {{was not part of}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> but mounted on it. An upgrade would be easy, just change the HD camera, the film {{transport}} deck stayed the same. A fiber optic-based 35 mm ground glass to video chip reducer was patented and sold to a competitor. A consumer-oriented Steadicam unit designed for small mini DV cameras was added to the Steadicam line. The Steadicam Jr. incorporated an 8-layer non-glare LCD video monitor comparable to the professional Steadicam rigs. The Steadicam line became the company's leading marketable product. Tiffen Filter bought the rights to make the Steadicam when Cinema Products Corporation went out of business in 2000.|$|R

50|$|Handschiegl {{described}} the invention thus: A separate, black-and-white print for each color {{to be applied}} was made. Using an opaque paint, portions of the image where color was to be applied were blocked out. A duplicate negative was made from the painted print and developed in a tanning developer, which hardened the gelatin layer {{where it had been}} exposed and developed. Those areas corresponding to the blocked out areas on the print remained relatively soft and capable of taking up dye. This dyed matrix film was brought into contact, in accurate register, with a positive print, to which the dye transferred in the appropriate areas. The print made several passes through the dye <b>transfer</b> <b>machines,</b> in contact with a separate matrix for each color. Usually, three colors were applied at the most.|$|E
