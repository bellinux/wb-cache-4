50|$|The Cucconi test {{is not as}} {{familiar}} as other location-scale tests but it is of interest for several reasons. First, from a historical point of view it is of interest because it was proposed some years before the Lepage test, the standard rank test for the two-sample location-scale problem. Secondly, it is of interest {{because it is not}} a combination of a test for location and a test for scale as the other location-scale tests. Thirdly, it compares favorably with Lepage <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> in terms of power and type-one error probability and very importantly it is easier to be computed because it requires only the ranks of one sample in the combined sample, whereas the other tests also require scores of various types as well as to permutationally estimate mean and variance of test statistics because their analytic formulae are not available.|$|E
40|$|The rotary <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> machine {{undergoes}} {{mechanical stress}} as an external force is applied. In {{case of the}} rotary <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> machine, even a tiny flaw results in a fatal demage because {{the size of the}} machine is huge. Therefore, when designing the rotary <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> machine, it is necessary to secure a safety factor with the mechanical stress analysis in order to prevent the machine from being destroyed due to scattering or transformation of rotating field. This thesis proposes a LSM rotary type tesitng machine which rotates at the speed of up to 600 km/h. And the mechanical stress is considered in order that the safety factor remains above 1. 5 at the maximum speed. In addition, because normal force as well as thrust occurs in the machine, the normal force exerted was considered through the strength analysis. Finally, a design plan which enables to weaken the normal force affecting the rotary <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> machine is introduced and its validity is proved by the results of FEM analysis. ? ??? ??????????? ???? ?? ??(???? e???? ?????? ??, ?? ??PK 1501 A) ? ???? ???????...|$|R

50|$|The third {{edition of}} the TTCT in 1984 {{eliminated}} the Flexibility scale from the figural test, but added Resistance to Premature Closure (based on Gestalt Psychology) and Abstractness of Titles as two new criterion-referenced scores on the figural. Torrance called the new scoring procedure Streamlined Scoring. With the five norm-referenced measures that he now had (fluency, originality, abstractness of titles, elaboration and resistance to premature closure), he added 13 criterion-referenced measures which include: emotional expressiveness, story-telling articulateness, movement or actions, expressiveness of titles, syntheses of incomplete figures, synthesis of lines, of circles, unusual visualization, extending or breaking boundaries, humor, richness of imagery, colourfulness of imagery, and fantasy. According to Arasteh and Arasteh (1976) the most systematic assessment of creativity in elementary school children has been conducted by Torrance and his associates (1960a,1960b, 1960c, 1961,1962,1962a,1963a 1964), who have developed and administered the Minnesota Tests of Creative Thinking (MTCT), which was later renamed as the TTCT, to several thousands of school children. Although they have used many of Guilfords concepts in their test construction, the Minnesota group, in contrast to Guilford, has devised tasks which can be scored for several factors, involving both verbal and non-verbal aspects and relying on senses other than vision. These tests represent a fairly sharp departure from the factor <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> developed by Guilford and his associates (Guilford, Merrifield and Cox, 1961; Merrifield, Guilford and Gershan,1963), and they also differ from the battery developed by Wallach and Kogan (1965), which contains measures representing creative tendencies that are similar in nature (Torrance, 1968).|$|E
40|$|Dynamic typing is an {{important}} feature of dynamic programming languages. Primitive operators such as those for performing arithmetic and comparisons typically operate {{on a wide variety}} of in put value types, and as such, must internally implement some form of dynamic type dispatch and type checking. Removing such <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> is important for an efficient implementation. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of a novel approach to reducing the number of dynamically executed <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> called context-driven basic block versioning. This simple technique clones and specializes basic blocks in such a way as to allow the compiler to accumulate type information while machine code is generated, without a separate type analysis pass. The accumulated information allows the removal of some redundant <b>type</b> <b>tests,</b> particularly in performance-critical paths. We have implemented intraprocedural context-driven basic block versioning in a JavaScript JIT compiler. For comparison, we have also implemented a classical flow-based type analysis operating on the same concrete types. Our results show that basic block versioning performs better on most benchmarks and removes a large fraction of <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> at the expense of a moderate code size increase. We believe that this technique offers a good tradeoff between implementation complexity and performance, and is suitable for integration in production JIT compilers.

40|$|Abstract. Compilers for Object-Oriented Languages {{optimize}} dynamic message sends through run-time <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> {{when they}} cannot precisely infer the message receiver type.

The literature is vast. Traditional nonparametric tests are due to Mood, Miller and Ansari-Bradley. A test which usually stands out in terms of power and robustness against non normality is the W 50 Brown-Forsythe (1974) modification of the Levene (1960) test. This paper deals with the two-sample scale problem and in particular with Levene <b>type</b> <b>tests.</b> We consider ten Levene type tests: the W 50 test, the M 50 and L 50 tests (Pan, 1999), the R test (O’Brien, 1979), as well as the bootstrap and permutation versions of the W 50, L 50 and R tests. We consider also the F test, the modified Fligner-Killeen (1976) test, an adaptive test due to Hall and Padmanabhan (1997) and two tests due to Shoemaker (1995 and 1999). The aim is to identify effective methods for detecting scale differences. Our study is different with respect to the other ones since is focused on resampling versions of the Levene <b>type</b> <b>tests,</b> and many tests considered here have not ever been proposed and/or compared. The computationally simplest test found robust is W 50. Higher power, while preserving robustness, is achieved by considering resampling Levene <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> like the permutation R test (recommended for normal- and light-tailed distributions) and the bootstrap L 50 test (recommended for heavy-tailed and skewed distributions).
