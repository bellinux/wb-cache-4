5|$|As Sovereign, Victoria {{used the}} royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom. Before her accession, she {{received}} no grant of arms. As she could not succeed to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> of Hanover, her arms did not carry the Hanoverian symbols that were used by her immediate predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his {{troubles}} {{and decides to}} renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius {{in a spirit of}} reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends to pronounce a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle").|$|E

50|$|The {{consensus}} is that the sculpture of <b>the</b> Boston <b>Throne</b> is lower in quality than that of <b>the</b> Ludovisi <b>Throne,</b> with less subtle and less figurative characterisation. <b>The</b> Ludovisi <b>Throne</b> {{is thought to be}} a 5th-century BC Greek original, but it seems likely that <b>the</b> Boston <b>Throne</b> has a substantially later date; perhaps it was a 1st-century BC Roman companion-piece to <b>the</b> Ludovisi <b>Throne,</b> created for that piece's assumed display-arrangement in the Gardens of Sallust, or it may even be a forgery.|$|R
5|$|For their part, the Sassanids {{struggled}} {{to establish a}} stable government. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius' ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrow's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrow II, succeeded to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> in 632 was there stability, but {{by then it was}} too late to rescue the Sassanid kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as {{his mother}} {{was the only person}} {{remaining}} in the Protestant line to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a child who survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did not want <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius's {{defeat of}} the Persians ended a war that {{had been going on}} {{intermittently}} for almost 400 years and led to instability in the Persian Empire. Kavadh II died only months after assuming <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> plunging Persia into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius's ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrau's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrau II, succeeded to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> in 632 was there stability. But by then the Sasanid Empire was severely disorganised and had been severely weakened by years of war and civil strife over the succession to <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E

5|$|Still {{opposed to}} the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George, the {{government}} of Eleftherios Venizelos offered <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> to Constantine's third son, Prince Paul, who refused to ascend <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state. Only days after Alexander's death, however, Venizelos was defeated in a general election. On 17 November, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, regent {{since the death of}} Alexander, retired and the new prime minister, Dimitrios Rallis, asked Olga to assume the regency.

Puger took <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> with the title Pakubuwana I and AmangkuratIII was exiled to Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|The {{most unusual}} feature of <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> hall {{is the small}} porch, {{projecting}} out {{at the front of}} the building. Under this porch stands the Busabok Mala Throne (พระที่นั่งบุษบกมาลา), whose spire echoes that of the larger building itself. The high base of <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> is surrounded by praying deities. During the reign of King Rama I, <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> was used when the king appeared before his vassal states; later it was used for certain ceremonies.

5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E

5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight of his descendants. The scene carries deep significance: King James, on <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> when Macbeth was written, {{was believed to be}} separated from Banquo by nine generations. What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James' right to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, a very real fulfilment of the witches' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> This apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E
5|$|With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero {{begin to}} ascend <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> but the {{ceremony}} {{is interrupted by}} the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive ("Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!"), saved from death by Otho, {{the commander of the}} army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E
5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights to <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E

5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|After Alfred's {{death in}} 899, Æthelwold disputed <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> with Alfred's son, Edward the Elder. As senior ætheling (prince {{of the royal}} dynasty {{eligible}} for kingship), Æthelwold had a strong claim to <b>the</b> <b>throne.</b> He attempted to raise an army to support his claim, {{but was unable to}} get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled Northumbria, where he was accepted as king. In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where he was also accepted as king.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Bethune first {{supported}} King Stephen, who seized <b>the</b> <b>throne</b> from Henry's heiress the Empress Matilda, but when Matilda's forces captured Stephen, Bethune switched sides to support Matilda. When Matilda did not secure <b>the</b> <b>throne,</b> Bethune once more switched back to supporting Stephen. Construction of Hereford Cathedral was completed under Bethune's episcopate, and consecrated in 1142 and 1148. Stephen appointed Bethune {{as one of}} the English bishops that the king allowed to attend the Council of Reims in 1148, and Bethune died there in April 1148.
