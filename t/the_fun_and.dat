500|$|There {{were very}} few {{reported}} sales of husbands, and from a modern perspective, selling a wife like a chattel is degrading, even when considered {{as a form of}} divorce.

500|$|Malaysian art {{historian}} Redza Piyadasa said that [...] "The Kampung Boy was a masterpiece {{that was clearly}} designed to {{be read as a}} novel." [...] He compared the graphical depiction of childhood experience to Camara Laye's novel The African Child and viewed The Kampung Boy as the [...] "finest and most sensitive evocation of a rural Malay childhood ever attempted in , in any creative medium." [...] Steinberger had the same thoughts, but compared The Kampung Boy to Colin Thiele's autobiographical novel Sun on the Stubble, which expounds on <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> mischief of early childhood.|$|E
500|$|The Love Hina Again OVA {{received}} more mixed reviews, with ANN's Zac Berthschy feeling it reversed {{part of the}} plot of the main anime series and never reached the same entertainment level as the television series.

[...] Beveridge praised <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> comedy as well as the fan service, but also noted that one's enjoyment would depend on whether they still cared for the characters.|$|E

500|$|The prime {{inspiration}} for the game was Formula One, and Grin tried to recreate the feeling of speed captured by the in-car cameras. In order to achieve a good on screen reference for the speeds attained, the track was redesigned into a tunnel, allowing the entire screen {{to act as a}} reference. Coupling this with scenes of the outdoors enabled Grin to create [...] "a total speed simulation". The settings were inspired by various sources, the city tracks drew inspiration from the films Blade Runner and The Fifth Element, other tracks took their inspiration from nature, such as the Amazon Rainforest and snow scenes of Siberia. Ballistics took cues from other futuristic racing games, such as WipEout and Rollcage, emulating <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> the speed whilst taking it even further with high end graphics.|$|E
500|$|Critics universally acknowledged, {{but gave}} mixed {{opinions}} on, the game's {{high level of}} difficulty. This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> even the smallest victory {{makes you feel like}} you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E
500|$|By 1975, punk {{was being}} used to {{describe}} acts {{as diverse as the}} Patti Smith Group, the Bay City Rollers, and Bruce Springsteen. As the scene at New York's CBGB club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement [...] "street rock"; John Holmstrom credits Aquarian magazine with using punk [...] "to describe what was going on at CBGBs". Holmstrom, McNeil, and Ged Dunn's magazine Punk, which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term. [...] "It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular", Holmstrom later remarked. [...] "We figured we'd take the name before anyone else claimed it.

500|$|... "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Christina Aguilera from her seventh studio album, Lotus (2012). The song was written by Aguilera, Lucas Secon and Olivia Waithe, with production done by Secon. It is a multi-genre song, combining dance, disco, hip hop, Latin and pop. The track makes use of two samples: [...] "The Whole Wide World Ain't Nothin' But a Party" [...] performed by Mark Radice and [...] "54-46 That's My Number" [...] performed by Toots & the Maytals. Lyrically, the song talks about Aguilera's attempts to impress the man she is flirting with and she will not go home without him. Its structure received comparisons to songs performed by Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue. The track was received positively by critics, the majority of whom praised <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> playful production.

500|$|GamePro {{praised the}} aspect of {{shifting}} between realms, particularly the visual effects involved. Similarly, Edge described the transition between realms as a [...] "complex and inspired piece of design", noting that it makes players think on different levels and consider [...] "each room as two rooms, {{the answer to a}} puzzle possibly existing in either." [...] However, the magazine criticized the save system for occasionally forcing players to replay large sections of the game to get to new areas. IGN stated that acquiring and learning the powers of Raziel's brothers constituted part of <b>the</b> <b>fun,</b> <b>and</b> that Raziel's moves were well animated and articulated. Finding minimal difficulty in using camera controls, GameSpot likened them to those of Banjo-Kazooie and stated that players would want to adjust the camera deliberately to watch Raziel's movements. Presenting differences between Soul Reaver and the Tomb Raider series, AllGame stated that the game's puzzles would challenge [...] "all but the most experienced gamers", while Game Informer considered the puzzles [...] "difficult-to-the-point-of-insanity".

Dungeon Siege sold over 1.7 million copies, and was nominated for the 2003 Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year award by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.

Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie to feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. It {{was a lot of fun}} coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements. But no matter how modern some of the weapons are, they all have an old-fashioned feel and look like they could fit into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1949 Cardus {{set up his}} London home at the National Liberal Club, while Edith took a flat in Bickenhall Mansions, {{just off}} Baker Street. The pair lived harmoniously apart, though in {{frequent}} contact, until Edith's death. Cardus found London's musical life invigorating, with five major orchestras {{and a host of}} distinguished conductors and solo artists performing regularly. Toscanini paid his final visit to England in 1952, with two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. Outside London, Cardus was a regular visitor to the Edinburgh Festival and to Glyndebourne, and was in Manchester for the reopening of the Free Trade Hall and the [...] "homecoming" [...] of the Hallé Orchestra in November 1951. The inaugural concert concluded with Kathleen Ferrier singing [...] "Land of Hope and Glory". Cardus had first heard Ferrier at the Edinburgh Festival in 1947; he became a devoted admirer to the extent that, eventually, questions were raised about his critical blindness to her technical weaknesses. He wrote of her singing that it was, [...] "like the woman herself... imbued with a quiet but reliant sense and a feeling for <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>and</b> goodness of life". He was devastated by her death from cancer in October 1953; the following year he edited and contributed to a memorial volume of tributes.|$|E
