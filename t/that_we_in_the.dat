He will be missed in ways that I don't think we all understand yet. There was no question about his reputation. His approach was always a no-nonsense, no-politics approach. He never let the main issues get sidetracked." [...] John De Luca, President of the Wine Institute said [...] "I'm not sure people truly perceive his extraordinary impact on the wine industry. He is one of the defining figures, one of the great figures in wine of our time." [...] Patrick Gleeson, executive director of the American Vineyard Foundation, who Meyer had mentored as a young lad said [...] "His vision and love for wine has undoubtedly made him a living legacy amongst friends, peers and those in the industry. Justin's passing will not diminish the influence he has had on the wine industry and hopefully it will inspire others to follow in his footsteps." ...|$|E

60|$|The old {{indigenous}} {{culture of}} China has become rather dead; its {{art and literature}} are not what they were, and Confucius does not satisfy the spiritual needs of a modern man, {{even if he is}} Chinese. The Chinese who have had a European or American education realize that a new element, is needed to vitalize native traditions, and they look to our civilization to supply it. But they do not wish to construct a civilization just like ours; and it is precisely in this that the best hope lies. If they are not goaded into militarism, they may produce a genuinely new civilization, better than any <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West have been able to create.|$|E
6000|$|How, in {{the grey}} of this morning, while we sat Permanent in Townhall, watchful for the commonweal, there entered, {{precisely}} as on a Tenth of August, some Ninety-six extraneous persons; who declared {{themselves to be}} in a state of Insurrection; to be plenipotentiary Commissioners from the Forty-eight Sections, sections or members of the Sovereign People, all in a state of Insurrection; and further <b>that</b> <b>we,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of said Sovereign in Insurrection, were dismissed from office. How we thereupon laid off our sashes, and withdrew into the adjacent Saloon of Liberty. How in a moment or two, we were called back; and reinstated; the Sovereign pleasing to think us still worthy of confidence. Whereby, having taken new oath of office, we on a sudden find ourselves Insurrectionary Magistrates, with extraneous Committee of Ninety-six sitting by us; and a Citoyen Henriot, one whom some accuse of Septemberism, is made Generalissimo of the National Guard; and, since six o'clock, the tocsins ring and the drums beat:--Under which peculiar circumstances, what would an august National Convention please to direct us to do?

60|$|That is {{the element}} about the Arab {{influence}} which makes it, after its ages of supremacy {{and in a}} sense of success, remain in a subtle manner superficial. When a man first sees the Eastern deserts, he sees this influence as I first described it, very present and powerful, almost omnipresent and omnipotent. But I fancy that to me and to others it is partly striking only because it is strange. Islam is so different to Christendom that to see it at all is at first like entering a new world. But, in my own case at any rate, as the strange colours became more customary, and especially as I saw more of the established seats of history, the cities and the framework of the different states, I became conscious of something else. It was something underneath, undestroyed and even in a sense unaltered. It was something neither Moslem nor modern; not merely oriental and yet very different from the new occidental nations from which I came. For a long time I could not put a name to this historical atmosphere. Then one day, standing in one of the Greek churches, one of those houses of gold full of hard highly coloured pictures, I fancied it came to me. It was the Empire. And certainly not the raid of Asiatic bandits we call the Turkish Empire. The thing which had caught my eye in that coloured interior was the carving of a two-headed eagle in such a position as to make it almost as symbolic as a cross. Every one has heard, of course, of the situation which this might well suggest, the suggestion that the Russian Church was far too much of an Established Church and the White Czar encroached upon the White Christ. But as a fact the eagle I saw was not borrowed from the Russian Empire; it would be truer to say that the Empire was borrowed from the eagle. The double eagle is the ancient emblem of the double empire of Rome and of Byzantium; the one head looking to the west and the other to the east, as if it spread its wings from the sunrise to the sunset. Unless I am mistaken, it was only associated with Russia as late as Peter the Great, though it had been the badge of Austria as the representative of the Holy Roman Empire. And what I felt brooding over that shrine and that landscape was something older not only than Turkey or Russia but than Austria itself. I began to understand a sort of evening light that lies over Palestine and Syria; a sense of smooth ruts of custom such as are said to give a dignity to the civilisation of China. I even understood a sort of sleepiness about the splendid and handsome Orthodox priests moving fully robed about the streets. They were not aristocrats but officials; still moving with the mighty routine of some far-off official system. In so far as the eagle was an emblem not of such imperial peace but of distant imperial wars, it was of wars <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West have hardly heard of; it was the emblem of official ovations.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{vibrations}} of a supermembrane of infinite energy can correspond to every particle in the Universe at {{once it is}} possible to interpret the supermembrane as equivalent to the Universe. i.e. all that exists is the supermembrane.

Every state of the Universe corresponds to a supermembrane and every history of the Universe corresponds to a supermembrane world volume.
