5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew it was going on, and the owners knew it was going on. But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Russian {{president}} Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos {{dating from}} {{a few weeks after}} the downing of KAL007 in 1983. The memos contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yury Andropov) that indicated that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> location of KAL007's wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after cockpit voice recorder on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not unequivocally support their firmly held view that KAL007's flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.|$|E
5|$|Dam asked Vann, who was {{circling}} the battlefield aboard an L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, to reconnoiter possible landing zones {{on the east}} and west sides of Ap Bac, where additional reinforcements could be inserted to launch their attacks. In response, Vann asked his pilot to make low passes over the trees which covered Ap Bac. Although he could not see any Viet Cong positions, Vann knew there was a well-fortified position {{at the south end of}} the hamlet, due to the impact of the Viet Cong's firepower on the Civil Guards since the battle's inception. As Vann's L-19 aircraft flew over the western tree line, the Viet Cong watched from their foxholes, but held their fire because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was trying to draw fire in order to mark their positions. Although Vann was suspicious, he decided it was a better landing zone because the area was tranquil despite the heavy fighting elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund, {{supported}} by Zamoyski {{and the former}} king's wife, Anna Jagiellon, was elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 and recognized as such by the interrex, the Primate Karnkowski. The election was disputed, however, by Maximilian and opponents of Sigismund chose not to respect the election outcome, decreeing that Maximilian was the rightful monarch three days later on 22 August. The Zborowski family called for the rokosz (legitimate right to rebel) and the election ended in chaos, with several killed and many wounded. For both Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, losing was not an option, as <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> losing side would likely pay a severe price, from confiscations {{and a loss of}} prestige to a possible death sentence for treason.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E
25|$|As {{the people}} had already {{experienced}} mass deportations, <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> signs (such as arrival of fresh troops and vehicles) and attempted to hide. Therefore, the Soviets set up ambushes, tracked down and interrogated relatives, carried out mass passport checks, etc. Against regulations, MGB operatives would deliver children without parents to the train stations hoping that the parents would voluntarily show up. Not all fugitives were caught by such measures and later, in Lithuania, smaller actions and deportations were organized to locate those that escaped the first Operation Priboi in March.|$|E

25|$|Initially the British {{force of}} six battlecruisers and four fast battleships {{commanded}} by Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty gave chase to five German battlecruisers commanded by Vice-Admiral Franz Hipper.

Despite his numerical disadvantage, Hipper succeed in sinking two British battlecruisers during the chase.

25|$|The P-38's {{service record}} shows mixed results, which may reflect more on its {{employment}} than on flaws with the aircraft. The P-38's engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One {{reason for this}} was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes. Until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters {{because of the lack}} of dive flaps to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a Split S and continue into steep dives because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.|$|E

25|$|The {{company had}} a strict policy {{that they would}} not {{purchase}} any horses that were broke. The company wanted their horses trained exclusively for staging, a process that generally took three months, even then they were never truly broken and had to be expertly handled. A hostler would lead the teams out to the stages only once the baggage had been secured and the passengers and driver were safely seated. Once harnessed to the stage, the reins were given to the driver and he could release the brake. The stage horses often leaped and reared {{at the start of a}} trip, but settled into a smooth trot once they were underway. The whip rarely had to be used to encourage them, as <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> next station meant a good feed and a warm stable.|$|E

25|$|The {{field was}} covered by a dense fog {{on the morning of}} 14 March. Burnside ordered his forces to form and advance on the Rebel works. The Yankees did not have {{complete}} information concerning their opponents' disposition at this time; so far as <b>they</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>the</b> Confederate line extended only from the river to the brickyard. In keeping with this belief, Burnside ordered the First Brigade to engage the enemy left, while the Second Brigade would try to turn their right, at the brickyard. The eight howitzers were deployed across the county road. Third Brigade was held as a reserve. The Army also got some dubious support from the gunboats under Commander Stephen C. Rowan, who shelled the Rebel positions although they were hidden by intervening forests. This gunfire greatly disturbed the North Carolinians, but it was inaccurate enough that Burnside eventually asked Cowan to change direction.|$|E
25|$|Jack Brod, the building's longest-lasting {{original}} tenant, co-established the Empire Diamond Corporation {{with his}} father in the building in mid-1931 and rented space in the building until he died in 2008. Brod later recalled that there were only about 20 tenants {{at the time of}} opening, including him, and that Al Smith was the only real tenant in the space above his seventh-floor offices. Generally, during the early 1930s, it was rare for an entity to rent more than a single office in the building, despite Smith's and Raskob's aggressive marketing efforts in the newspapers and to anyone <b>they</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>The</b> building's lights were continuously left on, even in the unrented spaces, to give the impression of occupancy. This was exacerbated by competition from the Rockefeller Center as well as from buildings on 42nd Street, which, when combined with the Empire State Building, provided excessive space in a slow market.|$|E

The first Europeans in the area were a party of explorers led by William Hovell and Hamilton Hume, who crossed the Goulburn River at a point near Molesworth in December 1824, and crossed the stream they named Muddy Creek the following day. (The Muddy Creek was renamed the Yea River in 1879.) They reported the area as very suitable for grazing, though in the hills good soil was only {{to be found in the}} hollows, but they found the forest almost impenetrable as they left the area south-west towards King Parrot Creek.|$|E

25|$|With this {{domestic}} {{record of}} captaincy success, Deane was picked as captain for the South Africa side for the 1927–28 English tour of South Africa, ahead of Herbie Taylor who {{had led the}} 1924 tour of England, but whose form had reportedly suffered in the big matches from {{the pressures of the}} captaincy. Poor batting led to defeat in the first match of the series and in the second the South Africans had a first-innings lead of 117, with Deane contributing 41 to a total of 250, but still lost the match by 87 runs. The turnaround in the series started with third Test, which was drawn with the South Africans finally posting a respectable total. Deane was instrumental in this: in the first innings, with the score at 146 for seven, he and Buster Nupen both made scores of more than 50, with Deane going on to 77. In the second innings, an all-round better batting performance by the South Africans secured the draw with Deane making a further 73. A new fast-medium bowling combination allied to less brittle batting brought a South African victory in the fourth Test, with Deane batting when victory by four wickets was achieved. And the series was tied at two wins apiece with a South African victory in the final match by eight wickets. As captain, Deane won the toss five times out of five in the series; unusually for the time in which he played, he put the England team in to bat three times, claiming that his young side would play better if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> odds they had to face.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of Native American hunter-gatherer societies, wolves were usually killed for body parts used in rituals, or to stop them raiding food caches, though some tribes would raid wolf dens to kill pups when wolf populations became too large for the Natives to live with. This {{also served as a}} method of acquiring food, as wolf pups were considered a delicacy. Native Americans were aware of the dangers of habituated wolves, and would quickly dispatch wolves following them too closely. Active hunting of wolves was rare because many tribes believed that such an act would cause game animals to disappear or bring retribution from other wolves. The Cherokee feared that the unjust killing of a wolf would bring about the vengeance of its pack mates, and that the weapon used for the deed would be useless in future unless exorcised by a medicine man. However, they would kill wolves with impunity if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> proper rites of atonement, and if the wolves themselves happened to raid their fish nets. When the Kwakiutl killed a wolf, the animal would be laid out on a blanket and have portions of its flesh eaten by the perpetrators, who would express regret at the act before burying it. The Ahtna would take the dead wolf to a hut, where it would be propped in a sitting position with a banquet made by a shaman set before it. When men from certain Eskimo tribes killed a wolf, they would walk around their houses four times, expressing regret and abstaining from sexual relations with their wives for four days. Young Apaches would kill wolves, cougars or bears as a rite of passage. Although some of the first European colonists traveling to North America would report back that wolves were more populous in the New World than in Europe, writings from the Lewis and Clark Expedition indicate that wolves were seldom seen except in aboriginal buffer zones.|$|E
