25|$|In {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent, Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is {{mourning}} {{the death of her}} husband Gugalana (gu, bull, gal, big, ana, sky/heaven), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. She tells her servant Ninshubur (Lady Evening), a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star, that if she does not return in three days, to get help from her father Anu, Enlil, king of the gods, or Enki. When she does not return, Ninshubur approaches Anu only to be told that he understands that his daughter is strong and can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> Enlil tells Ninshubur he is much too busy running the cosmos. Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla demons, Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails, to recover the young goddess. These beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman Galli, androgynous beings of the third sex, similar to the American Indian berdache, who played an important part in early religious ritual.|$|E
500|$|Meyer has {{dismissed}} such criticisms, arguing {{both that}} the books center around Bella's choice, which she perceives {{as the foundation}} of modern feminism, and that Bella's damsel in distress persona is due only to her humanity. Meyer also added, [...] "Just because [...] doesn't do kung fu and she cooks for her father doesn't make her worthy of that criticism". Shannon Simcox of The Daily Collegian has similarly dismissed the criticism surrounding Bella, commenting, [...] "While Bella plays the perfect damsel in distress that gets herself into sticky situations, she is also very in control of herself. She chose to move to Forks and be in a new place; she constantly faces a bunch {{of people who want to}} suck the life right out of her, and she is constantly pleading to become a vampire, too, so she can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> and Edward." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{eventually}} {{learned to}} <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> and her siblings, {{and she turned}} to her paternal grandmother in the hope of finding some solace and some form of her mother in her. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and invariably rebelled against anyone brought into their home ostensibly {{to take the place of}} their beloved mother. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Madonna commented that she saw herself in her youth as a [...] "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." [...] Terrified that her father, Tony Ciccone, could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him. Two years after her mother's death, her father married the family's housekeeper, Joan Gustafson. At this point, Madonna began to express unresolved feelings of anger towards her father that lasted for decades, and developed a rebellious attitude. She explained in the May 1989 issue of Interview magazine: ...|$|E

She isn't interested in dressing like a man; she’s not using her clothes to get anything from anybody else - it's not a device. She's dressing for herself. She has good taste - you can just tell. I don't know how, it’s hard to say - but you can tell from the page somehow how she <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> But it’s for herself and for herself alone." ...|$|R

500|$|When {{developing}} {{the characteristics of}} their version of Lois Lane, the writers took inspiration from other leading ladies in cinema, for example, Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood, from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Todd Slavkin describes the character as having a [...] "sophisticated, worldly experience", and {{was considered to be}} more of an adult {{than the rest of the}} cast. Durance believes that she embodies many of the characteristics that the creative team wanted to show in their version of Lois, specifically the fact that Lois has a lot of [...] "nervous energy" [...] from trying to [...] "find herself", the same nervous energy that Durance brings to the role. The actress also relates to Lois's sassy, and independent nature, but, conversely, she is not as extroverted as Lois. Gough describes the character as coming from the school of hard knocks; she is street smart, and a very capable woman. Durance believes her character is [...] "fiercely independent", but at the same time she is not afraid to admit that she has flaws, and she is only human; Lois also does not feel sorry about having those flaws. She goes into further detail, identifying the character as more of a tomboy who is vulnerable, with Gough adding that she is also [...] "slightly neurotic". BuddyTV's John Kubicek characterizes her as a fast-talking woman, who, though she whines over petty annoyances, can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself.</b> He goes on to further describe how she is not afraid of getting herself into trouble just so she can dig herself out.|$|E

[...] IGN listed Tifa as the 13th-best Final Fantasy character of all time in 2008, describing her as an attempt by Square to [...] "give Final Fantasy characters real sex appeal," [...] and someone who [...] "could <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself</b> in a pinch"; in a follow-up Reader's Choice edition of the list, Tifa placed first, with the staff repeating their previous comments while attributing her placement on the list to her breasts. In a 2009 IGN article focusing solely on Final Fantasy VII characters, Tifa placed fourth, with a comment that while her sex appeal contributes to her popularity, [...] "Tifa helped drive a tradition of tough, independent RPG heroines." [...] Other sources too praised Tifa for that aspect of her character. Mania Entertainment placed her tenth in the 2010 list of [...] "video game women that kick ass," [...] stating that while subsequent games in the Final Fantasy series introduced other memorable female characters, [...] "Tifa is our first Final Fantasy girl and holds a special place in our hearts." [...] In 2013, Gus Turner of Complex ranked Tifa as the 12th-greatest Final Fantasy character of all time, stating that [...] "next to Lara Croft and Samus, Tifa Lockhart stands out as one of gaming's most independent and empowered females ever." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 17, 1914, {{he married}} Martha Wheaton Bowers (1889–1958), {{daughter}} of Lloyd Wheaton Bowers and Louisa Bennett Wilson. Taft himself appeared taciturn and coldly intellectual, characteristics that were offset by his gregarious wife, who served {{the same role}} his mother had for his father, as a confidante and powerful asset to her husband's political career. In May 1950, Martha suffered a severe stroke that left her an invalid, leaving her confined to a wheelchair, unable to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>herself,</b> and reliant upon her husband, children, and nurses for support. A biographer called his wife's stroke [...] "the deepest personal blow of [...] life...there was no denying that he suffered." [...] Following her stroke, Taft faithfully assisted his wife, called her every night when he was away on business, read stories to her at night {{when he was at}} home, [...] "pushed her about in her wheelchair, lifted her in and out of cars...tenderly did his best to make her feel comfortable and happy, and helped feed and take care of her at public functions" [...] - facts which, his admirers noted, belied his public image as a cold and uncaring person. They had four sons: William Howard Taft III (1915–1991), who became ambassador to Ireland; Robert Alphonso Taft Jr. (1917–1993), who was also elected to the U.S. Senate; Lloyd Bowers Taft (1923–1985), who worked as an investment banker in Cincinnati, and Horace Dwight Taft (1925–1983), who became a professor of physics and dean at Yale. Two of Robert and Martha's grandsons are Robert Alphonso [...] "Bob" [...] Taft III (born 1942), Governor of Ohio from 1999 to 2007, and William Howard Taft IV (born 1945), Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1984 to 1989.|$|E
