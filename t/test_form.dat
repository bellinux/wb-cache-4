Davidson was retained for the final Test, his first on his home ground in Sydney, but was wicketless in a rain-affected draw. His Test series had been poor, with 71runs at 14.20 and only three wickets at 73.33 as England retained the Ashes 3–1. Davidson had not tasted victory in any of his eight Tests. His poor <b>Test</b> <b>form</b> contrasted to his performances against England in tour matches; he took 15 wicket at 15.13 in three matches outside the Tests.|$|E
5|$|The 1951–52 season saw {{the second}} tour to Australia by the West Indies. Morris experimented with his stance {{during the winter}} in {{response}} to criticism about his footwork when facing Bedser. Morris felt that his problems had arisen because he attempted to play excessively on the leg side. He opened his season by punishing the Queenslanders with a score of 253 in a Shield match and then scored 210 against Victoria. In {{the first of these}} innings, Morris had been ill but he struck 253 of his team's 400, with the last 50 coming in only 17 minutes of batting. His <b>Test</b> <b>form</b> was unimpressive though; he started steadily, with 122 runs in the first two Tests, which were won by Australia.|$|E

40|$|Basically a {{replication}} {{of an earlier}} investigation by Poggio and Glasnapp (1973), this study offered {{from the standpoint of}} several psychometric characteristics a comparison of a traditional mode of item assembly with one of item sampling employed in the construc-tion of three in-class midterm achievement examinations in inter-mediate algebra for a sample of 101 community college students. For two of three in-class midterm examinations reliable differences ex-isted between mean scores of constant-item (traditionally devised) <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> and those on corresponding item-sampled (content-sam-pled) <b>test</b> <b>forms.</b> Relative to performance on a final achievement examination of 60 multiple-choice items, the validity coefficients of scores derived from two of the three sets of the six item-sampled <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> employed were lower than those realized for the two corre-sponding single constant-item <b>test</b> <b>forms.</b> Furthermore, relative to the same criterion measure multiple correlation coefficients of. 571 and. 521, respectively, were found from optimally weighted com-posites of the three sets of in-class midterm examination scores on the constant-item <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> and on the item-sampled <b>test</b> <b>forms.</b> Thus the item-sampled midterm <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> appeared to be no more and perhaps slightly less valid than traditionally assembled constant-item <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> in the prediction of success on a final objective achievement examination in intermediate algebra...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{automated}} {{assembly of}} alternate <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> {{is to produce}} multiple <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> that are equivalent to some target. To achieve that goal, the alternate forms are usually assembled according to the content and psychometric specifications obtained from a reference test. Equivalent-test assembly techniques based on conventional testparallelism definitions constrain alternate <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> {{to have the same}} characteristics for each test taker. The test scores derived from such assembled forms are beneficial to indicate the standing of an examinee or make inferences about an individual’s performance. However, the requirement that each examinee should be provided <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> with identical <b>test</b> properties can be too stringent and unnecessary for certification and licensure testing. In such setting, tests are intended to classify examinees into categories (e. g., pass vs. fail, or master vs. non-master), and information about an individual’s standing relative to a tested population is not the main concern. One way to assemble equivalent <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> for classification <b>testing</b> can be to constrain alternate <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> to have identical test properties for, for example, two contrast groups (o...|$|R
5|$|Although Hammond {{began his}} career in 1920, he was {{required}} to wait until 1923 before he could play full-time, after his qualification to play for Gloucestershire was challenged. His potential was spotted immediately and after three full seasons, he was chosen to visit the West Indies in 1925–26 {{as a member of}} a Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.) touring party, but contracted a serious illness on the tour. He began to score heavily after his recovery in 1927 and was selected for England. In the 1928–29 series against Australia he scored 905 runs, then a record aggregate for a Test series. He dominated county cricket in the 1930s and, despite a mid-decade slump in <b>Test</b> <b>form,</b> was made captain of England in 1938. He continued as captain after the Second World War, but his health had deteriorated and he retired from first-class cricket after an unsuccessful tour of Australia in 1946–47. He appeared in two more first-class matches in the early 1950s.|$|E

The highlight was an unbeaten 134 against Sri Lanka in the Second Test in Hobart. This followed twin half centuries in the First Test. His focus on batting saw him aggregate only 1/19 with the ball for the seven Tests. Thereafter his <b>Test</b> <b>form</b> tapered off.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} develop any test either {{commercial}} or in-house, test-developers should clearly have a particular sample in mind when designing it and pilot items on the sample. To finalize the VELC Test®, three pilot trials were conducted and analyzed using the Rasch model. In the initial stage, a pilot test was administered to adopt anchor items that could link several <b>test</b> <b>forms.</b> The next step dealt with piloting and linking several <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> so as to revise any necessary items. The last step was to collect more data on the <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> to assure {{the quality of the}} test items.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{illustrate}} how Rasch model can contribute on reading comprehension measurement through multiple-choice tests. Three specific purposes were defined: (a) to examine {{the psychometric properties of}} the items; (b) to assess the <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> dimensionality, local independence and reliability, and; (c) to perform vertical scaling of the <b>test</b> <b>forms</b> of the TRC-n and the TRC-e.|$|R

England hosted the World Cup in 1983 and reached the semi-finals, but their <b>Test</b> <b>form</b> remained poor, as they suffered defeats against New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|After that century, however, Wettimuny's <b>Test</b> <b>form</b> {{went the}} same way as his ODI form. Despite hitting two fifties, he had too many scores below 20, and the 12 Tests {{following}} the England tour only yielded 402 runs at an average of 19.14. Wettimuny never got into control of the pitches in his home country, as he averaged a paltry 18.19 with the bat at home – an average more usually associated with a bowling all-rounder – but 39.95 overseas.|$|E

Despite beating South Africa and tying with eventual winners India, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh before losing in the quarter-finals to Sri Lanka. However the team's excellent form in the Test match arena continued and on 13 August 2011, they became the world's top-ranked Test team after comfortably whitewashing India 4–0, their sixth consecutive series victory and eighth in the past nine series. However, this status only lasted a year – having lost 3–0 to Pakistan over the winter, England were beaten 2–0 by South Africa, who replaced them {{at the top of}} the rankings.

25|$|The {{following}} home {{series against}} India saw Cook continue his fine <b>Test</b> <b>form</b> despite England not winning a Test. He {{was the third}} highest scoring Englishman {{with an average of}} 37. In the first Test, Cook made scores of 36 and 17 as the match ended in a draw. During {{the first day of the}} second Test at Trent Bridge, Cook became the youngest English player to rack up 1,500 Test runs eclipsing the record held by David Gower. In the first innings of the third Test, Cook made his biggest score of the series, 61 and followed this up with 43 in the second innings to help England secure a draw. Cook played in six of the seven ensuing one-day matches, scoring his maiden ODI century in the first match alongside Ian Bell's 126 not out guiding England to a 104 win victory that propped up England's first one-day series victory since 2005. After two ducks, Cook was dropped in the final, decisive match.|$|E
500|$|Morris' <b>Test</b> <b>form</b> {{peaked in}} the series, heading the Test averages with 696 runs at 87.00, {{and he was}} the only player to compile three Test centuries. After scoring 31 and 9 in the First Test victory at Trent Bridge, he was criticised by former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton, who {{believed}} Morris was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot. Morris scored 60 against Northamptonshire, before scoring 105 and 62 in the Second Test at Lord's to help Australia take a 2–0 series lead. Fingleton called the innings [...] "a pretty Test century in the grandest of all cricket settings"; the knock was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives. Morris featured in century partnerships with Bradman in the first innings and Barnes in the second innings, laying the foundation of a lead of 595 runs.|$|E

ESPNcricinfo praised Kohli for having [...] "demonstrated his growing maturity to play just the sort of innings his side required", while Kohli described his knock as [...] "a learning innings". However, the match ended in a draw and England won their first Test series in India in 28 years. Against Pakistan in December 2012, Kohli averaged 18 in the T20Is and 4.33 in the ODIs, being troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly Junaid Khan, who dismissed him on all three occasions in the ODI series.

If, however, a large number of misfitting items occur with no apparent reason for the misfit, the construct validity of the test will need to be reconsidered and the test specifications may need to be rewritten.
