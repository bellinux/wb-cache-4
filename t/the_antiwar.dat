5|$|One {{important}} piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for <b>the</b> <b>antiwar</b> film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.|$|E
5|$|By {{her junior}} year, Rodham became a {{supporter}} of <b>the</b> <b>antiwar</b> presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy. In early 1968, she {{was elected president of}} the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty. In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges. A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with the}} sexism {{sometimes}} found in <b>the</b> <b>antiwar</b> movement, New Left, and Civil Rights Movement, some women {{created their own}} organizations to establish true equality of the sexes.

25|$|In April 1939, the Lindberghs {{returned}} to the United States. Because of his outspoken beliefs about a future war that would envelop their homeland, <b>the</b> <b>antiwar</b> America First Committee quickly adopted Charles as its leader in 1940. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and Germany's declaration of war, the committee disbanded, and he eventually managed {{to become involved in}} the military and enter combat only as a civilian.|$|E

Nevertheless, he publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and flew fifty combat missions in the Pacific Theater of World War II as a civilian consultant, though Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission.|$|E

25|$|This {{became the}} Family Jewels. It {{included}} information linking the CIA to {{the assassination of}} foreign leaders, the illegal surveillance of some 7,000 U.S. citizens involved in <b>the</b> <b>antiwar</b> movement (Operation CHAOS), the CIA had also experimented on U.S. and Canadian citizens without their knowledge, secretly giving them LSD (among other things) and observing the results. This prompted Congress to create the Church Committee in the Senate, and the Pike Committee in the House. President Gerald Ford created the Rockefeller Commission, and issued an executive order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders. DCI Colby leaked the papers to the press, later he stated that he believed that providing Congress with this information was the correct thing to do, and ultimately in the CIA's own interests.|$|E
25|$|Most student antiwar {{organizations}} were locally or campus-based {{because they were}} easier to organize and participate in than national groups. Common antiwar demonstrations for college students featured attempts to sever ties between the war machine and universities through burning draft cards, protesting universities furnishing grades to draft boards, and protesting military and Dow Chemical job fairs on campus. From 1969 to 1970, student protestors attacked 197 ROTC buildings on college campuses. Protests grew after the Kent State shootings, radicalizing more and more students. Although the media often portrayed the student antiwar movement as aggressive and widespread, only 10% of the 2500 colleges in the United States had violent protests throughout the Vietnam War years. By the early 1970s, most student protest movements died down due to President Nixon's de-escalation of the war, the economic downturn, and disillusionment with the powerlessness of <b>the</b> <b>antiwar</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the popular}} {{perception}} that conservatism {{is limited to}} Republicans, during the era of segregation before 1965 many Southern Democrats were also conservative, especially about social and racial issues. Southern Democrats were {{a key part of}} a Conservative Coalition that largely blocked liberal labor legislation in Congress from 1937 to 1963, though they tended to be liberal and vote {{with the rest of the}} Democratic Party on other economic issues. Southern Democrats fended off the more conservative Republican Party (GOP) by arguing that only they could defend segregation because the Republican Party nationally was committed to integration. That argument collapsed when Congress banned segregation in 1964. This provided an opportunity for Republicans to appeal to conservative Southerners on the basis that the GOP was the more conservative party on a wide range of social and economic issues, as well as being hawkish on foreign policy when <b>the</b> <b>antiwar</b> forces gained strength in the Democratic party. Southern white conservatives moved from the Democratic Party to the GOP at the presidential level in the 1960s, and at the state and local level after 1990.|$|E

25|$|Many artists {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s {{opposed the war}} and used their {{creativity}} and careers to visibly oppose the war. Writers and poets opposed to involvement in the war included Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Robert Duncan, and Robert Bly. Their pieces often incorporated imagery based on the tragic events of the war {{as well as the}} disparity between life in Vietnam and life in the United States. Visual artists Ronald Haeberle, Peter Saul, and Nancy Spero, among others, used war equipment, like guns and helicopters, in their works while incorporating important political and war figures, portraying to the nation exactly who was responsible for the violence. Filmmakers such as Lenny Lipton, Jerry Abrams, Peter Gessner, and David Ringo created documentary-style movies featuring actual footage from <b>the</b> <b>antiwar</b> marches to raise awareness about the war and the diverse opposition movement. Playwrights like Frank O'Hara, Sam Shepard, Robert Lowell, Megan Terry, Grant Duay, and Kenneth Bernard used theater as a vehicle for portraying their thoughts about the Vietnam War, often satirizing the role of America in the world and juxtaposing the horrific effects of war with normal scenes of life. Regardless of medium, antiwar artists ranged from pacifists to violent radicals and caused Americans to think more critically about the war. Art as war opposition was quite popular {{in the early years of}} the war, but soon faded as political activism became the more common and most visible way of opposing the war.|$|E

In the 2001 film Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent, Zinn {{provides a}} historical context for <b>the</b> 1971 <b>antiwar</b> march by Vietnam Veterans against the War. The marchers traveled from Lexington, Massachusetts, to Bunker Hill, [...] "which retraced Paul Revere's ride of 1775 {{and ended in}} the massive arrest of 410 veterans and civilians by the Lexington police."
