50|$|Inside {{the coil}} was the electron-photon {{calorimeter}} (ECAL), {{designed for the}} highest possible angular resolution and electron identification. It consisted of alternating layers of lead and proportional tubes read out in 73,728 projective towers, each subdivided into three depth zones.The central detector for charged particles was the time projection chamber (TPC), 4.4 m long and 3.6 m in diameter. It provided a three dimensional measurement of each track segment. In addition, it provided up to 330 ionisation measurements for a track; this was useful for particle identification. The TPC surrounded the inner <b>track</b> <b>chamber</b> (ITC); an axial-wire drift chamber with inner and outer diameters of 13 cm and 29 cm and a length of 2 m. It provided 8 track coordinates and a trigger signal for charged particles {{that came from the}} interaction point.Closest to the beam pipe, was a silicon strip vertex detector. For each track, this measured two pairs of coordinates, 6.3 cm and 11 cm away from the beam axis over a length of 40 cm along the beam line.The beam pipe, made out of beryllium, had a diameter of 16 cm. The vacuum inside was about 10−15 atm.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{detection}} on {{the solar}} maximum mission (SMM) satellite of high energy neutrons emitted during large solar flares has provided renewed incentive {{to design a}} neutron detector which has the sensitivity, energy resolution, and time resolution to measure the neutron time and energy spectra with sufficient precision to improve {{our understanding of the}} basic flare processes. Over the past two decades a variety of neutron detectors has been flown to measure the atmospheric neutron intensity above 10 MeV and to search for solar neutrons. The SONTRAC (Solar Neutron <b>Track</b> <b>Chamber)</b> detector, a new type of neutron detector which utilizes n-p scattering and has a sensitivity 1 - 3 orders of magnitude greater than previous instruments in the 20 - 200 MeV range is described. The energy resolution is 1 % for neutron kinetic energy, T sub n 50 MeV. When used with a coded aperture mask at 50 m (as would be possible on the space station) an angular resolution of approx. 4 arc sec could be achieved, thereby locating the sites of high energy nuclear interactions with an angular precision comparable to the existing x-ray experiments on SMM.

A telescope employing this technique differs from a conventional telescope only in that the presence of the mask modifies the radiation field {{in the vicinity of the}} detection plane. In addition to reducing the primary photon flux incident on the detector by absorption in the mask elements, the mask will also be a secondary radiator of gamma-rays.

40|$|The present thesis {{contains}} a comprehensive {{description of the}} measurement of differential hadron multiplicities in the deep inelastic e-p scattering with the ZEUS detector at HERA. A main topic of this thesis formed Monte-Carlo studies for {{the understanding of the}} systematics of the central <b>track</b> <b>chamber</b> (CTD). Resolving power and detection probability of the chamber for charged tracks were studied. Basing on this criteria of the tracks selection were developed, which allow the selection of precesily measured tracks. All measured data were corrected for effects of the detector acceptance and the resolving power. The particle flux is studied as function of the polar angle in the laboratory system for different intervals of the square of the four-momentum transfer Q" 2 and the invariant mass of the hadronic final state W" 2. From measurements of the differential multiplicity in the laboratory system by extrapolation with MC models to total multiplicity N_t_o_t of charged particles in the hadronic final state can be estimated. The energy dependence of the mean total multiplicity can be described by an approach of the form [N_t_o_t]=a+b. ln W+c. (ln W) " 2. The results are compatible with measurements in hadron-hadron collisions. For the first time corrected distributions of the energy flux of charged particles from measurements of the CTD are presented. From the comparison of the calorimeter with the CTD data the contribution of the energy carried by neutral particles in the hadron final state can be determined. This lies at 34 % and is over the whole measurable angular range constant. Contraily to the calorimeter with the CTD also the particle multiplicity as function of #DELTA##eta# can be measured. The comparison of the particle with the energy distribution shows that in the region of the quark jet and the proton residue the more energetic particles are, while the particle flux dN/d#DELTA##eta# in the whole angular range between scattered quark and proton residue is nearly constant. The measurement of the distribution of the Feynman scaling variable x_F=p_z/p_z"m"a"x at a c. m. energy of 99 GeV is compared with measurement from other experiments (DELPHI,H 1). The distribution is nearly independent on the hard collision processSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 2821 (94 - 07) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekDEGerman...|$|E
