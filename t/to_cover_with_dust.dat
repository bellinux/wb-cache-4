25|$|The {{original}} narrative can {{be found}} in the rambling chronicle El Carnero of Juan Rodriguez Freyle. According to Freyle, zipa of the Muisca, in a ritual at Lake Guatavita near present-day Bogotá, was said <b>to</b> be <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> gold <b>dust,</b> which he then washed off in the lake while his attendants threw trinkets made of gold, emeralds, and precious stones into the lake.|$|R
60|$|The next visitor {{introduced}} by Archibald was a thin, nervous, irritable-looking man of middle age, with a worried and apprehensive expression of countenance. He carried {{in one hand}} a small satchel, which he set down upon the floor beside the chair which the lawyer placed for him. His clothing was of good quality, but it was worn without regard to neatness or style, and appeared <b>to</b> be <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> the <b>dust</b> of travel.|$|R
60|$|The king arrived {{before it}} on the 19th, and on the {{following}} day advanced to reconnoitre it closely. The gunners of the town, seeing a number of officers approaching, fired, and with so good an aim that a cannonball carried off the hindquarters of the horse the king was riding. A cry of alarm and consternation burst from the officers, but their delight was great when the king rose <b>to</b> his feet, <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> and blood indeed, but otherwise unhurt.|$|R
5000|$|The fender {{extension}} on the Apollo 17 LRV broke when accidentally bumped by Eugene Cernan with {{a hammer}} handle. Cernan and Schmitt taped the extension back in place, but due to the dusty surfaces, the tape did not adhere and the extension was lost after about one hour of driving, causing the astronauts <b>to</b> be <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>dust.</b> For their second EVA, a replacement [...] "fender" [...] was made with some EVA maps, duct tape, {{and a pair of}} clamps from inside the Lunar Module that were nominally intended for the moveable overhead light. This repair was later undone so that the clamps could be taken inside for the return launch. The maps were brought back to Earth and are now on display at the National Air and Space Museum. The abrasion from the dust is evident on some portions of the makeshift fender.|$|R
40|$|Juventae Chasma {{is a deep}} {{depression}} located {{north of}} Valles Marineris on Mars, with four bright mounds or light-toned interior layered deposits (ILDs) extending upwards from the Canyon floor. We present here the results of long-term imaging of Juventae Chasma including mounds A, B, C, and D using multiple datasets. Monohydrated sulfates (MHS) were deposited first on the canyon floor, followed by polyhydrated sulfates (PHS). The upper PHS-dominated units are largely eroded away at Juventae Chasma, but this material is still present in significant abundance at mound B. PHS are observed mixed with MHS {{in some areas of}} mounds A and C. Terraces are observed at the upper elevations of mound B that contain PHS at the steeper slopes and appear <b>to</b> be <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> on the horizontal surfaces. Current analyses of the MHS-rich unit indicate that kieserite (MgSO 4 {dot operator}H 2 O) is the primary sulfate component, rather than szomolnokite (FeSO 4 {dot operator}H 2 O) as previously thought. Formation of kieserite at Juventae Chasma likely required temperatures in the 150 - 200 °C range. Geochemical modeling is most consistent with dissolution of mafic materials followed by precipitation of kieserite from solution. The dust exhibits ferric signatures and the sand is largely mafic material. Outcrops of olivine- and pyroxene-bearing rocks are best observed along the base of mound C and in the chaotic terrain surrounding mound D. This study summarizes the current understanding of Juventae Chasma and its ILDs using HRSC, HiRISE and CTX data, an expanded laboratory spectral library, and the latest calibrations available for CRISM...|$|R
50|$|The first moonwalk (EVA) of {{the mission}} began {{approximately}} four hours after landing, at about 6:55 pm on December 11. The first task of the first lunar excursion was to offload the Lunar Roving Vehicle and other equipment from the Lunar Module. While working near the rover, a fender was accidentally broken off when Gene Cernan brushed up against it, his hammer getting caught under the right-rear fender, breaking off the rear extension. The same incident had also occurred on Apollo 16 as Commander John Young maneuvered around the rover. Although {{this was not a}} mission-critical issue, the loss of the fender caused Cernan and Schmitt <b>to</b> be <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> thrown up when the rover was in motion. The crew used duct tape to fix the problem by attaching a map to the damaged fender, but the dust picked up on the tape surface prevented it from sticking properly and the first fix was short lived. After an overnight rethink by the flight controllers, a better method of applying the tape resulted in a satisfactory fix that lasted for the length of the exploration. The crew then deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) west of the immediate landing site. After completing this, Cernan and Schmitt departed on the first geologic traverse {{of the mission}} towards Steno crater to the south of the landing site, during which they gathered 14 kg of samples; took seven gravimeter measurements; and deployed two explosive packages, which were later detonated remotely to test geophones that had been placed by the astronauts and seismometers that had been placed on previous Apollo missions. The EVA ended after seven hours and twelve minutes.|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not know}} why, if these abominable cruelties were thought mean, it was held lawful <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> a stone <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> and get a boy, not in the secret, to kick the pile over with his bare foot. It was {{perfectly}} good form, also, to get a boy, if you could, to shut his eyes, and then lead him into a mud-puddle or a thicket of briers or nettles, or to fool him in any heartless way, such as promising to pump easy when he put his mouth to the pump-spout, and then coming down on the pump-handle with a rush that flooded him with water and sent him off blowing the tide from his nostrils like a whale. Perhaps these things were permitted because {{the sight of the}} victim's suffering was so funny. Half the pleasure in fighting wasps or bumble-bees was in killing them and destroying their nests; the other half was in seeing the fellows get stung. If you could fool a fellow into a mass-meeting of bumble-bees, and see him lead them off in a steeple-chase, it was right and fair to do so. But there were other cases in which deceit was not allowable. For instance, if you appeared on the playground with an apple, and all the boys came whooping round, [...] "You know me, Jimmy!" [...] "You know your uncle!" [...] "You know your grandfather!" [...] and you began to sell out bites at three pins for a lady-bite and six pins for a hog-bite, and a boy bought a lady-bite and then took a hog-bite, he was held in contempt, and could by no means pass it off for a good joke on you; it was considered mean.|$|R

50|$|It is most {{generally}} accepted that the streaks represent avalanches of dust. Streaks appear in areas <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>dust.</b> When {{a thin layer}} of dust is removed, the underlying surface appears dark. Much of the Martian surface is <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>dust.</b> Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical then the Earth's. That is the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only slight for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in a global dust storm. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time.|$|R
