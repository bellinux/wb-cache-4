5|$|Approximately 27,000 Boer {{women and}} {{children}} died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners. The British won the war, but anti-British sentiment contributed {{to the rise of}} Afrikaner nationalism and the pro-Afrikaner National Party was the ruling party of South Africa from 1948 until 1994, <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> era.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Apartheid</b> era, 16 December {{continued}} to be celebrated as the Day of the Vow and the Day of the Covenant. In 1952, Dingane's Day was changed to Day of the Covenant and in 1980 was changed to The Day of the Vow. The Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria was erected on 16 December 1949 to commemorate Dingane's Day.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, {{the flag}} became {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> regime. Movements like the Black Sash and Umkhonto we Sizwe started protesting against {{it with their}} own symbols. Often the flag of South Africa would be removed from public display and replaced with the banned ANC flag. The flag would also {{be the subject of}} public burnings during anti-apartheid protests.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} {{uninhabited}} by Europeans until after World War II, when a severe drought caused white Afrikaans speaking farmers (Boers) to move in. The farm was later procured by <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> government {{as part of}} the Odendaal Plan and became part of the Damaraland bantustan. The white settlers left in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Upon gaining {{independence}} in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of {{its foreign policy}} and {{played a leading role}} in the fight against <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> government in South Africa.

5|$|After {{his arrest}} Biko {{was held in}} custody in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape for several days, during which he was interrogated. During his {{interrogation}} he was severely beaten {{by some of the}} policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E
5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{eight years}} after their last {{official}} series, South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after the dismantling of <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> system, and was only done with permission of the African National Congress. With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final. After a tense final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15â€“12 winners, with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.|$|E

In 1977, Tydings called for the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland to divest its endowment from companies doing business with <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> regime in South Africa. He later served as a member of Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland from 2000 to 2005. In September 2008, he was appointed by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley to the board of the University of Maryland Medical System. As of 2016, he resides in Harford County, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, {{introduced}} {{many changes}} to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules.

Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.|$|E

Vic Clapham was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. In 1971, former Chief Scout Arthur H. Johnstone was also awarded the Bronze Wolf. Colin Inglis and Garnet de la Hunt, both former Chief Scouts of South Africa, were awarded the Bronze Wolf in 1996 for their work towards racial unity in Scouting during <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> era. Winston Adams of South Africa received the Bronze Wolf in 2017.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>apartheid</b> {{government}} greatly limited {{freedom of}} expression, through censorship, reduced economic freedom, and reduced mobility for black people. However, {{it did not}} have the resources to effectively enforce censorship of written and recorded material. The government established the Directorate of Publications in 1974 through the Publications Act, but this body only responded to complaints, and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it. Less than one hundred pieces of music were formally banned by this body in the 1980s. Thus music and performance {{played an important role in}} propagating subversive messages.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} tension between those musicians {{who went into}} exile, and were therefore able to perform for, and raise awareness among, much larger audiences, and anti-apartheid musicians who remained in South Africa. The latter group has received significantly less popular attention, though Vershbow states that it played an equally {{important role in the}} movement, and Schumann argues that it was responsible for putting significant pressure on <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> government. The role of music in social change in South African is examined in the documentary film , released in 2002. The film focuses specifically on the 'liberation music' of the struggle against white domination.|$|E

The general image of Gandhi, state Desai and Vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination {{as if he was}} always a saint, when in reality his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths and was one that evolved over time. In contrast, other Africa scholars state the evidence points to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and <b>the</b> <b>Apartheid.</b>|$|E

The province was claimed {{as a part of}} Malawi in 1968 by the then Malawian President Dr. Hastings Kamazu Banda who was a supporter of <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> in South Africa against the wishes of Organization of African Unity (OAU). The then Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda openly asked Malawi to go on war with Zambia to claim the province and also affirmed that Zambia would not have trade relations with Malawi until the claim on territory was withdrawn. The expansionist ambition of Malawi was discontinued and the Eastern Province remained with Zambia.|$|E
5|$|Biko and SASO were openly {{critical}} of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought {{to influence the}} white electorate; in his opinion, this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be ineffective for the ultimate aim of dismantling <b>the</b> <b>apartheid</b> state. SASO regarded student marches, pickets, and strikes to be ineffective and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a point when it had a sufficiently large institutional structure. Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures {{in response to the}} expulsion of SASO member Abram Onkgopotse Tiro from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced the government that SASO was a threat.|$|E
