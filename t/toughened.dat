5|$|The {{competition}} {{mission was}} then <b>toughened</b> {{and made a}} bit less abstract by requiring teams {{to search for a}} toxic waste dump, map the location of partially buried randomly oriented toxic waste drums, identify the contents of each drum from the hazard labels found somewhere on the outside of each drum, and bring a sample back from one of the drums—all without any human intervention whatsoever.|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{engineering}} and functional ceramics {{are sensitive to}} damage cracks, which delay the wide applications of these materials in various fields. Ceramic composites with enhanced fracture toughness may trigger a paradigm for design and application of the brittle components. This paper reviews the <b>toughening</b> mechanisms for the nanolayered MAX phase ceramics. The main <b>toughening</b> mechanisms for these ternary compounds were controlled by particle <b>toughening,</b> phase-transformation <b>toughening</b> and fiber-reinforced <b>toughening,</b> as well as texture <b>toughening.</b> Based on the various <b>toughening</b> mechanisms in MAX phase, models of SiC particles and fibers <b>toughening</b> Ti 3 SiC 2 are established to predict and explain the <b>toughening</b> mechanisms. The modeling work provides insights and guidance to fabricate MAX phase-related composites with optimized microstructures {{in order to achieve}} the desired mechanical properties required for harsh application environments. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>toughening</b> of {{hard coating}} is {{becoming}} very important from engineering point of view. Nano multilayer structure {{is one of}} the effective way towards <b>toughening.</b> A comprehensive discussion on composition and <b>toughening</b> mechanism of structure <b>toughening</b> was presented. The effect of period, period ratio and microstructure on <b>toughening,</b> and the application of multilayer structure <b>toughening</b> in wear and erosion were also discussed. Micro-crack deflection is the main mechanism of <b>toughening,</b> but the more interface, the more initiation of cracks, results in spalling failure in case of little interfacial toughness. It can be concluded that interface quality rather quantity dominates <b>toughening</b> effect. In order to show the advantage of nano multilayer film, a good interfacial toughness must be obtained,and the blocking of the propagation of micro cracks should be considered from fracture mechanics point of view...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanics}} {{model of}} microcrack <b>toughening</b> is presented. The model predicts {{the magnitude of}} microcrack <b>toughening</b> {{as well as the}} existence of R-curve effects. The <b>toughening</b> is predicated on both the elastic modulus diminution in the microcrack process zone and the dilatation induced by microcracking. The modulus effect is relatively small and process-zone-size-independent. The dilatational effect is potentially more substantial, as well as being the primary source of the R curve. The dilatational contribution is also zone-size-dependent. The analysis demonstrates that microcrack <b>toughening</b> is less potent than transformation <b>toughening...</b>|$|R
5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or <b>toughened</b> components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E
5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often <b>toughened</b> {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1940, Quisling flew to Berlin to {{negotiate}} the future of Norway's independence. By the time he returned on 13December, he had agreed to raise volunteers to fight with the German Schutzstaffel (SS). In January, SS head Heinrich Himmler travelled to Norway to oversee preparations. Quisling clearly believed that if Norway supported Nazi Germany on the battlefield, {{there would be no}} reason for Germany to annex her. To this end, he opposed plans to have a German SS brigade loyal only to Hitler installed in Norway. In the process, he also <b>toughened</b> his attitude to the country harbouring the exiled king, the United Kingdom, which he no longer saw as a Nordic ally. Finally, Quisling aligned Norwegian policy on Jews with that of Germany, giving a speech in Frankfurt on 26 March 1941 in which he argued for compulsory exile, but warned against extermination.|$|E
40|$|For {{engineering}} {{applications of}} thin films, appropriate combination of high hardness with other properties (such as high toughness, low residual stress, good adhesion with substrate and oxidation resistance) is of vital importance. Super high hardness {{alone does not}} have too much use. For practical application, hardness and toughness are of the same importance. This paper gives a critical review on <b>toughening</b> methodologies for hard nanostructural thin films, these are: ductile phase <b>toughening,</b> nanograin boundary strengthening and sliding, composition and structure grading, multilayer design, carbon nanotube <b>toughening,</b> phase transformation <b>toughening,</b> compressive stress <b>toughening,</b> etc. A summary is given to cap the essence of <b>toughening</b> methodologies in terms of increasing the storage or dissipation of plastic energy...|$|R
40|$|A new <b>toughening</b> {{method that}} can be used to improve {{toughness}} for thermosets was developed. The method involved heat treatment to produce compressive residual stresses around hollow microspheres in solidified matrix. An epoxy resin system with expandable hollow microspheres for modification was adopted for demonstration. <b>Toughening</b> based on the method was shown to be more than twice as effective than the usual hollow microsphere <b>toughening</b> and its major <b>toughening</b> mechanism was deduced to be due to compressive residual stresses rather than cavitation. A necessary condition for cavitation in the presence of compressive residual stress was proposed and comparatively discussed for the <b>toughening</b> mechanisms involved...|$|R
30|$|The {{performance}} of synthetic <b>toughening</b> agent {{should be tested}} in EP adhesive system.

5|$|James {{asserted}} {{his authority}} not only over the nobility but also upon the Church and lamented that King David I's benevolence towards the Church proved costly to his successors {{and that he}} was 'a sair sanct to the croun'. James also considered that the monastic institutions in particular needed improvement and that they should return to being strictly ordered communities. Part of James's solution was to create an assembly of overseeing abbots and followed this up by establishing a Carthusian priory at Perth to provide other religious houses with an example of internal conduct. He also sought to influence Church attitudes to his policies by having his own clerics appointed to the bishoprics of Dunblane, Dunkeld, Glasgow and Moray. In March 1425, James's parliament directed that all bishops must instruct their clerics to offer up prayers for the king and his family; a year later, parliament <b>toughened</b> up this edict insisting that the prayers be given at every mass under sanction of a fine and severe rebuke. This same parliament legislated that every person in Scotland should 'be governed under the king's laws and statutes of this realm only'. From this, laws were enacted in 1426 to restrict the actions of prelates whether it was to regulate their need to travel to the Roman Curia or their ability to purchase additional ecclesiastical positions while there. In James's parliament of July 1427, it is evident that statute being enacted had the purpose of reducing the powers of the church jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The French and British naval staffs {{moved to}} Geneva, where a second {{agreement}} was signed on 17 September 1937. It extended {{the rules governing}} submarine warfare to surface vessels, and had the same signatories. Official versions of both agreements were published in French and English. Several proposals were not implemented: for instance, the British Admiral Ernle Chatfield wanted the Spanish parties {{to be able to}} verify that the flag a ship was displaying was correct, thereby preventing attacks on British shipping if Republican ships continued to use the British flag as a means of escape. This would have benefited the Nationalists, and the French insisted that this provision be dropped. Greece and Turkey wanted ships with a clear identifying mark to be excluded, so as to avoid being forced to fire on a German or Italian warship. This was rejected, but an amendment was made allowing nations to issue their preferred orders in their own territorial waters. A suggestion to fire at any attacking aircraft was easily passed. Another suggestion on surface ships (which incorrectly stated no attack had yet been proven) was eventually <b>toughened</b> {{with the addition of a}} clause stating aggressors would be attacked, at the request of the French. A Soviet proposal strengthening the effect of the agreement was made.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a {{synthesis}} method of epoxy resin <b>toughening</b> agent was presented, then the chemical composition and molecular number were studied, {{which include the}} DSC curves analysis, the fracture surface morphology and bonding strength. In addition, the mechanism of epoxy resin <b>toughening</b> agent {{and the effect of}} <b>toughening</b> agent’s content to bonding strength were studied. The testing results reveal that this <b>toughening</b> agent can form a micro two-phase structure in epoxy-amine system, which results in the stable chemical properties and excellent physical properties.|$|R
30|$|When {{the ratio}} of EP {{adhesive}} to <b>toughening</b> agent is 20  %, the bonding strength reaches the peak value, however, if {{the ratio of}} <b>toughening</b> agent is too high, which will cause damage to the original curing system, thus reducing the system’s bonding strength (Al-Turaif 2010). If the ratio of <b>toughening</b> agent is < 20  %, a perfect two-phase structure was formed by the combination of <b>toughening</b> agent and resin system without affecting the epoxy value of the system, therefore, the bonding strength of the system can be improved.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} framework used {{to describe}} transformation <b>toughening</b> in zirconia-based ceramics is adapted to apply to transformation <b>toughening</b> in bulk metallic glass matrix composites. The method {{is applied to the}} Cu(47. 5) Zr(47. 5) Al(5) bulk metallic glass, showing that the low volume change of transformation in this alloy leads to negligible <b>toughening</b> via the proposed mechanism.

40|$|Analyses are {{presented}} to evaluate two microcrack <b>toughening</b> situations in Zr_O 2 -based ceramics. The first analysis considers <b>toughening</b> due to stress-induced microcracking of residually strained monoclinic ZrO_ 2 particles. The second assesses microcracking that occurs {{as a consequence}} of the stress-induced tetragonal-monoclinic transformation. Both <b>toughening</b> mechanisms are characterized by a permanent dilatational strain and a modulus reduction; however, only the latter may result in a toughness enhancement or reduction. Conditions under which toughness enhancement and reduction are observed are established. The magnitudes of <b>toughening</b> increases from transformation-toughening and microcrack-toughening are also compared...|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} chemical <b>toughening</b> process involves {{forcing a}} surface layer of glass at least 0.1 mm thick into compression by ion exchange of the sodium ions {{in the glass}} surface with potassium ions (which are 30% larger), by immersion of the glass into a bath of molten potassium nitrate. Chemical <b>toughening</b> results in increased toughness compared with thermal <b>toughening</b> and {{can be applied to}} glass objects of complex shapes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Toughening</b> {{mechanisms}} and flank wear {{behavior of a}} TiC whisker <b>toughening</b> Al 2 O 3 -based ceramic cutting tool composite were investigated.

As a result, the tool composite could still possess enough high fracture toughness and flexure strength at high cutting temperature, which resulted in an interesting phenomenon that the wear resistance of the tool composite at higher cutting speed was higher than that of itself at lower cutting speed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The damage {{variables}} were {{defined by the}} microstructure of rod-shaped eutectic with parallel nano-micron fibers. The maximum strain criterion was used for determining the loading function. According to the attenuation characteristic of eutectic rigidity, the critical fracture stress of the damage rod-shaped eutectic was obtained by damage variable maximizing. On {{the basis of the}} work done by frictional force over the pull-out length, bridging <b>toughening</b> mechanism and pull-out <b>toughening</b> mechanism of damage rod-shaped eutectics were constructed. The result shows that damage in the eutectic reduces the eutectic rigidity, thus fracture strength decreases and the eutectic contribution to composite ceramic bridging <b>toughening</b> and pull-out <b>toughening</b> decreases...|$|R
