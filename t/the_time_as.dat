5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while standing and at rest, and swollen legs displaying open sores.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, {{it does not seem to}} have been attributed the same significance (even at <b>the</b> <b>time)</b> <b>as,</b> for example, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the Arch of Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. The arch is decorated with images of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, sacrifices to gods like Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> a pagan redoubt.|$|E

5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force.

5|$|At age six, Howerton {{was living}} in McCleary, Washington, with his parents and five brothers, Albert, Ernest, Forrest, LeRoy, and Charles.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, work was {{commissioned}} to precisely determine {{the mass of}} a cubic decimetre (one litre) of water. Although the decreed definition of the kilogram specified water at 0°C—its highly stable temperature point—the French chemist Louis Lefèvre-Gineau and the Italian naturalist Giovanni Fabbroni {{after several years of}} research chose to redefine the standard in 1799 to water's most stable density point: the temperature at which water reaches maximum density, which was measured at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> 4°C.|$|E

5|$|Chopin {{published}} his music in France, England and the German states {{due to the}} copyright laws of <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>As</b> such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition {{is different from the}} other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E

Caylor wrote that Stivetts' issues were entirely his own, blaming his hard-drinking lifestyle and his inability to remain in good condition.|$|E
