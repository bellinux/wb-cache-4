5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's {{willingness}} to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac {{is used as}} an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus, the idea of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of Isaac being a prefigure of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of Jesus on the cross.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E

The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice,</b> Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing the wealth {{equal to that of}} the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice.</b> He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|The Skanda Purana narrates that Bhikshatana-Shiva {{appears on}} another {{occasion}} as a naked, fierce Kapali beggar. Once, at a sacrifice hosted by Brahma, Bhikshatana appears and begs for food. The Brahmins performing <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> try to drive him away, considering a hungry beggar unfit for sacrificial rites. Bhikshatana throws his skull begging-bowl {{on the ground and}} the Brahmins throw it out, but another skull bowl appears in its place. Consequently, hundreds of skulls appear, polluting <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice,</b> which compels Brahma to promise Shiva that no sacrifice will be deemed complete without an invocation to him, Kapaleshvara—the Lord of the skulls.|$|E

5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, {{an expert}} on South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, author of Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject of}} Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One invocation to her calls her <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice,</b> the sacrificer, and the recipient of <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice,</b> with the severed head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E

5|$|In rabbinical tradition, {{the age of}} Isaac at {{the time}} of binding is taken to be 37, which {{contrasts}} with common portrayals of Isaac as a child. The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac. <b>The</b> <b>sacrifice</b> of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the aqedah ("binding"). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in <b>the</b> <b>sacrifice</b> and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.|$|E
5|$|More subtle Jewish {{references}} are {{also included in}} {{other aspects of the}} Rugrats franchise.
