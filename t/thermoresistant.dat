In the present study, we investigated the influence of hyperthermia on the metastatic potential of B 16 -F 10 murine melanoma cells. Incubation of melanoma cells at 43 ºC for 30 min led to {{a significant decrease in}} cell viability. About half of the cells survived the acute exposure to heat. These <b>thermoresistant</b> cells displayed a longer lag phase as compared to control unheated B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells.

Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine the heat resistance of spores isolated from dehydrated ingredients, intermediate and final products. Furthermore, the influence of the heating medium (milk or phosphate buffer) on the heat resistance was determined in order to assess which medium is best to use in the context of dairy processing. Sixteen spore-forming strains from seven different species (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus flexus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thermoamylovorans, Bacillus smithii, Geobacillus pallidus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus) producing <b>thermoresistant</b> spores were selected after their isolation from diverse food products obtained from local dairies such as cocoa powder, milk powder, spices, and dessert products. Spores produced from the chosen strains were tested regarding their heat resistance at 110, 120, and 125  °C for 30  min. Highly <b>thermoresistant</b> spores surviving a heat treatment for 30  min at 125  °C in milk were produced by B. amyloliquefaciens and G. stearothermophilus. The inactivation of the spores was higher in milk than in phosphate buffer. This study highlights that not only raw milk but also dehydrated ingredients are important sources of <b>thermoresistant</b> spores in dairy processing. Since the inactivation of spores in milk and phosphate buffer turned out to be significantly different, milk rather than laboratory media or buffers should be employed as the model heating system when designing thermal processes for new milk-based products...|$|E

The <b>thermoresistant</b> DNA synthesis was inhibited by the presence of the wild-type dnaA allele at a high but not a low copy number. The synthesis was also inhibited by an elevated dose of a mutant dnaR allele retaining dnaR activity.

The induced synthesis was synchronously initiated from oriC and proceeded semiconservatively toward terC. The replication depended on the dnaA function, which was essential for normal initiation of replication from oriC. The capability for drug-induced replication was abolished by certain rifampin resistance mutations in the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. Thus, the drug can induce the dnaA-dependent initiation of replication in the dnaR-deficient cells through its effect on RNA polymerase.

40|$|AbstractFeline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) multiplication is totally blocked by incubation of infected cells at 41 °. This inhibition {{does not take}} place with a <b>thermoresistant</b> strain of FIV, designated m 41, indicating {{the role played by}} the viral genome in temperature sensitivity. We have investigated the steps in the life cycle of wild-type FIV that are thermosensitive and found that they depend on the host cells infected. In CrFK cells, FIV replication was inhibited after the penetration step at 41 °. Synthesis of viral RNA and DNA was barely detectable and no viral antigen appeared in the extracellular medium. Nevertheless, viral multiplication resumed on incubation at 37 °, suggesting a state of latency at the elevated temperature. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the FIV cycle was inhibited at 41 ° after the synthesis of viral DNA. Several viral mRNAs failed to appear as fully spliced products and no viral antigen was found in the extracellular medium. As in CrFK cells, viral multiplication occurred in PBMCs after a shift to the permissive temperature. These results suggest that at least two steps in the viral life cycle are sensitive to 41 ° and that two different viral functions of the <b>thermoresistant</b> mutant m 41 are modified to overcome temperature sensitivity...|$|E

Because the Min system is thought to down-regulate Z-ring assembly, the prediction was that removing minCDE might at least partially suppress the thermosensitivity of ftsZ 84, which can form colonies below 42 °C but not at or above 42 °C. Contrary to expectations, the double mutant was significantly more thermosensitive than the ftsZ 84 single mutant. When shifted to the new lower nonpermissive temperature, the double mutant formed long filaments mostly devoid of Z rings, suggesting a likely cause of the increased thermosensitivity. Interestingly, even at 22 °C, many Z rings were missing in the double mutant, and the rings that were present were predominantly at the cell poles. Of these, a large number were present only at one pole. These cells exhibited a higher than expected incidence of polar divisions, with a bias toward the newest pole. Moreover, some cells exhibited dramatically elongated septa that stained for FtsZ, suggesting that the double mutant is defective in Z-ring disassembly, and providing a possible mechanism for the polar bias. <b>Thermoresistant</b> suppressors of the double mutant arose that had modestly increased levels of FtsZ 84. These cells also exhibited elongated septa and, in addition, produced a high frequency of branched cells. A <b>thermoresistant</b> suppressor of the ftsZ 84 single mutant also synthesized more FtsZ 84 and produced branched cells.

The percent similarity between the results of both instruments was 99 %+/-relative standard deviation of 12. 7 %. The concordance correlation coefficient was 0. 99. The absolute bias and limits of agreement (LOA) between the two instruments, calculated by Bland-Altman analysis, were clinically acceptable (bias: + 4 cells/mul; LOA: - 111 to + 120 cells/mul).

The repeatability of measurements on the Auto 40 was also similar to that observed with FACSCount system (bias + 0. 1 cells/mul, coefficient of variation 2. 5 % vs bias - 1. 1 cells/mul, coefficient of variation 2. 9 % respectively). In conclusion, our results indicate that the Auto 40 system, using <b>thermoresistant</b> reagents, is suitable for CD 4 T cell enumeration and will be a helpful tool to improve HIV laboratory monitoring in resource-limited settings...|$|E
40|$|A mutant, cyaR 1, {{affecting}} {{regulation of}} adenylate cyclase expression or activity is described. It was obtained as a <b>thermoresistant</b> revertant of a strain harboring a thermosensitive transcription termination factor, rho (rho- 15). This mutant failed to synthesize adenosine 3 ', 5 '-phosphate and exhibited a carbohydrate-negative phenotype. A secondary mutation at the crp locus (crpC) restored {{the ability of}} the mutant to synthesize adenosine 3 ', 5 '-phosphate, enabled the expression of catabolite-sensitive operons, and conferred on the strain an extreme sensitivity to catabolite repression. In addition, we showed that the crpC mutation restored the pleiotropic carbohydrate-positive phenotype even in a delta cya background. We interpret this to mean that the adenosine 3 ', 5 '-phosphate receptor protein regulates negatively either the activity or synthesis of adenylate cyclase and that the cyaR 1 mutation is either in a regulatory protein or a regulatory site of adenylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|Manuscript of {{the article}} {{published}} in print 13 April 2016. The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10. 1021 /acs. jafc. 6 b 00222. Glycoside hydrolases, specifically β-galactosidases, {{can be used to}} synthesize galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) due to the transglycosylating (secondary) activity of these enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis of a <b>thermoresistant</b> β-galactosidase from Thermotoga maritima has been carried out to study the structural basis of transgalactosylation and to obtain enzymatic variants with better performance for GOS biosynthesis. Rational design of mutations was based on homologous sequence analysis and structural modeling. Analysis of mutant enzymes indicated that residue W 959, or an alternative aromatic residue at this position, is critical for the synthesis of β- 3 ′-galactosyl-lactose, the major GOS obtained with the wild-type enzyme. Mutants W 959 A and W 959 C, but not W 959 F, showed an 80...|$|E
40|$|The sfiA and sfiB mutations, {{originally}} {{isolated in}} <b>thermoresistant</b> ultraviolet-resistant revertants of a tif lon strain, also suppressed filamentation in tsl strains (mutated at the lexA locus). When deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was arrested, however, sfi-independent filamentation occurred. Other SOS functions were {{not affected by}} sfiA and sfiB mutations; in particular, ultraviolet-induced repair and mutagenesis of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid were normal, as was tsl-tif-induced synthesis of recA protein. Genetic studies (i) established the identity of map location of the sfiA and sulA loci, (ii) showed that the two sfiB mutations are recessive, and (iii) showed that of six independent sfiA mutations, three are recessive and three are dominant. One sfiB strain was shown to have a 6 % growth disadvantage relative to a sfi+ or sfiA strain. It is proposed that the sfiA locus may define the structural gene of a hypothetical inducible SOS-associated division inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|Mutations {{enhancing}} the thermostability of beta-glucosidase A of Bacillus polymyxa, a family 1 glycosyl hydrolase, {{have been obtained}} after hydroxylamine mutagenesis of a plasmid containing the bglA gene, transformation of Escherichia coli with the mutagenized plasmid, and identification of transformant colonies that showed beta-glucosidase activity after a thermal treatment that inactivated the wild-type enzyme. Two additive mutations have been characterized that cause replacement of glutamate at position 96 by lysine and of methionine at position 416 by isoleucine respectively. The <b>thermoresistant</b> mutant enzymes showed increased resistance to other denaturing agents, such as pH and urea, while their kinetic parameters did not change. CD spectra indicated that the E 96 K replacement caused an increase in alpha-helix content. The observed effect of the M 416 I mutation {{is consistent with the}} lower content of cysteine and methionine found in family 1 enzymes of thermophilic species compared with similar ones from mesophilic organisms...|$|E
