25|$|Much {{of the art}} of {{motorcycle}} cornering {{is learning}} how to effectively push <b>the</b> <b>grips</b> into corners and how to maintain proper lean angles through the turn. When the need for a quick swerve to one side suddenly arises in an emergency, it is essential to know, through prior practice, that countersteering is {{the most efficient way to}} change the motorcycle's course. Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who have never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle.|$|E
25|$|In {{externally}} decorated glassware the cadmium {{and lead}} content are limited, with lower concentrations permitted for the lip or rim region. Lead content is also restricted in ceramic ware with exterior decorations, booster cables, and safety pins in varying concentrations. In the case of safety pins the preliminary limit is 300ppm for 2012, but a much lower limit of 100 ppm will come into force in 2013. For <b>the</b> <b>grips</b> of hand tools the content of lead and certain phthalates are restricted. Various specific phthalates are also restricted in varying concentrations in notepads with vinyl coverings, purses, slippers, flip flops with rhinestones and similar plastic footwear, ear buds and headsets, and exercise/fitness mats. Restriction on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is defined for smoothing solution products, {{and in this case}} a specific warning is mandatory in the material safety data sheets if the product releases detectable amounts of formaldehyde.|$|E

50|$|A related grip-type {{safety is}} <b>the</b> {{decocking}} <b>grip</b> found on some H&K pistols like the P7 Series. The firearm is cocked {{and ready to}} fire only when the front of <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is squeezed by the operator. When <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is released, <b>the</b> firearm is decocked, and the single-action trigger will not cock the firearm, therefore it will not fire unless <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is squeezed and the trigger pulled. Alternatively, the trigger can first be pulled {{and then it will}} fire when <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is subsequently squeezed. Finally, if both <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is squeezed and the trigger pulled simultaneously, the pistol will fire.|$|R

25|$|Brown was {{accompanied}} by the sheriff and his assistants, but no minister since he had consistently rejected the ministrations of pro-slavery clergy. Since the region was in <b>the</b> <b>grips</b> of virtual hysteria, most northerners, including journalists, were run out of town, and it is unlikely any anti-slavery clergyman would have been safe, even {{if one were to}} have sought to visit Brown. He elected to receive no religious services in the jail or at the scaffold. He was hanged at 11:15 a.m. and pronounced dead at 11:50 a.m. His body was placed in a wooden coffin with the noose still around his neck. His coffin was then put on a train to take it away from Virginia to his family homestead in New York for burial. In the North, large memorial meetings took place, church bells rang, minute guns were fired, and famous writers such as Emerson and Thoreau joined many Northerners in praising Brown.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{benefited from}} Germany's loss, {{as one of}} the first terms of the {{armistice}} was the abrogation of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. At the time of the armistice Russia was in <b>the</b> <b>grips</b> of a civil war which left more than seven million people dead and large areas of the country devastated. The nation as a whole suffered socially and economically. As to her border territories, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia gained independence. They were occupied again by the Soviet Union in 1940. Finland gained a lasting independence, though she repeatedly had to fight the Soviet Union for her borders. Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan were established as independent states in the Caucasus region. These countries were proclaimed as Soviet Republics in 1922 and over time were absorbed into the Soviet Union. During the war, however, Turkey captured the Armenian territory around Artvin, Kars, and Igdir, and these territorial losses became permanent. Romania gained Bessarabia from Russia. The Russian concession in Tianjin was occupied by the Chinese in 1920; in 1924 the Soviet Union renounced its claims to the district.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} new {{freestyle}} features into gameplay, citing the overuse of the Flavor Flav default sample {{in the first}} game. MacDonald favored how FreeStyleGames transformed the limited freestyle sections of the first game into [...] "an integral part" [...] of the sequel. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer stated {{that the nature of}} DJ Hero 2s freestyling made him feel that he was [...] "helping craft the mix, not just hitting buttons in time". While the addition of new multiplayer modes was well-received, many felt the vocal track addition did not work out well. [...] Chris Watters of GameSpot noted that [...] "the singing evaluation doesn't feel as slick as in other games", and unless the player knows the music from both tracks of a mix, singing the back-and-forth mix [...] "isn't all that fun". Helgeson commented that attempting to sing lyrics from two separate songs [...] "feels like playing karaoke game in <b>the</b> <b>grips</b> of a seizure".|$|E

50|$|While <b>the</b> cable <b>grips</b> used in <b>the</b> {{original}} cable railways were manually operated, requiring considerable {{skill and}} strength, modern cable grips {{tend to be}} automatic. Given that the cable runs at a relatively constant speed, accelerating the vehicle to match {{the speed of the}} cable presents a technical difficulty; possible methods are to apply <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> gradually, to accelerate the vehicle (e.g. by guiding wheels) prior to applying <b>the</b> <b>grip,</b> or to use a sprung linkage between <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> and <b>the</b> vehicle. Also, the cable {{needs to be able to}} handle friction from <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> and increased load while the vehicle is accelerating.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> waved {{badminton}} <b>grip</b> {{is a type}} of grip {{that has}} foam strips in the center of <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> wrap so that after <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is applied, there will be 'grooves' on <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> that can help increase friction and comfort when holding the racquet.The only slight disadvantage of waved grips is that is slightly heavier than flat <b>grips</b> due to <b>the</b> excess foam for the grooves.|$|R
2500|$|Bull-holders, {{also known}} as bull-tongs, have a pliers action and are used for short periods on grown cattle when they are being mouthed or drenched.

2500|$|The Raja of Bobbili {{became the}} Chief Minister on 5 November 1932 {{at the age}} of 31 and except for a short span of [...] 4 months when he was on a trip to England, served as Chief Minister until 1 April 1937. [...] During his tenure, Madras was in <b>the</b> <b>grips</b> of the Great Depression. The Raja did {{introduce}} some measures in order to relieve the burden on the poor peasant. But by and large, the rapid depreciation of the economy remained unchecked and the government showed little concern towards the plight of the poor peasant. The Justice Party lost badly in the 1937 elections. The Raja's policies are believed to be the main reason.|$|E

2500|$|During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen {{discussed}} the [...] "Paradox of deleveraging" [...] described by economist Hyman Minsky: [...] "Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take {{long before we}} were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in <b>the</b> <b>grips</b> of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Husqvarna Model 40 or m/40 was {{manufactured}} 1940 to 1946 {{and was a}} Swedish copy of the Finnish Lahti pistol. The Swedish army {{realized there}} would be a shortage of pistols in the event of large scale military mobilization in Europe. Originally adopting the Walther P38 in 1939, Germany's entry into World War II stopped the export of P38s to Sweden. To compensate, Sweden adopted the Lahti pistol but was unable to import L-35-type guns because of Finland's conflicts with the USSR. Production was licensed to Svenska Automatvapen AB but the immediate collapse of the company passed the contract to Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. The first m/40s were delivered to the Swedish military by 1942 with slight differences from the Finnish L-35 Lahtis. <b>The</b> <b>grips</b> of the m/40 have the Husqvarna [...] "crown H" [...] motif engraved and the front sight was slightly larger. The barrel is also slightly longer on the m/40 than the Finnish Lahti with the m/40's trigger guard being heavier, and the pistol does not have the loaded chamber indicator and lock-retaining spring of the Finnish Lahti. Other modifications included a change in the gun steel quality specifications that were not successful in the m/40s and led to cracks in the frame. Cracking in the frame became more aggravated as the m/39B-ammunition developed for use in the Carl Gustav m/45 submachine gun were used in the pistols. The m/40 would eventually be taken out of service in the 1980s because of the frame cracks, being completely replaced by the Glock 17 by the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Zone 1, on {{the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>grip,</b> has an {{anti-slip}} surface that is less assertive to work in conjunction with more sensitive parts of the hand. Zone 2, at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>grip,</b> has much more aggressive texturing, encouraging more friction and a firm hold. Zone 3, covering all other areas of <b>the</b> <b>grip,</b> is moderately textured and is meant to support the other two zones.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{adaptation}} of <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> forces to <b>the</b> fric-tional condition between the digits and an object relies on feedforward sensorimotor mechanisms that use tactile afferent input to intermittently update a sensorimotor memory {{that controls the}} force coordination, i. e., <b>the</b> ra-tio between <b>grip</b> force (normal to <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> surface) and load force (tangential to <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> surface). <b>The</b> present study addressed {{the development of these}} mechanisms. Eighty-nine children and 15 adults lifted an instrumented object with exchangeable <b>grip</b> surfaces measuring <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> and load forces. Particularly in trials with high fric-tion (sandpaper), the youngest children used a high grip force to load force ratio.
