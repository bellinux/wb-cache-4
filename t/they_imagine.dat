500|$|Cochrane has himself—writing with Garner and Siobhan O'Sullivan—explored {{the nature}} of the {{political}} turn. Cochrane, Garner and O'Sullivan argue both that the new literature is importantly unified and that it is distinct from more traditional approaches to animal ethics, presenting the focus on justice as the key feature. They write that [...] "the crucial unifing and distinctive feature of these contributions and what can properly be said to mark them out as a 'political turn' {{is the way in which}} <b>they</b> <b>imagine</b> how political institutions, structures and processes might be transformed so as to secure justice for both human and nonhuman animals".|$|E
500|$|April {{begins with}} another social disaster. The Pooters receive an {{invitation}} to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which <b>they</b> <b>imagine</b> will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be [...] shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests—among them Mr Padge—with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.|$|E

2500|$|In the 20th century, both {{tourists}} to the West and avid readers enjoyed the visual {{imagery of the}} frontier.

Critic Keith Phipps says, [...] "its [...] have defined what decades of moviegoers think of when <b>they</b> <b>imagine</b> the American West." [...] The heroic stories {{coming out of the}} building of the transcontinental railroad in the mid-1860s enlivened many dime novels, and illustrated many newspapers and magazines with the juxtaposition of traditional environment with the iron horse of modernity.|$|E

2500|$|French {{children}} are {{told a story}} in which <b>they</b> <b>imagine</b> having a pond with water lily leaves floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and if left unchecked will smother the pond in 30 days, killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day the plant seems small {{and so it is}} decided to leave it to grow until it half-covers the pond, before cutting it back. They are then asked on what day half-coverage will occur. This is revealed to be the 29th day, and then there will be just one day to save the pond. (From Meadows et al. 1972) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} lake {{district is}} the largest geographic region, and it is perhaps what most foreigners think of when <b>they</b> <b>imagine</b> Finland. The district is bounded to the south by the Salpausselkä Ridges. Behind the ridges extend networks of thousands of lakes separated by hilly forested countryside. This landscape continues {{to the east and}} extends into Russia. As a consequence, there is no natural border between the two countries. Because no set definition of what constitutes a lake and no procedures for counting the number of lakes exist, it has been impossible to ascertain exactly how many lakes the region has. There are, however, at least 55,000 lakes that are 200 or more metres wide. The largest is Lake Saimaa, which, with a surface area of more than , is the fifth largest lake in Europe. The deepest lake has a depth of only the depth of the average lake is [...] Because they are shallow, these many lakes contain only slightly more water than Finland's annual rainfall. The hilly, forest-covered landscape of the lake plateau is dominated by drumlins and by long sinuous eskers, both glacial remnants.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{described}} Zionism as [...] "an ethno-nationalist quasi-religious ideology" [...] but {{argued that}} Zionism [...] "...nonetheless has founded {{a sort of}} democratic state which isn't any worse in its practice than many others with equally dubious origins." [...] He stated that settlement {{in order to achieve}} security for Israel is [...] "doomed to fail in the worst possible way", and the cessation of this [...] "appallingly racist and messianic delusion" [...] would [...] "confront the internal clerical and chauvinist forces which want to instate a theocracy for Jews". Hitchens contended that the [...] "solution of withdrawal would not satisfy the jihadists" [...] and wondered [...] "What did <b>they</b> <b>imagine</b> would be the response of the followers of the Prophet ?" [...] Hitchens bemoaned the transference of Arab secularism into religious terrorism as a means of democratisation: [...] "the most depressing and wretched spectacle of the past decade, for all those who care about democracy and secularism, has been the degeneration of Palestinian Arab nationalism into the theocratic and thanatocratic hell of Hamas and Islamic Jihad". He maintained that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a [...] "trivial squabble" [...] that has become [...] "so dangerous to all of us" [...] because of [...] "the faith-based element." ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "false awareness" [...] (falsches Bewusstsein) in the {{classical}} sense used by Friedrich Engels does not necessarily refer to [...] "errors" [...] {{in the content of}} awareness. It refers rather to an absence of awareness of what is really behind the ideas being worked with, how they have originated, or what the real role or effect of the ideas is. The first result of that is, that the ideologists believe themselves to be performing certain intellectual operations with regard to an issue, which, in reality, have quite a different significance than what <b>they</b> <b>imagine.</b> The second result is that their intellectual creations can then function as a mask for what is really at stake, precisely because the issue is portrayed in a one-sided or distorted way – without the ideologists being aware of how that works. The ideologists are aware and unaware at the same time. The problem, says Engels, is that they exaggerate the power of ideas, even to the point where ideas seem to be the cause of all that happens. This occurs especially if the intellectual productions occur at quite some distance from the practical context to which they properly refer, or if they concern specialized, highly abstract ideas which cannot easily be verified (this concept differs from the Marxism–Leninism ideology, where [...] "false consciousness" [...] is thinking which deviates from the political line of the Communist Party).|$|E
