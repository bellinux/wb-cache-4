25|$|As {{early as}} 1910, Foster {{started talking about}} {{reviving}} {{the concept of an}} all-black league. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> was insistent upon was that black teams should be owned by black men. This put him in direct competition with Strong. After 1910, Foster renamed his team the Chicago American Giants to appeal to a larger fan base. During the same year, J. L. Wilkinson started the All Nations traveling team. The All Nations team would eventually become one of the best-known and popular teams of the Negro leagues, the Kansas City Monarchs.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the story, Saya finds Kohta cringing in the hallway as students run about in a panic. They hide in a classroom where Hirano is able to put together a nail gun rifle powered by gas cartridges. Kohta has an unrequited crush on Saya. Kohta provides long-range cover when Takashi rescues Alice Maresato from approaching zombies after Alice's father is killed. At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses saying this is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> was good at and that he wants to protect Saya. The rest of the group, including Saya, support him.|$|E

After retaking command of his Black Quadrant outpost, Thanos discovers {{that he is}} dying. Thanos tries to force Mentor {{to find a cure}} for his malady, but kills him when he is unable to. Around this time, Thanos is {{approached}} by a mysterious hooded woman, who proposes an alliance. He tasks her with bringing him the hammer of the deceased Ultimate Thor. The woman fails, but removes her disguise to reveal herself as Hela, the Norse goddess of death. She tells Thanos that she needs his help to reclaim Hel, and in exchange, offers to give him <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> has been searching for his entire life: death. After this, the two kiss.|$|E

His hot temper has put a wedge between himself and his strict father, gotten him kicked out of one school, and tossed him at a school notoriously horrible for <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he's</b> truly good at, basketball. A chance encounter with the willful Yuuki Kanako {{may serve as a}} catalyst for change, as the indefinable connection she feels with him draws them together...|$|R
500|$|Recent {{scientific}} {{advances have}} not significantly changed that assessment. The game of checkers was solved in 2007, {{but it has}} roughly the square root {{of the number of}} positions in chess. Jonathan Schaeffer, the scientist who led the effort, said a breakthrough such as quantum computing would be needed before solving chess could even be attempted, but he does not rule out the possibility, saying that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> learned from his 16-year effort of solving checkers [...] "is to never underestimate the advances in technology".|$|E
500|$|Drake {{ended his}} studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered [...] "writing him long letters, {{pointing}} out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least {{you have something to}} fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> did not want." [...] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.|$|E
500|$|Finally, {{the film}} {{illustrates}} the growing urban–rural divide in China. When Wei reaches Zhangjiakou, the film creates a clear contrast between {{urban and rural}} life, and the two locations are physically separated by a dark tunnel. The city is not portrayed as idyllic; rather, Zhang shows that rural people are faced with difficulties and discrimination in the cities. While Wei's first {{view of the city}} exposes her to well-dressed people and modern buildings, the living quarters she goes to while searching for Zhang Huike are cramped and squalid. Likewise, the iron gate where Wei waits all day for the TV station director reflects the barriers poor people face to survival in the city, and the necessity of connections to avoid becoming an [...] "outsider" [...] in the city. Frequent cuts show Wei and Zhang wandering aimlessly in the streets, Zhang begging for food, and Wei sleeping on the sidewalk; when an enthusiastic TV host later asks Zhang what part of the city left the biggest impression, Zhang replies that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> will never forget is having to beg for food. A.O. Scott of The New York Times compared the [...] "unbearable" [...] despair of the film's second half to that of Vittorio De Sica's 1948 Bicycle Thieves.|$|E

500|$|The next morning, Dorothy happens upon a Scarecrow (Michael Jackson) made {{of garbage}} and rags, and saves {{him from being}} viciously teased and picked on {{by a group of}} {{humanoid}} crows and whom she befriends. The two of them discover the yellow brick road and happily begin to follow it together. The Scarecrow hopes the Wizard might be able to give him <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> feels that he lacks – a brain. Along the way to the Emerald City, Dorothy, Toto, and the Scarecrow meet the Tin Man (Nipsey Russell), in an abandoned early 20th-century amusement park and the Cowardly Lion (Ted Ross), a vain dandy banished from the jungle who hid inside one of the stone lions in front of the New York Public Library. The Tin Man and Lion join them on their quest to find the Wizard, hoping to gain a heart and courage, respectively. Before the five adventurers reach the Emerald City, they must face obstacles such as a deadly subway where they meet a crazy subway peddler (a homeless man) who unleashes evil puppets in his control. They narrowly escape the subway and then encounter the [...] "Poppy" [...] Girls (a reference to the poppy field from the original story), flamboyant prostitutes who attempt to put Dorothy, Toto, and the Lion into an eternal sleep with magic poppy perfume.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Call My Name" [...] was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler in Los Angeles, California. A 15-second teaser was unveiled on 25 April 2012, followed by an extended version five days later. The music video officially premiered on 2 May 2012. It starts with a quote from French writer and philosopher the Marquis de Sade that reads, [...] "The only way to a woman's heart is along the path of torment." [...] This is followed by scenes of Cheryl strutting down a graffiti-daubed storm drain before meeting with her dancers and performing an elaborate dance routine in the Los Angeles River while wearing a neon yellow bra. This scene is {{a reference to the}} drag race scene in the 1970s musical film Grease. The camera cuts intermittently to footage filmed on the London Eye before the California shoot, which shows Cheryl posing through the reflection on the capsule window. Scenes of the singer driving a car over and posing on a Los Angeles bridge are intercalated later in the video. It received mixed reviews from critics. Jo Usmau of the Daily Mirror said that the video [...] "doesn't disappoint", and, regarding the dance sequences, stated that [...] "she can really really dance", adding: [...] "Check. Out. Her. Stomach. no wonder she's number two on FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World list which was released today." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator commented that the song itself is better than the video, and added <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> learned from it: [...] "when you don’t have a huge budget, spend what you can on clothing, makeup and wigs, and make the most out of the artist’s ample curves." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{thought it was a}} [...] "confident finale" [...] to the fifth season, which [...] "had seen the series become progressively more surreal and self-aware." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that he thought the episode ended the season with a [...] "high note", and that Homer’s insensitive gossiping about his relationship [...] "presents lots of good bits. It completes this excellent year well." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was [...] "This is a place of learning, not a house of hearing about things!", which Homer tells his class after they demand him to reveal more secrets about him and Marge. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A−, and commented that episodes focusing on the relationship between Homer and Marge can [...] "never fail", and there are [...] "numerous opportunities for some classic Homer-isms" [...] in the episode. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. One-time Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] his fifth favorite episode of the show, and commented that Homer's line to Marge, [...] "I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence," [...] is [...] "so sweet, because he's right!" [...] It was placed at number seven on MSNBCs top ten The Simpsons episodes list. They felt the episode embodied Homer's qualities of being [...] "stupid, good-natured and mildly pathetic, [...] from his conversations with his brain [...] to his final proclamation that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> can give Marge that no one else can is 'complete and utter dependence'." ...|$|E

500|$|Marge is {{generally}} a stereotypical sitcom mother, {{and she also}} plays the [...] "long-suffering wife" [...] who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in [...] "Homer Alone" [...] (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown. After spending time at [...] "Rancho Relaxo", during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often. Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she [...] "put {{up with a lot}} in [...] marriage," [...] and has left Homer or thrown {{him out of the house}} on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an adult education class on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> can offer her that nobody else can is [...] "complete and utter dependence." [...] At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he [...] "really [...] make a gal feel needed." [...] Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show. Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] (season one, 1990), where she resists the charming Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.|$|E

Although Kirk initially refuses the offer, he agrees after realizing the Nexus cannot give him <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> has always sought: the ability to make a difference.

[...] According to Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell, <b>one</b> of <b>the</b> main factors in the competition for the final two roster spots in the bullpen was [...] "being able to match up left on left". [...] Red Sox manager Terry Francona said: [...] "I haven't even seen Schoeneweis yet, but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he's</b> {{been able to do}} is get left-handers out."

50|$|Outlaw Skuzz (Alan Oppenheimer): Tex's cigar-smoking henchman. A {{cousin of}} Deputy Fuzz; {{apparently}} the only Prairie Person to practice crime.

[...] For Entertainment Weekly his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, [...] "redefined pop's cutting edge"; for Vibe it [...] "pushed boundaries more forcefully" [...] than works by his male contemporaries. Fuse TV's editor Jason Lipshutz stated it [...] "changed the game. [...] was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy.

5000|$|The Philadelphia Phillies signed Hernández for the 2014 {{season for}} $4.5 million. After five starts, {{during which he}} {{compiled}} a 5.81 ERA, he was available to pitch out of the bullpen, as off days meant the Phillies would not need him for over a week. Around that time, Phillies analyst Ricky Bottalico commented, [...] "All in all, I like what I've seen from Roberto Hernandez early in the ball games, but it's seems to be fourth, fifth, sixth innings, you're seeing a laboring guy out there. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he's</b> {{got to do is}} relax himself. It seems like he's trying to be a little too fine with his pitches. When you do that as a pitcher and you're not relaxed, you're going to make mistakes ... <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> can do is take a deep breath. Getting deeper into games is getting tougher and tougher for him." [...] Subsequently, he rebounded, and had totaled 23 appearances (20 starts) with the Phillies, during which he posted an ERA of 3.87.|$|R
