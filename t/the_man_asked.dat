5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E

They also went to the earthquake, which said that it was {{necessary}} for them to marry, so that the world might be peopled.|$|E

Early in 1930, Childs was approached by {{an agent of the}} Soviet secret police, the OGPU, who had noted in Childs' file that he had helped to successfully identify a police spy in the Communist organization of Chicago. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> Childs to become an informer for the agency to help keep tabs on the ideological foibles of his Lenin School comrades. Childs agreed with the request and thereafter provided periodic reports. During his second year at the Lenin School, Childs made the personal acquaintance of a number of high-level Soviet officials who taught courses at the school, including exiled Finnish revolutionary leader Otto Kuusinen and a young ideology expert named Mikhail Suslov.|$|E

In an effort to maintain authenticity in depicting teenage experiences, Lynch spoke to high school counselors and asked drama students at a Los Angeles high school for feedback.

500|$|Detectives {{from the}} King County Sheriff's Office and the Seattle Police Department grew {{increasingly}} concerned. There {{was no significant}} physical evidence, and the missing women had little in common, apart from being young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle. On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in Burien, Washington, near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. She was last seen {{in the parking lot}} talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling. In the early hours of June 11, UW student Georgann [...] Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend's dormitory residence and her sorority house. The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a criminalist combed the entire alleyway on their hands and knees, finding nothing. After Hawkins's disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man that night in an alley behind a nearby dormitory, on crutches with a leg cast, struggling to carry a briefcase. One woman recalled that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{initiative}} was usually the husband's, the wife {{had to agree}} to the sale. An 1824 report from Manchester says that [...] "after several biddings she [...] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and a quart of ale". Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner. In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife in bed with a stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from total strangers. In March 1766, a carpenter from Southwark sold his wife [...] "in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse". Once sober, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce. In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in Plymouth.|$|E

As the presents went before him, Jacob took his wives, handmaids, children, and belongings over the Jabbok River, and then remained behind that night alone. Jacob wrestled with a [...] "man" [...] until dawn, and when the [...] "man" [...] saw that he was not prevailing, he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh and strained it. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> Jacob to let him go, for the day was breaking, but Jacob would not let him go without a blessing. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> Jacob his name, and when Jacob replied [...] "Jacob," [...] the man told him that his name would no more be Jacob, but Israel, for he had striven with God and with men and prevailed.

2500|$|A further $156million was endowed to a gas-station owner, Melvin Dummar, {{who told}} reporters that in 1967, he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along U.S. Route 95, just [...] north of Las Vegas. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> for a ride to Vegas. Dropping him off at the Sands Hotel, Dummar said the man {{told him that he}} was Hughes. Dummar later claimed that days after Hughes' death a [...] "mysterious man" [...] {{appeared}} at his gas station, leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk. Unsure if the will was genuine and unsure of what to do, Dummar left the will at the LDS Church office. In 1978, a Nevada court ruled the Mormon Will a forgery, and officially declared that Hughes had died intestate (without a valid will). In 1980, Jonathan Demme's film Melvin and Howard, was based on Dummar's story.|$|E

[...] The assailant {{told her she was}} lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she did not and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), when Moses grew up, {{he went to}} his brethren and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian {{striking}} a Hebrew, he looked this way and that, and when he saw no one, he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. When he went out the next day, he came upon two Hebrew men fighting, and he asked the wrongdoer why he struck his fellow. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> Moses who had made him king, asking him whether he intended to kill him as he did the Egyptian, so Moses realized that his deed was known. When Pharaoh heard, he sought to kill Moses, but Moses fled to Midian, where he sat down by a well. The priest of Midian's seven daughters had come to water their father's flock, but shepherds drove them away. Moses stood up and helped the daughters, and watered their flock. When they came home to their father Reuel, he asked how they were able to come home so early, and they explained how an Egyptian had delivered them from the shepherds, and had also drawn water for the flock. Reuel then asked his daughters why they had left the man there, and told them to call him back to join them for a meal. Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah to marry. Moses and Zipporah had a baby boy, whom Moses called Gershom, saying that he had been a stranger in a strange land. The third open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the long}} fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joseph told his {{brothers}} {{that he would}} allow them to prove themselves by letting one of them be bound in prison while the others carried grain to their houses and brought their youngest brother to Egypt. They said to one another that surely they were guilty concerning their brother, and so now this distress had come upon them. Reuben said that he had told them not to sin against their brother, but they had not listened. They did not realize that Joseph understood them, for he used an interpreter, and Joseph turned aside and wept. When Joseph returned, he bound Simeon before their eyes, and commanded that their vessels be filled with grain and that their money be restored to their sacks. They loaded their donkeys and departed. When they came to a lodging-place, one of them opened his sack and found his money, and their spirits fell, wondering what God had done to them. They went home and told Jacob all that had happened, and Jacob accused them of bereaving him of his children, first Joseph and now Simeon, and told them that they would not take Benjamin away. Reuben answered that Jacob could kill Reuben's two sons if Reuben failed to bring Benjamin back, but Jacob insisted that his son would not go down with them, for Joseph was dead and only he was left, and if harm befall Benjamin then it would be the death of Jacob. The famine continued, and Jacob told the brothers to buy more grain. But Judah reminded Jacob that the man had warned them that they could not see his face unless their brother came with them, so if Jacob sent their brother they could buy food, but if Jacob did not send him they could not go. Jacob asked them why they had treated him so ill as to tell the man that they had a brother. They explained that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>asked</b> them directly about their kindred, whether their father was alive, and whether they had another brother, and they answered him; how were they to know that he would ask them to bring their brother down? Judah then asked Jacob to send the lad with him, so that they could go and the family could live, and Judah would serve as surety for him, for they could have been to Egypt and back by then if they had not lingered. Relenting, Jacob directed them to take a present for the man, double money in case the return of their payment was an oversight, and also their brother, and Jacob prayed that God might show them mercy before the man and that he might release Simeon and Benjamin to them. So the brothers went to Joseph. The long fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
