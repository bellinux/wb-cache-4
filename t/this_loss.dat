40|$|International audienceThe impulse {{response}} of a lossless resonant system, usually obtained using the finite-difference time-domain method, permits us {{to determine the}} resonant frequencies through the Fourier transform. However, the obtained spectrum has no physical meaning since the losses have not been implemented. Rather than modeling physically the losses, we propose to apply a specific time-domain window to the already simulated signal of the lossless system. <b>This</b> <b>Losses</b> window depends on a user-defined quality factor. The advantage of <b>this</b> postsimulation <b>losses</b> implementation is a capability of parametric study of composite losses.

5|$|According to Herodotus, after <b>this</b> <b>loss</b> Xerxes {{attempted}} {{to build a}} causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes to retreat to Asia with {{the bulk of the}} army. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly. The Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to <b>this</b> <b>loss,</b> {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E

Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract <b>this</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
