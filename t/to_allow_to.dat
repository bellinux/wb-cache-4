John Noonan proposes the scenario of a family who {{was found to be}} liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick. It is argued that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect him from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation of a fetus.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Sam Amirante, one of Gacy's two defense {{attorneys}} at his 1980 trial, authored procedures that were incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly into the Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984. Amirante has since {{stated that the}} primary inspiration for this legislation {{was the fact that}} at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> elapse before initiating a search for a missing child. The Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency—commonly known today as an Amber Alert.|$|E

2500|$|The {{steel balls}} were {{intended}} to prevent a nuclear detonation even if the explosives fired accidentally, or in any conceivable accident. The ball bearings {{had to be removed}} {{through the hole in the}} bomb casing during flight preparation, and after the bomb was winched into the aircraft. The ball bearings then had to be re-inserted into the lowered and upturned bomb before transport back to the bomb store. Quite obviously, without the ball bearings installed, these weapons were armed and live, and too dangerous <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> be flown on exercises. Bomber Command exercises demonstrated that flight preparation followed by a scramble take-off could not be reduced below thirty minutes, and on exercises in bad weather and at night a ninety-minute scramble was the norm. At least one accident, dated 1960, was reported in the press when the plastic bung was removed and 133,000 steel ball bearings exited onto the aircraft hangar floor, leaving the bomb armed and vulnerable. The Royal Air Force were so nervous of the outcome of a fire in storage that permission was sought to store the bombs inverted, so that a loss of the plastic bung could not end with the steel balls on the floor, leaving the HEU unprotected against a subsequent explosion. Even without the partial nuclear detonation feared by the RAF, there was [...] "a risk of catastrophe" ...|$|E
