500|$|O'Neill Surber {{explored}} {{the lyrics of}} Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to [...] "Comfortably Numb": [...] "I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot {{put my finger on}} it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." [...] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, [...] "Jugband Blues": [...] "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July 1987, a {{day after}} Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named Vijitha Rohana hit him on his {{shoulder}} with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> some movement. I ducked {{down a little bit}} in a reflex action. By my ducking, he missed my head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you see, madam mother, I am at practice," [...] I answered, {{and out of}} <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> I {{caught the}} grim {{approving}} twitch of old Falcone's lips.|$|E

60|$|Now I, Hubert, {{watching}} Quilla out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes, saw {{her turn}} pale and tremble.|$|R
60|$|I peeped round <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fan at Miss Melbury. She {{was looking}} at us. I shook hands with Mr. Sax.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} Cynthia came in. Out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> I {{observed}} {{a look of}} fuddled displeasure come into Tanky's face at her frank pleasure at seeing me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So, {{when the}} morning came, I {{went down to}} the beach, casting out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> at the house of the mother of Unga. My offer yet stood untouched.|$|E
60|$|As I lighted a cigar I saw, out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> how Hoden gave a quick start. I {{expected}} {{some kind}} of a startling idea to flash into his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Number 481 is no better, doctor," [...] {{said the}} head-warder, in a {{slightly}} reproachful accent, looking in round <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> door.|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced at}} <b>my</b> {{opponent}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes. <b>The</b> man was suffering. Beads of perspiration stood {{out on his}} forehead.|$|R
50|$|Tillison and Manning then {{formed a}} new band, Parallel or 90 Degrees, with Sam Baine also on keyboards. With Manning {{temporarily}} unavailable, Tillison and Baine recorded <b>The</b> <b>Corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Room, subsequently released as the band's second album.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{told me to}} {{wait until}} I was alone with you," [...] I said, {{dropping}} my voice significantly, and watching him intently out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe, creating an atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|I watched Phaidor from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> She paled to {{a ghastly}} hue. Slowly, very slowly she turned, as though drawn by some {{invisible}} yet irresistible force. She was standing {{quite close to}} me, so close that her bare arm touched mine as she finally faced Issus, Goddess of Life Eternal.|$|E
6000|$|I took {{a little}} look at him out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> and wished that as a child I had paid more heed to my {{arithmetic}} lessons. [...] "Look, Mrs Monnerie," [...] I cried piteously, [...] "poor Cherry's tongue is dangling right out of his head. He looks so hot and tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|And just then, peeping round <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{chair to}} see if there were any signs of cake, what should I see but a great beastly brute of a rat. It was {{standing}} right beside the visitor, drinking milk out of a saucer, if you please! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{opened the}} box, and tilted out the {{contents}} upon <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> desk. My hair rose and my flesh grew cold as I looked. There were twelve magnificent square stones engraved with mystical characters. There {{could be no}} doubt that they were the jewels of the urim and thummim.|$|R
6000|$|Denis nodded. Mr. Barbecue-Smith put {{his hand}} {{in his pocket and}} pulled out a notebook. [...] "I did a few in the train to-day," [...] he said, turning over the pages. [...] "Just dropped off into a trance in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> carriage. I find the train very conducive to good work. Here they are." [...] He cleared his throat and read: ...|$|R
60|$|You {{may think}} how proud I was {{to walk down}} the village street with my {{magnificent}} relative, and to note out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> how the folk came to the doors and windows to see us pass. Champion Harrison was standing outside the smithy, and he pulled his cap off when he saw my uncle.|$|E
60|$|I babbled on, till from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> I saw {{the flush}} fade from the professor's {{face and his}} back {{gradually}} relax its poker-like attitude. The situation was saved for the moment {{but there was no}} knowing what further excesses Ukridge might indulge in. I managed to draw him aside as we went through the fowl-run, and expostulated.|$|E
60|$|I bowed my best bow as the Chevalier {{presented}} me, {{and from}} <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> with inward malice, I watched them as I did so. Genevi√®ve curtsied with a puzzled air and a sidelong {{glance at her}} sister. Yvonne accorded me the faintest, the coldest, inclination of her head, whilst her cheeks assumed a colour that was unwonted.|$|E
60|$|I went to <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hut, Noma {{watching}} {{me all the}} while, and took a kerrie and my small shield. Then I started through the moonlight. Till I was past the kraal I glided along quietly as a shadow. After that, I began to run, singing to myself as I went, to frighten away the ghosts, my father.|$|R
60|$|We tried {{a shorter}} kite-line and a shorter length <b>of</b> <b>my</b> line, and we ran down upon that mess of tuna once more. It was strange--and foolish--how we stuck to that school of biggest fish. This time Dan headed {{right into the}} thick of them. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes I seemed to see tuna {{settling}} down all around. Suddenly my brother yelled.|$|R
5000|$|In her letters, Segale {{referred}} to Billy the Kid: [...] "His eyes were blue-gray, rosy complexion, {{and the air}} of a little boy: not the data would be more than seventeen years. He was an innocent, if not for the iron firmness of purpose, good or bad, that we read in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eye...could choose <b>the</b> right path and instead chose the wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Guardian, {{whom she}} called [...] "Shaman" [...] or Magician, held a lamp in his hand, and by its light {{it was easy}} to see his face, which I watched out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I thought that it wore a very strange expression, one {{moreover}} that alarmed me somewhat. From the beginning I had misdoubted me of this old man, whose cast of countenance was vindictive as it was able; now I was afraid of him.|$|E
60|$|The little beaded front-sight wavered {{slightly}} as I held my rifle leveled at the grim, snarling face, {{and out of}} <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> as it were, I saw Jones dash in under the lion and grasp Moze by the hind leg and haul him down. He broke from Jones and leaped again to the first low branch. His master then grasped his collar and carried him to where we stood and held him choking.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} I caught another glimpse from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> {{of the single}} pair of eyes at my back making a sudden rush upon me. I turned to meet the charge; there was a quick rush of the three from the other direction; but I {{determined}} to pursue the single pair until I {{should have at least}} settled my account with one of the beasts and thus be relieved of the strain of meeting attacks from both directions.|$|E
5000|$|Tillison and guitarist/vocalist Guy Manning had {{an early}} {{unsigned}} band called Gold Frankincense & Disk Drive. The band's final line-up also included Hugh Banton on organ and Dave Albone on drums. One piece by this line-up, [...] "A Gap in the Night", was later included on Parallel or 90 Degrees' <b>The</b> <b>Corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Room, {{followed by the}} archival release No More Travelling Chess.|$|R
60|$|Upon one occasion, even, when woollen rags were scarce, and no burned-brick {{was to be}} {{had from}} the ship's Yeoman, I sacrificed <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> woollen shirt, and used some dentrifice I had, as {{substitutes}} for the rags and burned-brick. The dentrifice operated delightfully, and made the threading <b>of</b> <b>my</b> carronade screw shine and grin again, like a set of false teeth in an eager heiress-hunter's mouth.|$|R
60|$|Beyond the {{realization}} that I was in <b>the</b> tightest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life, I seemed to have lost the power of thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, sir, {{he is such}} {{a mysterious}} little sacket," [...] replied Cathro, testily, [...] "and so clever at leading you into a hole, that it's not chancey to meddle with him, and I could see through <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> that, for all this woeful face, he was proud of it, and hoped I was taking note. For though {{sometimes}} his emotion masters him completely, at other times he can step aside as it were, and take an approving look at it. That is a characteristic of him, and not the least maddening one." ...|$|E
60|$|The Zulus grew excited, and {{the odds}} went down a little. The Boers {{stretched}} out their white faces {{and stared at}} me; I saw them out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> as I loaded again. Another vulture came; seeing one of its companions on the ground, if in a somewhat unnatural attitude, perhaps it thought {{that there could be}} nothing to fear. I leaned against my rock, aimed, and fired, almost carelessly, so sure was I of the result. This time I did not shut my eyes, but watched to see what happened.|$|E
60|$|As I did so, out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> I {{caught sight}} of {{something}} that glittered far away, so far that it would only have attracted the notice of a trained hunter. Yes, something was shining on the brow {{of the rise of}} which I have spoken. I stared at it through my glasses and saw what I had feared to see. A body of natives was crossing the rise and the glitter was caused by the rays of dawn striking on their spears and gun-barrels.|$|E
5000|$|Plant, O God, through Thy awesomeness, {{the springs}} of humility in the {{watering}} place <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart! Cause to flow, O God, because of Thy awesomeness, tears <b>of</b> moaning from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> eyes! And chastise, O God, the recklessness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> clumsiness with the reins <b>of</b> contentment! <b>My</b> God, if mercy from Thee {{does not begin}} with fair success for me, then who can take me to Thee upon the evident path? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Desperate man, {{there is}} no need; you will find it to <b>the</b> north-west <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> upper {{secretary}} drawer. I spromise not to appear." ...|$|R
5000|$|Manning {{and local}} keyboardist/vocalist Andy Tillison had an early {{unsigned}} band called Gold Frankincense & Disk Drive. This band's final line-up included David Albone on drums and a guest spot from Van der Graaf Generator organ player Hugh Banton. One piece by this line-up, [...] "A Gap in the Night", was later included on Parallel or 90 Degrees' <b>The</b> <b>Corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Room before being reworked {{for the second}} album by The Tangent.|$|R
