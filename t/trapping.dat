5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. The best pelts are from winter <b>trapping</b> with {{secondary}} quality pelts from spring <b>trapping.</b> The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season <b>trapping</b> when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Wijdefjorden {{was first used}} by Russian, and later Norwegian, trappers. The cabin at Krosspynten was erected in 1910, {{and two years later}} the cabin at Purpurdalen was built. Trappers {{considered}} the area to have few polar bears but much fox; they could also supplement the catch with common eider. In 1928, a season of <b>trapping</b> gave about 50 Arctic foxes. In 1932, the area's special vegetation was protected, which was assimilated into the national park when it was created. Since the 1980s, <b>trapping</b> has again been taken up, and the Governor of Svalbard has one cabin at Austfjordnes that can be rented for a season of <b>trapping.</b> Of the larger fjords on Svalbard, Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Trapping</b> resumed in the U.S. after 1962 once numbers had {{recovered}} sufficiently. During the early 1970s, {{the value of}} fisher pelts soared, leading to another population crash in 1976. After {{a couple of years}} of closed seasons, fisher <b>trapping</b> re-opened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits. The population has steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite a much lower pelt value.|$|E

5|$|Beach Thomas {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} the toothed steel trap for {{catching}} rabbits, supporting the RSPCA in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it both inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes <b>trapping</b> other animals such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, silicon does {{react with}} vacancies, {{creating}} the described above optical absorption at 738nm. The assumed mechanism is <b>trapping</b> of migrating vacancy by substitutional silicon {{resulting in the}} Si-V (semi-divacancy) configuration.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The <b>trapping</b> rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by <b>trapping</b> a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon <b>trapping</b> a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E

50|$|In an ion <b>trap</b> instrument, ions are <b>trapped</b> in a {{quadrupole}} ion <b>trap</b> {{and then}} {{injected into the}} TOF. The <b>trap</b> can be 3-D or a linear <b>trap.</b>|$|R
5|$|Most serpins are {{protease}} inhibitors, targeting extracellular, chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. These proteases {{possess a}} nucleophilic serine residue in a catalytic triad in their active site. Examples include thrombin, trypsin, and human neutrophil elastase. Serpins act as irreversible, suicide inhibitors by <b>trapping</b> an intermediate of the protease's catalytic mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation <b>trapping</b> {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation <b>trapping</b> generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E

50|$|Unlike <b>trap</b> crops, most <b>traps</b> used {{to control}} pests are man made, and used by rat catchers. A variety of mouse <b>traps</b> and rat <b>traps</b> are {{available}} for mice and rats, including snap <b>traps,</b> glue <b>traps</b> and live catch <b>traps.</b> Sticky <b>traps,</b> which often include pheromones to attract the pest, are also a common way of controlling many moth pests, such as Indian mealmoths.|$|R
50|$|Turtles can {{be caught}} {{by using a}} variety of techniques; hoop <b>traps,</b> basking <b>traps,</b> {{floating}} pitfall <b>traps,</b> and funnel <b>traps</b> are among the best <b>traps</b> to use. Basking <b>traps</b> are used to catch basking turtles. These <b>traps</b> float on the surface and have an elevated platform for the turtle to bask. The net is underwater so they cannot escape once they fall into the <b>trap.</b>|$|R

5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be {{controlled}} by <b>trapping</b> are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before <b>trapping</b> them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{trials in}} Cairns, Australia, to examine if novel updraft light <b>traps</b> collected significantly more mosquitoes than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) model 512 miniature light <b>trap.</b> Two new updraft <b>traps,</b> the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) Mozzie <b>Trap</b> and a CDC updraft <b>trap,</b> both collected significantly more mosquitoes {{than the standard}} CDC light <b>trap,</b> with a mean CDC <b>Trap</b> Index (<b>trap</b> collections relative to paired standard CDC light <b>trap</b> collections) of 3. 3 and 2. 3, respectively. These <b>traps</b> both had large horizontal suction areas that increased the probability that attracted mosquitoes entered the <b>trap</b> updraft. However, if the CO 2 source was located within the updraft of the CDC updraft <b>trap,</b> mosquito collections decreased considerably, indicating that placement of the bait is critical to <b>trap</b> performance. Creating an updraft by simply inverting the CDC <b>trap</b> body did not increase collections. The Mosquito Magnet X <b>trap</b> also did not collect significantly more mosquitoes than the CDC <b>trap.</b> Two CDC light <b>traps</b> sharing a 600 ml CO 2 /min gas line collected ca. 50 % more mosquitoes than a single CDC <b>trap</b> baited with 600 ml CO 2 /min, suggesting that a single gas source could be used on a <b>trap</b> line consisting of multiple <b>trap</b> units. These {{studies suggest that the}} optimal <b>trap</b> design should incorporate a CO 2 release system that lures mosquitoes to a large updraft within a bowl-shaped <b>trap</b> intake...|$|R
50|$|A {{pheromone}} <b>trap</b> {{is a type}} {{of insect}} <b>trap</b> that uses pheromones to lure insects. Sex pheromones and aggregating pheromones are the most common types used.

Results showed that <b>traps</b> designs and <b>traps</b> colours significantly influence the number of alate aphids collected. The water-pan <b>trap</b> collected significantly (P< 0. 05) more aphids than those of other <b>traps.</b> <b>Traps</b> coloured with yellow were also found to collect significantly (P< 0. 05) more aphids than <b>traps</b> coloured with other colours.

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} five {{different}} types of <b>traps</b> currently used in biodiversity studies to collect flying insects. Our aim is to evaluate the potentials {{and the limits of}} these <b>traps</b> in the assessment of insect biodiversity. Hence, we compared the diversity of insects caught by a malaise <b>trap,</b> a yellow pan <b>trap,</b> a blue pan <b>trap,</b> a suction <b>trap</b> and a light <b>trap</b> in six different lo- cations in Brussels. We showed that these <b>traps</b> caught nearly only insects: more than 98. 3 % of all collected organisms were insects. Only the blue pan <b>trap</b> caught, in higher proportions, other arthropods such as isopods or spiders. The Malaise <b>trap</b> was generally the most effective <b>trap</b> capturing the majority of Homoptera, Heteroptera, Psocoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera and Hy- menoptera. The yellow pan <b>trap</b> was often the second most effective <b>trap</b> particularly for Hy- menoptera, Diptera and Homoptera. Without surprise, the light <b>trap</b> caught nearly all Lepidoptera (Heterocera). Some combinations of two different <b>traps</b> were very effective. However, none of these combinations were the most effective for all families of insects. Moreover, the combination of the two most effective <b>traps</b> (Malaise and yellow pan <b>traps)</b> was not the best combination. We discuss about the effectiveness of <b>traps</b> and the usefulness of their association. Finally, we raise the particular case of urban environment which needs the use of discreet <b>traps.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
