There are also several free weekly publications, including news magazines CityNews and Canberra Weekly as well as entertainment guide BMA Magazine. BMA Magazine first went <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> 1992; the inaugural edition featured coverage of the Nirvana Nevermind tour.|$|E
5|$|His {{break from}} writing lasted for five years, {{following}} the death of his wife, but after battling his illness he returned <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> 2000 with a new novel, Day of Absolution.

5|$|In 1929, the News-Miner was {{purchased}} by Alaska industrialist Austin E. Lathrop, who operated it under a series of editors until 1950. In that year, the paper {{was purchased}} by Charles Willis Snedden, who proceeded on a course of modernization. Under Snedden's leadership, the News-Miner {{became one of the}} first papers in Alaska <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> color and survived a fire and the biggest flood in Fairbanks history.|$|E

50|$|He turned <b>to</b> <b>printing</b> <b>in</b> 1524 and {{designed}} his own italic typefaces for his work, which were widely emulated. His last printing was dated {{shortly before the}} sack of Rome (1527), during which he was probably killed.|$|R
5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E

25|$|The printed {{space between}} a line tip and a {{perpendicular}} line it faces is 25-35 nm for 22 nm half-pitch lines (with a 20 nm nominally drawn gap). For a 22 nm line-space pattern with 22 nm nominal gap, conventional illumination yields a 38 nm tip-to-line distance, while quasar illumination yields a 28 nm distance.

25|$|Written Marathi first {{appeared}} during the 11th century {{in the form of}} inscriptions on stones and copper plates. The Marathi version of Devanagari, called Balbodh, is similar to the Hindi Devanagari alphabet. From the 13th century until the mid-20th century, Marathi was written in the Modi script. Since 1950 it has been written in the Balbodh style of Devanagari. Except for Father Stephen's Christ Puran in the Latin script in the 1600s, Marathi has mainly been printed in Devanagari because William Carey, the pioneer of printing in Indian languages, was only able <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> Devanagari. He later tried printing in Modi but by that time, Balbodh Devanagari had been accepted for printing.|$|E
25|$|Aloys Senefelder, the {{inventor}} of lithography, introduced the subject of colored lithography in his 1818 Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography), where he told of his plans to print using color and explained the colors he wished {{to be able to}} print someday. Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as France and England, were also trying to find a new way <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> color. Godefroy Engelmann of Mulhouse in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837, but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of playing cards.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the volume}} {{had begun in}} 1930, resumed in September 1942 and was {{completed}} in draft in July 1943. Ready <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> May 1944, the order came on 31 July for a limited edition by HMSO, because the small print run {{made it impossible for}} Macmillan to realise a profit. Edmonds later tried to have the small issue made public but in November 1947, HMSO was ordered to destroy the type of the book. (The volume remained unseen, until the Fifty-year Rule was amended to the Thirty-year rule in 1967, that allowed the public to view the surviving copies.) The failings of the volume raised questions as to the suitability of Edmonds continuing as Director of the Historical Section {{for the rest of the}} series but given that it was beyond his normal area of expertise, he was allowed to carry on and produced a short account of the Occupation of Constantinople, saw the remaining volumes on the Western Front through to publication and retired in July 1949, just before the publication of the final volume Military Operations: Italy, 1915–1919 (1949), ended thirty years' work. Edmonds was somewhat chagrined when the War Office ordered 800 copies of Assize of Arms (1946) by Brigadier-General J. H. Morgan (20 March 1876 – 8 April 1955), that he called far more outspoken on the occupation.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of copyright in Russia {{followed the same}} lines as in Western Europe, only about a century later. The first printing press was installed in Moscow in the late 1550s {{with the support of}} Tsar Ivan IV; the first dated book was printed there in 1564. Printing was strictly controlled by the Tsars and remained reserved mostly for religious works. Tsar Peter the Great was the first to grant printing privileges for printing secular works in Russian to a few select printers, both from Russia and from abroad. Under Peter's reign, the print production in Russia rose tremendously, but except for the printers of the Orthodox Church, most print shops remained state owned. The first printing privilege granted to a private (and non-Russian) printer for the printing of literature in foreign languages was granted by Catherine II of Russia in 1771 to a printer in St. Petersburg. At the same time, a decree also installed censorship measures for the control of foreign-language works. The first private press with the right <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> Russian was founded in 1776, and in 1783, Russian printed works were also subjected to censorship. The events of the French revolution led Catherine to have most private print shops closed down again; and her successor Paul I prohibited in 1808 the importation of foreign books again.|$|E
500|$|In his own estimation, the Arizona {{senator is}} {{straightforward}} and direct, but impatient. Other traits include {{a penchant for}} lucky charms, a fondness for hiking, {{and a sense of}} humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons widely deemed not fit <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> newspapers: [...] "Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly?– Because Janet Reno is her father." [...] McCain subsequently apologized profusely, and the Clinton White House accepted his apology. McCain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings, and apologizing for them. He is known for sometimes being prickly and hot-tempered with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff have been more cordial, and have inspired loyalty towards him. [...] He formed a strong bond with two senators, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham, over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel, and they became dubbed the [...] "Three Amigos".|$|E

2500|$|The {{advantage}} The Guardian {{saw in the}} Berliner format was that, {{though it}} is only a little wider than a tabloid, and is equally easy to read on public transport, its greater height gives more flexibility in page design. The new presses mean that printing can go across the strip {{down the middle of the}} centre page, known as the [...] "gutter", allowing the paper to print striking double-page pictures. The new presses also made it the first UK national paper <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> full colour on every page.|$|E

2500|$|The Harvard Monthly ceased {{publication}} with Volume 64, in May 1917, {{with the}} following words within black bordering: [...] "The editors of the monthly regret that existing circumstances compel the suspension of publication during the immediate future." [...] The [...] "circumstances" [...] involved World War I and a campus gearing-up for war, with passionate disagreements erupting among Monthly staff members, as described years later by Malcolm Cowley in an on-line biography of his friend, Monthly editor E.E. Cummings. [...] " [...] took no part {{in the debate over}} preparedness for war, one which shook the country in the winter of 1916-17 and which, as a minor effect, disrupted the board of The Harvard Monthly. Four of the editors were pacifists, the other four were superpatriots, all eight were impractical, and they couldn't agree on what <b>to</b> <b>print.</b> <b>In</b> April 1917, when Congress declared war, The Monthly disappeared from Harvard, but not from memory." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unified English Braille (UEB) is an {{attempted}} unified standard for English Braille, proposed in 1991 to the Braille Authority of North America (BANA). The motivation for UEB {{was that the}} proliferation of specialized braille codes—which sometimes assigned conflicting values to even basic letters and numbers—was threatening not just braille-literacy, but also the viability of English braille itself. Also, the irregularities of English Braille made automated transcription inaccurate, and therefore increased the cost and time required <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>in</b> braille. In 1993, the UEB project {{was adopted by the}} International Council on English Braille, and expanded to cover the various national systems of the member states: [...] Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. An additional goal became adoption of a single standard for all braille encoding, apart from music; with the exception of math-notation, this was largely achieved. [...] New Zealand officially retains Maori Braille as compatible with UEB, and BANA officially retains Nemeth Code as a math-notation option alongside UEB for the United States.|$|E
