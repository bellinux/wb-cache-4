2500|$|Two common photothyristors {{include the}} light-activated SCR (LASCR) and the light-activated <b>TRIAC.</b> A LASCR {{acts as a}} switch that turns on when exposed to light. Following light exposure, when light is absent, if the power is not removed and the {{polarities}} of the cathode and anode have not yet reversed, the LASCR {{is still in the}} [...] "on" [...] state. A light-activated <b>TRIAC</b> resembles a LASCR, except that it is designed for alternating currents.|$|E
50|$|DIACs have no gate electrode, {{unlike some}} other {{thyristors}} {{that they are}} commonly used to trigger, such as <b>TRIACs.</b> Some <b>TRIACs,</b> like Quadrac, contain a built-in DIAC in series with the <b>TRIAC's</b> gate terminal for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|<b>TRIACs</b> are {{a subset}} of {{thyristors}} and are related to silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs). <b>TRIACs</b> differ from SCRs in that they allow current flow in both directions, whereas an SCR can only conduct current in a single direction. Most <b>TRIACs</b> can be triggered by applying either a positive or negative voltage to the gate (an SCR requires a positive voltage). Once triggered, SCRs and <b>TRIACs</b> continue to conduct, even if the gate current ceases, until the main current drops below a certain level called the holding current.|$|R

2500|$|The {{functional}} drawback of a thyristor is that, like a diode, it only conducts in one direction. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, {{called a}} <b>TRIAC,</b> {{is able to}} work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the <b>TRIAC</b> can conduct in both directions, reactive loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the AC power cycle. Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily inductive motor loads usually {{requires the use of}} a [...] "snubber" [...] circuit around the <b>TRIAC</b> to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power. Inverse parallel SCRs can also be used in place of the triac; because each SCR in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it, the SCRs, unlike TRIACs, are sure to turn off. The [...] "price" [...] to be paid for this arrangement, however, is the added complexity of two separate, but essentially identical gating circuits.|$|E
2500|$|Digital {{thermostats}} {{use either}} a relay or a semiconductor device such as <b>triac</b> {{to act as}} a switch to control the HVAC unit. [...] Units with relays will operate millivolt systems, but often make an audible [...] "click" [...] noise when switching on or off.|$|E
5000|$|Discrete devices (diodes, Power MOSFETs, {{thyristors}} and <b>triacs,</b> transistors) ...|$|R
50|$|SCRs are {{unidirectional}} devices (i.e. {{can conduct}} current only in one direction) {{as opposed to}} <b>TRIACs,</b> which are bidirectional (i.e. current can flow through them in either direction). SCRs can be triggered normally only by currents going into the gate as opposed to <b>TRIACs,</b> which can be triggered normally by either a positive or a negative current applied to its gate electrode.|$|R
50|$|Other three-quadrant <b>TRIACs</b> {{can operate}} with smaller gate-current to be {{directly}} driven by logic level components.|$|R
2500|$|In 1966, Eugene Alessio {{patented}} a {{light bulb}} socket adapter for adjusting a light level on a single light bulb using a <b>triac.</b> [...] To house this device, he decided on a 2-inch round device with one end capable of being screwed into {{a light bulb}} socket and the other end able to receive a light bulb.|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{resistance}} of the filament is temperature dependent. The cold {{resistance of}} tungsten-filament lamps is about 1/15 the hot-filament resistance when the lamp is operating. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp has a resistance of 144 ohms when lit, but the cold resistance is much lower (about 9.5 ohms). Since incandescent lamps are resistive loads, simple phase-control <b>TRIAC</b> dimmers {{can be used to}} control brightness. Electrical contacts may carry a [...] "T" [...] rating symbol indicating that they are designed to control circuits with the high inrush current characteristic of tungsten lamps. For a 100-watt, 120-volt general-service lamp, the current stabilizes in about 0.10 seconds, and the lamp reaches 90% of its full brightness after about 0.13 seconds.|$|E

50|$|Because the wax motor is a {{resistive}} load {{rather than an}} inductive load, wax motors controlled by <b>TRIACs</b> do not require snubber circuits.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{established}} {{treatment for}} AHDS. Theoretical considerations suggested <b>TRIAC</b> (triiodothyroacetate or tiratricol, a natural non-classical thyroid hormone) to be beneficial. In 2014, a case was demonstrated in which therapy with <b>TRIAC</b> {{in early childhood}} led to significant improvement of cognition and mobility. Currently, the effect of <b>Triac</b> is under investigation.|$|E
50|$|The {{point where}} the AC line voltage is 0 V is the Zero Cross Point. When a <b>triac</b> is {{connected}} in its simplest form, it can clip {{the beginning of the}} voltage curve, due to the minimum gate voltage of the <b>triac.</b> A zero cross circuit works to correct this problem, so that the <b>triac</b> functions as well as possible. This is typically done with thyristors in two of the three phases.|$|E

50|$|Saturable {{reactors}} at mains (line) frequency are larger, heavier, {{and more}} expensive than electronic power controllers developed after the introduction of semiconductor electronic components, and have largely been replaced by thyristor dimmers using <b>triacs</b> or SCRs.|$|R
50|$|For higher-powered, more-demanding loads, two SCRs in inverse {{parallel}} may be {{used instead}} of one <b>TRIAC.</b> Because each SCR will have an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity voltage applied to it, turn-off of the SCRs is assured, {{no matter what the}} character of the load. However, due to the separate gates, proper triggering of the SCRs is more complex than triggering a <b>TRIAC.</b>|$|E

50|$|Three-quadrant <b>TRIACs</b> only {{operate in}} {{quadrants}} 1 through 3 and cannot be triggered in quadrant 4. These devices are made specifically for improved commutation and can often control reactive loads {{without the use}} of a snubber circuit.|$|R
50|$|Thyratrons {{have been}} {{replaced}} in most low and medium-power applications by corresponding semiconductor devices known as thyristors (sometimes called silicon-controlled rectifiers, or SCRs) and <b>triacs.</b> However, switching service requiring voltages above 20 kV and involving very short risetimes remains within {{the domain of the}} thyratron.|$|R
