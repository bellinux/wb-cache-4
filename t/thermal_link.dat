5000|$|Finally, it is {{necessary}} to tune the thermal coupling between the TES and the bath; a low thermal conductance {{is necessary}} to ensure that incident energy is seen by the TES rather than being lost directly to the bath. However, the <b>thermal</b> <b>link</b> must not be too weak, as {{it is necessary}} to cool the TES back to bath temperature after the energy has been absorbed. Two approaches to control the <b>thermal</b> <b>link</b> are by electron-phonon coupling and by mechanical machining. At cryogenic temperatures, the electron and phonon systems in a material can become only weakly coupled. The electron-phonon thermal conductance is strongly temperature-dependent, and hence the thermal conductance can be tuned by adjusting Tc. Other devices use mechanical means of controlling the thermal conductance such as building the TES on a sub-micron membrane over a hole in the substrate or {{in the middle of a}} sparse [...] "spiderweb" [...] structure.|$|E
50|$|A {{bolometer}} {{consists of}} an absorptive element, such as {{a thin layer of}} metal, connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a <b>thermal</b> <b>link.</b> The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir - the greater the absorbed power, the higher the temperature. The intrinsic thermal time constant, which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal conductance between the absorptive element and the reservoir. The temperature change can be measured directly with an attached resistive thermometer, or the resistance of the absorptive element itself {{can be used as a}} thermometer. Metal bolometers usually work without cooling. They are produced from thin foils or metal films. Today, most bolometers use semiconductor or superconductor absorptive elements rather than metals. These devices can be operated at cryogenic temperatures, enabling significantly greater sensitivity.|$|E
