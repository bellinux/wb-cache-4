40|$|We {{conducted}} a functional analysis of challenging behavior for two students with autism using widely available <b>videoconferencing</b> <b>equipment</b> (laptop computers equipped with web cameras). Observers used the videoconferencing facilities {{to collect data}} on challenging behavior and to instruct the therapist conducting the assessment. Results of the functional analyses suggested that challenging behavior was associated with escape from academic demands and access to attention for both students. An intervention, derived from the results of the functional analyses, was implemented in the classroom for both students. This intervention was compared to typical classroom instruction using a multi-element treatment design. Results indicated that the intervention derived from the functional analysis produced substantial reductions in challenging behavior with concomitant increases in academic engagement over typical classroom instruction for both students.

50|$|Video visitation is a {{term used}} for {{technology}} that allows the inmate and visitor to communicate via analog or digital <b>videoconferencing</b> <b>equipment.</b> Under the old method of face-to-face visitation, inmates were transferred from their housing area to the visitation area, while visitors often had {{to walk through the}} facility. With video visitation, inmates will use a video visitation station located in their cell or cell block, while visitors can use a corresponding station elsewhere—or even use their computers from home. This greatly reduces the amount of manpower needed to conduct visits by reducing the movement of inmates; reducing inmate movement also reduces contraband at the facility.|$|R

40|$|We {{aimed to}} assess the value of {{real-time}} telemedicine using low cost <b>videoconferencing</b> <b>equipment</b> for otorhinolaryngology consultations. A general practitioner, using low cost <b>videoconferencing</b> <b>equipment,</b> presented patients to an otorhinolaryngologist. After history taking and clinical examination, investigations were requested if required and a diagnosis and management plan formulated. The patients were then seen, by the same otorhinolaryngologist, for a conventional face-to-face consultation. Differences in the history, clinical examination and investigation requests were reported. The accuracy of diagnosis and correlation of management plans between the two consultations were analysed. Forty-three patients were admitted to the study but one, a young child, refused examination either by tele-link or the conventional approach {{and had to be}} excluded. There were thus 42 patients with 55 diagnoses included in the trial, 26 (62 %) females and 16 (38 %) males. Age range was 5 months to 70 years. There was no difficulty with any of the patients in obtaining an accurate history and ordering investigations, if required, via the telelink. Clinical examination during the tele-link consultation was inadequate for eight out of the first 20 patients, resulting in a wrong diagnosis in three patients and a missed diagnosis in five patients. All of the next 22 patients had a correct diagnosis and management plan. Comparison of data from the two types of consultation showed that a correct diagnosis and management plan was made in 34 patients. Low cost real-time telemedicine is a useful technique, providing reliable otorhinolaryngology consultations in a general practice setting. However initial difficulties due to inexperience in using the equipment need to be overcome...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Telemedicine {{is the use}} of {{telecommunications}} technology to provide medical information and services. It may be as simple as two health professionals discussing a case over the telephone, or as sophisticated as using satellite technology to broadcast a consultation between providers at facilities in two countries, using <b>videoconferencing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The first is used daily by most health professionals, and the latter is used by the military and some large medical centers. In the past, several telemedicine applications using wired communications were presented. The recent evolutions of wireless communications have enabled telemedicine systems to operate throughout the world, hence expanding telemedicine benefits, applications, and services. In telemedicine, typically scenarios is two doctors are involved with the patient: a local attendin...|$|R
