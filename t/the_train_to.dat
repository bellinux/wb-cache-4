5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{over the}} identity of the doctor who pronounced Beiderbecke dead. The official cause of death, meanwhile, was lobar pneumonia, with scholars continuing to debate the extent to which his alcoholism was also a factor.

5|$|In mid-2005, {{construction}} commenced {{on the new}} South Ferry–Whitehall Street {{station on}} the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which is located underneath an older loop-platformed station {{of the same name}} in South Ferry, Manhattan. It is designed as an ADA-accessible, two-track terminal, which allows all ten cars of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> platform and all doors to be opened, as opposed to only the first five cars in the old station.|$|E

5|$|Odd Horten is an overcautious 67-year-old {{man about}} to retire after forty {{years as a}} train driver on the route between Oslo and Bergen. As he awakes, he goes through a meticulous daily routine, as he prepares for his second-to-last time driving <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> Bergen.

5|$|On 5 June 1965, {{locomotive}} 70051 Firth of Forth was hauling {{a passenger}} train when a blowback {{of the fire}} occurred near , severely injuring both traincrew. Driver Wallace Oakes managed to safely bring <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> a stand, but both he and fireman Gwilym Roberts were severely injured. Oakes died a week later. He was awarded the George Cross and the Carnegie Hero Trust bronze medal for his actions. Class 86 locomotive 86 240 was later named Wallace Oakes G.C. in his honour.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1982, a train derailed at a {{malfunctioning}} crossover switch {{south of}} the Federal Triangle station. In attempting to restore <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> the rails, supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed. The other rail car slid off the track and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this crash occurred about 30 minutes after Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th Street Bridge during a major snowstorm.|$|E

5|$|Stunt co-ordinator Martin Grace {{suffered}} an injury while shooting {{the scene where}} Bond climbs down <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> catch Octopussy's attention. During {{the second day of}} filming, Grace – who was Roger Moore's stunt double for the scene – carried on doing the scene longer than he should have, due to a miscommunication with the second unit director, and the train entered a section of the track which the team had not properly surveyed. Shortly afterwards, a concrete pole fractured Grace's left leg.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, another {{programme}} of {{improvements to}} the locks was carried out, extending the locks to , which enabled trains of 19 compartments to operate regularly. Experiments with trains as long as 38 tubs were carried out, but the difficulty of splitting <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> pass through the locks meant that 19 was the usual maximum. The compartments continued until the late 1960s to carry around half a million tons of coal, long after most British canals had ceased {{to be used for}} commercial traffic, but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Clues from Mollaka {{point to}} corrupt Greek {{official}} Alex Dimitrios. Bond finds Dimitrios in the Bahamas and, after seducing his wife Solange, pursues him to Miami. Bond kills Dimitrios and follows his henchman to the airport. He thwarts {{the destruction of}} Skyfleet's airliner, costing Le Chiffre his investment. To recoup the money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government, which they will grant in exchange for information on his clients. On <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> Montenegro, Bond meets Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent there to protect the government's $10million buy-in.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning Sissener {{suggests}} the two go driving blindfolded. The stunt goes surprisingly well, but as Sissener pulls over the car, he dies. Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an urgency to live life to the fullest. He makes {{his way up to}} the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing the jump. He comes to a decision and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer wearing his railwayman's jacket, rides <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E

5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers are waiting for <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E
5|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} from Stephenson's, {{but the first}} was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth being told to convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828 two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing the driver and both due to the safety valves being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used on the line, and they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy cart was introduced in mid-1828: a small cart {{at the end of}} the train, this carried the horse downhill, allowing it to rest and <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> run at higher speed. The S made their use compulsory from November 1828.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 2015, Network Rail's tracklaying machine {{reached the}} end of the line at Tweedbank station where a large crowd had gathered. As there was not enough track for <b>the</b> <b>train</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} tracklaying into the second platform, it had to return the next day. The formal completion took place on 12 February when Keith Brown clipped the final length of rail into place. During the period of construction, more than 1,000 rails were laid across 90,000 sleepers. With the infrastructure complete, attention was turned to the installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising the stations. A GSM-R system controlled from the IECC next to Edinburgh Waverley was in place by April 2015.|$|E
