5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poet and <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try}} to help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|Avatar, {{marketed as}} James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and {{starring}} Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film {{is set in}} the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi– a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.|$|E

5|$|In the Balkand {{episode of}} the {{marriage}} of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state (Jagrat), sleep with dreams (Swapna), dreamless sleep (Sushupti) and the fourth self-conscious state (Turiya). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (Vibhu) of the four states – Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Brahman. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.|$|E
5|$|Inside Out is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy-drama {{adventure}} film, co-written {{and directed}} by Pete Docter. The film is set in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young girl named Riley Andersen (Kaitlyn Dias), where five personified emotions—Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling)—try to lead her through life as she moves to a new city and has to adjust to her new life. After premiering it at the 68th Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2015, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures released the film theatrically in the United States on June 19, 2015. Made on a production budget of $175 million, Inside Out grossed a worldwide total of $857 million, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2015 and the 49th highest-grossing film of all time as of July 2016. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, surveyed 317 reviews and judged 98% to be positive.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E

5|$|According to the Malayalam Bhagavata Purana, Krishna got {{the name}} Keshava as he slew Keshi. Krishna is {{referred}} to as slayer of Keshi twice in the Bhagavata Gita by Arjuna - Keshava (1.30) and Keshi-nisudana (18.1). In the first chapter (1.30), addressing Krishna as slayer of Keshi, Arjuna expresses his doubts about war, at the same time, finds Krishna capable of destroying them. Here, Keshi represents false pride and the reference as slayer of Keshi by Arjuna expresses his humility. Keshi as a mad horse who created havoc in Gokula - also represents the wild horse of doubts who run in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person. In the last chapter (18.1), Arjuna addresses Krishna as Maha-baho ("mighty-armed") paired with the slayer of Keshi epithet, reminding the reader how Krishna killed Keshi with his arms alone. The Vishnu sahasranama ("The Thousand names of Vishnu") calls Krishna as Keshava (Names 23, 648) and Keshitha (649) - the slayer of Keshi. The fourth century play Mudrarakshasa also interprets the epithet Keshava as the slayer of Keshi. Keshighat is a major bathing ghat along the river Yamuna in Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have overpowered Keshi.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Nilin (Kezia Burrows), an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by Memorize. As she {{is taken to}} have {{the last of her}} {{memories}} wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into the slums of Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad Request, is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Memorize commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide.|$|E

25|$|Using {{the idea}} of shadows, a major theme that {{received}} considerable notice by the academic public was the literal liberation of the young female voice during the Hasenjagd and, consequently, during the war. Reichart allowed the reader to see into <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tormented, silenced girl, thus freeing her voice. Through Reichart's book, the Austrian readers could feel they were making a positive and progressive movement in history by becoming aware of {{the tragedy of the}} war, and accepting their place and major faults in it.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, DGs {{have had}} a {{different}} approach to linear order (word order) than constituency grammars. Dependency-based structures are minimal compared to their constituency-based counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions. Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency-based structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesnière (1959), to focus on hierarchical order {{in a manner that is}} hardly possible for constituency grammars. For Tesnière, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesnière produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesnière adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.|$|E
25|$|In March 1983, {{under two}} years before EastEnders first episode was broadcast, the show was a vague idea in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> handful of BBC executives, who decided that what BBC1 needed was a popular {{bi-weekly}} drama series that would attract the kind of mass audiences that ITV was getting with Coronation Street. The first people to whom David Reid, then head of series and serials, turned were Julia Smith and Tony Holland, a well established producer/script editor team who had first worked together on Z-Cars. The outline that Reid presented was vague: two episodes a week, 52 weeks a year. After the concept was put to them on 14 March 1983, Smith and Holland then went about putting their ideas down on paper; they {{decided it would be}} set in the East End of London. Granada Television gave Smith unrestricted access to the Coronation Street production for a month so that she could get a sense how a continuing drama was produced.|$|E

25|$|However it {{cannot be}} stated affirmatively where <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arahant exists {{or that it}} exists at all, because {{describing}} an arahant's <b>mind</b> in terms <b>of</b> existence would limit it to the confines of time and space, which Nirvana occurs outside of. It would be equally incorrect to say that <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arahant does not exist — the Buddha said {{that the idea of}} existence or non-existence “does not apply” to <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arahant's <b>mind.</b> Ajaan Mun argued all of this by describing <b>a</b> unique class <b>of</b> “objectless” or “themeless” consciousness specific to Nirvana, which differs from the consciousness aggregate.|$|R
25|$|Mullich {{contracted}} the Dreamers Guild {{to do the}} programming, artwork and sound effects. Its S.A.G.A. game engine {{was seen as an}} ideal user interface for the player to interact with the environment and to converse with the characters in AM's world. It was decided early on that high resolution graphics were necessary to capture the nuances and mood of Ellison's vivid imagination, and so Technical Director John Bolton adapted the engine to utilize SVGA graphics and included the Fastgraph graphics library. Mullich and Cyberdreams art director Peter Delgado had frequent meetings with Dreamers Guild art director Brad Schenck to devise art direction complementing the surreal nature of the story. Since the story takes place in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mad god who can make anything happen, the team chose a variety of art styles for each of the scenarios, ranging from the unsettling perspectives used in German Expressionist films to pure fantasy to stark reality. Assistant art director Glenn Price and his team rendered more than 60 backgrounds utilizing a number of 2D and 3D tools, including Deluxe Paint and LightWave. Hundreds of animations were drawn by assistant art director Jhoneil Centeno and his team of animators.|$|E
25|$|The {{journals}} of the reigns of George IV and William IV, extending from 1817 to 1837, {{were published in}} obedience to his directions almost ten years after his death. Few publications have been received with greater interest by the public; five large editions were sold {{in little more than}} a year, and the demand in America was as great as in England. These journals were regarded as a faithful record of the impressions made on <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> competent observer, at the time, by the events he witnessed and the persons with whom he associated. Greville did not stoop to collect or record private scandal. His object appears to have been to leave behind him some of the materials of history, by which the men and actions of his own time would be judged. He records not so much public events as the private causes which led to them; and perhaps no English memoir-writer has left behind him a more valuable contribution to the history of the 19th century. Greville published anonymously, in 1845, a volume on the Past and Present Policy of England in Ireland, in which he advocated the payment of the Roman Catholic clergy; and he was also the author of several pamphlets on the events of his day.|$|E
25|$|In Captain America: Steve Rogers #1 (July 2016), {{the final}} panel {{apparently}} revealed that Rogers {{has been a}} Hydra double-agent since his early youth. This is subsequently revealed {{to be the result}} of Kobik's restoration of Rogers' youth, as she had been taught by the Red Skull that Hydra was good for the world, and having <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> four-year old child, Kobik changed reality so that Rogers would be the greatest man he could be: believing Hydra to be good, Kobik permanently altered his memories so that Rogers believed that he had always been a member of Hydra. Some of Rogers' original heroic attributes remain intact, such as covering the death of another Hydra member within S.H.I.E.L.D., Erik Selvig, as well as knowing of Jack Flag's tragic life and his immortality, which is why Steve pushes him from Zemo's airplane (resulting in coma, not death). Additionally, it is revealed that Rogers' abusive father, Joseph, was actually killed by Hydra, and that Hydra deceived him into thinking Joseph died of a heart attack. It is also revealed that Rogers witnessed his mother, Sarah, being killed by Sinclair's Hydra goons and kidnapped him, which is the reason why Steve held a grudge towards Hydra's evilness and plans to kill the Red Skull's clone and restore Hydra's lost honor. As part of his long-term plans, Steve further compromised Sam Wilson's current image as 'the' Captain America by using his greater familiarity with the shield to deliberately put Wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the shield to save a senator from Flag-Smasher, with the final goal of demoralizing Sam to the point where he will return the shield to Rogers of his own free will, not wanting to kill Wilson and risk creating a martyr.|$|E
