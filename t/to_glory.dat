Booker T could not attend the event due to Hurricane Ike, making the bout a Three Ways <b>to</b> <b>Glory</b> match instead. Joe retained the championship at the show.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{completing}} The Road <b>to</b> <b>Glory,</b> Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays {{a married couple}} by juxtaposing them in the Garden of Eden and in modern New York City. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy flapper and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred George O'Brien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers: Ippo's Road <b>to</b> <b>Glory</b> was {{produced}} by Entertainment Software Publishing and was adapted from the Fighting Spirit manga series, {{at a time when}} the publishing company was focusing on its licensed comic properties rather than original titles. Development for the game was handled by New Corporation. The developers noted the capacities of the PlayStation 2 allowed them to reproduce the characters of the series accurately. The soundtrack of the game was composed by Takayuki Aihara, Shinji Hosoe and Naoki Tsuchiya. In May 2001, British video game company Empire Interactive announced it would publish the game in Europe and North America. Since Empire's presence in the United States market was minimal, a distribution deal was passed with Vivendi Universal for them to distribute the game, along with six other titles, in North America.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's home colours are {{sky blue}} and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, {{in recent years}} several {{different}} colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but {{there is evidence that}} the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side. The red and black away colours used infrequently yet recurrently come from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison, who believed that adopting the colours of A.C. Milan would inspire City <b>to</b> <b>glory.</b> Allison's theory worked, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup Final, 1970 League Cup Final and the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road <b>to</b> <b>Glory</b> as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle {{continued}} after Hard Justice leading into No Surrender. On the August14 episode of Impact!, Styles fought Angle in an Olympic Wrestling match for Angle's 1996 Summer Olympics {{gold medal in}} freestyle wrestling. Styles defeated Angle to win the medal on the telecast. Styles and Angle fought a week later on the August 21 episode of Impact! in a ladder match for the medal, with Styles retaining the medal. Styles {{then went on to}} feud with Angle's on-screen bestfriend Frank Trigg, who attacked Styles with a kendo stick during Styles' Four Ways <b>to</b> <b>Glory</b> qualification match with Cage, costing Styles to bout in the process. This led to Styles challenging Trigg to a bout at No Surrender, which Trigg agreed to but only if it was contested under Mixed Martial Arts rules on the September11 episode of Impact!. Styles and Trigg fought to a no contest at No Surrender due to Styles accidentally hitting Trigg in the groin. Afterwards, Styles beat Trigg with a kendo stick to end their feud. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Styles was ordered to return Angle's gold medal by Jeff Jarrett, who had taken a role as a TNA management authority figure. The medal was returned to Angle on the October9 episode of Impact! by Jarrett.|$|E
5|$|At TNA's {{previous}} No Surrender PPV {{event on}} September14, Sting announced that TNA management {{had decided that}} he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. Later in the show, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a Three Ways <b>to</b> <b>Glory</b> match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when he was younger he learned from the veterans in the industry and that Joe and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments later in the show, stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for Glory to teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October2 Impact! episode. Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added {{that there would be no}} rematch between the two after the event regardless of the outcome.|$|E
