5|$|After winning two Five Nations {{games in}} 1992, {{and one in}} 1993, Wales won the Championship in 1994 on points difference. But without {{defeating}} one of Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa, during the inter-World Cup period, Wales was not considered a major tournament contender. At the 1995 World Cup, after comprehensively beating Japan, Wales lost to New Zealand; this meant <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> defeat Ireland {{to qualify for the}} quarter-finals. Wales lost 24–23 and so failed to progress beyond the pool stage for the second time, and later that year Kevin Bowring replaced Alex Evans to become Wales' first full-time coach.|$|E

5|$|NJDOT {{started the}} I-287 (Middlesex Freeway) Rehabilitation Project in August 2007 to {{resurface}} the pavement between exit5 in South Plainfield and I-95/New Jersey Turnpike in Edison Township, {{which is used}} by about 150,000 vehicles daily. Some of the bridges and overpasses had deteriorated to such a state <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be replaced. On September16, 2009, NJDOT announced the start of another rehabilitation and repaving project from exit5 in Piscataway {{to the area of}} exit10 in Franklin Township.

5|$|Over the {{following}} year, Japan also proceeded with its expansion plans. The Invasion of French Indochina on 22 September 1940 (which by then {{was controlled by}} the collaborating government of Vichy France), and Japan's ongoing bloody conflict with China, put a severe strain on American-Japanese relations. On 26 July 1940, the United States had passed the Export Control Act, cutting oil, iron and steel exports to Japan. This containment policy was Washington's warning to Japan that any further military expansion would result in further sanctions. However, such US moves were interpreted by Japan's militaristic leaders as signals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> take radical measures to improve the Empire's situation, thereby driving Japan closer to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, the Government {{felt that}} the best way to ensure {{minority}} representation in Parliament was to introduce the GRC scheme. In addition, it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates, as it would be economical for a town council to manage a group of three constituencies. Subsequently, in 1991, the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies which had grown too big for the MPs serving them, and, in 1996, GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be effective.|$|E

However, the class win was revoked when the Jaguar XJ220-C was {{controversially}} disqualified for failing to run with catalytic converters. The Jaguars had passed scrutiny and completed {{the first day of}} qualifying when senior steward Alain Bertaut complained that Jaguar were not running catalytic converters. The cars had been entered under the IMSA GT category and Bertaut claimed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> run with catalysts. The cars ran in the race under appeal.|$|E

Trailers from Class 65 and Class 67 were taken into use, and {{for a short period}} a Class 91 trailer. On 28 August 1985, passenger traffic on the line was terminated and the two remaining trains were retired. Reasons for the termination included a lack of sufficient political support for financing new trains, and also that Class 64 was no longer suitable for use. The last two trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Club and are stored at Garnes Station, part of the Old Voss Line.|$|E

Angelina developed a crush on Gloria's son, Kevin Fisher, who was already engaged to his girlfriend Chloe. Angelina attempted to seduce Kevin, making Chloe hate her. Angelo put Kevin in charge of keeping Angelina safe from her dangerous ex-boyfriend Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper). Devon found out that Angelina sang well only if staring into Kevin's eyes. At Kevin and Chloe's wedding, Angelina told Kevin that she was pregnant with Carmine's child and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> leave town immediately.

Newsom received 41.9 {{percent of the vote}} to Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 19.6 {{in the first round of}} balloting, but he faced a closer race in the December 9 runoff when many of the city's liberal groups coalesced around Gonzalez. The race was partisan with attacks against Gonzalez for his support of Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election and attacks against Newsom for contributing $500 to a Republican slate mailer in 2000 that endorsed issues Newsom supported. Democratic leadership felt <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> reinforce San Francisco as a Democratic stronghold after losing the 2000 presidential election and the 2003 recall election to Arnold Schwarzenegger. National figures from the Democratic Party, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson, campaigned on Newsom's behalf. Five supervisors endorsed Gonzalez while Newsom received the endorsement of Willie Brown.|$|E
5|$|When King Rama V {{ascended the}} throne in 1868, {{he decided to}} build a new group of grander throne halls to replace the old structures. The first phase of {{construction}} began in 1868, then again in 1876, and the final phase between 1882 and 1887. King Rama V resided in the palace until 1910 when he gradually moved to the new Dusit Palace, {{to the north of the}} Grand Palace. King Rama VI occasionally stayed in the palace; however he preferred his other residences in the country. By the reign of King Rama VII the buildings were in dire need of renovations, but due to economic constraints only the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall was renovated. This work was carried out by Prince Itthithepsan Kritakara, an architectural graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Many of his works can still be seen today. During the reign of King Rama IX many of the buildings once more became so dilapidated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be demolished altogether. In their stead new halls were constructed in 2004 to replace them.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Jenner {{encountered}} {{a group of}} men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren {{standing in front of the}} National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's good news provided that he was allowed to share some good news first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was intended}} to stay true to the Dragon Quest formula within the design necessities and limitations of an MMORPG. During an earlier development phase, the UI featured {{a large amount of}} information showing the various player statuses, but seeking to streamline and simplify the game, they removed most of the display. A different gameplay challenge was presented by the move from turn-based to real-time battles, which went against the traditions of the Dragon Quest series. Fujisawa wanted to implement the classic battle system, but was opposed by Horii and other staff members, who successfully pushed for a real-time combat system. Elements of that battle system, such as the ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic, proved extremely challenging for the developers. Speaking about the difference between Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Yoshida said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> preserve the atmosphere of a normal Dragon Quest title despite MMORPGs not being designed for solo playing. It was for this reason that the loaning of player characters as NPC party members was incorporated. During later development, and following the game's release, the main focus was on balancing the various elements, items and weapons so as to create a level playing field, in addition to keeping the in-game economy balanced. Several features featured in earlier entries, such as the Casino and Coliseum, needed to be kept back for a later time.|$|E
