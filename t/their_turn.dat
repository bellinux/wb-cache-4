5|$|Early on the {{development}} of Navi Trackers, it was decided that it would include a speech navigation system that talks and advises the player during mini-games. Players type in their name and the system calls players by their name during the game in order to notify them of <b>their</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|His {{career began}} when he was apprenticed to {{engraver}} Ralph Beilby in Newcastle upon Tyne. He became {{a partner in the}} business and eventually took it over. Apprentices whom Bewick trained include John Anderson, Luke Clennell, and William Harvey, who in <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> became well known as painters and engravers.|$|E
5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air to be caught and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will {{sometimes}} stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently {{declared}} that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> be beaten by France, Britain and the United States. By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed {{that the best way}} to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E
5|$|In a {{first for}} the series, Days of Ruin {{includes}} online multiplayer over Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection service, {{as well as a}} feature for players to share their own custom map designs and download maps made by others (custom maps and sharing custom maps is a feature present in all Advance Wars games). Over 150 premade maps are included in the game for use in local multiplayer, and designed for two, three, and four-player matches. Multiplayer games can be played with only one DS game card: each player can pass the game to the next player when it is <b>their</b> <b>turn.</b> It is also possible to set all sides to CPU, which is useful for studying the AI.|$|E

5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, {{around the world to}} interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> to attack.|$|E
5|$|Milson led {{the first}} group of Beaufighters into Førde Fjord at about 4:10pm. His {{aircraft}} escaped undamaged after attacking a flak ship and other Beaufighters followed him into the fjord. At about this time 12 Fw190s arrived at Førde Fjord and flew through German flak to intercept the Beaufighters that were waiting <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> to attack. The British Mustangs were taken by surprise, but dived to intercept the German fighters. This led to an intense air battle, with over 50 aircraft either engaged in dogfights or diving to attack the German ships; it was the largest aerial conflict ever fought over Norway.|$|E
5|$|New {{walls were}} built by Tarade and Vauban in the 17th century. They were in <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> {{destroyed}} in 1874. Only small portions survive: two bastions and the Porte de Strasbourg ("Strasbourg gate"), {{a good example}} of French architecture under Louis XIV. Sélestat still has two old arsenals, Sainte-Barbe on the main square (1470) and Saint-Hilaire (1518). The first, with a large crenelated gable, is a fine example of Gothic architecture.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 {{includes}} a multiplayer option which allows two players to cooperatively {{play the game}} by taking turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (a palette swap of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, in which one player {{has the opportunity to}} steal the cards of another but may lose <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> if they lose the mini-game.|$|E
5|$|The Pandavas {{live under}} the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very {{powerful}} monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} local two-player {{multiplayer}} with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel {{at the beginning}} of <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> to determine how many hazards they get to place via drag and drop. A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases. Gasketball uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a tutorial and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.|$|E

5|$|The turn-based battles are {{triggered}} through random encounters. The {{player has}} several options, including fighting and fleeing from battle. The number of enemies are indicated by small sprites {{on the bottom}} of the battle screen. During <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> in combat, the protagonist and current companion can perform an action such as attacking using melee or ranged attacks such as magic, or use an item which can weaken the enemy or strengthen the player party. Upon successfully completing a battle, the party is awarded with experience points, skill points, items and money. Skill points are assigned to the protagonist's attributes such as speed or magic, modifying future performance in battle.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> to bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible {{route to the}} ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{original}} versions, Xenosaga I & II features random encounters within the environment, with enemies only {{appearing in the}} battle arena. During battle, the battle arena is displayed on the DS's top screen while commands and party status is displayed on the bottom screen. Battles are governed by a turn-based battle system similar to the main Xenosaga games. Battles take plates on a 5x6 grid divided between the main party and the enemy party. During <b>their</b> <b>turn,</b> a character can move to any part of their half of the grid.|$|E

5|$|While in port, Spee {{received}} the {{order from the}} Admiralty Staff to attempt to break through to Germany. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, {{in accordance with the}} neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. Dresden and Leipzig took <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> in Valparaiso, after which the re-formed squadron continued south and rounded Cape Horn into the South Atlantic. In the meantime, the Royal Navy sent a pair of battlecruisers— and —commanded by Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee to hunt down Spee's squadron and avenge Cradock's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Assembly of a Fat Man {{unit was}} a complex {{operation}} involving personnel from the HE-ME, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting {{to perform a}} specific task had to wait <b>their</b> <b>turn</b> outside the building. The first Fat Man assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man high explosive pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on a B-29 of the 509th Composite Group and 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 {{were found to be}} badly cracked and unserviceable. The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.|$|E
5|$|At first, the revolutionaries {{used the}} {{constitutional}} machinery {{of the old}} confederal republic. They resumed where they had left off after the purge in 1787 of Patriot regents, taking over {{the offices of the}} Orangist regents that were now purged in <b>their</b> <b>turn.</b> Though the political make-up of the States-General changed appreciably because of this change in personnel, it retained a number of defenders of the old particularist interests. The first order of business of the revolutionaries therefore was to strive for the reform of the confederal state, with its discrimination of the Generality Lands, and of particular minorities (Catholics, Jews), {{in the direction of a}} unitary state, in which the minorities would be emancipated, and the old entrenched interests superseded by a more democratic political order. As a first step the representatives of Brabant were admitted to the States-General.|$|E
