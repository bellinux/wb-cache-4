Elastomeric material possessing conductive or magnetic properties {{have been widely used}} in applications such as conductive and magnetic <b>tapes,</b> <b>sensors,</b> flexible permanent magnets, etc. Our interest in these materials has focussed on understanding and controlling the magnitude and directionality of their response to applied magnetic fields. The effect of magnetic fields on the mechanical properties of these materials has not been the subject of many published studies. Our interest and expertise in controllable fluids have given us the foundation to make a transition to controllable elastomers. Controllable elastomers are materials that exhibit a change in mechanical properties upon application of an external stimuli, in this case a magnetic field. Controllable elastomers promise to have more functionality than conventional elastomers and therefore could share the broad industrial application base with conventional elastomers. As such, these materials represent an attractive class of smart materials, and may well be a link that brings the applications of modern control technologies, intelligent structures and smart materials to a very broad industrial area. This presentation will cover our research work in the area of controllable elastomers at the Thomas Lord Research Center. More specifically, the presentation will discuss the control of mechanical properties and mathematical modeling of the new materials prepared in our laboratories along with experiments to achieve adaptive vibration control using the new materials...|$|R

40|$|Thermoplastic and {{thermoset}} fiber-reinforced {{composite materials}} are well established in aerospace engineering, {{but also more}} and more used in {{the oil and gas}} industry as well as in civil engineering. In these applications they are mainly used to reinforce, repair or straighten existing structures, but recently full-composite structures have also been built. Independently from the domain of the use, there is a need for these composite structures to be monitored. Since the composite materials are usually applied in form of thin <b>tapes</b> or sheets, <b>sensors</b> have to be embedded within the structure, depending on structural layer that has to be monitored. Embedding the sensors may have as a consequence a significant decrease of the mechanical properties of the composite material due to the dimensions of the sensor. The solution presented in this paper is integration of a fiber optic sensor directly into the main composite component, i. e. into the composite tape. In this paper we present the development of a thermoplastic fiber-reinforced composite tape with integrated long-gage fiber-optic sensors. The fiber-optic sensors are selected due to small transversal dimension and good compatibility with the plastic materials. The tape with integrated optical fiber can be used for tape winding of a structural element, embedded between different layers, but also as a separate sensor – a sensing tape. The optical and mechanical properties of the <b>tapes</b> with <b>sensor</b> are tested. The sensing tape is then installed onto the rail along with standard long-gage fiber optic sensor, additional tests are performed and performance of both sensor compared.

Inkjet printing is used because it is a non-contact technique and is the printing method that allows the most accurate registration from layer to layer. (1) In addition, the sensors require membranes and spacers; therefore contact printing methods would not be appropriated.

The transcutaneous sensor of the CGM system (CGMS TM Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA, USA) is chosen to measure glucose concentration in interstitial fluid up to three days after insertion even though its function remains stable for a longer period. The question arises, which factors really limit the period of sensor insertion without unnecessary risk. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess any adverse events occurring in the course of 9 days after the sensor insertion. Methods: In a group of 22 healthy volunteers aged 21. 8 ± 1. 30 y (mean ± SE) a total of 26 sensors was inserted subcutaneously in gluteal or lumbar region for 9 days. Before insertion the site was sprayed with an antiseptic (Cutasept F, Bode Chemie, Hamburg, Germany). Local adverse reactions and disturbances in general condition were examined.

The left-hand cluster includes the write-protection hole. The right-hand cluster of three is used (by various permutations of open/closed status) to tell the machine the total tape running time. This was employed in second generation machines such as Grundig's Video 2x4 Super to provide a real-time tape counter: upon insertion of the tape the machine moves the tape forward and then backward by a small amount and monitors the comparative angular speed of the reels. This is looked up in a data table for the known total tape length and the hours and minutes used are then displayed. A similar technique was later used on Video8, MiniDV and MicroMV cassettes. Some later VHS machines also featured this ability although it did not work with VHS-C cassettes.

New technologies based on this mission enable us to more easily sense, interact, and communicate with objects. However, the world is highly variable in physical forms. To achieve the vision of ubiquitous computing, common manmade objects need to be designed from the ground up to incorporate computers and sensors. Often, we find ourselves confined by existing sensing infrastructures that are not designed to adapt the complexity of the physical world. This dissertation presents a research platform to investigate design principles and applications for flexible sensate surfaces. This platform utilizes recent advancements in low-cost, roll-to-roll conductive inkjet printing technology as an enabler for creating a scalable, physically and functionally adaptive and customizable sensing system. This collection of work demonstrates design principles and examples in the following four areas: manufacturing, customizable computer aided design, fabrication with physical manipulation and multi-modal sensing techniques. Two types of manufacturing methods are used and characterized. The first approach customizes the sensing design in a digital environment, where users define the geometry, shape and sensing inputs in a computer and print out customized functional patterns. The second approach is sensor fabrication via physical manipulation, where the sensate surface is premanufactured and through an additive method (paneling linear <b>sensor</b> <b>tape</b> stripes), or a subtractive method (cutting a sensor sheet), and the shape and sensing targets are processed post-manufacturing. Lastly, I demonstrate three techniques for multimodal sensing - designing "target specific shapes" for different sensing targets, multiplexing single input electrodes with various analog circuits for near surface sensing (pressure, touch, folding, proximity sensing), and adding extra layers of chemical for the designed ad-hoc sensing target alteration. The outcome of this exploration combines emerging technologies to realize a new way of designing sensate surfaces for smart environments and objects and helps us rethink sensing as both a graphical design and a physical manipulation process.

40|$|A passive, {{economical}} {{and easy}} to assemble thermal insulation blanket {{has been designed to}} protect micro, nano and pico satellites, and their payloads as well. The structure of the Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) system has been simplified using Components Off The Shelf (COTS), so that it is composed of two types of layers: the reflective layers and the separator layers. The layers are bonded together using Kapton, glass fiber tape and a bi-adhesive tape. The reflective layers are made of Mylar polyester film, typically used in first-aid kits. The separator layers, used to prevent thermal conduction between the reflective layers, consist of a glass-fiber net used in building constructions, namely for wall plastering. The fibers are crossed together to form a mesh about 3 x 6 mm in size. Several samples have been manufactured, with the size of 22 x 22 cm, in order to fit inside the thermo-vacuum chamber of the LARES-lab at the School of Aerospace Engineering. Each sample differs from the others by the number of layers, with a maximum thickness of 2 mm. The performances of this MLI system have been evaluated. Each sample has been tested in high vacuum (< 10 − 5 mbar), and temperatures {{on both sides of the}} sample have been recorded before and during the activation of a SpectrosunXT- 10 Type II solar simulator. The test procedure, applied on all the samples, consisted in measuring the temperatures reached at the equilibrium but also in monitoring the transient during vacuum creation and during the heating of the sample. Two Platinum Resistance Thermometers were placed in the center of each side of the sample; the thermometers were fixed to the surface by means of a thermal conductive double sided adhesive <b>tape.</b> Two additional <b>sensors</b> were placed on the walls of the vacuum chamber. The highest recorded temperature on the front- facing layers of a tested specimen was 161. 9 o C.

Heat transfer was reduced through the use of a larger number of layers in the sample, as well as by varying the front surface emissivity.
