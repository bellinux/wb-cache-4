Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is {{faced with the challenge}} of a particularly difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail.

With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, {{and the rest of the}} team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit.</b> Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced to take a good look at what she wants.

He's pleased when his son becomes a Lions football player.|$|E
25|$|Real estate trade groups, in response, {{claim that}} the {{abatement}} program makes it feasible to build residential housing in the first place. John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, claimed that the high construction costs, expensive land, and tax increases would make construction unfeasible without the tax break. One developer also claimed {{that they would be}} more likely to construct condos instead of rentals without the tax abatement because the differential would make condos comparably more profitable. The developer claimed that affordable rental units would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> without the 421-a program.|$|E
500|$|Mullen {{arrived in}} the NHL {{possessing}} great balance on his skates, an ability his teammates and coaches believed he gained from playing roller hockey. His coaches praised his willingness {{to play in the}} difficult areas of the ice, even though he stood only five foot nine inches tall and knew he would have to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> to make a play. Penguins' play-by-play announcer Mike Lange nicknamed Mullen [...] "Slippery Rock Joe" [...] for his ability to evade opposing players.|$|E

500|$|The stunt {{coordinator}} for the season was Tanner Gill. In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying [...] "I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers to help me through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level. That {{has to be very}} believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they hitting me, so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> and make it look real.|$|E
500|$|Bure {{recorded}} 49 {{points in}} 53 games in 1991–92 for the Chiefs, {{his first season}} in the WHL. The Montreal Canadiens selected him with their second round pick, 33rd overall, at the 1992 NHL Entry Draft. [...] The NHL Central Scouting Bureau praised Bure as being a good skater. [...] In its assessment, the Bureau added: [...] "very smart around the net; good passer, playmaker. Good shot, quick release. Will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> to make the play. Good competitor." [...] He returned to Spokane for the 1992–93 season where Bure led his team and finished second overall in WHL scoring with 147 points. [...] His 68 goals that season remains a Chiefs' franchise record. He {{was named to the}} WHL's West Division First All-Star Team. Bure attended Montreal's training camp prior to the 1993–94 season, but was again returned to his junior team. [...] He recorded 102 points in his final season in the WHL and was named to the Second All-Star Team. In three seasons with Spokane, Bure recorded 298 points and stands fourth on the Chiefs' all-time scoring list.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Andersson's luck {{seemed to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> when the Vancouver Canucks traded {{up to take}} Alexander Edler ahead of Detroit. Andersson had scouted Edler in the remote town of Östersund, where the youngster was playing in a local men's league, and due to the {{relative}} isolation of Östersund the only other NHL scout who had seen Edler play was Vancouver's Thomas Gradin. With Edler off the board, Detroit moved to the next name on their list: an unheralded 24-year-old defensive-minded Swede center named Johan Franzén. [...] Franzén was big, had a heavy shot, with very good skating abilities for his size, and Andersson believed Franzén could at least be a good checking center. Andersson's expectations were exceeded in 2008 when, despite missing six games, Franzén set a new Red Wings franchise record by scoring 13 goals in a single post-season, a mark subsequently matched by Zetterberg.|$|E

2500|$|The 2007 Oklahoma team {{opened up}} with a home game against North Texas and soundly beat them 79-10. The 79points scored by OU was {{the most in the}} country for Week 1. In Week 2, the Sooners played a much tougher {{opponent}} in Miami. However, the results seemed to show a mismatch, as OU easily defeated the Hurricanes 51-13. In Week 3, the Sooners got the best of Utah State with a 54-3 thrashing. Week 4 matched OU {{up with a}}n in-state foe, Tulsa. Just as it had been all season (except for the Sept. 29 loss at unranked Colorado), the Sooners put up another dominant performance with a 62–21 victory. In Week 5 (September 29, 2007), the #4 Sooners saw their National Championship hopes <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> as they lost to 2–2 unranked Colorado in Boulder 27-24 after leading in the second half by a score of 24-7. The Sooners only had 234 net yards compared to Colorado's 379 net yards. The 2007 match-up between Oklahoma and Texas on Oct. 2007 was predicted to be the #3game to watch in 2007 by SI.com's [...] "Top 20Games To Watch In 2007" [...] list. The Oklahoma football team proved itself worthy of the top ten rankings when it defeated Texas 28-21 at the Red River Rivalry. The Texas Longhorns played up to their potential when they answered almost every point during the October 6game. In the end Colt McCoy along with Jermichael Finley and the Longhorns could not withstand the adamant pressing of Sam Bradford, DeMarco Murray and the Sooners. [...] Oklahoma would go on to lose to an unranked Texas Tech team in an upset, although this was not enough to keep them from the Big 12 championship. They would go on to defeat Missouri in the Big 12 championship game and win the Big 12's automatic BCS berth, playing West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl. For the second consecutive year Oklahoma would lose to an underdog opponent in a BCS bowl game, although this game was not as close as the previous year. Oklahoma was down 14points at halftime and never pulled close than 20–15, eventually losing 48-28. After the 2007 season ended, offensive coordinator Kevin Sumlin resigned to accept the head football coach position at Houston, becoming the fourth Sooners offensive coordinator under Stoops to take a head coaching job and the fifth coordinator overall.|$|E
