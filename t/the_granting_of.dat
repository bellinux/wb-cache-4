5|$|Within the Macedonian commonwealth, or the Koinon of Macedonians, {{there is}} some epigraphic {{evidence}} from the 3rd century BC that foreign relations were handled by the central government.

Likewise, the city-states within contemporary Greek koina (i.e., federations of city-states, the sympoliteia) obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league. In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, <b>the</b> <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> proxenia (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities.
