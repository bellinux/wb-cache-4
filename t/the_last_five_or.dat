25|$|A {{significant}} {{diversity of}} species exists. Since coldwater coral reefs only occur at great depths, most hobbyists are largely confined to fish, sea anemones, crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and Feather duster worms. A few corals {{can be found}} at low depths. Since there are very few commercially available coldwater fish and invertebrates, hobbyists usually have to physically acquire specimens, although recently more specimens have become commercially available from the west coast of the United States as well as Japan, Australia, and the UK. The most common methods of acquisition are by trolling or seining, and experienced hobbyists use the movement of tides and searching methods to find certain species. Unlike commercially available tropical fish, whose behavior patterns and tank compatibilities have been well documented in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> six decades, coldwater fish have been kept in public and private aquaria for over two centuries and much ichthyological knowledge has been gathered in order to maintain them.|$|E
500|$|During {{his ninth}} season in 1966, Taylor did not sign a new one-year {{contract}} and instead played out his option; {{he made no}} secret that it was likely his last season with the Packers. He caught a career-high 41 passes that year but recorded the fewest rushing yards since his second season. The Packers finished atop the Western Division with a 12–2 record and defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the 1966 NFL Championship Game for their fourth NFL title in six years. In January 1967, Taylor and the Packers played in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, known retroactively as Super Bowl I, in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. They easily defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 35–10. Taylor was the top rusher of the game with 56 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} on a Packer Sweep play, with his score being the first rushing touchdown in Super Bowl history. [...] "It was just good blocking on a weak-side sweep play," [...] said Taylor of his touchdown run. [...] "It's a cakewalk when you get the blocking. It was just like we had been doing <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> six years." [...] The game was his final with the Packers.|$|E
500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> six starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I {{had to work hard}} adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let me tell you, it wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us. [...] You can call it a run-and-hit." [...] Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled induced labor for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.|$|E
