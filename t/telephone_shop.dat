This study is conducted to answer some problem formulations: (1) Any form of entrepreneurship activities in Pesantren al-Amien Prenduan and Darul Ulum Banyuanyar ?, (2) What is the motivation of entrepreneurship activities in Pesantren al-Amien and Darul Ulum?, (3) How is the development of entrepreneurship Based on Experiential Learning conducted in Pesantren al-Amien and Darul Ulum?, (4) What are the benefits and contribution of entrepreneurship Development-Based on Experiential Learning for institutions, students and the alumnus?. The method used in this study is a qualitative research with phenomenological research type. The data collection technique used is interview to businesses, students and the alumnus, as well as observation on several business units activities and related documentation for the research focus. Based on the research concluded that the entrepreneurship activities in al-Amien islamic boarding school, among others: Bottled Water of Bariklana, Factory of tofu, Family Welfare Unit, <b>Telephone</b> <b>shop,</b> and the shop for building tools. And the entrepreneurship activities in Darul Ulum, are: Nuri Drinking water, Nuri Syari'ah Cooperative, Ice factory, Shops, Kitchen Cooperative or common kitchen, and barber shop. Motivation entrepreneurship in Islamic boarding school is a vertical motivation, namely the intention of worship and devotion motivation, namely horizontal (ngabuleh) to scholars, and communities, improving the economy, achieving independence of institutions, as well as avoiding of dependency on aid and government subsidies. The forms of entrepreneurship development Experiential learning (learning based on direct experience) are: Employment Practices Industry (prakerin) Rihlah iqtishadiyah, Reward baketram, "ngabuleh/Khaddam" (maid of scholars), "master the corner”, inspiring schoolars behavior with dual role as a businessman and leader of pesantren, scholar slogan " hard work, smart work, and sincere work".

For patients with cognitive or hearing/language impairment limiting the interview, disability information was obtained from a surrogate who had frequent contact with the patient. A previous study has suggested a high patient-proxy inter-observer agreement in assessing functional status in critical illness survivors [36]. Overall, we define increased disability as an increase in composite BADL/IADL score at follow-up relative to baseline.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Designing {{a machine}} that mimics the human behavior, {{particularly}} with the capability of responding properly to spoken language, has intrigued engineers and scientists for centuries. The earlier research work on voice recognition system which is text-dependent requires that the user must say exactly the same text or passphrase for both enrollment and verification before gaining access. In this method the testing speech is polluted by additive noise at different noise decibel levels to achieve only 75 % recognition rate and would require full cooperation by the speaker {{which could not be}} used for forensic investigation. This paper presents the historical background, and technological advances in voice recognition and most importantly the study and implementation of textindependent biometric voice recognition system which could be used for speaker identification with 100 % recognition rate. The technique makes it possible to use the speaker's voice to verify their identity and control access to services such as voice dialing, <b>telephone</b> <b>shopping,</b> database access services, information services, voice mail, and remote access to computers. The implementation mainly incorporates Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCCs) which was used for feature extraction and Vector quantization using the Linde-Buzo-Gray (VQLBG) algorithm used to minimize the amount of data to be handled. The matching result is given on the basis of minimum distortion distance. The project is coded in MATLAB...|$|R

Sharing of these data is proved to be beneficial for data mining application. Since data mining often involves data that contains personally identifiable information and therefore releasing such data may result in privacy breaches. On one hand such data is an important asset to business decision making by analyzing it. On the other hand data privacy concerns may prevent data owners from sharing information for data analysis. In order to share data while preserving privacy, data owner must {{come up with a}} solution which achieves the dual goal of privacy preservation as well as accuracy of data mining task mainly clustering and classification. Privacy Preserving Data Publishing (PPDP) is a study of eliminating privacy threats like linkage attack while preserving data utility by anonymizing data set before publishing. Proposed work is an extension to k-anonymization where Privacy Gain (PrGain) has been computed for selective anonymization for set of tuples. Classification and clustering characteristics of original data and anonymized data using proposed algorithm have been evaluated in terms of information loss, execution time, and privacy achieved. Algorithm has been processed against standard data sets and analysis shows that values for sensitive attributes are being preserved with minimal information loss. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
40|$|Speaker recognition, {{which can}} be {{classified}} into identification and verification, {{is the process of}} automatically recognizing who is speaking on the basis of individual information included in speech waves. This technique makes it possible to use the speaker’s voice to verify their identity and control access to services such as voice dialing, banking by <b>telephone,</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>shopping,</b> database access services, information services, voice mail, security control for confidential information areas, and remote access to computers. AT&T and TI (with Sprint) have started field tests and actual application of speaker recognition technology; Sprint’s Voice Phone Card is already being used by many customers. In this way, speaker recognition technology is expected to create new services that will make our daily lives more convenient. Another important application of speaker recognition technology is for forensic purposes. Figure 1. 1 shows the basic structures of speaker identification and verification systems. Speaker identification is the process of determining which registered speaker provides a given utterance. Speaker verification, on the other hand, is the process of accepting or rejecting the identity claim of a speaker. Most applications in which a voice is used as the key to confirm the identity of a speaker are classified as speaker verification. There is also the case called open set identification, in which a reference model for an unknown speaker ma...|$|R
