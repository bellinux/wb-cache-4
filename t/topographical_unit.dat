Within Poland, neither of these ranges is forbidding enough to prevent substantial habitation; the Carpathians are especially densely populated. The rugged form of the Sudeten range derives from the geological shifts that formed the later Carpathian uplift. The highest elevation in the Sudeten is Śnieżka (1,602 meters) in the Karkonosze Mountains. The Carpathians in Poland, formed as a discrete <b>topographical</b> <b>unit</b> in the relatively recent Tertiary Era, are the highest mountains in the country. They are the northernmost edge of a much larger range that extends into the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Hungary, and Romania. Within Poland the range includes two major basins, the Oświęcim and Sandomierz, which are rich in several minerals and natural gas.|$|E

Multi-temporal satellite imagery, from different agricultural seasons, was used to produce land-cover maps for the catchment, using knowledge-based re-classification. The drainage network, elevation and other topographic and thematic data were digitized from maps. The GIS was used to integrate these data sources and provide tools for manipulation of the data. This procedure enabled spectrally inseparable classes to be delineated and land use maps to be prepared. Various land use classes, including wastelands, and appropriate preventive measures, have been developed. The paper also envisages some future studies for catchment management policies...|$|E

There {{is a need for}} conservation evaluations before large-scale commercial afforestation to determine which areas are required to maintain biological diversity in the afforestable region and which areas can be planted. This paper gives a protocol for wildlife conservation based on focal taxa, and is presented by means of a flow diagram. The protocol is designed to be implemented by a single researcher in regions which are poorly-known biologically and when there are time and cost constraints. Land types or broad vegetation types can be used to account for the large-scale variability in the landscape. Sampling on different <b>topographical</b> <b>units</b> or in different habitats on each large-scale unit can account for the small-scale variability. Some criteria considered important in choosing focal taxa are given. The sampling methods should allow the rapid collection of data on animal distributions in the landscape.

50|$|The geology of Bolivia {{comprises}} {{a variety}} of different lithologies as well as tectonic and sedimentary environments. On a synoptic scale, geological <b>units</b> coincide with <b>topographical</b> <b>units.</b> The country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the subduction processes in the Pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable platforms and shields. The Bolivian Andes is divided into three main ranges; these are from west to east: the Cordillera Occidental that makes up the border to Chile and host several active volcanoes and geothermal areas, Cordillera Central (in some contexts also called Cordillera Oriental) once extensively mined for silver and tin and the relatively low Cordillera Oriental that rather than being a range by its own is the eastern continuation of the Central Cordillera as a fold and thrust belt. Between the Occidental and Central Cordillera the approximately 3,750-meter-high Altiplano high plateau extends. This basin hosts several freshwater lakes, including Lake Titicaca as well as salt-covered dry lakes that bring testimony of past climate changes and lake cycles. The eastern lowlands and sub-Andean zone in Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, and Tarija Departments was once an old Paleozoic sedimentary basin that hosts valuable hydrocarbon reserves. Further east close to the border with Brazil lies the Guaporé Shield, made up of stable Precambrian crystalline rock.|$|R

No formal management plan is available for the game reserve and therefore the need for an ecological management plan and guidelines for the formulation of a vegetation monitoring plan constituted the basis of the study. The objectives of the study were: 1. To classify and map the plant communities of the Botsalano Game Reserve; 2. To provide quantitative data, collected during a formal vegetation classification, for use by the reserve management in terms of current vegetation condition; 3. To ascertain whether a classification of the vegetation on the BGR could be used for the objective placement of vegetation monitoring sites. Monitoring site placement will be based on representation of plant communities, reflecting community and <b>topographical</b> <b>unit</b> utilization and thus stocking rates based on management decisions...|$|E

Here, we address fundamental questions regarding the molecular basis of adaptation in undomesticated forest tree populations to past climatic environments by employing an integrative quantitative genetics and landscape genomics approach. Using this comprehensive approach, we studied the molecular basis of climate adaptation in 433 Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood) genotypes originating across western North America. Variation in 74 field-assessed traits (growth, ecophysiology, phenology, leaf stomata, wood, and disease resistance) was investigated for signatures of selection (comparing Q(ST) -F-ST) using clustering of individuals by climate of origin (temperature and precipitation). 29, 354 SNPs were investigated employing three different outlier detection methods and marker-inferred relatedness was estimated to obtain the narrow-sense estimate of population differentiation in wild populations. In addition, we compared our results with previously assessed selection of candidate SNPs using the 25 <b>topographical</b> <b>units</b> (drainages) across the P. trichocarpa sampling range as population groupings. Narrow-sense QST for 53 % of distinct field traits was significantly divergent from expectations of neutrality (indicating adaptive trait variation); 2, 855 SNPs showed signals of diversifying selection and of these, 118 SNPs (within 81 genes) were associated with adaptive traits (based on significant QST). Many SNPs were putatively pleiotropic for functionally uncorrelated adaptive traits, such as autumn phenology, height, and disease resistance. Evolutionary quantitative genomics in P. trichocarpa provides an enhanced understanding regarding the molecular basis of climate-driven selection in forest trees and we highlight that important loci underlying adaptive trait variation also show relationship to climate of origin. We consider our approach the most comprehensive, as it uncovers the molecular mechanisms of adaptation using multiple methods and tests. We also provide a detailed outline of the required analyses for studying adaptation to the environment in a population genomics context {{to better understand the}} species' potential adaptive capacity to future climatic scenarios...|$|R
30|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the operation of}} SF-NIL, a <b>topographical</b> array with <b>unit</b> side 7  mm was stepped out on Si using Delo-Katiobond. The array which comprised various sub-sections was spread across a 4 -in. wafer. The entire wafer was etched uniformly {{to a depth of}} 65  nm (the RIE parameters are included in Additional file 1 Section S 3). The nanopattern within each unit of the array consists of disordered 200 -nm diameter pillars which are presently of imperative importance to stem cell research and can only be fabricated via EBL [16 – 18]. The EBL process is highly time-consuming for this particular design at a rate of five and a half hours per square centimetre. Rapid array production via replication of the EBL pattern through SF-NIL is thus not only a good demonstration of the technology but useful for furthering stem cell studies.|$|R
40|$|Modeling is an {{essential}} part of the science of hydrology. Models enable us to formulate what we know and perceive from the real world into a neat package. Rainfall-runoff models are abstract simplifications of how a catchment works. Within the research field of scientific rainfall-runoff modeling, the focus is shifting from performance to consistency with fundamental principles of hydrological processes. Despite all efforts there are still gaps in our understanding of how real catchments work. Additionally there are enormous endeavors to understand the behavior of rainfall-runoff mechanisms within a catchment. Examples of research items that characterize system behavior are; water residence time, travel time, differences between velocity and celerity, use of tracers and remote sensing techniques. Meanwhile not much attention is given to understanding how all this knowledge should be implemented in a model. This thesis is an attempt to understand the role of model structure and the related assumptions in making better use of the available knowledge on catchment processes. The starting point of this thesis is building a hydrological model based on <b>topographical</b> landscape <b>units,</b> using a newly introduced descriptor called HAND (Height above nearest drainage). The purpose of this part of research was to build a model which contains our perception of how rainfall-runoff mechanisms work for distinct landscapes, classified based on HAND and slope. Three different models have been developed from simple to complex. A simple model has a limited number of constraints while a complex model can have various constraints imposed. To have a realistic behavior of these models a set of constraints has been defined and imposed on the model parameters as well as model fluxes and states in a comparative fashion. After simulations with these models, it is observed that even without calibration and just by constraining, the complex model was able to simulate discharge within an acceptable range. Moreover, without the constraints the complex model shows higher parity with observation compared to the simple model. To refine this method even more, a simple parameter search strategy is proposed to satisfy all imposed constraints (chapters 3, 4 and 5). The fact that adding proper constraints can have such a positive impact on the accuracy of the outcome is the basis for further research into the structural elements and type of constraints imposed on the model. However to study the effect of structural changes in a model, the dominant effect of assumptions on state-discharge relations (parameterizations) had to be diminished. To achieve this, weak parameterization was introduced building on the concept of random functions. Using weak parameterization, it was found that structural complexity can improve themodel’s correspondence with observed data significantly. It was also found that there is a balance between model complexity, imposed constraints and performance of the model. Although increased complexity of a model can improve its performance, an over-constrained model can deviate from observed data. This means that, although a complex model may be structurally more favorable, the constraints, based on expert knowledge, should be set-up in such a way as to minimize the bias of the model outcome. This research can be a basis for the dialog between modelers and experimentalists. This approach can be used to investigate the behavior of the model in relation to its structural configuration, parameterizations and the set of imposed constraints (chapter 6). The last part of this thesis (chapter 7) covers the introduction of the concept of time consistent model parameters. Traditionally a part of the time series is kept for a separate evaluation of the model. However, during so-called SubPeriod calibration (SuPer calibration), parameter sets are evaluated based on their resulting model performance for different sub-periods of the entire observed time series. The parameter sets identified by SuPer calibration are different from the optimal parameter set found by calibration over the same period of data. This thesis concludes with a critical review of this research work together with discussions that took place during the research (chapter 8). This chapter is reflecting the novelty and deficiency of presented work and the battles to be fought in future. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
