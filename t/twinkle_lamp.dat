60|$|But yet--yet {{she remembered}} that the open sky was no blue vault, no dark dome hung with many <b>twinkling</b> <b>lamps,</b> but a space where stars were {{wheeling}} in freedom, with freedom above them always higher.|$|R
50|$|Lakshmi Puja, or {{the worship}} of the goddess of wealth, is the main event of Diwali in North and West India. It is popularly {{believed}} that Lakshmi likes cleanliness and will visit the cleanest house first. Hence, the broom is worshiped with offerings of haldi (turmeric) and sindoor (vermilion) on this day. Lamps are lit in the evening to welcome the goddess as they are believed to light up her path. On this day, a supported light of knowledge is said to dawn upon humanity. This self-enlightenment is expressed through the <b>twinkling</b> <b>lamps</b> that illuminate the abode of the worshippers. It is believed that on this day, the goddess walks through the green fields and loiters through the by-lanes and showers her blessings on mankind for glory and prosperity.|$|R
60|$|Lister got up with {{an effort}} {{and went to the}} pump, which {{presently}} began to throb. The mended engine ran well and the regular splash of water, flung out from the big discharge pipe, drowned the languid rumble of the surf. The hull shook; shadowy figures crossed the beam of light from the furnace, and vanished in the dark. <b>Twinkling</b> <b>lamps</b> threw broken reflections on the water that looked like black silk, lightning flashed in the background, and when the swell broke with phosphorescent sparkles about the wreck Lister marked the height the pale illumination crept up her plates. She would not lift that tide, but the pump was clearing the hold, and he hoped much water was not coming in. If the leakage was not excessive, her bow ought to rise when the next tide flowed.|$|R
60|$|While my {{companion}} was relating these anecdotes, we {{had entered the}} gateway, traversed the exterior courtyard of the convent, and made our way into a great interior court; partly surrounded by cloisters and dormitories, partly by chapels, and having a large fountain in the center. The pile had evidently once been extensive and magnificent; but {{it was for the}} greater part in ruins. By the light of the stars, and of <b>twinkling</b> <b>lamps</b> placed here and there in the chapels and corridors, I could see that many of the columns and arches were broken; the walls were rent and riven; white burned beams and rafters showed the destructive effects of fire. The whole place had a desolate air; the night breeze rustled through grass and weeds flaunting out of the crevices of the walls, or from the shattered columns; the bat flitted about the vaulted passages, and the owl hooted from the ruined belfry. Never was any scene more completely fitted for a ghost story.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the grass}} {{all around them}} became brilliantly lighted, {{as if from a}} {{thousand}} tiny electric <b>lamps.</b> <b>Twinkle</b> looked closely, and saw that a vast number of fireflies had formed a circle around them, and were illuminating the scene of the ball.|$|R
60|$|We went on deck, {{where one}} of the gentle beings of our party {{declared}} that she would remain as long as Genoa was in sight; and to tell the truth, the scene was worthy of the promised devotion. There, in a half-circle before us, blazed the lights of the quay; above these <b>twinkled</b> the <b>lamps</b> of the steep streets and climbing palaces; over and behind all hung the darkness on the heights,--a sable cloud dotted with ruddy points of flame burning in the windows of invisible houses.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a happy}} {{thought to}} build the Hudson river {{railroad}} right along the shore. The grade is already made by nature; you are sure of ventilation one side--and you are in nobody's way. I see, hear, the locomotives and cars, rumbling, roaring, flaming, smoking, constantly, away off there, night and day--less than a mile distant, and in full view by day. I like both sight and sound. Express trains thunder and lighten along; of freight trains, most of them very long, there cannot be {{less than a hundred}} a day. At night far down you see the headlight approaching, coming steadily on like a meteor. The river at night has its special character-beauties. The shad fishermen go forth in their boats and pay out their nets--one sitting forward, rowing, and one standing up aft dropping it properly-marking the line with little floats bearing candles, conveying, as they glide over the water, an indescribable sentiment and doubled brightness. I like to watch the tows at night, too, with their <b>twinkling</b> <b>lamps,</b> and hear the husky panting of the steamers; or catch the sloops' and schooners' shadowy forms, like phantoms, white, silent, indefinite, out there. Then the Hudson of a clear moonlight night.|$|R
60|$|From the pavilion, whence {{the paths}} radiated, there came {{the strains of}} the band of the Foot Guards, and by the many-coloured <b>lamps</b> <b>twinkling</b> from every tree Sir Charles could see the {{confused}} whirl of the dancers. Suddenly the music stopped. The quadrilles were at an end.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I like to {{have our}} light shine out in the evening, for the road is dark and lonely just here, and the <b>twinkle</b> of our <b>lamp</b> is {{pleasant}} to people's eyes as they go by. We can do so little for our neighbours, I am glad to cheer the way for them. Now put these poor old shoes to dry, and go to bed, dearie; I'll come soon.' ...|$|R
60|$|When evening came Kit {{entered the}} arcade {{and sat down}} in a quiet spot to look about. The moon was nearly full and flooded half the patio with silver light; the rest was in shadow and rows of colored <b>lamps</b> <b>twinkled</b> in the gloom. A band played behind the pillars, the rattle of {{castanets}} breaking in on the tinkle of the guitars when the beat was sharply marked. The music was seductive, unlike any Kit had heard in England, and he thought it tinged by the melancholy the Moors had brought, long since, from the East to Spain.|$|R
60|$|Kim {{watched the}} last dusty {{sunshine}} fade {{out of the}} court, and played with his ghost-dagger and rosary. The clamour of Benares, oldest of all earth's cities awake before the Gods, day and night, beat round the walls as the sea's roar round a breakwater. Now and again, a Jain priest crossed the court, with some small offering to the images, and swept the path about him lest by chance he should take {{the life of a}} living thing. A <b>lamp</b> <b>twinkled,</b> and there followed the sound of a prayer. Kim watched the stars as they rose one after another in the still, sticky dark, till he fell asleep {{at the foot of the}} altar. That night he dreamed in Hindustani, with never an English word...|$|R
60|$|On a clear frosty evening, a {{few days}} before the festival of Christmas, Stoner stood in a corner of the orchard which {{commanded}} a wide view of the countryside. Here and there he could see the <b>twinkling</b> dots of <b>lamp</b> or candle glow which told of human homes where the goodwill and jollity of the season held their sway. Behind him lay the grim, silent farm-house, where no one ever laughed, where even a quarrel would have seemed cheerful. As he turned to look at the long grey front of the gloom-shadowed building, a door opened and old George came hurriedly forth. Stoner heard his adopted name called in a tone of strained anxiety. Instantly he knew that something untoward had happened, and with a quick revulsion of outlook his sanctuary became in his eyes a place of peace and contentment, from which he dreaded to be driven.|$|R
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} nearly nine at night; he had eaten nothing since lunch, he had drunk a good deal, {{and he was}} {{exhausted}} by emotion, when the thought of Houston came into his head. He turned, not merely to the man as a friend, but to his house {{as a place of}} refuge. The danger that threatened him was still so vague, that he knew neither what to fear nor where he might expect it; but this much at least seemed undeniable, that a private house was safer than a public inn. Moved by these counsels, he turned at once to the Caledonian Station, passed (not without alarm) into the bright lights of the approach, redeemed his portmanteau from the cloak-room, and was soon whirling in a cab along the Glasgow road. The change of movement and position, the sight of the <b>lamps</b> <b>twinkling</b> to the rear, and the smell of damp and mould and rotten straw which clung about the vehicle, wrought in him strange alternations of lucidity and mortal giddiness.|$|R
6000|$|Yielding {{at last to}} {{the blows}} of the battering-beam, the great portals had flown open with a crash, and now through them poured the mob. On they came with a rush and a roar, {{like that of the}} sea {{breaking}} through a dyke, carrying in their hands torches, lanterns hung on poles, axes, swords and staves, till at length they reached the screen of wonderful carved oak, on the top of which, rising to a height of sixty feet above the floor of the church, stood the great Rood, with the images of the Virgin and St. John on either side. Here, of a sudden, the vastness and the silence of the holy place which they had known, every one, from childhood, with its echoing aisles, the moonlit, pictured windows, its consecrated <b>lamps</b> <b>twinkling</b> here and there like fisher lights upon the darkling waters, seemed to take hold of them. As {{at the sound of the}} Voice Divine sweeping down the wild waves at night, the winds ceased their raving and the seas were still, so now, beneath the silent reproach of the effigy of the White Christ standing with uplifted hand above the altar, hanging thorn-crowned upon the Rood, kneeling agonised within the Garden, seated at the Holy Supper, on His lips the New Commandment, [...] "As I have loved you, so ye also love one another," [...] their passions flickered down and their wrath slept.|$|R
