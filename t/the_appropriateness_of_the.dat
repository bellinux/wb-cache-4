The episode features seven cover versions of songs, each of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the series' one-week debut high in the US. Critics disagreed over <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musical performances, with some complaining of the tangential relationship between the numbers and religion, and others appreciating that the Glee versions brought new meaning to the songs.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{to the notion of}} the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of amae plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of the Strange Situation procedure where amae is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory. Most recently a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.|$|E

Saldías pointed out that, since there was no act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record of date of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes, the date of 24 January 1544, specified in the title of encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro, another conquistador, was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu. The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—There is {{a rising}} concern among parents that mobile {{advertisements}} may contain violent and sexual content {{even when the}} app itself is safe for children. Because mobile advertisements are not controlled by <b>the</b> content rating <b>of</b> apps, unexpected objectionable contents may occur and be harmful to children’s mental health. This study {{is the first to}} explore <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements on mobile devices from children’s online safety perspective. We find in-app advertisements are common in the free apps designed for children on smart platforms. Experimental results show that a large percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements carry inappropriate contents for children. Unfortunately, neither mobile platforms nor advertising networks provide maturity policies to restrict <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements. This research suggests that these challenges cannot easily be tackled by one entity. Instead, advertisement providers, advertising networks, app developers, and mobile platforms should collaborate in developing policies and mechanisms to monitor <b>the</b> content <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-app advertisements. Keywords-children safety; Android apps; iOS apps; applications (apps); maturity rating; mobile advertisement (ad); in-app advertisement (ad); advertising network I...|$|R

25|$|Ever since, the {{definition}} of the canon has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules {{for the use of the}} Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail.

The school took up the issue after researching high schools and colleges around the U.S. with similar nicknames that had decided to change their mascots. Many of these schools had received complaints from Native American groups about the stereotypes that the mascots reinforced. The student council also discussed rumors that New Jersey would be banning Native American-related mascots, and eventually it was decided that taking up the issue by choice rather than force {{was the right thing to}} do. After months of public debate and an official symposium in which students voiced opinions from both sides of the issue, a vote was held among the students and faculty and the motion to keep the Indian was affirmed, 67% voting in favor of keeping the mascot.|$|E
25|$|Amid {{political}} controversy, in April 2007 the Government of Estonia started final {{preparations for}} the relocation of the statue and reburial of the associated remains, according to the political mandate received from the previous elections (held in March 2007). Disagreement over <b>the</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action led to mass protests and riots (accompanied by looting), lasting for two nights, the worst in Estonia since the Soviet reoccupation in 1944. During the riots, one Russian rioter was killed. In {{the early morning hours}} of April 27, 2007, after the first night's rioting, the Government of Estonia decided, at an emergency meeting, to relocate the monument immediately, referring to security concerns. By the following afternoon the stone structure had been dismantled as well. As of the afternoon of April 30, the statue without the stone structure had been placed at the Cemetery of the Estonian Defence Forces in Tallinn. An opening ceremony for the relocated statue was held on May 8, VE Day. (Soviet Army veterans celebrate Victory Day a day later, on May 9.) During June 2007 the stone structure was rebuilt. Relatives have made claims to bodies of four of the war dead. Unclaimed remains were reburied at the military cemetery, next to the relocated monument, on July 3, 2007.|$|E

500|$|The {{pastoral}} interlude {{that follows}} {{begins with the}} short instrumental movement, the Pifa, which {{takes its name from}} the shepherd-bagpipers, or pifferari, who played their pipes in the streets of Rome at Christmas time. Handel wrote the movement in both 11-bar and extended 32-bar forms; according to Burrows, either will work in performance. The group of four short recitatives which follow it introduce the soprano soloist—although often the earlier aria [...] "But who may abide" [...] is sung by the soprano in its transposed G minor form. The final [...] recitative of this section is in D major and heralds the affirmative chorus [...] "Glory to God". The remainder of Part I is largely carried by the soprano in B flat, in what Burrows terms a rare instance of tonal stability. The aria [...] "He shall feed his flock" [...] underwent several transformations by Handel, appearing at different times as a recitative, an alto aria and a duet for alto and soprano before the original soprano version was restored in 1754. [...] <b>The</b> <b>appropriateness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian source material for the setting of the solemn concluding chorus [...] "His yoke is easy" [...] has been questioned by the music scholar Sedley Taylor, who calls it [...] "a piece of word-painting... grieviously out of place", though he concedes that the four-part choral conclusion is a stroke of genius that combines beauty with dignity.|$|E
