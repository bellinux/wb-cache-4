5|$|Shortly after birth, Bertram {{declares}} {{war with}} Stewie for {{control over the}} playground. They confront {{each other in the}} playground with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> actually for a young tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} mature deciduous or mixed woodland with large, old trees, preferably oak. Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If {{the entrance to}} <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> too large, the female plasters it with mud to reduce its size, and often coats {{the inside of the}} cavity too. The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E

25|$|Cin'aq (Yukon, Hooper Bay and Chevak, Lake Iliamna, and Nunivak) is cheese-like fish aged in a pit. This fish {{is usually}} dog (chum) or king (chinook) salmon. The salmon whole (except the guts) aged {{through the process}} of burying them into the marshy, muddy lowland (maraq). <b>The</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> dug until the {{permafrost}} is exposed. The bottom of <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> then covered with dry grass, moss, and cardboard. Then several salmon are placed in. The top of the salmon is again covered with grass, moss and or cardboard, then the remaining dug up groung is placed back into the hole, tightly covering the contents. The aged salmon fish are usually dug out during the early winter, and eaten as a delicacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} is to form a {{cylindrical}} hole through these layers. In practice, a 128Gibit V-NAND chip with 24 layers of memory cells requires about 2.9 billion such holes.

25|$|An {{approximate}} {{realization of}} a black surface is {{a hole in the}} wall of a large enclosure.

25|$|Most modern solid-carbide bits {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a spot drill bit or a center drill bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> drilled.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the car had}} one difference, {{which was}} focused on the rear {{so-called}} 'double-decker diffuser'. The diffuser is {{at the rear of the}} car and is a route to get downforce by using the airflow under the car's floor. The BGP 001 had a different central channel to its diffuser with the shape of the structure being used to create advanced type of double-decker design. The diffuser's controversial aspect was the hole in the rear which increases the speed of airflow as it heads towards the higher rear venturi section, where it expands and creates more downforce. Other teams argued that the presence of <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> against the regulations.|$|E
25|$|Scramble: {{also known}} as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and no closer to the hole), and the {{procedure}} is repeated until <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score.|$|E

30|$|As it is {{depicted}} in Figs.  1, 2, 3 and 4, all graphs of the prepared samples with magnification ratio of 500 are porous and larger masses (granules) are created due to joining of powder particles together. After sintering of <b>the</b> particles, more <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> observed and since <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> smaller, <b>the</b> porosity decreases too. The study of pictures shows that the average size of granules and <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> about 100 and 30  μm, respectively.|$|R
25|$|Mating {{behaviour}} {{is similar}} to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this {{does not seem to}} benefit hatchlings. After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line, where she digs a hole 11-22 inches in depth with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. <b>The</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> then covered up again. Clutch size ranges between 85 and 200, depending on the age of the female. This process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. After the nest is completely covered, she returns to the sea. The female will do this 3 to 5 times in one season.|$|E
25|$|Suppose {{the cavity}} is {{held at a}} fixed {{temperature}} T and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at thermal equilibrium with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> small, radiation passing {{in and out of}} the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate black-body radiation that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature T and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole. See the figure in the Introduction for the spectrum as a function of the frequency of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation E=hf, with E = energy, h = Planck's constant, f = frequency.|$|E
25|$|The four {{fingers of}} the left hand can each be used {{in at least two}} {{different}} positions, three {{in the case of the}} index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E4. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> open. The middle finger typically stays on the centre hole on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E4 and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a Polisi Artist bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C1. The upper key is used for E1, E3, F3, F3, A4, B4, B4, C4, C4, and D4.|$|E

500|$|It {{was noted}} that the game, like {{previous}} titles in the series, refers to the film Jacob's Ladder (1990) and that the protagonist Henry Townshend shares a likeness to actor Peter Krause.

Other nods includes the novel Rosemary's Baby (1967), American television series Twin Peaks (1990–1991), and American horror author Stephen King. The creators of the game have acknowledged writer Ryū Murakami's book Coin Locker Babies (1980) as an inspiration for the game's premise.|$|E
