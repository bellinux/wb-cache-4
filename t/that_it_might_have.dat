5|$|As Threni was {{intended}} for concert rather than liturgical use, Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters of the Book of Lamentations. It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones. Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942, and Stravinsky acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> influenced him. He considered it less likely that works by Renaissance composers, including Tallis, Byrd and Palestrina, had influenced him, although he had studied such music.|$|E
5|$|The 1893–94 {{season was}} the 13th season of {{competitive}} association football and second {{season in the}} Football League played by Small Heath F.C., an English football club based in Birmingham. In 1892–93, the inaugural season of the Football League Second Division, Small Heath had won the divisional championship but failed to gain promotion via the test match system. This year, they finished as distant runners-up in the League, eight points behind Liverpool, but were successful in the test match, defeating Darwen 3–1 to confirm {{their place in the}} First Division for the 1894–95 Football League season. The club struggled financially during the season, and there were suggestions <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> disbanded had promotion not been secured.|$|E

In their first season in the First Division, they finished in 12th place in the 16-team division, thus avoiding the possibility of relegation via the test matches.|$|E

5|$|The dacite volcanics {{composing}} Mount Fee contain brown {{volcanic glass}} {{as much as}} 70% and vesicular textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including plagioclase, hornblende, orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass, but rather composed of an abnormal cryptocrystalline matrix. This indicates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> developed {{as part of a}} subvolcanic intrusion.|$|E
5|$|Sedna has an {{exceptionally}} long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 {{years to complete}} and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to informally {{refer to it as}} the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was captured from another star system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{remastering}} {{work was}} outsourced to the Shanghai-based studio Virtuos. Square Enix's internal staff was responsible for reassembling the original assets, and helped with a part of redoing the high-definition data. Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama, Yusuke Naora, Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production. X-2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games. The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng. The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware. The loss and repair {{of some of the}} original assets posed another hurdle, with Kitase commenting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been easier to recreate the data from the ground up.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{release in}} Japan, the game entered {{the top ten}} best-selling titles of the week at #3, with 21,445 units sold. It had a {{sell-through}} rate of just over 48%. The following week, it had dropped to #8, selling a further 8,436 units. By {{the end of the}} year, it was among the top 1000 best-selling games of 2011, with total sales of 46,834 units. At its debut in the United Kingdom, it performed poorly, reaching only #38 in the charts. According to Xseed, the game's sales in North America were favorable, although they were not on the same level as The Last Story. In an interview, Xseed said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> done better if it had been released in the 2012 holiday season.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the jockey {{creature}} was not explored in the film, but Scott later theorized <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the ship's pilot, and that the ship {{might have been a}} weapons-carrier capable of dropping alien eggs onto a planet so that the aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts. In early versions of the script, the eggs were to be located in a separate pyramid structure which would be found later by the Nostromo crew and would contain statues and hieroglyphs depicting the alien reproductive cycle, contrasting the human, alien, and space jockey cultures. Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to make the film shorter. Instead, the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space-jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair were removed and the set was re-dressed to create the egg chamber. Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band The Who. The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show on the sound-stage next door.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Greeks {{relied upon}} the herb silphium as an {{abortifacient}} and contraceptive. The plant, {{as the chief}} export of Cyrene, was driven to extinction, but it is suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> possessed the same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the Apiaceae family. Silphium was so central to the Cyrenian economy that most of its coins were embossed with {{an image of the}} plant.|$|E

Menéndez Pidal argued that the coin was issued between 1033 and 1035, after Sancho's conquest of León, but P.
