5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller entered {{the game to}} guide the Hokies' offense. The first play of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards. Two more runs by Oxendine failed to gain a first down, however, and Virginia Tech punted. Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the kick to the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out the clock. Tennessee failed to gain a first down, and the resulting punt rolled {{into the end zone}} for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas City Chiefs {{credited}} {{their defense}} with the win after holding the Buccaneers to 14 yards rushing. The Buccaneers managed only 2 first downs and 34 yards of total offense before exploding for three {{touchdowns in the}} final ten minutes. The Buccaneers were mistake-prone and ineffective throughout the first three quarters. Ken Stone was penalized for roughing on a missed field goal in the first quarter, {{with the result that}} the Chiefs got a second chance to kick it. The special teams allowed Henry Marshall to return a punt 59 yards, setting up the Chiefs’ second touchdown. They got 14 first downs and 162 yards in the final 15 minutes, scoring on an Essex Johnson run and passes from Steve Spurrier to Johnny McKay and Jack Novak. Coach McKay felt that the difference was that the team did not begin giving effort until the fourth quarter. McKay also felt that the Chiefs left themselves vulnerable by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> up the score. Bert Cooper, filling in at linebacker for an injured Steve Reese, was consistently exploited in the passing game. McKay later threatened to fire players who he felt were giving a slack effort, specifically referring to a Chiefs kickoff that rolled {{all the way to the}} 4-yard line, with no Buccaneers trying to recover it. Spectators booed the team, and one threw a dead bird at Spurrier as he returned to the locker room after the game. Buccaneer defenders found some consolation in having held the AFC’s top offensive team to only 13 points. Defensive end Council Rudolph played, despite the death of his father the previous evening.|$|E

He made no contact with the ball and it did not hit the stumps.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} some hostility between players and management, {{not the least}} of which came to a head when Carmine Isacco was sent home by the team for no {{apparent}} reason. Speculation was that management was unhappy with how much they were paying him, and were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> him out of town. While not public, there was a series of disturbing occurrences behind the scenes that reinforce that speculation.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, Crystal Gail Mangum, {{a student}} at North Carolina Central University, had been working {{part-time}} for about two months as a stripper. Although Mangum claimed that she had only recently taken up stripping, she had actually worked at strip clubs as early as 2002: When she was arrested that year for stealing a taxi and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> over a police officer, the incident report stated {{that she had been}} lap dancing at a strip club that evening.|$|E

25|$|Jesse's {{death in}} the unrated cut is much more gruesome.

(Early copies of the Blu-ray release were missing some scenes from the Unrated Cut and played the Theatrical version scenes in their place, 20th Century Fox quietly fixed the issue and later copies contain the full Unrated Cut).|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} unarmed people were {{shot in the}} back while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away - {{including}} a 7-year old girl, who died as a result. An ACLU report declared it a massacre and it has since been known as the Ponce Massacre. The march had been organized to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873, and to protest the incarceration by the U.S. government of nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. Soon thereafter, the Puerto Rican government arrested the leadership of the Nationalist party, including Pedro Albizu Campos. In two trials, they were convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government of the United States.|$|E

25|$|Then things {{fell apart}} for Tennessee. Backed {{up at their}} own 11-yard line by a Shane Lechler punt and simply <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out the clock, running back Robert Holcombe fumbled the ball while being tackled by Raiders linebacker Eric Barton, and {{defensive}} back Anthony Dorsett, Holcombe's old teammate {{who was a member}} of the Titans when they reached Super Bowl XXXIV, recovered the ball at the Tennessee 16-yard line. On the next play, Rice caught a 15-yard reception at the 1-yard line, and then Gannon found Doug Jolley in the back of the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown pass, giving the Raiders a 21–17 lead. Then on the ensuing kickoff, rookie returner John Simon was stripped of the ball by Tim Johnson and Alvis Whitted recovered the fumble for Oakland on the Titans 39-yard line, setting up a 43-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski on the last play of the first half, making the score 24-17.|$|E
25|$|The {{team won}} their first game in 1953, against Murray State, and lost the {{rest for a}} record of 1–7. One {{of the most memorable}} games of the season came in a 59–6 loss against Tennessee. Unitas {{completed}} 9 of 19 passes for 73 yards, rushed 9 times for 52 yards, returned 6 kickoffs for eighty-five yards, 1 punt for three yards, and had 86 percent of the team's tackles. The only touchdown the team scored was in the fourth quarter when Unitas made a fake pitch to the running back and ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown. Unitas was hurt later in the fourth quarter while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the ball. On his way off the field, he received a standing ovation. When he got to the locker room he was so worn that his jersey and shoulder pads had to be cut off because he could not lift his arms. Louisville ended the season with a 20–13 loss to Eastern Kentucky. In his junior year, Unitas completed 49 of 95 passes for 470 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Washington drove into the Bears red zone and sent their special teams unit to attempt a 35-yard field goal. Backup quarterback Jay Schroeder, who was the holder on the play, called an audible for a fake field goal, but due the roaring crowd at Soldier Field, his {{receivers}} didn't hear the call. As a result, he {{had no one to}} throw to after the snap, and slipped on the 25-yard line while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for a first down. Chicago then took over and drove to the Washington 14-yard line. But with just over nine minutes left in the game, McMahon's pass was intercepted by Barry Wilburn in the end zone. Later on, McMahon was intercepted again, this time by Dennis Woodberry at the Chicago 43. Three plays later, Washington attempted to put the game away with a quarterback sneak on fourth and inches, but Williams was stopped short with 1:13 left, giving the Bears one last chance to drive for a winning score. However, the Redskins defense again rose to the occasion, forcing Walter Payton out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker on fourth down and 8.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the FA, people in football criticised them. Bob Paisley, for example, said: [...] "People who don't know how to run the country are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> football, which they know even less about".

500|$|Sebenico {{took part}} in an {{international}} naval demonstration off Crete in 1897 {{during a period of}} tension between Greece and the Ottoman Empire that culminated in the Greco-Turkish War. The Austro-Hungarian contingent, which also included the ironclad , the armored cruiser , the torpedo cruisers [...] and , three destroyers, and eight torpedo boats, was the third largest squadron {{to take part in the}} demonstration, after the British and Italian fleets. Sebenico and the rest of the squadron arrived off Crete on 3 February. On 17 March, Sebenico intercepted and sank a Greek schooner <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the blockade off the island of Dia. Austria-Hungary, displeased with the settlement that left Crete with a Greek ruler but nominally under Turkish control, withdrew its ships in March 1898, before the other members of the international fleet. Sebenico remained in service until 4 May, when she was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
