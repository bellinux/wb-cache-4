Before {{the release of the}} song, Banks described the single as giving [...] "Detroit house vibes with major Diana Ross teas". Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham compared the song to that of Banks' work on her debut album, in the sense <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>contain</b> [...] "fast, aggressive rap verses over a dancefloor-ready electronic beat and a sing-song bridge", although did not clarify whether this was good or bad. Gregory Adams from Exclaim! thought that the track [...] "fit with various early '90s house sounds, from club synths to a jazzed-up digi-hi-hat beat", and went on to describe the song's lyrics as [...] "maintaining the precarious balance between staying true to the streets while popping up on magazine covers". D-Money from Soul Bounce was enthusiastic in his review, writing [...] "'The Big Big Beat' comes out of the gate swinging with a fat, squelchy synth bass intro and a vocal sample. 'Guess who up in this b***h,' Azealia begins, bringing the swing of programmed drums and hi-hats along with her as the groove kicks up the bpm and the party really gets started. She continues flipping her usual boastful rhymes that hit as hard as the kick drum thumps, then things smooth out just a bit as AB flexes her vocals on the chorus". Ione Gamble of Dazed noted Banks' use of softer vocals on the single, compared to that of her previous work, while Brennan Carley of Spin described the song's instrumental work as [...] "glittery synthesizers", alluding that Banks had returned [...] "swinging and vogueing" [...] on the song.|$|E

50|$|A {{central part}} of Monahan’s sculptural {{practice}} is his evocation of museo-logical systems of display <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>contain</b> and morph into the figures that they hold. Composed of raw pieces of drywall, plate glass, wood, and perforated metal, these improvised vitrines and plinths speak as much to Minimalist forms as they do to museum practices. They are the makeshift containers of Monahan’s museum without walls, the equally provisional containers of his cabinet of curiosities. In the end, these glass vitrines take on another more poetic quality. They present themselves less as museum furniture and more as space capsules conveying time travellers that have been frozen in suspended animation somewhere between yesterday and tomorrow. Caught in this chronotopic amber, Monahan’s figures are at once iconic survivors of some long-gone imaginary world and iconoclastic forays {{into the history of}} sculptural figuration.|$|E
50|$|The Guidelines shares {{similarities}} {{with the}} 1900 Prussian Instructions for the Directors in <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>contain</b> clauses for needing consent and for subjects who are underage. The Nuremberg Code would also later specify {{a requirement for}} informed consent, and contains other additional similarities to the Guidelines - for instance, both require risk to be balanced out by potential benefits, and both discourage the use of human experimentation if other means of obtaining the desired results are available. While the two are similar, the Guidelines contain more clauses and requirements regarding human experimentation. For example, the Guidelines also necessitate {{the creation of a}} report detailing the purpose and justification of the experiment. Ravindra Ghooi was critical of the Nuremberg Code, arguing that it bears too strong of a resemblance to the 1931 Guidelines to pass as coincidence, and that the 1931 Guidelines must have been used as reference in creating the Code. However, the Nuremberg Code does contain stipulations not found in the Guidelines - the clause requiring subjects be given the freedom to leave the experiment at any time is one such example.|$|E

30|$|One {{important}} point {{of our work}} is that it contributes {{to the understanding of}} the complex colour chemistry of tesserae. Their crystal colour may or may not be influenced by the opacifier presence, which colour in turn may be influenced by the presence of cations introduced through ionic exchanges in the host structure at firing temperatures and the cations presence within the glass matrix. For instance we determined with ADT tomography in green and yellow colour tesserae <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>contain</b> cubic structure (Fd- 3 m symmetry) Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7 yellow colour opacifier [8]. However the resultant tesserae colours are different as both opacifiers contain different amount of Cu inside the crystal framework and the glass matrix (2 % into the green sample vs 0.01 % into the yellow sample).|$|E
40|$|Advantages and {{disadvantages}} of synthetic soils are discussed. It is pointed out that synthetic soils may provide the proper {{physical and chemical properties}} necessary to maximize plant growth, such as a toxic-free composition and cation exchange capacities.

Zeoponics, or the cultivation of plants in zeolite substrates <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>contain</b> essential plant-growth cations on their exchange sites and have minor amounts of mineral phases and/or anion-exchange resins that supply essential plant growth ions, is discussed. It is suggested that synthetic zeolites at lunar bases could provide adsorption media for separation of various gases, act as catalysts and as molecular sieves, and serve as cation exchangers in sewage-effluent treatment, radioactive-waste disposal, and pollution control.

Our main result is that if G and H are connected graphs of chromatic number at least 5 <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>contain</b> odd wheels as subgraphs, then their product also has chromatic number at least 5. However, we also provide counterexamples to the El-Zahar and Sauer conjecture on the structure of n-chromatic subgraphs of products of n-chromatic graphs.
