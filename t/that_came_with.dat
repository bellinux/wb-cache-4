5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end}} of the canyon where a sharp bend in the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E

The main addition to the first team was goalkeeper Jens Lehmann for £1.5million; striker José Antonio Reyes was later purchased in the winter transfer window. Arsenal retained their best players and successfully negotiated new contracts for captain Patrick Vieira and midfielder Robert Pirès. The stability of the squad meant Arsenal were considered front-runners for the Premier League title, along with Manchester United, and Chelsea who were taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.|$|E
5|$|Carrouges {{was born}} in the late 1330s in the village of Saint-Marguerite-de-Carrouges as the eldest son of knight and minor noble Sir Jean de Carrouges III and his wife Nicole de Buchard. Carrouges III was an {{influential}} man in lower Normandy, being a vassal of the Count of Perche and a veteran soldier in his service. Carrouges III had been rewarded for his long military service in the Hundred Years War with a knighthood and the title of Viscount of Bellême, a rank <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> command of a vital hill castle overlooking the town as well as the role of sheriff in the vicinity, a post carrying significant financial and social rewards.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Georgian {{architecture}} (about 1720–1840) the main architects and builders working in Bristol were James Bridges, John Wallis, and Thomas Paty with his sons John and William Paty. They put up hundreds of new buildings, reflecting the increased prosperity <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the new Floating Harbour and trade based at The Exchange, built in 1741–43 by John Wood the Elder. Their early work included the Royal Fort, Blaise Castle House and Arno's Court estate, with the associated Arno's Court Triumphal Arch and Black Castle Public House. More modest terraces and squares {{grew up in the}} new suburbs such as Hotwells and north into Clifton, including 7 Great George Street, now the Georgian House Museum. It was built around 1790 for John Pinney a successful sugar merchant, and {{is believed to be the}} house where the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge first met. It was also home to Pinney's slave, Pero, after whom Pero's Bridge at Bristol Harbour is named.|$|E

The Broncos' special teams had more luck on kickoff returns. Three players had kickoff returns. Austin Smith returned four kickoffs for 173yards. His 89–yard return for a touchdown in the first quarter was the team's longest of the game and gave Boise State its only lead of the game. Jeremy Avery returned two kicks for 41yards, and Titus Young returned one kick for 52yards.|$|E

5|$|Mounted Muslim warriors conquered North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula {{during the}} 7th and 8th centuries AD {{following}} the Hegira, or Hijra, of Muhammad in 622 AD. By 630 AD, their influence expanded across the Middle East and into western North Africa. By 711 AD, the light cavalry of Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and controlled {{most of the}} Iberian peninsula by 720. Their mounts were of various oriental types, including the North African Barb. A few Arabian horses may have come with the Ummayads who settled in the Guadalquivir valley. Another strain of horse <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> Islamic invaders was the Turkoman horse. Muslim invaders travelled north from nowadays Spain into France, where they were defeated by the Frankish ruler Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD.|$|E

5|$|Rather than become president, Noriega {{preferred}} to remain behind the scenes, {{and avoid the}} public scrutiny <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> the post. He {{did not have a}} particular social or economic ideology, and used military nationalism to unify his supporters. The Partido Revolucionario Democrático (Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD), which had been established by Torrijos, was used by Noriega as a political front for the National Guard. Noriega compelled the Panamanian Congress to pass Law 20, which was supposedly aimed at protecting the Panama Canal from communists, and allowed a huge influx of U.S. weapons to the Panamanian military. The law also tripled the size of the military forces, and gave the National Guard control over immigration, customs, commercial transportation, railroads, and airports. Noriega's period in power saw significant capital flight from Panama; according to Kempe, this was at least in part because wealthy individuals worried their wealth would be seized by Noriega's administration.|$|E

5|$|The new peace {{would only}} last for two years; war recommenced in the {{aftermath}} of John's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoulême. In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, his first wife; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this. It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême. Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the Angoumois lands <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine.|$|E

He took a position among the officers of the county militia, eventually rising to the rank of colonel. In 1748, he sought a seat in the House of Burgesses; the process was controlled by more senior members of the court and he was not then successful, but he would win in 1758.|$|E
40|$|Objectivity versus Proximity In {{this paper}} we {{identify}} the trade-off between objectivity and proximity as {{fundamental to the}} corporate governance debate.

S. system), {{and the value of}} better information <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> proximity (e. g., the more intrusive Continental European model). Our key result is that the optimal arrangement between management and monitor (board or shareholders) should either capitalize on the better information <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> proximity or seek to optimally exploit the objectivity <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> distance. We argue that the asset structure, in particular, the irreversibility of investments, and the opportunity costs associated with resource misallocation critically determine the optimality of the distance- or proximity-based arrangement. We also discuss the ways in which investors have “contracted around ” the flaws in their own corporate governance systems, pointing at th...|$|R
