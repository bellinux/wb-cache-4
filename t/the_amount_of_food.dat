5|$|<b>The</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste {{produced}} by a household and its occupants is affected by several factors; WRAP found the most impacting factors to be: firstly {{the size of the}} household, followed by the age of the individual occupants and finally the household composition (e.g. single occupant household). The other factors: job status, lifestage, ethnicity and occupation grouping of individuals were found to have less correlation between the amount of avoidable waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of non-native plants into its habitat {{is a large}} threat to the bog turtles' survival. Although several plants disrupt its ecosystem, the three primary culprits are purple loosestrife, reed canary grass, and reeds, which grow thick and tall and are believed to hinder {{the movement of the}} turtles. Such plants also out-compete the native species in the bog turtle's habitat, thus reducing <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and protection available to the turtles.|$|E
5|$|The larger workhouses had {{separate}} {{dining rooms}} {{for males and}} females; workhouses without separate dining rooms would stagger the meal times to avoid any contact between the sexes. Rations provided for the indoor staff were {{much the same as}} those for the paupers, although more generous. The master and matron, for instance, received six times <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> given to a pauper.|$|E

5|$|Before the war, the Belgian {{government}} had planned an emergency system of rationing, which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion. The German occupying authority used Belgium's reliance on food imports as a bargaining tool. <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> permitted to Belgian citizens was roughly two-thirds of that allowed to comparable German citizens and was amongst the lowest in occupied Europe. On average, scarcity of food led to a loss of five to seven kilograms of weight per Belgian in 1940 alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the severe agricultural damage, the government initiated a food ration. By {{two months after the}} storm, assistance pledges amounted to over $37 million (1979 US$) from various groups around the world. Similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters, the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and material, or lack thereof, for the affected citizens. The Hurricane destroyed some important landmarks, including {{a significant part of the}} ruins of the Fort Young which had stood since the 1770s.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the food}} thrown away {{could have been avoided}} (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of the total amount of food waste) and with better {{management}} could have been eaten or used. Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) are unaware of <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be throwing away 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E

40|$|While the {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>food</b> security encompasses food availability, access, utilization and stability, most attention {{appears to have}} been on increasing <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> available. Evidence suggests, however, that widespread hunger can exist even in times <b>of</b> increasing <b>food</b> availability. This draws attention to the need to distinguish between household and individual food security. Even though households may have ready access to food supplies, individual food security requires appropriate resources, markets and social networks. Randy Stringe...|$|R
5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged to reduce <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, {{is seen as an}} expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E
5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during {{the peak of the}} breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
5|$|In early February Amundsen began organising the depot-laying {{journeys}} {{across the}} Barrier, {{in preparation for}} the following summer's assault on the pole. Supply depots laid in advance at regular intervals on the projected route would limit <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and fuel that the South Pole party would have to carry. The depot journeys would be the first true tests of equipment, dogs and men. For the first journey, to begin on 10February, Amundsen chose Prestrud, Helmer Hanssen and Johansen to accompany him; 18dogs would pull three sledges. Before leaving, Amundsen left instructions with Nilsen regarding Fram. The ship was to sail to Buenos Aires for reprovisioning, before undertaking a programme of oceanographic work in the Southern Ocean and then returning to the Barrier as early as possible in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Other sectors also {{attribute}} to {{the amounts of}} food waste. The food industry produces large amounts of food waste, with retailers alone generating 1,600,000 tonnes of food waste per year. Supermarkets particularly have been criticised for wasting items which are damaged or unsold (what the industry calls 'surplus food'), but that often remain edible. However, exact statistics for <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> wasted by supermarkets is mostly unavailable; although a few voluntarily release data on food waste, it is not required by law. Similarly, limited information is available on amounts generated by the agricultural sector. Before a reversal of European Union policy in 2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, misshaped or 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could not be sold by retailers and were required to be thrown away.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{construct}} shelter tubes, {{also known}} as earthen tubes or mud tubes, that start from the ground. These shelter tubes {{can be found on}} walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter tubes depends on <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> sources that are available. They range from less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E
5|$|The Hamsa mendicants are {{constantly}} on the move, staying in villages for just one night, in towns {{no more than five}} nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> they eat with the lunar cycle. They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by the Nordic Council of Ministers and its waste prevention group. The background to the project is that waste prevention is the highest priority in the waste hierarchy according to the EU Waste Directive. One other reason is the heavily increasing discussions in society on food waste in general. The project has been focusing on <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste, causes for food waste generation and initiatives to reduce <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste from <b>the</b> retail and wholesale sector.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2000 The feeding {{habitats}} of the Western Arctic bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) {{during summer}} are generally known, but <b>the</b> precise <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> consumed from <b>the</b> eastern Beaufort Sea (EBS) are not known. [Alpha] 13 C and [alpha] 15 N ratios in whale tissues {{were used to}} estimate <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> required from EBS. The feeding strategies of adults and subadults were also compared. For all whales, the [alpha] 13 C values in muscle sampled in fall {{were not significantly different}} from those in the muscle sampled in spring, indicating most <b>food</b> <b>of</b> adults and subadults comes from the Bering/Chukchi seas. The ¹³C data from baleen showed, however, that EBS may be a significant feeding area for subadults. [alpha] 15 N values are significantly different between fall and spring muscle in subadults, suggesting a shift to different prey and/or nutritional stress during winter followed by feeding in EBS in summer...|$|R

5|$|Crocodilian {{teeth are}} adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is {{swallowed}} unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat {{is a fairly}} simple substance to digest. The stomach {{is divided into two}} parts: a muscular gizzard that grinds food, and a digestive chamber where enzymes work on it. The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which {{play a role in the}} mechanical breakdown of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on stored fat between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time. An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> necessary for a lion of the same weight, and can live for half a year without eating.|$|E
5|$|Feeding horses {{was a major}} issue, {{and horse}} fodder was the single largest {{commodity}} shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> they needed to import and stockpile {{before the beginning of}} the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E

30|$|At {{least three}} reasons can be {{mentioned}} for collection and hunting <b>of</b> small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>foods.</b> First, {{data were collected}} on purely wild sources <b>of</b> <b>food</b> (i.e. the semi-wild foods were not considered). Had semi-wild foods been considered, the contribution <b>of</b> wild <b>foods</b> {{would have been much}} higher than what was found from purely wild sources. Second, perhaps most households did not report hunting wild animals due to fear of legal prohibitions. This idea goes in line with a previous study which states that most often in a given survey <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>foods</b> are under-reported perhaps due to hunting forest or bush meat is illegal (Bharucha and Pretty 2010). Third, presently hunting and gathering are perceived as traditionalism and inferiority so that many households might have reserved themselves from fully reporting <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>foods</b> they obtained. By implication if these reasons were removed, <b>the</b> actual <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>foods</b> reported by the households would have been considerably higher than what they reported during the survey and their contribution to alleviating nutritional inadequacies and enhancing resilience too.|$|R
