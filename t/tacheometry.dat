50|$|In western countries, <b>tacheometry</b> is {{primarily}} of historical interest in surveying, as professional measurement nowadays is usually carried out using total stations and recorded using data collectors. Location positions are also determined using GNSS. Traditional methods and instruments {{are still in}} use {{in many areas of}} the world and by users who are not primarily surveyors.|$|E
50|$|Another device used in <b>tacheometry</b> is the {{subtense}} bar. This is a rigid rod, usually of {{a material}} insensitive {{to change in}} temperature such as invar, of fixed length (typically two metres). The subtense bar is mounted on a tripod over the station to which the distance is desired. It is brought to level and a small telescope on the bar enables the bar to be oriented perpendicular {{to the line of}} sight to the angle measuring station.|$|E
50|$|The {{ordinary}} {{methods of}} surveying with a theodolite, chain, and levelling instrument are fairly satisfactory when {{the ground is}} relatively clear of obstructions and not very precipitous, but it becomes extremely cumbersome when the ground is covered with bush, or broken up by ravines. Chain measurements then become slow and liable to considerable error; the levelling, too, is carried on at great disadvantage in point of speed, though without serious loss of accuracy. These difficulties led {{to the introduction of}} <b>tacheometry.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tacheometry</b> ( [...] ; from Greek for [...] "quick measure"), is {{a system}} of rapid surveying, by which the {{horizontal}} and vertical positions of points on the earth's surface relative to one another are determined without using a chain or tape, or a separate levelling instrument.Instead of the pole formerly employed to mark a point, a staff similar to a level staff is used. This is marked with heights from the base or foot, and is graduated according to the form of tacheometer in use.|$|E
50|$|Other {{forms of}} <b>tacheometry</b> in {{surveying}} {{include the use}} of stadia rods with theodolites or plane-table alidades. These use stadia marks on the instrument's reticle to measure the distance between two points on the stadia rod (the stadia interval). This is converted to distance from the instrument to the stadia rod by multiplying the stadia interval by the stadia interval factor. If the stadia rod is not at the same elevation as the instrument, the value must be corrected for the angle of elevation between the instrument and the rod.|$|E
50|$|For exact {{interpretations of}} the {{morphology}} extensive datings, surveying and mapping of marine terraces is applied. This includes stereoscopic aerial photographic interpretation (ca. 1 : 10,000 - 25,000), on-site inspections with topographic maps (ca. 1 : 10,000) and analysis of eroded and accumulated material. Moreover, the exact altitude can be determined with an aneroid barometer or preferably with a levelling instrument mounted on a tripod. It should be measured with the accuracy of 1 cm and at about every 50 - 100 m, depending on the topography. In remote areas technics of photogrammetry and <b>tacheometry</b> can be applied.|$|E
5000|$|Before EDM devices, {{distances}} {{were measured}} {{using a variety}} of means. These included chains with links of a known length such as a Gunter's chain, or measuring tapes made of steel or invar. To measure horizontal distances, these chains or tapes were pulled taut to reduce sagging and slack. The distance had to be adjusted for heat expansion. Attempts to hold the measuring instrument level would also be made. When measuring up a slope, the surveyor might have to [...] "break" [...] (break chain) the measurement- use an increment less than the total length of the chain. Perambulators, or measuring wheels, were used to measure longer distances but not to a high level of accuracy. <b>Tacheometry</b> is the science of measuring distances by measuring the angle between two ends of an object with a known size. It was sometimes used before to the invention of EDM where rough ground made chain measurement impractical.|$|E

40|$|The Global Positioning System {{has been}} the leading {{technology}} for monitoring the movements of points at high data rates (i. e. 1 Hz). Areas of application include the monitoring of operating cranes, bridge and building vibration studies, and the dynamic alignment of structures during construction. In recent years, robotic <b>tacheometry</b> (“total station”) systems have been developed that can track moving points and make observations of angles and distances at rates up to 1 Hz. This paper compares the accuracy and utility of robotic <b>tacheometry</b> systems to that of GPS. Several issues are uncovered that currently limit the practical use of robotic <b>tacheometry</b> systems in kinematic positioning. The two main problems are a) low EDMI accuracy, which is directly correlated to station velocity along the line-of-sight, b) uneven sampling over time {{and the lack of}} observation time-tagging. However, it is also noted that robotic <b>tacheometry</b> systems have the advantage in stop-and-go applications, where they are capable of millimetre level accuracy, compared to centimetre level results when using GPS. 1...|$|E

40|$|First, a short {{comparison}} {{of different types}} of edifices, different types of recording, different instruments and different surveying methods is given. Four surveying methods are taken into account: manual measurement, photogrammetry, <b>tacheometry</b> and scanning. Two of these methods will be described in greater detail, {{due to the fact that}} they are less common: scanning and <b>tacheometry</b> with a totalstation controlled via notebook. On the one hand the methods compete up to a certain amount, on the other particular surveying methods are suited more or less well to detect special qualities of a building or a monument. In reality a certain method is not always used how it fits best for the problem. Which one is chosen depends on the experience of the surveyor or of the equipment available. Quite often there is no single method which alone is a perfect solution, it is rather a combination of different methods that would produce the best results or allow the most rational way of working. In consequence, the question arose whether it would be more effective, cost-reducing and time-saving not only to more often use different surveying methods side by side, but also to achieve a synthesis of different methods and to integrat...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{one method}} of {{surveying}} seldom meets all needs for recording complex shapes and surfaces {{of a historic}} building, a combination of methods (<b>tacheometry,</b> photogrammetry and manual measurements) has often to be used.

Beside the problems of fusion of data from very different origin, the presented example (Crypt Colonia Güell in Barcelona, Spain) shows the limits of 2 D-representation of complex shapes in plans and orthophotos and develops alternatives for a flexible and comprehensive visualization of the final model. ...|$|E
