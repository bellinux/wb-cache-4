5|$|A <b>transitional</b> fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that {{exhibits}} traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a <b>transitional</b> fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that <b>transitional</b> fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Further combat was averted on 12 November {{when the}} Erdut Agreement {{was signed by}} the RSK acting defense {{minister}} Milan Milanović, on instructions received from Slobodan Milošević and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia officials. The agreement stated that the remaining occupied area was {{to be returned to}} Croatia, with a two-year <b>transitional</b> period. The new UN mission was established as the United Nations <b>Transitional</b> Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1037 of 15 January 1996. The agreement guarantees also right of establishment of Joint Council of Municipalities for local Serbian community.|$|E
5|$|His {{place in}} Roman history is {{therefore}} summarized as a necessary, if tumultuous stop-gap before the Trajanic-Antonine dynasties. Even {{the only major}} public work completed during his reign, the Forum of Nerva, ultimately {{became known as the}} Forum Transitorium, or <b>transitional</b> forum.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the <b>Transitional</b> Federal Government re-opened the Central Bank of Somalia in Mogadishu {{as part of}} its {{campaign}} to restore national institutions. The Bank had an additional branch in Baidoa that was already operational with personnel in place.|$|E

5|$|Senior {{officers}} of the army also met {{the leaders of the}} political parties and called on them to form the <b>transitional</b> government, but added that the army would control the defence and interior ministries. The meeting was also attended by: Indjai, who was later arrested; the deputy chief-of-staff General Mamadu Ture Kuruma; the heads of the army, air force and navy; the army's spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Daha Bana na Walna and four colonels; however there was no one from the incumbent PAIGC. Consultations with 23 parliamentary and extra-parliamentary parties discussed issues such as: a <b>transitional</b> government including, an interim president and head of the National Assembly, as well as a PAIGC-nominated prime minister other than the incumbent and a government of national unity inclusive of all parties; and the dissolution of the National Assembly with a government led by the National <b>Transitional</b> Council (NTC) under interim leadership.|$|E
5|$|Somalia, from 1991 to 2006, {{is cited}} as a {{real-world}} example of a stateless society and legal system. Since the fall of Siad Barre's government in January 1991, {{there had been no}} central government in Somalia until the establishment of the <b>Transitional</b> National Government and its successor the <b>Transitional</b> Federal Government. Large areas of the country such as Puntland, Somaliland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. In many areas, there were no formal regulations or licensing requirements for businesses and individuals.|$|E
5|$|The Australian led International Force for East Timor {{restored}} {{order and}} following the departure of Indonesian forces from East Timor, the United Nations <b>Transitional</b> Administration in East Timor administered the territory for two years, establishing a Serious Crimes Unit to investigate and prosecute crimes committed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The NZ ETS {{contains}} special <b>transitional</b> provisions from 1 July 2010 (when fossil emissions {{enter the}} scheme) until 31 December 2012 (transition period). This end date {{coincides with the}} end date of the Kyoto Protocol. Although <b>transitional</b> measures are legislated to end after 2012, the Government has suggested {{that they will be}} extended in the event that major trading partners such as the USA and Australia do not implement emissions trading schemes of their own before then.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Transitional</b> Federal Government (TFG) was the internationally {{recognized}} central government of Somalia between 2004 and 2012. Based in Mogadishu, it constituted {{the executive branch}} of government.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Transitional</b> Programme was {{the central}} {{programmatic}} statement of the congress, summarising its strategic and tactical conceptions for the revolutionary period that it saw opening up {{as a result of}} the war which Trotsky had been predicting for some years. It is not, however, the definitive programme of the Fourth International as is often suggested but instead contains a summation of the conjunctural understanding of the movement at that date and a series of <b>transitional</b> policies designed to develop the struggle for workers' power.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of FBO/Robertson-Cole pictures, produced during either the silent era or the <b>transitional</b> period of the conversion to sound cinema, {{are considered to be}} lost films, with no copies now known to exist. Partly in consequence, many of FBO's star actors are barely remembered today.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} other {{provisions}} of the UN Charter that deal with <b>transitional</b> arrangements, and thus are now spent. For example, article 61(3) and article 109(3). However, In Larger Freedom does not contain any proposals with respect to these provisions.|$|E
5|$|With the ICU in {{a retreat}} for the Kenyan border, <b>Transitional</b> Federal Government forces slowly {{advanced}} towards Kismayo {{to avoid the}} many landmines that had been placed. By 1 January 2007, they had reached Kismayo, which was taken without a fight.|$|E
5|$|A Handful of Dust is a {{novel by}} the British writer Evelyn Waugh. First {{published}} in 1934, it is often grouped with the author's early, satirical comic novels for which he became famous in the pre-World War II years. Commentators have, however, drawn attention to its serious undertones, and have regarded it as a <b>transitional</b> work pointing towards Waugh's Catholic postwar fiction.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} <b>transitional</b> form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, {{and the presence of}} endosymbionts. This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E
5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a <b>transitional</b> form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, <b>transitional</b> fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the <b>transitional</b> anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E
5|$|After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyoncé and Rowland {{founded the}} Survivor Foundation to provide <b>transitional</b> housing for {{victims in the}} Houston area, to which Beyoncé contributed an initial $250,000. The {{foundation}} has since expanded {{to work with other}} charities in the city, and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later.|$|E
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct <b>transitional</b> geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|An {{alcoholic}} and womanizer, Kunichika also portrayed women deemed beautiful (bijinga), contemporary social life, {{and a few}} landscapes and historical scenes. He worked successfully in the Edo period, and carried those traditions into the Meiji period. To his contemporaries and now to some modern art historians, this {{has been seen as}} a significant achievement during a <b>transitional</b> period of great social and political change in Japan's history.|$|E
5|$|Another small-bore cannon of the 14th {{century was}} the culverin, whose name derives from the snake-like handles {{attached}} to it. It was <b>transitional</b> between the handgun and the full cannon, and {{was used as an}} anti-personnel weapon. The culverin was forged of iron and fixed to a wooden stock, and usually placed on a rest for firing.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{prominence}} of the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth and the Hampton VA Medical Center in Hampton, Norfolk has had a strong role in medicine. Norfolk is served by Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, Sentara Leigh Hospital, and Bon Secours DePaul Medical Center. The city {{is also home to}} the Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters and Lake Taylor <b>Transitional</b> Care Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by <b>transitional</b> fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E
5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy {{has been}} so heavily modified for flight, and immediate <b>transitional</b> fossil predecessors have not so far been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been advanced, including links to the avemetatarsalian-like Scleromochlus, an ancestry among the basal archosauriforms, like Euparkeria, or among the protorosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a <b>transitional</b> age in which gods and mortals moved together. These were {{the early days of}} the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1084 and 1504, Worcester Cathedral {{represents}} every medieval style from Norman to Perpendicular. It {{is famous}} for its Norman crypt, and for its circular chapter house, which became the model from which derives the series of uniquely British polygonal chapter houses. Also notable are a series of unusual <b>Transitional</b> Gothic bays, fine woodwork and the central tower, which, though not large, is nevertheless of particularly fine proportions.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1088 and {{the early}} 15th century, the unusual {{features}} of Chichester Cathedral are a <b>Transitional</b> retro choir, a pair of early Norman relief carvings and its freestanding belfry of the 15th century. The spire, rebuilt after its collapse in 1860, {{can be seen from}} the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Crosses, cruces, creases and cree {{were found}} in a broad band across England from crosses in Lincolnshire, cruce or cruces from Oxford through to Gloucester, creases in Berkshire and cree in South Wales and {{both sides of the}} Bristol Channel. There are some areas of scruces, screwsies or screws in Essex and Suffolk. The Opies saw creases as a <b>transitional</b> word.|$|E
5|$|Death {{has always}} been a {{critical}} moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions, people use rites. The ceremonies are <b>transitional</b> rites that are intended to give the deceased peace in his or her new situation {{at the same time as}} they provide strength for the bereaved to carry on with their lives.|$|E
5|$|ISAF was {{initially}} charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban, al Qaeda and factional warlords, {{so as to}} allow for the establishment of the Afghan <b>Transitional</b> Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan, and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, it was {{believed}} the B-1 could be in operation before the ATB, covering the <b>transitional</b> period between the B-52's increasing vulnerability and the ATB's introduction. Reagan decided the best solution was to procure both the B-1 and ATB, and on 2 October 1981 he announced that 100 B-1s were to be ordered to fill the LRCA role.|$|E
