5|$|Further {{extensions}} to {{both the}} east and the west followed in later years after several years of false starts under the administrations of two different governors. Expansion of the highway was finally approved in 1998. <b>The</b> <b>extension</b> to the west, linking the Creek Turnpike to the Turner Turnpike in Sapulpa, opened December 15, 2000. <b>The</b> <b>extension</b> to the east opened in three parts over the course of 2001 and 2002.|$|E
40|$|Parallel {{programs}} should be machine-independent, i. e., independent of properties {{that are likely to}} differ from one parallel computer to <b>the</b> next. <b>Extensions</b> are described of Modula- 2 for writing highly parallel, portable programs meeting these requirements. <b>The</b> <b>extensions</b> are: synchronous and asynchronous forms of forall statement; and control of the allocation of data to processors. Sample programs written with <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> demonstrate <b>the</b> clarity of parallel programs when machine-dependent details are omitted. The principles of efficiently implementing <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> on SIMD, MIMD, and MSIMD machines are discussed. <b>The</b> <b>extensions</b> are small enough to be integrated easily into other imperative languages...|$|R

5|$|However, the {{recession}} of the mid-1990s resulted in Highway 407 being truncated in Markham temporarily. Slightly revised plans for the links appeared on the June 2007 Technically Recommended Route Report for <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> of Highway407 to Highway35/115, which was submitted {{as part of the}} environmental assessment (EA) for <b>the</b> <b>extension,</b> but had been announced earlier that year on March7 by the Government of Canada, as part of an investment in Greater Toronto Area infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, city staff {{reported}} that the estimated cost of <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> will increase by $150 million to $3.35 billion {{in order to build}} a 34-bay bus terminal at Scarborough Town Centre, to be the largest bus terminal on the TTC system. Also, the projection for new riders for <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> has been revised downwards to 2,300 per day, down from the 4,500 new riders estimated in the summer of 2016.|$|E

40|$|Multimedia {{computer}} architecture extensions for Hennessy and Patterson 2 ̆ 7 s DLX architecture are developed following {{the study of}} multimedia applications and existing multimedia architecture <b>extensions.</b> Support for <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> is added to a VHDL superscalar DLX CPU model {{as well as a}} DLX assembler. Key functions used in digital video encoding and decoding are modified to use <b>the</b> <b>extensions,</b> and simulations are undertaken using the VHDL model to determine the speedup offered by <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> for these functions. The results of the simulations are used to calculate the application speedup based on the function speedup and the fraction of the time that each application spends executing each function. It is shown that the superscalar CPU design limits the performance gain offered by <b>the</b> <b>extensions,</b> and concluded that the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>extensions</b> is further limited by the fraction of the application code that can make use of them...|$|R

5|$|On June 9, 2010, the MTO {{approved}} <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> as {{far east}} as Simcoe Street in Oshawa, announcing plans to phase construction of <b>the</b> <b>extension.</b> Local residents and politicians rejected the plan, as had {{happened with the}} section between McCowan Road and Markham Road. A motion was proposed in the Ontario Legislature to build the full extension in one project, but failed to pass. Instead, a compromise was issued on March 10, 2011: the first phase would extend Highway407 to Harmony Road in Oshawa by 2015, including Highway412; the second phase would then complete <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> to Highway35/ 115 by 2020, including Highway418.|$|E

5|$|The ARS had the Blue Line end at Addison Road. However, {{sports fans}} {{continually}} {{argued for a}} three-mile (5km) extension to the Capital Centre sports arena in Largo, Maryland. On February 27, 1997, the WMATA board approved construction of <b>the</b> <b>extension.</b> By the time <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> opened in 2004, professional basketball and hockey had relocated to a new arena atop the Gallery Place Station and the Capital Centre was replaced with a shopping mall. However, <b>the</b> <b>extension</b> still drew considerable sport spectator traffic because it is {{within walking distance of}} the FedExField football stadium. <b>The</b> <b>extension</b> cost $456 million.|$|E
