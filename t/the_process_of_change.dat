Eventually, Sharabha assumed a further fiercer form. In this fierce form he wanted to devour the Rishi.

40|$|This book {{seeks to}} {{understand}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> important <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> {{taking place in}} the ‘New Europe’ in its <b>process</b> <b>of</b> enlarging <b>the</b> circle of states whose shared identity and core values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, makes them a value-based community with some very specific qualities — most notably peaceful and co-operative relations. In its focus on <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in <b>the</b> relations between states, the book is very much located within International Relations. However, a key assumption of the book is that we cannot separate the ‘international’ from the ‘domestic’, and that both form a mutually constitutive relationship. As a result, we must direct our attention at both the ‘international’ and the ‘domestic’, thereby locating the book at the intersection between International Relations, Comparative Politics and Democratization Studies. The assumption is that in our quest for explaining <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> between states in the post-Cold War world, we must also look in more detail at <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> within states, because as suggested by Ian Clark, ‘the change is relational to both rather than particular to either’ (Clark, 1999 : 5) ...|$|R
25|$|Evolution is <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> in {{all forms}} of life over generations, and {{evolutionary}} biology {{is the study of}} how evolution occurs. Biological populations evolve through genetic changes that correspond to changes in the organisms' observable traits. Genetic changes include mutations, which are caused by damage or replication errors in an organism's DNA. As the genetic variation of a population drifts randomly over generations, natural selection gradually leads traits to become more or less common based on the relative reproductive success of organisms with those traits.|$|E
25|$|The CAP {{has always}} been a {{difficult}} area of EU policy to reform; it is a problem that began in the 1960s and one that has continued to the present, albeit less severely. Changes to the CAP are proposed by the European Commission, after a public consultation, which then sends its proposals to the Council and to the European Parliament. Both the Council and the European Parliament have to agree to any changes. The Parliament was involved in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> {{for the first time in}} 2013. The involvement of the Parliament, which represents the citizens, increases the democratic legitimacy of the CAP.

25|$|During the 1960s, {{historians and}} public bodies {{had begun to}} realise the loss to the nation of this destruction. However, <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> was long, {{and it was not}} until 1984 with the {{preservation}} of Calke Abbey that it became obvious that opinion had changed. In the 21st century, the period of change seems cemented. A large public appeal has assured the preservation of Tyntesfield in 2002, and in 2007, Dumfries House and its collection were saved, after protracted appeals and debates. Today, demolition has ceased to be a realistic, or legal, option for listed buildings, and an historic house (particularly one with its contents intact) has become recognized as worthy of retention and preservation. However, many country houses are still at risk and their security, even as an entirety with their contents, is not guaranteed by any legislation.|$|E

60|$|Isolation is {{no doubt}} an {{important}} aid to natural selection, {{as shown by the}} fact that islands so often present a number of peculiar species; and the same thing is seen on the two sides of a great mountain range or on opposite coasts of a continent. The importance of isolation is twofold. In the first place, it leads to a body of individuals of each species being limited in their range and thus subjected to uniform conditions for long spaces of time. Both the direct action of the environment and the natural selection of such varieties only as are suited to the conditions, will, therefore, be able to produce their full effect. In the second place, <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> will not be interfered with by intercrossing with other individuals which are becoming adapted to somewhat different conditions in an adjacent area. But this question of the swamping effects of intercrossing will be considered in another chapter.|$|E

A {{random sample of}} an existing Internet research panel resulted in a cohort of 735 adults, who were examined three times with electronic questionnaires assessing stages <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> and fruit intake. Cross-sectional differences were found for <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> between precontemplation and all further stages.

60|$|We {{fall into}} glib usage of words like {{democracy}} and make fetiches of them without due understanding. Democracy is inferior to autocracy from the aggressively national point of view; {{it is not}} necessarily superior to autocracy as a guarantee of general well-being; it may even turn out to be inferior unless we can improve it. But democracy is the rising tide; it may be dammed or delayed, but cannot be stopped. It seems to be a law in human nature that where, in any corporate society, the idea of self-government sets foot it refuses to take that foot up again. State after State, copying the American example, has adopted the democratic principle; the world's face is that way set. And civilisation is now so of a pattern that the Western world may be looked on as one State and <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> therein from autocracy to democracy regarded as though it were taking place in a single old-time country such as Greece or Rome. If throughout Western civilisation we can secure the single democratic principle of government, its single level of State morality in thought and action, we shall be well on our way to unanimity throughout the world; for even in China and Japan the democratic virus is at work. It is my belief that only in a world thus uniform, and freed from the danger of pounce by autocracies, have States any chance to develop the individual conscience to a point which shall make democracy proof against anarchy and themselves proof against dissolution; and only in such a world can a League of Nations to enforce peace succeed.|$|E
60|$|To {{another of}} this writer's objections--that by Professor Thomson's {{calculations}} the sun {{can only have}} existed in a solid state 500,000,000 of years, and that therefore time would not suffice for the slow process of development of all living organisms--it is hardly necessary to reply, as it cannot be seriously contended, even if this calculation has claims to approximate accuracy, that <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> and development {{may not have been}} sufficiently rapid to have occurred within that period. His objection to the Classification argument is, however, more plausible. The uncertainty of opinion among Naturalists as to which are species and which varieties, is one of Mr. Darwin's very strong arguments that these two names cannot belong to things quite distinct in nature and origin. The Reviewer says that this argument is of no weight, because the works of man present exactly the same phenomena; and he instances patent inventions, and the excessive difficulty of determining whether they are new or old. I accept the analogy though it is a very imperfect one, and maintain that such as it is, it is all in favour of Mr. Darwin's views. For are not all inventions of the same kind directly affiliated to a common ancestor? Are not improved Steam Engines or Clocks the lineal descendants of some existing Steam Engine or Clock? Is there ever a new Creation in Art or Science any more than in Nature? Did ever patentee absolutely originate any complete and entire invention, no portion of which was derived from anything that had been made or described before? It is therefore clear that the difficulty of distinguishing the various classes of inventions which claim to be new, is of the same nature as the difficulty of distinguishing varieties and species, because neither are absolute new creations, but both are alike descendants of pre-existing forms, from which and from each other they differ by varying and often imperceptible degrees. It appears, then, that however plausible this writer's objections may seem, whenever he descends from generalities to any specific statement, his supposed difficulties turn out to be in reality strongly confirmatory of Mr. Darwin's view.|$|E
