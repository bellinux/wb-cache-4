5|$|For a {{short time}} in 1901 Olivia held a {{position}} as a book reviewer for The Kensington Review, a small literary magazine, until it succumbed to poor sales. After, she dabbled in <b>the</b> <b>occult</b> and became friendly with prominent London occultists. In 1902 she co-wrote with Florence Farr — who for a time led the Order of Golden Dawn — two plays on <b>the</b> <b>occult,</b> The Beloved of Hathor and The Shrine of the Golden Hawk, which were subsequently published as a pair.|$|E
50|$|This {{table is}} another {{compilation}} of occultations and transits of bright {{stars and planets}} by solar planets. These events are not visible everywhere <b>the</b> <b>occulting</b> body and <b>the</b> <b>occulted</b> body are above the skyline.

50|$|The {{basic concept}} is that Besselian {{elements}} describe {{the movement of}} the shadow cast by <b>the</b> <b>occulting</b> body - for solar eclipses this is the shadow of the Moon - on a specifically chosen plane, called the fundamental plane. This is the geocentric, normal plane of the shadow axis. In other words, it is the plane through the Earth's center that is perpendicular to the line through the centers of <b>the</b> <b>occulting</b> and <b>the</b> <b>occulted</b> bodies. One advantage, among others, of choosing this plane is that the outline of the shadow on it is always a circle, and there is no perspective distortion.|$|R
2500|$|... where Rs is {{the radius}} of the star, Ro is <b>the</b> <b>occulting</b> object's radius, and r is the {{distance}} from the star to <b>the</b> <b>occulting</b> object. For Earth, on average L is equal to 1.384km, which is much larger than the Moon's semimajor axis of 3.844km. Hence the umbral cone of the Earth can completely envelop the Moon during a lunar eclipse. If <b>the</b> <b>occulting</b> object has an atmosphere, however, some of the luminosity of the star can be refracted into the volume of the umbra. This occurs, for example, during an eclipse of the Moon by the Earthproducing a faint, ruddy illumination of the Moon even at totality.|$|R
5|$|Yeats's mystical inclinations, {{informed}} by Hindu Theosophical beliefs and <b>the</b> <b>occult,</b> provided {{much of the}} basis of his late poetry, which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision (1925).|$|E
5|$|At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, {{one of the}} party's founders and {{a member}} of <b>the</b> <b>occult</b> Thule Society. Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and {{introducing}} him {{to a wide range of}} Munich society. To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP). Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the Order {{stated that it}} was {{entering}} {{the second stage of}} its development, in which it would leave behind its prior focus on recruitment and public outreach within <b>the</b> <b>occult</b> community and that it would instead focus on refining its teachings; its resulting quietness led some occultists to erroneously speculate that the ONA had become defunct.|$|E

Knowing these two locations, combined with the direction to the background object, the two endpoints of the chord can be determined using simple geometry.|$|R

5|$|Himmler was {{interested}} in mysticism and <b>the</b> <b>occult</b> from an early age.

5|$|Olivia met Pound in January 1909 at a Kensington salon {{hosted by}} a friend; she invited him for tea on 16 February 1909, and, at his insistence, {{introduced}} Pound to Yeats in May 1909.

40|$|The present work, {{which is}} based on a {{cooperative}} effort between the Group of Space Solar Physics at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino (OATo), and the AeroSpace Systems Engineering Team (ASSET), at Politecnico di Torino, is part of a wider research program known as "Studies of Solar System Exploration," funded in 2007 by ASI (Italian Space Agency). The request made by OATo was the development of the capability of taking pictures of the solar corona by means of simple and low cost optical components. ASSET developed the concept of a system consisting of two low-cost tethered nanosatellites, <b>the</b> <b>Occulting</b> and <b>the</b> Observing. The research program, which ended in 2010, envisaged both the conceptual design of the system and the development of experimental test-benches to test critical technologies. The following tests were performed in the Aerospace Systems Laboratory: attitude determination and control of <b>the</b> <b>Occulting</b> engineering model on a frictionless table; acquisition and transmission of pictures from the Observing engineering model to the control station; rotation of the Observing engineering model on a frictionless table; translation of the Observing engineering model on a frictionless table; and separation between <b>the</b> <b>Occulting</b> and Observing engineering models.

5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius.

But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions of {{morality}} and ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in <b>the</b> <b>occult</b> is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E

5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by {{touching}} her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of <b>the</b> <b>occult</b> as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E
5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} {{work from the}} war years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches <b>the</b> <b>occult</b> and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present Laughter and his working-class drama This Happy Breed.|$|E

Fortune later claimed that she subsequently came under psychic attack from Mathers, during which she was confronted and assaulted by both real and etheric cats.|$|E
40|$|The unusual flux {{variations}} of the pre-main-sequence binary star KH 15 D {{have been attributed to}} occultations by a circumbinary disk.

We find the model to be successful, after two refinements: a more realistic motion of <b>the</b> <b>occulting</b> feature and a halo around each star that probably represents scattering by <b>the</b> disk. <b>The</b> <b>occulting</b> feature is exceptionally sharp edged, raising the possibility that the dust in the disk has settled into a thin layer and providing a tool for fine-scale mapping of the immediate environment of a T Tauri star.
