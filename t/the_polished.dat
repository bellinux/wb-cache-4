5|$|There are varying tales {{as to the}} {{inspiration}} for Deere to create the invention he is famed for, the steel plow. In one version he recalled the way <b>the</b> <b>polished</b> steel pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that the same effect could be obtained for a plow. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall. Crandall spread word of his success with Deere's plow quickly, and two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841 he was manufacturing 75 plows per year, and 100 plows per year in 1876.|$|E

40|$|Effect of <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane {{vibration}} on large-size optical workpieces {{in continuous}} <b>polishing</b> is studied. <b>The</b> vibration equation was deduced {{based on the}} existence of inclination between <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane and z-axis direction. Influences of different parameters, such as the inclination, rotation speeds of <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane and workpiece, the eccentricity and workpiece radius, on <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane vibration were simulated. The simulations results show that rotation speeds of <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane and workpiece is the most significant factor. The chaotic vibration of <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane increases with increasing rotation speeds differences between <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane and workpiece. When differences are small, periodic ups and downs of <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane occur with <b>the</b> increase of <b>polishing</b> time. Experiments verified the influence of rotation speeds differences on <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane vibration. <b>The</b> vibration affects PV of large-size optical workpieces in continuous polishing...|$|R

25|$|An evocative {{description}} {{exists in}} words from 1867: ″Look at the dapper little fellow, how neatly {{he sits on}} the back of the old American horse, Reporter.

25|$|The GP-B gyro {{consists}} of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for {{a thin layer of}} niobium superconducting material. To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, <b>the</b> <b>polished</b> gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish {{infantry}} was to join <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> army, <b>the</b> reiters were {{to swear}} never {{to fight against}} <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> king, with volunteers also allowed to join <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> army, and <b>the</b> Swedish loot from nearby lands was {{to be returned to}} the owners (this caused some annoyance within <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> army, whose soldiers preferred to continue fighting to take the loot for themselves). Eventually, about 500 reiters and 800 infantry joined <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> army; about 250 reiters left for <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> borders.|$|R

25|$|Numerous other fakes, some of {{very high}} quality, {{circulated}} in Europe and Russia. They were pressed either from real, mass-produced silver coins of the period, or from soft alloys. According to Ivan Spassky, all high-quality fakes of this kind were pressed on {{the same set of}} dies. According to Kalinin, the genuine press dies from the Hermitage are no longer good for minting. During World War II the Hermitage coin collection was evacuated from the city into deep rear. The dies were stored in inappropriately humid conditions that caused corrosion of <b>the</b> <b>polished</b> surfaces. Speckles of rust on the Hermitage dies, according to Kalinin, forever rule out their use (or abuse) for cloning the Constantine ruble.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>polished</b> {{and complex}} {{nature of the}} Aeneid (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are {{generally}} seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Because this poem was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the Aeneid is more complete than most classical epics. Furthermore, {{it is possible to}} debate whether Virgil intended to rewrite and add to such lines. Some of them would be difficult to complete, and in some instances, the brevity of a line increases its dramatic impact (some arguing the violent ending as a typically Virgilian comment on the darker, vengeful side of humanity). However, these arguments may be anachronistic—half-finished lines might equally, to Roman readers, have been a clear indication of an unfinished poem and have added nothing whatsoever to the dramatic effect.|$|E
25|$|A DAC {{consists}} of two opposing diamonds with a sample compressed between <b>the</b> <b>polished</b> culets (tips). Pressure may be monitored using a reference material whose behavior under pressure is known. Common pressure standards include ruby fluorescence, and various structurally simple metals, such as copper or platinum. The uniaxial pressure supplied by the DAC may be transformed into uniform hydrostatic pressure using a pressure-transmitting medium, such as argon, xenon, hydrogen, helium, paraffin oil or a mixture of methanol and ethanol. The pressure-transmitting medium is enclosed by a gasket and the two diamond anvils. The sample can be viewed through the diamonds and illuminated by X-rays and visible light. In this way, X-ray diffraction and fluorescence; optical absorption and photoluminescence; Mössbauer, Raman and Brillouin scattering; positron annihilation and other signals can be measured from materials under high pressure. Magnetic and microwave fields can be applied externally to the cell allowing nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and other magnetic measurements. Attaching electrodes to the sample allows electrical and magnetoelectrical measurements as well as heating up the sample to a few thousand degrees. Much higher temperatures (up to 7000 K) can be achieved with laser-induced heating, and cooling down to millikelvins has been demonstrated.|$|E

500|$|In Utero is {{the third}} and final studio album by American rock band Nirvana, {{released}} on September 21, 1993, by DGC Records. [...] Nirvana intended the record to diverge significantly from <b>the</b> <b>polished</b> production of its previous album, Nevermind (1991). [...] To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired engineer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. [...] The music was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and the song lyrics and album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame.|$|E
500|$|Originally the BBC was {{the sole}} {{producer}} of Persuasion, until it partnered with the American company WGBH Boston and the French company Millesime. This decision gave the production a larger budget and allowed it to be filmed at locations featured in the novel, including Lyme Regis and Bath. Michell believed this was Austen's most emotional and poignant novel, {{as well as her}} most autobiographical. While directing, he avoided what he felt was <b>the</b> <b>polished,</b> artificial feel of other 19th-century depictions, and discouraged his actors from wearing make-up or appearing too hygienic. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne produced clothing that appeared [...] "lived-in", winning a BAFTA for her efforts.|$|E
