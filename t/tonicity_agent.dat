40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop and {{characterize}} an ion-activated in situ gel-forming estradiol (E 2) solution eye drops intended for the prevention of age-related cataracts. Accordingly, in situ gelling eye drops were made using gellan gum as an ion-activated gel-forming polymer, polysorbate- 80 as drug solubilizing agent, mannitol as <b>tonicity</b> <b>agent,</b> and combination of potassium sorbate and edetate disodium dihydrate (EDTA) as preservatives. The formulations were tested for the following characteristics: pH, clarity, osmolality, antimicrobial efficacy, rheological behavior, and in vitro drug release. Stability of the formulation was also monitored for 6 months at multiple storage conditions per ICH Q 1 A (R 2) guidelines. The solution eye drops resulted in an in-situ phase change to gel-state when mixed with simulated tear fluid (STF). The gel structure formation was confirmed by viscoelastic measurements. Drug release from the gel followed non-fickian mechanism with 80 % of drug released in 8 hr. The formulations were found to be clear, isotonic with suitable pH and viscoelastic behavior and stable at accelerated and long-term storage conditions for 6 months. In vitro results suggest that the developed formulation is suitable for further investigation in animal models to elucidate the ability of estrogen to prevent and delay cataracts...|$|E
40|$|This review {{deals with}} the excipients used in various {{lyophilized}} formulations of small molecules. The role of excipients such as bulking <b>agents,</b> buffering <b>agents,</b> <b>tonicity</b> modifiers, antimicrobial <b>agents,</b> surfactants and co-solvents has been discussed. Additionally, a decision making process for their incorporation into the formulation matrix has been proposed. A list of ingredients used in lyophilized formulations marketed in USA has been created based on {{a survey of the}} Physician Desk Reference (PDR) and the Handbook on Injectable Drugs. Information on the recommended quantities of various excipients has also been provided, based on the details given in the Inactive Ingredient Guide (IIG) ...|$|R

These include solubilizers, stabilizers, buffers, <b>tonicity</b> modifiers, bulking <b>agents,</b> viscosity enhancers/reducers, surfactants, chelating agents, and adjuvants.|$|R
40|$|Opthalmic In-situ gels {{refers to}} polymer {{solution}} {{which can be}} administered as liquid and undergoes a phase transition to semisolid gel upon exposure to physiological environment i. e., pH, Temperature, ions in the lachrymal fluid. The poor bioavailability and therapeutic response exhibited by conventional ophthalmic solutions due to rapid precorneal elimination of the drug can be overcome {{by the use of}} in situ gel system that are instilled as drops into the eye and undergo a sol‐gel transition in the cul-de-sac. Fungal keratitis is a serious disease that can lead to loss of vision if not diagnosed and treated effectively. Itraconazole is a triazole compound effective against Fungal keratitis. Because of poor bioavailability of Itraconazole opthalmic solutions, we formulated itraconazole opthalmic in situ gels by pH triggered, ion activation and temperature modulation methods. Total nine formulations have been prepared by using different concentrations of gelling agents i. e., carbopol 934 as pH triggered polymer, sodium alginate as ion activated polymer and poloxamer 407 as temperature triggered polymer. All the formulations contain Hydroxy Propyl Methyl Cellulose (HPMC) as viscosity enhancer, sodium chloride as <b>tonicity</b> adjusting <b>agent,</b> benzalkonium chloride as preservative. All the formulations were evaluated with respect to clarity, pH, gelling capacity, viscosity, drug content and in-vitro drug release. Among all the formulations, F 4 -F 6 containing sodium alginate as gelling agent exhibited maximum drug release of 96. 55 ± 0. 56 % for prolonged period of time upto 8 hrs. These formulations also shown optimum results for all the evaluation parameters. Hence formulations F 4, F 5 and F 6 prepared by ion activation method were selected as optimized formulations. So from the present study, we concluded that the Itraconazole opthalmic in situ gels will be promising approach to overcome the drawbacks of conventional opthalmic solutions.
