5|$|In the meantime, <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> War in Italy {{against the}} Ostrogoths {{had been going}} badly for the Byzantine Empire, with <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> king Totila having wrested most of the {{peninsula}} back from the Byzantine troops. In 549, Emperor Justinian decided to send a major expeditionary force to Italy with Germanus as its head. Soon, however, {{he changed his mind}} and appointed the patricius Liberius instead, before cancelling the expedition altogether.|$|E

50|$|Weinstock's {{interests}} in monsters, ghosts, and vampires are specific manifestations of his broader interest in <b>the</b> American <b>Gothic</b> tradition—an interest that runs throughout his {{body of work}} and is reflected by his research on Edgar Allan Poe, H. P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, and Toni Morrison, among others. Of note in this respect is his 2011 monograph on American Charles Brockden Brown arguing for the late eighteenth-century author's centrality in establishing American variants of four <b>Gothic</b> subgenres: <b>the</b> frontier <b>Gothic,</b> <b>the</b> urban <b>Gothic,</b> <b>the</b> psychological <b>Gothic,</b> and <b>the</b> female <b>Gothic.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1854 William Gibbs {{commissioned}} John Gregory Crace, {{an architect}} {{he was already}} using elsewhere, to redesign and decorate the principal rooms at Tyntesfield. These new designs included gilded panelling, woodwork, moulding and chimneypieces all in <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> style.|$|E
50|$|The present Immanuel Episcopal Church was {{finished}} in Bellows Falls in Vermont in 1869 and {{was designed by}} <b>the</b> renowned <b>Gothic</b> revival architect Richard M. Upjohn. <b>The</b> building's <b>Gothic</b> style would have been typical of 14th-century France. The multi-colored fish scale slate roof is typical of <b>the</b> Victorian <b>Gothic</b> style of architecture.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the house's west wing was demolished, leaving {{it with the}} {{asymmetrical}} appearance it retains today.

5|$|Several {{adaptations of}} Bizenghast have been released, {{including}} {{a novel by}} Shawn Thorgersen, animated episodes, and a tabletop roleplaying game. Critics praised Bizenghast for <b>the</b> <b>gothic</b> atmosphere and art, but noted the traditional elements and varying quality of the series.|$|E
5|$|Several {{churches that}} were {{originally}} built as Romanesque structures were modified or extended during <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> period. Among {{these are the}} cathedral of Hamar, now in ruins, the Stavanger Cathedral, and the renowned Nidaros Cathedral, {{one of the most}} important pilgrim destinations in medieval Europe.|$|E
25|$|Regarded as the {{archetype}} of <b>the</b> classic <b>Gothic</b> style, <b>the</b> cathedral also presents {{some elements of}} <b>the</b> radiant <b>Gothic</b> style and flamboyant <b>Gothic.</b> <b>The</b> speed of construction, barely 70 years for the shell (1220 to 1269), explains this remarkable homogeneity of style. Its façade is decorated with more 3,000 statues, gargoyles and chimeras.|$|R

50|$|Despite its name, Catalan <b>Gothic</b> {{differs from}} <b>the</b> <b>Gothics</b> {{from other parts}} of Europe. In architecture, it does not seek {{excessive}} height, or have highlights in its flying buttresses, and its decoration is sober.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gothic</b> style {{developed}} {{fully in}} the later nineteenth century. Important figures included Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832–98), who adapted <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> style {{for the needs of}} the Free Church of Scotland, as at Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862–64). Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921), trained in the office of leading Gothic Architect George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, where he worked on many small churches, including St James the Less in Leith, Christ Church, Falkirk (1862) and the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh (1876). He also supervised the renovation of Dunblane (1890–93) and Paisley Abbey (1898–1907). Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75), working mainly in Glasgow, began in <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> style, but soon turned toward the ancient Greeks and Egyptians for inspiration, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856). Scotland's most influential architect of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Charles Rennie MacKintosh, designed a number of churches, but only one, Queen's Cross Free Church, Glasgow (1898–99) was built. It avoided the characteristic steeple of Glasgow churches in favour of a wide tower, and has a simple, elegant, rectangular structure with a single aisle.|$|E
5|$|The Historian {{has been}} {{described}} as a combination of genres, including <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> novel, the adventure novel, the detective novel, the travelogue, the postmodern historical novel, the epistolary epic, and the historical thriller.|$|E
5|$|The faux {{finished}} {{interior of}} the church incorporates groined vaults in <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> architecture style permitting very ample illumination from lateral windows. The steel columns, walls and ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Rocha, Isabelo Tampingco and Félix Martínez to {{give the appearance of}} marble and jasper. Trompe l'oeil paintings of saints and martyrs by Rocha were used to decorate the interiors of the church. True to <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> revival spirit of the church are its confessionals, pulpit, altars and five retablos designed by Lorenzo Guerrero and Rocha. The sculptor Eusebio Garcia carved the statues of holy men and women. Six holy water fonts were constructed for the church, each crafted from marble obtained from Romblon.|$|E
50|$|Around 1400 a (first) portal in <b>the</b> High <b>Gothic</b> {{style was}} {{installed}} in the west wall of the Old Choir, in the same location as the later portal in <b>the</b> late <b>gothic</b> style (see below).|$|R
50|$|King Sigismund Luxemburg of Hungary greatly {{enlarged}} the palace. During {{his long}} reign it became probably <b>the</b> largest <b>Gothic</b> palace of <b>the</b> late Middle Ages. Buda {{was also an}} important artistic centre of <b>the</b> International <b>Gothic</b> style.|$|R
50|$|After a fire damaged Canterbury Cathedral in 1174 Norman masons {{introduced}} <b>the</b> new <b>Gothic</b> architecture. Around 1191 Wells Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral {{brought in}} <b>the</b> English <b>Gothic</b> style, and Norman became increasingly a modest style of provincial building.|$|R
5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe enough to warrant a major reconstruction of the church. George Gilbert Scott, who had recently designed the monumental London buildings of the Foreign Office and St.Pancras Station, was chosen to lead the project. Scott was a leading advocate of <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> Revival and saw the renovation as a chance to return St.Mary's to a state nearer to its earlier Gothic design.|$|E
5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It {{depended}} on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often antiqua).|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a number}} of {{landmark}} buildings and monuments. One of those is the Saint Michael's Church in Unirii Square, built {{at the end of the}} 14th century in <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> style of that period. It was only in the 19th century that the Neo-Gothic tower of the church was erected; it remains the tallest church tower in Romania to this day.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Biscay <b>Gothic</b> lost <b>the</b> {{spirit of}} the International Gothic: they were not monumental {{buildings}} with windows which played with the light creating a mystical aura inside, but small buildings, becoming that a characteristic of <b>the</b> local <b>Gothic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The nave {{was built}} between 1291 and c. 1350 {{and is also}} in <b>the</b> {{decorated}} <b>Gothic</b> style. It is <b>the</b> widest <b>Gothic</b> nave in England and has a wooden roof (painted so as to appear like stone) and the aisles have vaulted stone roofs. At its west end is the Great West Window, known as the 'Heart of Yorkshire' which features flowing tracery of <b>the</b> later decorated <b>gothic</b> period.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Decorated <b>Gothic</b> chancel {{is early}} 14th century {{and has a}} five-light east window. The rood screen is {{probably}} of the same date, but <b>the</b> screen's Perpendicular <b>Gothic</b> top is later.|$|R
5|$|Codex Carolinus is a Gothic-Latin diglot uncial {{manuscript}} of the New Testament on parchment, dated to the 6th or 7th century. <b>The</b> <b>Gothic</b> text is designated by siglum Car, the Latin text is designated by siglum gue (traditional system) or by 79 (on {{the list of}} Beuron), it represents the Old Latin translation of the New Testament. It is housed in the Herzog August Bibliothek.|$|E
5|$|Eutharic's {{status in}} both <b>the</b> <b>Gothic</b> and Roman world was {{elevated}} by the attentions of Theoderic the Great {{who he was}} related to distantly through their mutual connection with Hermanric. Hermanric was an Ostrogoth chief who ruled much of the territory north of the Black Sea. Eutharic was descended through five generations from Hermanric, whilst Theoderic was a descendant of Hermanric's older brother Vultwulf.|$|E
