It was proposed that the races would be run in two classes, with single-cylinder machines to average 90 mpg and twin-cylinder machines to average 75 mpg fuel consumption. To emphasise the road-touring nature of the motorcycles there were regulations for saddles, pedals, mudguards and exhaust silencers.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Motor vehicle crashes are a {{major cause}} of {{fatality}} all over the world. By 2020, motor vehicle injury is projected to become the third leading contributor to the global burden of disease in the world. Motor cyclists are about 25 times more likely than car occupants to die in Road Traffic Accidents. Data on the incidence and types of crashes is required to guide safety policy. Knowledge of how injuries are caused and of what type they are of valuable instrument for identifying interventions and monitoring the effectiveness of intervention. The present study was done to find out the factors that contribute <b>for</b> <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> crashes and to study the injury pattern seen in helmeted and non-helmeted victims. MATERIAL AND METHODS Victims of two wheeler accidents brought for autopsy in a Govt. Medical College were studied from October 2010 to August 2011. Two wheelers include <b>motor</b> <b>cycles,</b> scooters and mopeds. Bicycles were excluded from the study. Accidents include all types; against all types of vehicles running on the road, collision with any object, surface or any animal or fall from vehicle.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Finding {{the correct}} Top Dead Center (TDC) offset for an {{internal}} combustion engine is harder than it seems. This study introduces a novel method to find the TDC offset based on the simple assumption that the heat loss power through the combustion chamber walls is constant <b>for</b> <b>motored</b> <b>cycles</b> in a narrow Crank Angle interval around TDC. The proposed method uses nonlinear least squares optimization to find the combination of specific heat ratio and TDC offset that makes the heat loss power as constant as possible. An important subproblem {{is to determine the}} peak pressure location with high accuracy. Fitting a third order Fourier series to the motored cylinder pressure allows the pressure maximum to be estimated {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 005 ° Crank Angle (CA) and it can also be used instead of the measured pressure to reduce the uncertainty of the TDC estimate by approximately 50 %. The standard deviation of a single-cycle TDC estimate is approximately 0. 025 ° CA when using a crank resolution of 0. 2 ° CA for the measurements. The bias of the TDC estimate is in the 0 - 0. 02 ° CA range both when comparing to measurements with a TDC sensor and with simulated <b>motored</b> <b>cycles.</b> The method can be used both for calibration and on-board diagnostics purposes e. g. during cranking, fuel cut-off or engine switch-off. The third order Fourier series fit comes with a significant computational penalty but since it is only applied very intermittently this does not have to be a serious issue...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the {{analysis}} of unsteady heat conduction through short fin with applicability of quasi theory. “The area exposed to the surrounding is frequently increased by the attachment of protrusions to the surfaces, and the arrangement provides a means by which heat transfer rate can be substantially improved. The protrusions are called fins”. The fins are commonly used on small power developing machine as engine used <b>for</b> <b>motor</b> <b>cycle</b> as well as small capacity compressor. Earlier, Work under steady state conduction had been carried out extensively. Unsteady heat conduction analysis for the fins is being done for calculation of heat transfer. Unsteady Closed form solutions had been derived earlier by various researchers. Exact solutions are given for the unsteady temperature in flux-base fins with the method of Green’s Functions (GF) in the form of infinite series for three different tip conditions. The time of convergence is improved by replacing the series part by closed form solution. The present study supplies a new approach to calculate the thermal performance of the short fin. For the short fin case, exact fin solution and a quasi-steady solution is presented. Numerical values are presented and the conditions under which the quasi-steady solution is accurate are determined. Dimensionless temperature distribution is presented for both quasi steady theory and exact fin theory...|$|R

40|$|The {{available}} {{knowledge and}} studies {{which have been}} carried out on setting speed limits for Sri Lankan road ways are very limited. Speed limit, on a given roadway, is a much important factor for road users, because that decides the travel time. This research attempts to evaluate the applicability of speed limits for Sri Lankan road network and develop a methodology for setting up speed limit for selected road section. In the selection of road sections for this research, the scope was limited to straight road sections in flat terrains in sub-urban areas and other characteristics such as shoulder conditions, roadside development and etc pretty much equal. Then, the sample speed data was collected on selected road sections according to the vehicle category. The collected data was processed and compared with existing speed limits. Besides, a questionnaire survey was carried out in order to find out drivers' knowledge and attitude about speed limits on those selected road sections. According to the obtained results, only three-wheelers and buses exceeded the speed limits which were to be adopted on the road sections by drivers. Then, the speed limit <b>for</b> <b>motor</b> <b>cycles,</b> car/van/jeep, light goods vehicles can be increased while Speed limit for heavy vehicles is kept as of for these road sections. After considering the results of the questionnaire survey it can be suggested that the speed limits for three-wheelers and buses can be increased by 10 kmph with respect to their prevailing speed limit values...|$|R
