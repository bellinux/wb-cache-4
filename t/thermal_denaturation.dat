Isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (IDH) is an important enzyme in the multi-step biosynthesis of patulin, and its gene is present in other fungi that may potentially produce the toxin.

40|$|The {{properties}} of inverted repeated sequences in wheat nuclear DNA {{have been studied}} by HAP(1) chromatography, nuclease S 1 digestion and electron microscopy. Inverted repeated sequences comprise 1. 7 % of wheat genome. The HAP {{studies show that the}} amount of "foldback HAP bound DNA" depends on DNA length. Inverted repeats appear to be clustered with an average intercluster distance of 25 kb. It is estimated that there are approximately 3 x 10 (6) inverted repeats per haploid wheat genome. The sequences around inverted repeats involve all families of repetition frequencies. Inverted repeats are observed as hairpins in electron microscopy. 20 % of hairpins are terminated by a single-stranded spacer ranging from 0. 3 to 1. 5 kb in length. Duplex regions of the inverted repeats range from 0. 1 to 0. 45 kb with number average values of 0. 24 kb and 0. 18 kb for unlooped and looped hairpin respectively. <b>Thermal</b> <b>denaturations</b> and nuclease S 1 digestions have revealed a length of about 100 bases for duplex regions.

40|$|There are {{frequent}} contacts between aromatic rings and sulfur atoms in proteins. However, {{it is unclear}} to what degree this putative interaction is stabilizing and what {{the nature of the}} interaction is. We have investigated the aryl–sulfur interaction by placing a methionine residue diagonal to an aromatic ring on the same face of a β-hairpin, which places the methionine side chain in close proximity to the aryl side chain. The methionine (Met) –aryl interaction was compared with an equivalent hydrophobic and cation–π interaction {{in the context of the}} β-hairpin. The interaction between phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp), or cyclohexylalanine (Cha) and Met stabilized the β-hairpin by − 0. 3 to − 0. 5 kcal mole− 1, as determined by double-mutant cycles. The peptides were subjected to <b>thermal</b> <b>denaturations</b> that suggest a hydrophobic driving force for the interactions between Met and Trp or Cha. The observed interaction of Met or norleucine (Nle) with Trp or Cha are quite similar, implying a hydrophobic driving force for the Met–π interaction. However, the thermodynamic data suggest that there may be some differences between the interaction of Met with Trp and Phe and that there may be a small thermodynamic component to the Met•••Phe interaction...|$|R
25|$|The flow of {{reactants}} {{into the}} reaction chamber and subsequent ejection {{occur in a}} series of about 70 pulses, {{at a rate of about}} 500 pulses per second. The whole sequence of events takes only a fraction of a second. These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatory opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the reaction chamber. This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles' survival because the system uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from <b>thermal</b> <b>denaturation.</b>|$|E

Objectives: To evaluate the antiulcer potential of two commonly used herbal products, Endemali, Akseer ULCER. Material and Method: In urease inhibitory assay, enzyme solution, extract, diferent regaents added and absorbance was measured at 630 nm (50 min, pH 8. 2) and thiourea used as standard. In protein denaturation assay, the egg albumin was mixed with different concentration of test compounds, buffer absorbance was measured. Aspirin was used as standard. Results: The Endemali {{had a profound effect on}} the urease activity in a concentration dependent manner with EC 50 value of 0. 468 mg/ml. The Akseer ULCER antagonized the urease activity markedly with EC 50 value of 0. 374 mg/ml. These tested herbal products caused marked inhibition of <b>thermal</b> induced protein <b>denaturation</b> in a concentration dependent manner. The potency in the form of EC 50 for Endemali, Akseer ULCER was measured as 323, 337 µg/ml respectively.

40|$|Using a dimeric bZIP protein, we have {{designed}} a leucine zipper that becomes more stable after a serine in the e position is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (delta delta GP = - 1. 4 kcal mol- 1 dimer- 1 or - 0. 7 kcal mol- 1 residue- 1). Mutagenesis {{studies indicate that}} three arginines form a network of inter-helical (i,i' + 5; i, i' + 2) and intra-helical (i, i + 4) attractive interactions with the phosphorylated serine. When the arginines are replaced with lysines, the stabilizing effect of serine phosphorylation is reduced (delta delta GP = - 0. 5 kcal mol- 1 dimer- 1). The hydrophobic interface of the leucine zipper needs a glycine in the d position to obtain an increase in stability after phosphorylation. The phosphorylated protein binds DNA with a 15 -fold higher affinity. Using a transient transfection assay, we document a PKA dependent four-fold activation of a reporter gene. Phosphorylation of a threonine in the same e position decreases the stability by delta delta GP = + 1. 2 kcal mol- 1 dimer- 1. We present circular dichroism (CD) <b>thermal</b> <b>denaturations</b> of 15 bZIP proteins before and after phosphorylation.

40|$|AbstractThe aspA gene, {{encoding}} the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) {{from the}} hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus sp. KOD 1, was expressed in Escherichia coli. The KOD 1 AspRS, which was purified to homogeneity and {{was shown to}} be functional in dimeric form, aminoacylated tRNA from KOD 1. The optimum temperature for this activity was 65 °C, which was lower than that for the cell growth of KOD 1 (85 °C). However, it increased to 75 °C {{by the addition of}} polyamine molecules, such as putrescine, spermine, and spermidine. Analysis of the <b>thermal</b> <b>denaturations</b> of the enzyme and of KOD 1 -tRNA indicated that neither of them was denatured at temperatures below 70 °C. These results suggest polyamine is one of the factors which are required to stabilize the AspRS-tRNA complex in vivo. In order to determine whether the nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) is required for Asp-tRNA synthesis, the aminoacylation was examined in the presence of each of the four NTPs. AspRS most effectively aminoacylated tRNA in the presence of ATP. However, we also found that the enzyme aminoacylated it even in the presence of GTP and UTP as well. Archaeon synthetase may have an interesting system to utilize other NTPs than ATP. The extreme conditions of early life may have given rise to these unique characteristics which then disappeared from developed organisms through evolution...|$|R
2500|$|Hybridization is {{the process}} of {{establishing}} a non-covalent, sequence-specific interaction between two or more complementary strands of nucleic acids into a single complex, which in the case of two strands is referred to as a duplex. [...] Oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA will bind to their complement under normal conditions, so two perfectly complementary strands will bind to each other readily. In order to reduce the diversity and obtain the most energetically preferred complexes, a technique called annealing is used in laboratory practice. However, due to the different molecular geometries of the nucleotides, a single inconsistency between the two strands will make binding between them less energetically favorable. Measuring the effects of base incompatibility by quantifying the temperature at which two strands anneal can provide information as to the similarity in base sequence between the two strands being annealed. The complexes may be dissociated by <b>thermal</b> <b>denaturation,</b> also referred to as melting. In the absence of external negative factors, the processes of hybridization and melting may be repeated in succession indefinitely, which lays the ground for polymerase chain reaction. Most commonly, the pairs of nucleic bases A=T and G≡C are formed, of which the latter is more stable.|$|E

40|$|The basic region-leucine zipper (B-ZIP) (bZIP) protein motif dimerizes to bind {{specific}} DNA sequences. We {{have identified}} 27 B-ZIP proteins in the recently sequenced Drosophila melanogaster genome. The dimerization specificity of these 27 B-ZIP proteins was evaluated using two structural criteria: (1) {{the presence of}} attractive or repulsive interhelical g↔e‘ electrostatic interactions and (2) the presence of polar or charged amino acids in the ‘a’ and ‘d’ positions of the hydrophobic interface. None of the B-ZIP proteins contain only aliphatic amino acids in the‘a’ and ‘d’ position. Only six of the Drosophila B-ZIP proteins contain a “canonical” hydrophobic interface like the yeast GCN 4, and the mammalian JUN, ATF 2, CREB, C/EBP, and PAR leucine zippers, characterized by asparagine in the second ‘a’ position. Twelve leucine zippers contain polar amino acids in the first, third, and fourth ‘a’ positions. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, used to monitor <b>thermal</b> <b>denaturations</b> of a heterodimerizing leucine zipper system containing either valine (V) or asparagine (N) in the ‘a’ position, indicates that the V–N interaction is 2. 3 kcal/mole less stable than an N–N interaction and 5. 3 kcal/mole less stable than a V–V interaction. Thus, we propose {{that the presence of}} polar amino acids in novel positions of the ‘a’ position of Drosophila B-ZIP proteins has led to leucine zippers that homodimerize rather than heterodimerize...|$|R
40|$|The soybean Kunitz trypsin {{inhibitor}} (SKTI) is a 21. 5 kDa allergenic protein {{that belongs to}} the family of all antiparallel h-sheet proteins that are highly resistant to <b>thermal</b> and chemical <b>denaturation.</b> Spectroscopic and biochemical techniques such as circular dichroism (CD), ANS fluorescence and proteolysis were used to study its molecular structure under denaturing conditions such as acid and heat to which these allergens are commonly exposed during food processing. Reduction of native SKTI leads to its complete and rapid proteolysis by pepsin in simulated gastric fluid (SGF). Limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin during renaturation after heating showed that the native structure reforms at around 60 jC reversing the denaturation. CD spectra revealed that under acid denaturing conditions, SKTI shows major changes in conformation, indicating the possibility of a molten structure. The existence of this intermediate was established by ANS fluorescence studies at different concentrations of HCl. The remarkable stability of SKTI to both <b>thermal</b> and acid <b>denaturation</b> may be important for its role as a food allergen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermodynamic {{parameters}} describing the phage 434 Cro protein have been determined by calorimetry and, independently, by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements of isothermal urea <b>denaturations</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>denaturations</b> at fixed urea concentrations. These equilibrium unfolding transitions are adequately {{described by the}} two-state model. The far-UV CD denaturation data yield average temperature-independent values of 0. 99 (0. 10 kcal mol- 1 M- 1 for m and 0. 98 (0. 05 kcal mol- 1 K- 1 for ∆Cp,U, the heat capacity change accompanying unfolding. Calorimetric data yield a temperatureindependent ∆Cp,U of 0. 95 (0. 30 kcal mol- 1 K- 1 or a temperature-dependent value of 1. 00 (0. 10 kcal mol- 1 K- 1 at 25 °C. ∆Cp,U and m determined for 434 Cro are in accord with values predicted using known empirical correlations with structure. The free energy of unfolding is pH-dependent, and the protein is completely unfolded at pH 2. 0 and 25 °C as judged by calorimetry or CD. The stability of 434 Cro is lower than those observed for the structurally similar N-terminal domain of the repressor of phage 434 (R 1 - 69) or of phage λ (λ 6 - 85), but {{is close to the}} value reported for the putative monomeric λ Cro. Since a protein’s structural stability is important in determining its intracellular stability and turnover, the stability of Cro relative to the repressor could be a key component of the regulatory circuit controlling the levels and, consequently, the functions of the two proteins in vivo...|$|R
