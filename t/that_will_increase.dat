5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E

25|$|Prakash Thakur, the {{chairman}} of the People for Environment Horticulture & Livelihood of Himachal Pradesh, announcing his support for retail reforms claimed FDI is expected to roll out produce storage centers <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> market access, reduce the number of middlemen and enhance returns to farmers. Highly perishable fruits like cherry, apricot, peaches and plums have a huge demand but are unable to tap the market fully because of lack of cold storage and transport infrastructure. Sales will boost with the opening up of retail. Even though India is the second-largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world, its storage infrastructure is grossly inadequate, claimed Thakur.|$|E
25|$|Indirect {{costs are}} those that affect females in the future. One such cost happens because sexual {{coercion}} does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> their offspring’s survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice {{and can lead to}} their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not. Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating access. This loss of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females.|$|E

This new $4.6 million contribution was hailed as a victory for Nassau County bus riders, although it will still leave NICE bus with a $6 million operating deficit. However, on December 11, 2014, Nassau County executive Ed Mangano proposed cutting $4 million from Nassau County's NICE bus contribution (in addition to cuts to numerous other Nassau County services) to replace the $30 million that will be lost after the shutdown of Nassau County's controversial school speed zone cameras.|$|E

Players collect medals as the player win events. Players must win a certain number of easier challenges before the referees will allow the player into the tougher ones. Along the way players can also find Twitchy Shakes, which are special drinks <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> the player's abilities depending on the next event the player enters. Players may be able to attain higher speeds or even become invincible.|$|E
25|$|The International Monetary Fund {{stated in}} June 2017 that annual {{growth in the}} economy was just over 4% and that the {{financial}} system was sound. The IMF expressed concern however, about increasing deficits and public debt {{as well as the}} heavy dollarization of bank assets and liabilities. Costa Rica's public debt is problematic, especially {{as a percentage of the}} GDP, increasing from 29.8% in 2011 to 40.8% in 2015. Of the proposed 2017 budget (US$15.9 billion), debt payments account for one-third of the total and a full 46% of the budget will require financing. <b>That</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> the deficit and the debt owed to foreign entities.

25|$|Working {{with a soft}} hammer {{allows a}} knapper greater control of the knapping and reduces waste of the raw material, {{allowing}} the production of longer, sharper, more uniform edges <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> the tool's working life. Hand axes made with a soft hammer are usually more symmetrical and smooth, with rectilinear edges and shallow indentations that are broad and smooth {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish where one flake starts and another ends. They generally have a regular biconvex cross-section and the intersection of the two faces forms an edge with an acute angle, usually of around 30°. They were worked with great skill and therefore they are more aesthetically attractive. They are usually associated with periods of highly developed tool making such as the Micoquien or the Mousterian. Soft hammer manufacturing is not reliable as the sole dating method.|$|E

25|$|Adult male macaques try to {{maximize}} their reproductive success by entering into sex with females, both in and outside the breeding period. Females prefer to mate with males <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> the survival of their young. Thus, a consort male provides resources for his female and protects her from predators. Larger, more dominant males {{are more likely to}} provide for the females. The breeding period can last up to 11 days, and a female usually mates with four males during that time. Male rhesus macaques have not been observed to fight for access to sexually receptive females, although they suffer more wounds during the mating season. Female macaques first breed when they are four years old, and reach menopause at around 25 years of age. When mating, a male rhesus monkey usually ejaculates less than 15 seconds after sexual penetration. Male macaques generally play no role in raising the young, but do have peaceful relationships with the offspring of their consort pairs.|$|E
25|$|UNICEF {{has found}} that {{children}} who are forced to beg by third parties are often removed from their families, surrender the majority of their income to their exploiter, endure unsafe work and living conditions, and are at times maimed to increase profits. The process of maiming, popularized by the film Slumdog Millionaire, is common given that according to the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review children with apparent special needs often make upwards of three times as much as other children who beg. In addition to inflictions such as blindness and loss of limbs, other physical abuses for the purposes of heightening profits include pouring chili pepper on a child's tongue to give the appearance of impeded speech, the use of opium to elicit cries, and administering forced injections of drugs <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>increase</b> a child's energy and alertness. Testimonies against trafficking ring gang leaders have discussed the detainment of individuals in small cells devoid of food, water, and light to make victims weak and feeble, and thus more likely to elicit donations.|$|E
