5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were often}} {{stationed}} in provinces {{other than that}} {{in which they were}} originally raised, for reasons of security and to foster the process of Romanisation in the provinces. The regimental names of many auxiliary units persisted into the 4th century, but by then the units in question were different in size, structure, and quality from <b>their</b> <b>predecessors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hyde Road was a {{football}} stadium in West Gorton, Manchester, England. It {{was home to}} Manchester City F.C. and <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> from its construction in 1887 until 1923, when the club moved to Maine Road. It was named after Hyde Road, a road which begins at {{the east end of}} Ardwick Green South in Ardwick and runs east towards Hyde. At the boundary between Gorton and Audenshaw it continues as Manchester Road.|$|E

5|$|Like Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Ruby and Sapphire {{keep track}} of real-life time; this {{influences}} events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> Ruby and Sapphire do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to {{the differences in the}} technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, Ruby and Sapphire cannot be linked with Pokémon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade to the previous generations.|$|E

5|$|Rome's {{territorial}} {{expansion in}} Europe {{and across the}} Mediterranean, and its development of mining, led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the classical era, with an estimated annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes. Like <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> the Romans obtained lead mostly as a by-product of silver smelting. Lead mining occurred in Central Europe, Britain, the Balkans, Greece, Anatolia, and Hispania, the latter accounting for 40% of world production.|$|E

5|$|The EO-7 relief crew arrived aboard Soyuz TM-10 on 3 August 1990. The new crew {{arrived at}} Mir with quail for Kvant-2's cages, {{one of which}} laid an egg {{en route to the}} station.

Two more expeditions, EO-8 and EO-9, continued the work of <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> whilst tensions grew back on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine {{designed}} the Bussard class in 1888 as an improved {{version of the}} Schwalbe class; like <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> the Bussards were intended purely for colonial duty. They were larger and faster, with a comparable cruising radius and the same number and caliber of guns, though all but the first ship were equipped with new quick-firing models. The Bussard class was also the last cruiser design to incorporate a sailing rig in the German Navy.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time that Caprivi began {{ordering}} new protected cruisers, he also authorized the construction of smaller unprotected cruisers for use in Germany's overseas colonies. The first of these, the , were laid down in 1886 and 1887. A further six vessels of the , which were improved versions that were larger and faster than <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> followed over the next five years. A final, much larger vessel, , was laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta. She represented another attempt to merge the colonial cruiser and fleet scout, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the German naval designers began work on the , which provided the basis for all future German light cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|Kingship had its ritual aspects. The {{kings of}} Dál Riata were inaugurated by putting their {{foot in a}} {{footprint}} carved in stone, signifying that they would {{follow in the footsteps}} of <b>their</b> <b>predecessors.</b> The kingship of the unified kingdom of Alba had Scone and its sacred stone at the heart of its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was inherited from Pictish practices. Iona, the early centre of Scottish Christianity, became the burial site of the early kings of Scotland until the eleventh century, when the House of Canmore adopted Dunfermline near Scone.|$|E

5|$|Most border {{units were}} based in forts as were <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> the legions and {{auxiliary}} {{units of the}} Principate; {{in many cases they}} were based in the same forts. Some of the larger limitanei units (legiones and vexillationes) were based in cities, probably in permanent barracks. Because units of limitanei operated in one area, had their own camps, and often recruited from the same area, they tended to maintain better relations with the locals than the comitatenses and palatini, who would often be transferred to other areas, and were often quartered in civilian homes.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Gold and Silver were {{critically}} acclaimed upon release {{and they are}} {{considered by many to}} be the best games in the entire series, as well as some of the fifth generation console gaming's most significant titles. They continued the enormous success of <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> as Pokémon began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise. The games almost matched the sales of Pokémon Red and Blue and went on to jointly sell millions of copies worldwide. By 2010, the recorded sales of Gold and Silver were at 23 million units.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{initially}} became {{established in}} Lower Silesia, Greater Poland, central Poland, and western Masovia and Lesser Poland, gradually replacing, moving eastbound, the Pomeranian {{culture and the}} Cloche Grave culture, coexisting with the older cultures for a while (in some cases well into the younger pre-Roman period, 200 to 0 BC) and assimilating in process some of their characteristics, for example the Cloche Grave funerary practice and ceramics. The Przeworsk people must have originated from the above two local cultures, {{because of the lack}} of any other archeologically viable possibility, but in respect to <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> they represent a striking cultural discontinuity (different cremation rite and pottery).|$|E

40|$|This paper studies how {{individuals}} learn by observing {{the behavior of}} predecessors {{as well as from}} their advice. What we find is a truly puzzling result that we call the advice paradox. This paradox can be stated as follows: subjects in a laboratory social learning situation played with and without advice appear to be more willing to follow the advice given to them by <b>their</b> <b>predecessor</b> than to copy their action, despite the fact that both pieces of information are equally informative in equilibrium. The consequence of this advice paradox is that in experiments with advice subjects tend to herd more than they do in experiments where they can only view <b>their</b> <b>predecessor’s</b> action. Remarkably, these herds tend to select the correct action and, hence, advice tends to be efficiency increasing when compared to experiments where subjects can only observe <b>their</b> <b>predecessor’s</b> action...|$|R
5|$|The {{church in}} Northumbria {{was one of}} the major landowners, perhaps second only to the king. At the head of the Northumbrian church was the Archbishop of York, an office held by Eanbald I to 796, Eanbald II until some time after 808, and then by Wulfsige to around 830. Immediately below the {{archbishop}} were three bishops: the bishop of Lindisfarne, the bishop of Hexham and the bishop of Whithorn. The typically long term of office of senior clerics meant that kings often had to work with men appointed by <b>their</b> <b>predecessors,</b> with whom their relations might be difficult.|$|E
5|$|The game {{follows the}} five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn {{they are part}} of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit {{predecessors}} from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b> from destruction.|$|E
5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of <b>their</b> <b>predecessors.</b> The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E
