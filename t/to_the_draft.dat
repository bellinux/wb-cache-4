5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 1995 college {{football}} season for Texas and Virginia Tech, the 1995 Sugar Bowl provided a final opportunity for players to demonstrate their skills on the field prior to the next NFL Draft. Several players from both teams announced their intention to enter the draft and attempt to play in the National Football League. Star Virginia Tech defender Cornell Brown was not one of these players. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> he announced his intention to remain at Tech for his senior year.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from France, Edward found his {{political}} position greatly strengthened. After intense negotiation, the earls, including Lancaster and Warwick, came to a compromise in October 1313, fundamentally very similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> agreement of the previous December. Edward's finances improved, thanks to parliament agreeing to the raising of taxes, a loan of 160,000 florins (£25,000) from the Pope, £33,000 that he borrowed from Philip, and further loans organised by Edward's new Italian banker, Antonio Pessagno. For {{the first time in}} his reign, Edward's government was well-funded.|$|E

The project foundered, but Shaw returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> {{as the basis of}} Widowers' Houses in 1892, and the connection with Archer proved of immense value to Shaw's career.|$|E

The cost was estimated at HK$3.5 billion. The Government said that the historical significance of the third-generation pier would be recognised and promised to recreate the landmark on the new waterfront.|$|E

5|$|After {{naming the}} {{remaining}} All-Stars, each player voted for team captains. The players selected the 12-time All-Star, Nicklas Lidstrom, {{and the captain}} of the host Carolina Hurricanes, Eric Staal. Lidstrom was assigned the home blue uniforms while Staal received the away whites. The NHL further named their alternate captains, placing Ryan Kesler and Mike Green with Staal while Patrick Kane and Martin St. Louis joined Team Lidstrom. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> the NHL determined head coaches for the teams via a coin toss. Chicago's Joel Quenneville and his assistant, Mike Haviland, were named coaches as a result of winning the Stanley Cup last year. Philadelphia Flyers Head Coach Peter Laviolette and the Vancouver Canucks' Alain Vigneault earned the distinction by having the highest winning percentage through January 8, 2011. After the coin toss, Quenneville was assigned to Team Staal, while Laviolette and Vigneault were given Team Lidstrom.|$|E
5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, Crosby {{was listed}} first {{overall in the}} NHL Central Scouting Bureau and International Scouting Services' {{respective}} rankings of prospects. He had also won the Mike Bossy Trophy as the QMJHL's best prospect. Crosby went on to be selected first overall in the draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 30, 2005. Due to the labour stoppage that suspended the entire 2004–05 NHL season, positioning for the 2005 draft was conducted via a weighted lottery based on each team's playoff appearances and draft lottery victories {{in the last four}} years. This lottery system led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> being popularly referred to as the Sidney Crosby Lottery or the Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Malhotra {{was drafted}} by the New York Rangers in the first round, seventh overall, of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft.

He was surprised to have been selected by the Rangers, as they {{were one of the}} only teams to have not interviewed or met with him prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b> He anticipated being drafted by the Calgary Flames at sixth overall, as the team's general manager, Al Coates had previously drafted him into the OHL as general manager of the Storm.|$|E

According to Bleacher Report, he signed with sports agent Rich Paul, who is LeBron James's agent, but other sources, such as SLAM Magazine, suggest that he signed with BJ Armstrong, who is Derrick Rose's agent. Parker (along with other top prospects Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid) decided to decline the invitation {{to participate in the}} NBA Draft Combine. On June 26, Parker was selected no. 2 overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. Just prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> Parker became the second member of the 2014 draft class to sign a shoe contract when he signed an endorsement deal with the Jordan Brand.|$|E

5|$|Stastny was draft-eligible in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, but {{opted out}} of the draft. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> the NHL Central Scouting Bureau ranked him as the 49th best North-American skater available. Ranked by CSB as the 74th best in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, he was drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the second round, 44th overall. Before moving to Denver in 1996, the Avalanche were the Quebec Nordiques, the team for which his father played from 1980–1990 and had his jersey number retired. Stastny signed a multi-year {{contract}} with the Avalanche on July 24, 2006, and began his professional career in the 2006–07 NHL season.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} on June 22–23, 2012, at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the first round, the Canucks drafted Brendan Gaunce, a two-way centre with size. Leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> Gaunce was ranked 13th among North American skaters by the NHL's {{scouting}} department, and was the top-ranked Canadian forward. Projected to be a mid-first round pick, he dipped slightly to 26 where he was selected by the Canucks. General Manager Mike Gillis stated that going into the draft, they had targeted Gaunce, {{and if he had}} not been available, Vancouver would have traded down to add extra picks.|$|E
5|$|The Houston Astros chose Nevin {{with the}} first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had {{evaluated}} Derek Jeter extensively prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b> Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter, and quit in protest over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to {{the best player in}} the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's first pick, Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.|$|E
