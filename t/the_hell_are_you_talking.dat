5000|$|The {{songs on}} T.S.O.L. are fast-tempoed and have angry, leftist lyrics attacking the United States {{government}} and the renewal of the military draft. Grisham has described it as [...] "four kids hating the government and refusing to get real jobs. It was muscular and threatening, anarchistic and confrontational. It was a straight up attack at {{the government of the}} United States and those involved with it." [...] "Property Is Theft" [...] employs Marxist rhetoric, echoing the communist belief in the abolishment of private property, while [...] "Abolish Government / Silent Majority" [...] is anarchist in nature.

He criticized the lyrics' naivety, since the band members were too young to pay taxes or be drafted, and pointed out the lack of focus in [...] "Superficial Love": [...] "Superficial love, only for a fuck / But love is incest, and it's only for a buck / Eating to survive, surviving for free / Peacetime, wartime, trying to draft me...It's like, 'What <b>the</b> <b>hell?</b> <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> about this, or are you talking about that?
