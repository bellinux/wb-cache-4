5|$|A three-strong EC {{delegation}} made <b>three</b> <b>visits</b> to {{the region}} in late June and early July to negotiate a political agreement which would facilitate further negotiations. The delegation consisted of the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, as the incumbent holder of the EC presidency, and Italy and the Netherlands, as the previous and future holders of that office. The delegation members were Jacques Poos (Luxembourg), Gianni de Michelis (Italy), and Hans van den Broek (Netherlands). Prior to the delegation's arrival in Belgrade, Poos told reporters that the EC would {{take charge of the}} crisis. There, the delegation was met by Serbian president Slobodan Milošević who dismissed the prospect of Croatia leaving the Yugoslav federation because its population contained 600,000 Serbs.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{a number}} of notable people used Saint-Inglevert Airfield. King Edward VIII made <b>three</b> <b>visits,</b> the first on 4 February 1935, while still the Prince of Wales, when he arrived from Fort Belvedere, Surrey on {{the first part of}} a journey to take a holiday at Kitzbühel, Austria. As king, he {{departed}} on 26 July 1936 to RAF Hendon on his return from the ceremony to unveil the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and flew in from the Great West Aerodrome, Harmondsworth, UK on 8 August, in order to catch the Orient Express at Calais, as part of a holiday in Yugoslavia. Henri Mignet flew from Saint-Inglevert to Lympne on 13 August 1935, in his Flying Flea, then the world's smallest aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, two {{driving under}} the {{influence}} incidents led to Lohan being put on probation, and together with <b>three</b> <b>visits</b> to rehabilitation facilities caused the loss of several movie deals. In 2008 and 2009, Lohan worked as a fashion model and launched the clothing line 6126. She resumed her acting career with TV work in 2008, and starred in the TV film Labor Pains (2009). She appeared in Robert Rodriguez's feature film Machete (2010). Between 2010 and 2013, Lohan went into rehabilitation three times, and spent much of her time entangled in legal problems stemming from misdemeanors and probation violations. In 2012 and 2013, she did further television work, including starring as Elizabeth Taylor in the biographical TV film Liz & Dick (2012). In 2013, she starred in Paul Schrader's independent film The Canyons. In 2014, the docu-series Lindsay aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network, and Lohan made her stage debut in the London West End production of Speed-the-Plow.|$|E

5|$|In November 1651, Cromwell's troops {{called on}} Ogilvie to surrender, but he refused. During the {{subsequent}} blockade of the castle, {{the removal of}} the Honours of Scotland was planned by Elizabeth Douglas, wife of Sir George Ogilvie, and Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of Kinneff Parish Church. The king's papers were first removed from the castle by Anne Lindsay, a kinswoman of Elizabeth Douglas, who walked through the besieging force with the papers sewn into her clothes. Two stories exist regarding {{the removal of the}} honours themselves. Fletcher stated in 1664 that over the course of <b>three</b> <b>visits</b> to the castle in February and March 1652, she carried away the crown, sceptre, sword and sword-case hidden amongst sacks of goods. Another account, given in the 18th century by a tutor to the Earl Marischal, records that the honours were lowered from the castle onto the beach, where they were collected by Fletcher's servant and carried off in a creel (basket) of seaweed. Having smuggled the honours from the castle, Fletcher and her husband buried them under the floor of the Old Kirk at Kinneff.|$|E
5|$|A trip to The Dell on 3 October {{was taken}} with caution given United's return from Munich in the Champions League and winless record at the ground. The team lost to Southampton {{in each of}} their last <b>three</b> <b>visits,</b> {{including}} a 6–3 mauling in 1996. Despite dominating possession and clear-cut chances in the previous season’s fixture, United lost by a single goal leaving Ferguson to question when, not if he would eventually break the jinx. Andy Cole was paired with Yorke {{for only the second}} time this season, a tactic that paid off as both got on the score sheet. Substitute Jordi Cruyff added a third in the 75th minute to move United into second place in the table, four points behind leaders Aston Villa going into the international break. Raimond van der Gouw who deputised for injured goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel at Southampton featured again at home to Wimbledon, a match that Manchester United won 5–1, the biggest win of the season at Old Trafford. Ryan Giggs, Beckham, Yorke and Cole (twice) all scored; Ferguson in particular hailed the contribution of 19-year-old defender Wes Brown. United earned a point away at Derby County on 24 October, and deservedly beat Everton 4–1 at Goodison Park on Halloween to cut the gap at the top to just a point.|$|E
5|$|Brown made 17 in {{his only}} innings as Australia won by eight wickets. Between Tests, Brown scored 113 {{in a slow}} innings against Yorkshire to retain his middle-order {{position}} for the Second Test at Lord's. He was unable to replicate the Test centuries he made in the preceding tours, scoring 24 and 32. It was to be his last Test, as Sam Loxton top-scored with 159 not out against Gloucestershire in the match before the Third Test, ousting Brown from his middle-order position. Barnes was injured in the Third Test, but Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test; instead, Lindsay Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order and struck 112. Brown then scored 140 against Derbyshire immediately after the Fourth Test, in a dour display that displeased spectators, and then scored consecutive centuries against Kent and the Gentlemen of England after the Tests. He ended with eight centuries {{and a total of}} 1,448 runs on the tour at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris, with the 200 against Cambridge University his highest score. Brown took 4/16 against the South of England in his only bowling assignment of the tour. It was his best career bowling figures, having amassed only six wickets in his first-class career. In <b>three</b> <b>visits</b> to England, Brown scored 18 centuries.|$|E

500|$|Disraeli always {{considered}} foreign affairs {{to be the}} most critical and most interesting part of statesmanship. Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas about foreign policy when he took office in 1874. [...] He had rarely travelled abroad; since his youthful tour of the Middle East in 1830–1831, he had left Britain only for his honeymoon and <b>three</b> <b>visits</b> to Paris, the last of which was in 1856. As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe. [...] His brief first premiership, and the first year of his second, gave him little opportunity to make his mark in foreign affairs.|$|E
500|$|From October 1999 to January 2000, Manning forced Climbié {{to sleep}} in a bin liner in the bathtub in her own excrement. During a later police interview, Manning said this was because of her {{frequent}} bedwetting. At Haringey social services on 1 November 1999, Kouao told social workers that Manning sexually assaulted Climbié, but withdrew the accusation the following day. In one of Arthurworrey's visits, during a conversation about housing, Arthurworrey said that the council accommodated only children who were believed to be at serious risk. Laming said in his report, [...] "it may be no coincidence that within three days of this conversation, Kouao contacted Ms. Arthurworrey to make allegations which, if true, would have placed Victoria squarely within that category". Jones sent a letter to Kouao, which was ignored, and no further action was taken. Manning later denied the allegation. Alan Hodges, the police sergeant overseeing the investigation, claimed in the inquiry that the social workers were obstructing the police in dealing with child protection cases. Between December 1999 and January 2000, Arthurworrey made <b>three</b> <b>visits</b> to the flat, but she received no answer. She speculated to her supervisor, Carole Baptiste, that they had returned to France. Despite no evidence, her supervisor wrote on Climbié's file that they had left the area. On 18 February 2000 they wrote to Kouao saying that if they did not receive any contact from them, they would close the case. A week later, on 25 February 2000, they closed the case—on the same day that Climbié died.|$|E
