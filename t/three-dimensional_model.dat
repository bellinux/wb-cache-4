500|$|Costume {{designer}} Lindy Hemming {{explained that}} Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, [...] "keeps his pain {{just below the}} threshold so he can function." [...] In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look [...] "like an amalgam {{of all sorts of}} bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform." [...] Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look [...] "animalistic". Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>model</b> of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face. Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary. The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling.|$|E

Using their <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>model</b> of the inner ear, Carabajal and colleagues suggested that the snout faced downwards at an angle of roughly 65° relative to the horizontal. A similar value has recently been proposed for the related Diplodocus. The neutral posture of the neck can be approximated based on how the cervical vertebrae attached to each other. According to Carabajal and colleagues, the neck was gently sloping downwards, so that the snout would have rested [...] above the ground in neutral posture. In reality, neck posture would have varied according to the respective activities of the animals.

[...] Some (PANAIR, HESS and MACAERO) were higher order codes, using higher order distributions of surface singularities, while others (Quadpan, PMARC, USAERO and VSAERO) used single singularities on each surface panel. [...] The advantage of the lower order codes was that they ran much faster on the computers of the time. [...] Today, VSAERO has grown to be a multi-order code and is the most widely used program of this class. It has been used in the development of many submarines, surface ships, automobiles, helicopters, aircraft, and more recently wind turbines.
