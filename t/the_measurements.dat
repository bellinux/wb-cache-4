This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and <b>the</b> <b>measurements</b> of subcellular objects.

5|$|Radiocarbon {{dates are}} {{generally}} {{presented with a}} range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) {{on either side of the}} mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in <b>the</b> <b>measurements),</b> and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. <b>The</b> <b>measurements</b> included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for determining, improving, and controlling <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> process errors (or measurement uncertainty) of a measurement system {{used to monitor}} product as it is manufactured. The method is called <b>the</b> Process <b>Measurement</b> Assurance Program (PMAP). It integrates metrology early into the product realization process and is a step beyond statistical process control (SPC), which monitors only the product. In this method, a control standard is used to continuously monitor the status of <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> system. Analysis of the control standard data allow the determination of <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> error inherent in the product data and allow one to separate the variability in the manufacturing process from variability in <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> process. These errors can be then associated with either <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> equipment, variability of <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> process, operator bias, or local environmental effects.

5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in <b>the</b> <b>measurements.</b> Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E

40|$|Position {{measurements}} are examined {{under the assumption}} that object position x_t and probe position X_t just after <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> are expressed by a linear combination of positions x_ 0 and X_ 0 just before <b>the</b> <b>measurement.</b> <b>The</b> Heisenberg uncertainty relation between the position uncertainty and momentum disturbance holds when <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> error ϵ(x_t) for the object position x_t is adopted as the position uncertainty. However, the uncertainty in <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> result obtained for x_ 0 is the standard deviation of <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> result, and not <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> error ϵ(x_ 0).
