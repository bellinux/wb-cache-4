5|$|East Quantoxhead {{used to have}} a small harbour {{which brought}} in {{limestone}} for local limekilns and exported alabaster. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was also used for smuggling.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda {{released}} a teaser trailer to promote gameplay being shown at E3 2015 on June 14, 2015; the trailer depicted the double-barreled shotgun and the Revenant, a monster {{returning to the}} game. On June 14, around 15 minutes of gameplay footage were shown at E3. Regarding the progression system, Marty Stratton <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was an important to allow players personalization and customization.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} of the game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregator site Metacritic. The main problems reviewers had with the game was its repetitiveness and the tediousness of some parts. Reviewers highly praised its narrative, and some reviewers <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would work better as a short film, or an audio drama, {{rather than as a}} game.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I guessed, {{on second}} <b>thoughts,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was yours, my lady,' said Tabitha, with rather a frightened face; 'and so I have brought it back.' ...|$|R

5|$|The game {{originally}} did {{not have}} a cooperative multiplayer mode, as the development team <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would distract from the tonally darker levels of the single-player campaign, not matching the game's narrative. However, a cooperative mode was still added to the game in August 2012 as free downloadable content; it does not follow the storyline of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|While Evolve carried some game {{mechanics}} from Left 4 Dead, {{others were}} discarded. The team originally <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be added}} to the artificial intelligence system of Evolves wildlife, but was later scrapped. They thought that the core experience offered by Evolve should be tracking and hunting the monster, instead of getting attacked by wildlife constantly. The team also <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would become an irritation if they added too many complex mechanics for the wildlife. The developer also intentionally chose not to make Evolve action-packed all the time, and introduced segments that would require players to slow down and track the Monster. Robb explained that the design team wanted to create a contrast, so that players could appreciate the action and chaotic moments after experiencing the less exciting segments.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit in prime time, Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. He <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became a star in her own right, hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years.|$|E
50|$|Ajātasattu {{began to}} send great offerings to Devadatta, {{and the latter}} became obsessed with his own worth, and began to have <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was he who should lead the Sangha, not the Buddha, and he didn’t desist even though this thought brought down his psychic powers.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pickwick {{glanced at}} the speaker, and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> if <b>it</b> were washing too, {{it would be all}} the better.|$|R
50|$|Production was in {{stellite}}, arsenic, {{silver and}} cobalt until 1956 when the stellite division moved to Belleville. Only silver ore {{continued to be}} treated there until the plant closed in March 1961. 'Cleanup' and demolition of the mine site followed with tons of arsenite refuse being buried, with the <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would eliminate the health hazard.|$|R
5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began to {{distance}} himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E
5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would negatively {{impact on the}} conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would have}} been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio {{just a couple of months}} before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "P'raps not," [...] {{returned}} Ben. [...] "Happiness is a queer thing, after all. I've often <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> neither huntin' nor farmin', nor fair weather nor foul, <b>that</b> brings <b>it</b> {{about in}} the heart o' man or woman, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes nat'ral to man, woman, and child, when they does what is best suited to their minds and bodies, and when they does it in the right way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'N-n-no, I don't know that,' replied Squeers. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> if <b>it</b> was in {{your power}} to make me, besides the trifle of money you sent, any compensation--' ...|$|R

5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E
5|$|Groening <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be}} funny {{to have a}} baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. She <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be the site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in Webster County, Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been altered by cultivation, they found little evidence of habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage {{in the belief that}} the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about Nosek's death.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} would know all about it," [...] said Mrs. Orme, [...] "as Mr. Furnival manages Lady Mason's law business. I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>it</b> was about <b>that</b> that you had come." ...|$|R
5000|$|The attacks {{themselves}} {{might have}} changed the electoral winner. A sufficient number of voters suddenly decided {{to vote for the}} Socialist party because they <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> if <b>it</b> won, Islamist terrorism would be placated.|$|R
5|$|The British forces {{occupied}} Flensburg on 5 May 1945; initially, nothing {{changed in}} the daily routine at the Mürwik Naval Academy. Returning drunk in the night of 13/14 May 1945, Lüth {{failed to respond to}} the sentry's challenge and {{was shot in the head}} by 18-year-old seaman Mathias Gottlob, a German guard. The officer in charge immediately reported the incident, contacting Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. Dönitz's adjutant, who had accepted the call, initially <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a bad joke. He then called Lüth's brother, Joachim, as the two siblings had been staying together. It was he who informed Lüth's wife and their four children that Lüth had died.|$|E
5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín {{did not agree with}} delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used by then. He <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been a good measure in the past but had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while delaRúa supported it.|$|E
5|$|The {{efforts of}} Miller and Lindwall against Hutton {{had led the}} English {{selectors}} to drop the Yorkshireman for the Third Test. The Australians were surprised by the move and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a bad move by their opponents. Miller had a quiet Third Test at Old Trafford, taking one wicket and scoring 31 as the match ended in a draw. In a rain-shortened match, Miller again earned the ire of the crowd, after aiming a series of bouncers at Edrich, in apparent retaliation to the Englishman's bouncing of Lindwall. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman ordered him to stop.|$|E

5000|$|Cooke elected not {{to perform}} [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] {{again in his}} lifetime, both because of the {{complexity}} of the arrangement and because of the ominous nature of the song. When shown to his protégé Bobby Womack, his response was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> sounds [...] "like death." [...] Cooke responded, [...] "Man, that's kind of how it sounds like to me. That's why I'm never going to play it in public." [...] Womack clarified his <b>thoughts,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wasn’t deathly, but rather [...] "spooky," [...] but Cooke never performed the song again.|$|R
6000|$|She hadn't so far <b>thought</b> of <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> brought Sir Isaac {{suddenly}} {{into the}} picture. [...] "By half-past five," [...] {{she said with}} just the faintest flavour of interrogation.|$|R
