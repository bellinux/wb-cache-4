We assessed the effects of 36 reported glucose-associated sequence variants on between- and within-subject variance in fasting glucose levels in 69, 142 Icelanders. The variant in TCF 7 L 2 <b>that</b> <b>increases</b> fasting glucose levels increases between-subject variance (5. 7 % per allele, P = 4. 2 × 10 (- 10)), whereas variants in GCK and G 6 PC 2 <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> fasting glucose levels decrease between-subject variance (7. 5 % per allele, P = 4. 9 × 10 (- 11) and 7. 3 % per allele, P = 7. 5 × 10 (- 18), respectively). Variants <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> mean and between-subject variance in fasting glucose levels tend to increase T 2 D risk, whereas those <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> the mean but reduce variance do not (r(2) = 0. 61). The variants <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> between-subject variance increase fasting glucose heritability estimates. Intuitively, our results show <b>that</b> <b>increasing</b> the mean and variance of glucose levels is more likely to cause pathologically high glucose levels than increase in the mean offset by a decrease in variance...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates <b>that</b> <b>increased</b> usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate <b>that</b> <b>increased</b> noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E

5|$|Adding to the problems, the zip fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids <b>that</b> <b>increased</b> wear on moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make {{up some of the}} difference. Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, another problem arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.|$|E
