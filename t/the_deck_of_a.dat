5|$|The chained {{slaves were}} packed under <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small vessel named The Schooner York {{to be shipped}} to the island (other sources say the voyage took place aboard The Morovia). During this voyage the Igbo slaves rose up in rebellion, {{taking control of the}} ship and {{drowning}} their captors in the process causing the grounding of the Morovia in Dunbar Creek at the site now locally known as Igbo Landing.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} {{slightly above}} normal tides and rough surf along the Jersey shore, killing one surfer off of Wildwood Crest. The combination of gusty winds {{and the heavy}} surf produced moderate beach erosion along much of the coastline, primarily to beaches facing southeastward. In the Delaware Bay and River area, no significant erosion was reported, though coastal flooding from the hurricane washed out a road and destroyed <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house in Baypoint. In Cape May County waves eroded the beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m) in Ocean City and Avalon, with several cities experiencing a loss of dunes and geotubes in Whale Beach being exposed. Waves from Isabel in Atlantic County resulted in light damage, minor coastal flooding, and slight beach erosion. The beaches of southern Ocean County experienced a loss of 3 to 4feet (0.9 to 1.2m) of sand, while locations further to the north experienced only minor erosion. Most coastal areas of Monmouth County reported eroded beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m), with Union Beach losing about 5,000sq. feet (465sq. m) of sand.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that further}} {{manoeuvring}} would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown {{and the ship}} evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took {{a survey of the}} ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch—like the cruiser—was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck.|$|E

25|$|On <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical trireme in the Peloponnesian War {{there were}} 4 or 5 archers and 10 or so marines. These few troops were {{peripherally}} effective in an offensive sense, but critical in providing defense for the oarsmen. Should {{the crew of}} another trireme board, the marines were all that stood between the enemy troops and the slaughter of the men below. It has also been recorded that if a battle were {{to take place in}} the calmer water of a harbor, oarsmen would join the offensive and throw stones (from a stockpile aboard) to aid the marines in harassing/attacking other ships.|$|E
25|$|De la Cierva's early autogyros were {{fitted with}} fixed rotor hubs, small fixed wings, and control {{surfaces}} {{like those of}} a fixed-wing aircraft. At low airspeeds, the control surfaces became ineffective and could readily lead to loss of control, particularly during landing. In response, Cierva developed a direct control rotor hub, which could be tilted in any direction by the pilot. De la Cierva's direct control was first developed on the Cierva C.19 Mk. V and saw production on the Cierva C.30 series of 1934. In March 1934 this type of autogyro became the first rotorcraft to take off and land on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship, when a C.30 performed trials on board the Spanish navy seaplane tender Dédalo off Valencia.|$|E

25|$|The Lynx is a {{multi-purpose}} twin-engine battlefield helicopter, {{of which}} specialized versions {{have been developed}} for both sea and land-based warfare. A distinguishing feature between early and later aircraft is the undercarriage: early Army versions of the Lynx were equipped with skids, while the Naval and later models have been outfitted with wheels, a requirement for easy ground handling on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warship. Early versions of the Lynx were powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem turboshaft engines, which powered a four-blade rotor. Mounted on a rigid titanium monobloc rotor head of the kind pioneered by the MBB BO105 a few years earlier. The innovative blade design comprised a honeycomb sandwich structure and made out of composite material. For shipboard stowage, both the rotor blades and tail can be folded. Lag dampers were incorporated but these are not required in flight (owing to the rigidity of the monobloc rotor head). In flight, the main rotor is kept at a constant speed, simplifying aircraft control; the rotor also features a vibration absorption system.|$|E
25|$|Dressing into a {{dry suit}} is usually more {{time-consuming}} than a wet suit, and may require {{the assistance of}} another person to check the neck seal and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment {{as far as possible}} before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.|$|E

500|$|Finally on 25 January 1884, {{when the}} whale was too badly {{decomposed}} for further public exhibition, Struthers {{was allowed to}} come and dissect the famous specimen.

He had two assistants; but the dissection was disturbed by John Woods, who admitted the public, for a fee, to watch the dissection in progress, while a military band played in the background.|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{original}} design of the Riverlore is the distinctive river boat theme of the house.

500|$|Saturation diving lets {{professional}} divers {{live and}} work under pressure for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, the divers rest and live in a dry pressurised underwater habitat on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diving support vessel, oil platform or other floating platform at a similar pressure to the work depth. They are [...] transferred between the surface accommodation and the underwater workplace in a pressurised closed diving bell. Decompression {{at the end of}} the dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater work efficiency and safety.|$|E

The dissection was disturbed by John Woods, who admitted the public, for a fee, to watch Struthers and his assistants at work, with a military band playing in the background. Progress on the dissection was impeded by snow showers. Struthers was able to remove much of the skeleton before Woods had the flesh embalmed; the carcass was then stuffed and sewn up to be taken on a profitable tour as far as Edinburgh and London. After months of waiting, on 7 August 1884, Struthers was able to remove the skull {{and the rest of the}} skeleton. Over the next decade, Struthers wrote seven anatomy articles on the whale, with a complete monograph on it in 1889.|$|E
500|$|The game {{opens with}} Diddy {{standing}} on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pirate ship.

Together, they travel through Crocodile Isle and are helped on their way by an assortment of animals to defeat K. Rool and rescue Donkey Kong. Diddy and Dixie eventually battle and defeat K. Rool, though he escapes after releasing Donkey Kong. Shortly after, Diddy and Dixie discover a secret area known as the [...] "Lost World". After going through the Lost World, they once again defeat K. Rool in [...] "Krocodile Kore", in a hidden geyser {{at the heart of}} Crocodile Island. Upon being defeated, K.

In the surreal style of LaChapelle, the pirate crew has distorted features, and a leaked casting call commented, [...] "I need the freaks on this one." [...] Above deck Stefani, the Harajuku Girls, Eve, and more pirates dance on the deck and rigging. Stefani is also seen dancing with the Harajuku Girls in a treasure trove, often carrying a sword, and swinging from an anchor. When the girls dunk the toy ship in a fish tank, the galleon engages in cannon fire, causing Stefani and the pirates to fall all over the ship, and Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are soon shipwrecked.|$|E
