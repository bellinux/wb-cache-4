However, Moore describes the ant in his publication as being one and a half inches long (3.8 centimetres), having very long and sharp mandibles and a formidable sting that produces acute pain. <b>These</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>characteristics</b> (large size, long mandibles and powerful stings) is consistent with most Myrmecia species which are well known ants.|$|E
50|$|The worm has a {{segmented}} body, but {{the middle}} segments are highly inflated, giving the animal a round shape. <b>These</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>characteristics</b> are unique among chaetopterids. It is unknown whether the specimens found to date were adult or larval forms. As chaetopterid worms do not spend a predetermined {{amount of time}} as planktonic larva, {{it is possible that}} the specimens found were actually larva that had simply been unable to settle in an appropriate benthic habitat for their species. Their unusual size (five to ten times larger than any known chaetopterid larvae) might indicate they were adults, but all currently known species of chaetopterid adults prefer to live in the benthic environment, and live in parchment-like tubes on the sea floor. Comparison to larval morphology has indicated that the specimens have a close relationship to either genus Chaetopterus or genus Mesochaetopterus, and a phylogenetic tree constructed from mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA sequences from twelve different Chaetopteridae worms found them to be most closely related to other worms of the Chaetopterus genus.|$|E
50|$|Decaying {{plants is}} one of the most common places where N. sphaerica is found. Many studies around the world found N. sphaerica as a leaf pathogen. N. sphaerica was {{isolated}} from various plants displaying leaf spots. These reported cases reveal newly identified plant hosts for the pathogen N. sphaerica that have been validated through Koch’s postulates. The fungus causes a progressively fatal leaf spot diseases of a range of plants including blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), and Wisteria sinensis (Chinese Wisteria). Initial lesions resemble small red spots around 2 - 5 mm particularly near the tips and edges of leaves, eventually resulting in complete defoliation. The fungus also causes a blight disease of the commercial tea plant, Camellia sinensis. Symptoms of blight was observed in commercial tea estates in Darjeeling, India. The disease affected plants of all ages, being especially pronounced in younger plants. Fungal colonies displayed an initial white colour that eventually turned gray/brown. Based on <b>these</b> <b>morphological</b> <b>characteristics,</b> N. sphaerica was identified as the fungal pathogen. Inoculation of the pathogen using conidial suspension spray, and re-isolation of N. sphaerica satisfied Koch’s postulates. rRNA sequence comparison of the ITS region confirmed N. sphaerica identity. Cases of leaf spot disease of kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) have been reported from orchards in Huangshan, Anhui Provence, China. Infected leaves browned and defoliated. Conidia morphology and culture properties suggested N. sphaerica as the etiological agent, later confirmed by Koch’s postulates and ITS identification.|$|E
