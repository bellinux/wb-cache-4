5|$|A large tumulus of {{uncertain}} {{origin and}} purpose stands approximately {{in the middle}} of the excavated area, between <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> new parts of the city.

5|$|A {{majority}} of Old School {{leaders in the}} North were convinced of the orthodoxy of the New School. Some within the Old School, chiefly Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, claimed that there were still ministers within the New School who adhered to New Haven theology. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> New School General Assemblies in the North and a {{majority of}} their presbyteries approved the reunion in 1869 of the PCUSA.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{diplomatic}} duties, Peckham {{wrote to}} Llywelyn, and in those letters the archbishop continued his criticisms of the Welsh people, this time condemning their laws as contrary to both <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> New Testament.

5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
