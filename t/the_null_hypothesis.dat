In 1941, he derived the exact {{distribution of the}} ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin–Watson statistic for testing <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.|$|E
25|$|As such, {{the only}} {{hypothesis}} {{that needs to}} be specified in this test and which embodies the counter-claim is referred to as <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> (that is, the hypothesis to be nullified). A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> That is, as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning, the statistically significant result should be highly improbable if <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is assumed to be true. The rejection of <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> However, unless there is a single alternative to <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> the rejection of null hypothesis does not tell us which of the alternatives might be the correct one.|$|E
25|$|Fallacy of the {{transposed}} conditional, aka prosecutor's fallacy: criticisms arise {{because the}} hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (<b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis)</b> to be favored, since {{what is being}} evaluated is probability of the observed result given <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> and not probability of <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> given the observed result. An alternative to this approach is offered by Bayesian inference, although it requires establishing a prior probability.|$|E

50|$|Fisher's {{method is}} {{typically}} {{applied to a}} collection of independent test statistics, usually from separate studies having <b>the</b> same <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>The</b> meta-analysis <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{is that all of}} <b>the</b> separate <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> are true. <b>The</b> meta-analysis alternative hypothesis is {{that at least one of}} the separate alternative hypotheses is true.|$|R
25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. <b>The</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how {{likely it is that}} we would observe 10 counts per minute if <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> were true. If <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus we can say that the suitcase is compatible with <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of the test statistic under <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> partitions the possible values of T into those for which <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is rejectedthe so-called critical regionand those {{for which it is}} not. The probability of the critical region is α.|$|E
25|$|If the {{probability}} of obtaining a result as extreme as the one obtained, supposing that <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> were true, is lower than a pre-specified cut-off probability (for example, 5%), then the result {{is said to be}} statistically significant and <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is rejected.|$|E

40|$|A popular {{framework}} for false discovery control is the random effects {{model in which}} <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> {{are assumed to be}} independent.

25|$|A typeII error {{occurs when}} failing to detect an effect (adding {{fluoride}} to toothpaste protects against cavities) that is present. <b>The</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is false (i.e., adding fluoride is actually effective against cavities), but the experimental data {{is such that}} <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> cannot be rejected.|$|E
25|$|Size: For simple hypotheses, {{this is the}} test's {{probability}} of incorrectly rejecting <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The false positive rate. For composite hypotheses this is the supremum of the {{probability of}} rejecting <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> over all cases covered by <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The complement of the false positive rate is termed specificity in biostatistics.

See sensitivity and specificity and Type I and type II errors for exhaustive definitions.|$|E
25|$|The test {{described}} here is more fully the null-hypothesis statistical significance test. <b>The</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> represents {{what we would}} believe by default, before seeing any evidence. Statistical significance is a possible finding of the test, declared when the observed sample is unlikely to have occurred by chance if <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> were true. The name of the test describes its formulation and its possible outcome. One characteristic of the test is its crisp decision: to reject or not reject <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> A calculated value is compared to a threshold, which is determined from the tolerable risk of error.|$|E

40|$|This mini-review {{illustrates}} that testing <b>the</b> traditional <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{is not always}} the appropriate strategy. Half in jest, we discuss Aristotle’s scientific investigations into the shape of the earth in the context of evaluating <b>the</b> traditional <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> We conclude that Aristotle was actually interested in evaluating informative hypotheses. In contemporary science the situation is not much different. That is, many researchers have no particular interest in <b>the</b> traditional <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> More can be learned from data by evaluating specific expectations, or so-called informative hypotheses, than by testing <b>the</b> traditional <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> These informative hypotheses will be introduced while providing an overview of the literature on evaluating informative hypothesis...|$|R

25|$|Two {{hypothesis}} {{tests are}} particularly widely used. First, {{one wants to}} know if the estimated regression equation is any better than simply predicting that all values of the response variable equal its sample mean (if not, it is said to have no explanatory power). <b>The</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of no explanatory value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has explanatory power, is accepted. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of no explanatory power is accepted.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{approach is to}} test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> The probability of type I error is therefore {{the probability that the}} estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true (statistical significance) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> when <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is false.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a general class of nonparametric tests for {{treatment}} effects conditional on covariates. Our tests allow both conditional average treatment effects and distributional treatment effects. The hypotheses of interests {{can be either}} one-sided or two-sided. The test statistic {{is based on the}} (one-sided) L 1 -norms of uniformly consistent nonparametric kernel estimators of conditional expectations that characterize <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> Using <b>the</b> Poissionization techinque of Gine, Mason and Zaitsev (2003), we show that suitably studentized versions of our test statistics are asymptotically standard normal under <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> and also show that proposed nonparametric tests are consistent against general fixed alternatives. Furthermore, it turns out that our tests have non-negligible powers against local alternatives that are n 1 = 2 different from <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses,</b> where n is the sample size. We also provide some numerical results using the LaLonde (1986) ’s data set to illustrate the usefulness of our proposed tests...|$|R
30|$|As {{the reader}} can notice, apart from TOTAL-LOC-TC AO⇔OO and MOD AO⇔OO, all other p values are below the defined {{threshold}} of 0.05. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypotheses</b> (that is, <b>the</b> data has normal distribution) are rejected.|$|R

25|$|The typeI {{error rate}} or {{significance}} level is {{the probability of}} rejecting <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> given that it is true. It is denoted by the Greek letter α (alpha) and is also called the alpha level. Often, the significance level is set to 0.05 (5%), implying that it is acceptable to have a 5% probability of incorrectly rejecting <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Second, {{for each}} {{explanatory}} variable of interest, {{one wants to}} know whether its estimated coefficient differs significantly from zero—that is, whether this particular explanatory variable in fact has explanatory power in predicting the response variable. Here <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is that the true coefficient is zero. This hypothesis is tested by computing the coefficient's t-statistic, as {{the ratio of the}} coefficient estimate to its standard error. If the t-statistic is larger than a predetermined value, <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is rejected and the variable is found to have explanatory power, with its coefficient significantly different from zero. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of a zero value of the true coefficient is accepted.|$|E

25|$|In {{both cases}} the data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is false (that is, the coin is not fair somehow), but {{changing}} the sample size changes the p-value.

25|$|While in {{principle}} the acceptable level of statistical significance {{may be subject}} to debate, the p-value is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> This is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming <b>the</b> <b>null</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic.
