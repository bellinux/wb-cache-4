40|$|With so many {{references}} to Tiananmen {{showing up in}} the news, we wanted to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>break</b> from our time away to recommend {{a couple of the}} best uses of 1989 analogies (if we weren’t on hiatus, we’d also {{look at some of the}} worst, and there have been some pretty bad ones). One powerful rumination on the relevance of China’s 1989 for thinking about Iran’s 2009 is by Andrew Leonard of the “How the World Works” blog at Salon. com: He begins as follows: “In the spring of 1989, the fax machine was China’s Twitter — the miracle technology connecting Chinese democracy activists with each other and the outside world. In Berkeley, Calif., the apartment of one Chinese expat student who owned a fax became a 24 / 7 information clearinghouse. Documents produced by students camping out on the square would emerge magically from the machine in all their subversive glory”… Make the jump to read all of his “Tiananmen’s Bloody Lessons for Tehran,” which went up on Friday and has provoked some interesting comments. Also noteworthy, from early in the Iran crisis, was a post by Sam Crane at his “Useless Tree” site called “Tehran and Tiananmen. ” Posted on June 16, it begins: “Watching the extraordinary political events unfold in Iran, I am reminded of the massive protests that swept across China twenty years ago. Here are a couple of comparative ideas: 1) Protests of this sort start out spontaneously, in response to some unexpected political event (election fraud in Iran, Hu Yaobang’s death in China). But they create a self-reinforcing momentum, driven by the regime’s response to popular mobilization. In China, an editorial, reportedly written under the supervision of Deng Xiaoping, was published on April 26 th that harshly (in PRC political terms) criticized the student demonstrators. This sparked the massive march of April 27 th, which propelled the movement forward...|$|E

[...] She added that the group had recorded a song called [...] "Shoulda Put Something On", a track about teenage pregnancy, for the album. [...] "It is about a young couple arguing whether to keep their unplanned baby. It's not something any {{of us have been}} through personally. But everyone knows someone who has. The three of us wrote down our different perspectives and we based the song around that. It's our favourite track on the album." [...] The group were rumoured to be recording a song with Kylie Minogue for the album, after she expressed praise for their debut album Uncle B, however, Tulisa denied the rumours. The group announced that the album would be released on November 16, 2009, before revealing the album title. When covering for Semtex on BBC Radio 1Xtra, Fazer and Tulisa stated that their former manager, Dappy's father (Byron Contostavlos), wanted Against All Odds to be the title of their debut album, but after his death, they changed it to Uncle B in memory of him and so Against All Odds was the title for their second album. They also confirm this in the album booklet. The album includes six different collaborations, including an updated version of the Tinchy Stryder's single [...] "Number 1". Stryder's first verse was kept, but new verses by Tulisa and Fazer were recorded. The album was mixed at The Chairworks in Castleford Yorkshire by Kelvin Avon.

5000|$|NBC {{was also}} criticized by fans for {{incorporating}} long commercial breaks during the race, {{much longer than}} the breaks that Fox would run during its race telecasts. Two glaring problems with the NBC coverage were that restarts were often missed due to these extended commercial breaks, that breaks during green flag runs were too frequent. Fans and media columnists used [...] "Nothing But Commercials," [...] as a jocular acronym for NBC's coverage. This cliché was mocked in the film Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, during {{a scene in which}} NBC is shown to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> commercial <b>break</b> during <b>a</b> race (with a commercial for Applebee's) when Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) and Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) wreck their cars in a very long-lasting crash (NBC's announcing team at the time of Weber, Dallenbach and Parsons had cameos during the scene covering the fictional race).|$|R
