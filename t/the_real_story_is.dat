The more conservative radio-listeners in Concrete (who had been listening to The Chase and Sanborn Hour on another station) attempted to calm neighbors, reporting that they hadn't heard a thing about any [...] "disaster". Reporters heard soon after of the coincidental blackout of Concrete, and sent the story out over the international newswire and soon the town of Concrete was known (if only for a moment) worldwide.|$|R

50|$|While {{the game}} was high-scoring and exciting, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> emotions.

The second, larger perspective was that {{the game was}} played during the war with Iraq, and Operation Desert Storm had just started two days earlier. Some players asked that the game be delayed, but the league pressed on and players wore decals on their helmets supporting the troops. When Wayne Messmer stepped to the microphone and the organ began to play the pre-game National Anthem, the roam from the Chicago Stadium crowd, many of who waved flags and sparklers was deafening and sustained over {{the length of the}} song, totally overwhelming the performance, and creating a patriotic moment of history that transcended the sport.|$|R
