Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E

[...] Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook. On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark. When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising {{as a result of}} its phenomenal growth, he explained: I guess we could... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads... That's the simplest <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do.

[...] But he recognised Grey's clear commitment to Anglo-French unity and, following Russian mobilisation on 30 July, and the Kaiser's ultimatum to the Tsar on 1 August, he recognised the inevitability of war. From this point, he committed himself to participation, despite continuing Cabinet opposition; [...] "There is a strong party reinforced by Ll George Morley and Harcourt who are against any kind of intervention. Grey will never consent and I shall not separate myself from him." [...] Also, on 2 August, he received confirmation of Tory support from Bonar Law. In one of two extraordinary Cabinets held on that Sunday, Grey informed members of the 1912 Anglo-French naval talks and Asquith secured agreement to mobilise the fleet.|$|E
