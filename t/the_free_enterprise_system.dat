500|$|In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism" [...] for Associated Content, in which he posited that Hoodwinked! {{was one of the}} first postmodern {{animated}} films and also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling Hoodwinked! [...] "the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9/11", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on <b>the</b> <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>system.</b> He drew comparisons between the film's villain and the typical American business owner, going so far as to say that the character was [...] "clearly based on people like Bill Gates and Sam Walton". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition.|$|E

40|$|Influential {{economists and}} U. S. federal policy makers {{are of the}} opinion that much of U.

Alan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, credits economic expansion to the creation and diffusion of new technologies which have led to an expansion of business investment, increased productivity, and low levels of inflation and interest rates. Many of these new technologies, including improved products and services, are results of the monetary incentives endogenous to <b>the</b> U.

The growing role of innovation in the U.

40|$|Recent global {{recession}} has motivated this predominantly historical and exploratory research of thoughts and perceptions.

Two survey instruments on perceptions of ethics (with 110 participants) and religion (with 117 different participants), influenced by observations of various events of the recent years, were given to Business and Economics students at the PhD, Master’s, and undergraduate levels to assess the perceptions of some educated and/or being-educated people about the market economic system, ethics, and religion.

40|$|Whereas {{professional}} persuasion is a {{means to}} an immediate and instrumental end (such as increased sales or enhanced corporate image), ethical persuasion must rest on or serve a deeper, morally based final (or relative last) end. Among the moral final ends of journalism, for example, are truth and freedom. There is a very real danger that ad-vertisers and public relations practitioners will play an increasingly dysfunctional role in the communications process if means continue to be confused with ends in pro-fessional persuasive communications. Means and ends will continue to be confused unless advertisers and public relations practitioners reach some level of agreement as to the moral end toward which their efforts should be directed. In this article we advance a five-part test (the TARES test) that defines this moral end, establishes ethical boundaries that should guide persuasive practices, and serves as a set of action-guiding principles directed toward a moral consequence in profes-sional persuasion. The TARES Test consists of five principles: Truthfulness (of the message), Authenticity (of the persuader), Respect (for the persuadee), Equity (of the persuasive appeal) and Social Responsibility (for the common good). We provide checklists to guide the practitioner in moral reflection and application of TARES Test principles. Individuals active in some area of professional persuasive mass com-munication—that is, advertising, public relations, and so forth—fre-quently have a difficult time defending what it is they do from a societal, common good, and ethical perspective, in their own minds as well as in their conversations with others. Defenders—apologists—for advertising and public relations, although not denying that ethical considerations have been a problem, also contend that critics often overstate the case. Speaking specifically to the question of societal value, advertisers frequently contend that without advertising <b>the</b> American <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>system</b> simply would not exist. In this they echo the rhetoric of U. S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun in his opinio...|$|R
40|$|When Westernization was {{introduced}} into Ethiopia {{at the beginning}} of this century, it was to fulfil the need of a modernizing autocracy aspiring to enter the Technological Age. But through Westernization also came a very intense Anglo-American cultural penetration. The first group of Western-educated intelligentsia integrated themselves into the feudal system, embraced western values and the American way of life. Haile Selassie hoped that <b>the</b> American <b>free</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>system</b> would absorb those his bureaucracy could not. The missionary zeal that guided America's global policy of "containment" also created a situation whereby the U. S., in order to influence Ethiopian politics and particularly its youth, invested heavily in the ideological sector. Thus, the feudal regime, the U. S., and the first generation of Western educated elites became necessarily interdependent. There was however, a seed of contradiction in this alliance and the ideological bond that tied them. American education which moulded the new Ethiopian intelligentsia is rooted in the liberal-utilitarian tradition which promotes the values of metropolitan market economies. Autonomy and individual freedom [...] which forms the core of this liberal-utilitarian ideology [...] was accepted at face value by the new intelligentsia, but these ideological values could not be implemented in Haile Selassie's Ethiopia which was a dependent, modernizing autocracy tied to a metropolitan nation. Due to the fact that dependency and autocracy are dialectically opposed to autonomy and individual freedom, the liberal education disseminated through the Ethiopian school system and the political ideals connected with it were negated by the prevalent political realities in Ethiopia. There was also a further paradox. Since Haile Selassie's authoritarian system was guided by metropolitan capitalism, the alienated elites came to reject the latter ideology and turned towards a Socialist Political Prism. Ultimately, these new breed of Western educated intelligentsia, who were mostly students and teachers, ignited the sparks of the revolutionary ferment in the country, and all the military had to do in 1974 was deliver a coup de grace to Haile Selassie's feudal regime...|$|R
