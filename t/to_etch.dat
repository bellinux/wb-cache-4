40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a highly filled light-cured sealant (HFLCS) on the shear bond strength of metal, ceramic and titanium brackets bonded with resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC). Materials and Methods: A total of 60 freshly extracted maxillary premolars were randomly divided into six groups (10 in each group). In all groups, the teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 20 s and RMGIC (Fuji Ortho LC, GC Europe) was used for bracket bonding. Group 1 : Titanium brackets were bonded directly <b>to</b> <b>etched</b> enamel surfaces. Group 2 : Titanium brackets were bonded <b>to</b> <b>etched</b> enamel surfaces covered with HFLCS (Pro Seal, Reliance Orthodontic Products, Itasca, IL, USA). Group 3 : Metal brackets were bonded directly <b>to</b> <b>etched</b> enamel surfaces. Group 4 : Metal brackets were bonded <b>to</b> <b>etched</b> enamel surfaces covered with HFLCS. Group 5 : Ceramic brackets were bonded directly <b>to</b> <b>etched</b> enamel surfaces. Group 6 : Ceramic brackets were bonded <b>to</b> <b>etched</b> enamel surfaces covered with HFLCS. The specimens were tested in shear mode with a universal testing machine. After debonding, the teeth and the brackets were examined under a scanning electron microscope. Univariate analysis of variance (analysis) was performed to test the main effects of bracket type and HFLCS. Result and Conclusion: The effect of HFLCS on etched enamel surfaces did not affect the bond strength values and bond failure modes of metal, ceramic and Titanium brackets bonded with RMGI...|$|R

25|$|Colloidal {{lithography}} is {{inexpensive and}} can be used to create surfaces with controlled heights and diameters. Nanocolliods are used as an etch mask by spreading them along the material surface, and then ion beam bombardment or film evaporation is used <b>to</b> <b>etch</b> away around the nanocolliods, creating nanocolumns and nanopits, respectively. The final surface structure can be controlled by varying the area covered by colloids and the colloid size. The area covered by the colloids can be changed by modifying the ionic strength of the colloid solution. This technique is able to create large patterned surface areas, which is necessary for tissue engineering applications.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the glass}} panels also proceeded. The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates {{to assist with the}} {{selection}} of quotations for the panels. Research into the speeches and writings of famous disabled veterans was made, and hundreds of interviews with disabled veterans conducted. More than 700 quotations were gathered, but just 18 of them—representing a wide diversity of voices spread through time—were used. Initially, a New York-based firm was hired to fabricate the glass panels, but this company backed out of the project. Savoy Studios, a glass manufacturing firm located in Portland, Oregon, was then hired to inscribe and fabricate the panels. Individual sheets of glass were purchased from PPG Industries. Savoy Studios used a computer-controlled water jet cutter to carve the text into them. Moon Shadow Glass, a decorative glass fabricator (known for sandblasting artwork onto vandalized bus shelter glass for the TriMet bus system in Portland) used fine-art abrasive blasting <b>to</b> <b>etch</b> the photo-realistic images into the glass. Savoy Studios then used GlassLam, a liquid polymer trademarked by the GlassLam company of Pompano Beach, Florida, to laminate the glass sheets together into a panel. The laminate not only cemented the sheets together, but also filled in any empty spaces between the sheet. Savoy Studios then used a computer-controlled water jet to cut the panels to their final size.|$|E

50|$|Cleaning is the preparatory {{process of}} {{ensuring}} that the surface <b>to</b> be <b>etched</b> is free of contaminants which could negatively impact {{the quality of the}} finished part. An improperly cleaned surface could result in poor adhesion of the maskant, causing areas <b>to</b> be <b>etched</b> erroneously, or a non-uniform etch rate which could result in inaccurate final dimensions. The surface must be kept free from oils, grease, primer coatings, markings and other residue from the marking out process, scale (oxidation), and any other foreign contaminants. For most metals, this step can be performed by applying a solvent substance to the surface <b>to</b> be <b>etched,</b> washing away foreign contaminants. The material may also be immersed in alkaline cleaners or specialized de-oxidizing solutions. It is common practice in modern industrial chemical etching facilities that the workpiece never be directly handled after this process, as oils from human skin could easily contaminate the surface.|$|R
