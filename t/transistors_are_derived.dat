40|$|We {{propose a}} {{definition}} of the efficiency bandwidth for a power amplifier (PA) using a modulated signal as the signal bandwidth at which the amplifier efficiency has dropped {{to a level of}} 90 % of the maximum efficiency at small bandwidth. We introduce a Monte Carlo method to calculate the efficiency bandwidth for some popular PA architectures. The method assumes a given modulated signal at the load. From this load signal the wave forms at the drains of the <b>transistors</b> <b>are</b> <b>derived</b> and the energy dissipation in the transistors can be calculated. Using idealized transistors with no output capacitance the maximum realizable efficiency bandwidth of an asymmetrical Doherty amplifier is 60 %, which is much larger than that of an outphasing amplifier, which is 14 %. More realistic transistors that include output capacitances, need a matching circuit with a high Q-value which decreases the efficiency bandwidth. Using output capacitance values typical for LDMOS transistors, the asymmetrical Doherty amplifier shows an efficiency bandwidth of about 400 MHz for a signal centered at 1 GHz. For a signal at 2 GHz the efficiency bandwidth is found to be 520 MHz. Due to the fixed values of the output capacitances the efficiency bandwidth does not scale with frequency...|$|E

40|$|In this report, {{a future}} {{scenario}} concerning the economic {{direction of the}} computing industry has been presented. This future scenario was based on past developments within the computing industry. The continued miniaturization of semiconductor components was discussed based on observed trends for transistors. The physical limitations for <b>transistor</b> devices <b>were</b> also addressed. The use of x-ray lithography {{for the construction of}} devices on a “nano-scale ” was considered. Next, cost trends within the microelectronics industry were explored. Although the cost per <b>transistor</b> has <b>been</b> observed to decrease, total equipment costs and facilities costs were observed to rise. Trend extrapolation was next used to predict the future cost per transistor and the number of transistors per chip. By taking the product of these two predicted quantities, an equation for the future manufacturing cost per chip was determined. A parametric cost estimation model (VHSIC Model) for the prediction of avionics computer system costs was modified to reflect the future performance parameters of nanoelectronics. Using data from the x 86 design of Intel ® Microprocessor Chips, undetermined parameters of the Modified VHSIC Model were calculated. Next, future performance parameters were used in the model to predict the initial selling price of future chips.

Furthermore, the influence from including self-consistency and non-parabolicity in the band structure simulations is quantified. It is demonstrated that the effective mass approximation underestimates the transistor performance due to the highly non-parabolic conduction band in InAs. Neglecting self-consistency severely overestimates the device performance, especially for thick nanowires. The error introduced by both of these approximations gets increasingly worse under high bias conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{threshold}} voltages of {{a carbon}} nanotube (CNT) field-effect <b>transistor</b> (FET) <b>are</b> <b>derived</b> and {{compared with those}} of the metal oxide-semiconductor (MOS) FETs. The CNT channel is so thin that there is no voltage drop perpendicular to the gate electrode plane, which is the CNT diameter direction, and this makes the CNTFET characteristics quite different from those in MOSFETs. The relation between the voltage and the electrochemical potentials, and the mass action law for electrons and holes are examined in the context of CNTs, and it is shown that the familiar relations are still valid because of the macroscopic number of states available in the CNTs. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} cases of quantum dots. Using these relations, we derive an inversion threshold voltage V(sub Ti) and an accumulation threshold voltage V(sub Ta) as a function of the Fermi level E(sub F) in the channel, where E(sub F) is a measure of channel doping. V(sub Ti) of the CNTFETs has a much stronger dependence than that of MOSFETs, while V(sub Ta) s of both CNTFETs and MOSFETs depend quite weakly on E(sub F) with the same functional form. This means the transition from normally-off mode to normally-on mode is much sharper in CNTFETs as the doping increases, and this property has to be taken into account in circuit design...|$|R
