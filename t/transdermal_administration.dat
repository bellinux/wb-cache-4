40|$|The {{detection}} of testosterone abuse in sports is routinely achieved through the ‘steroidal module’ of the Athlete Biological Passport by GC-MS(/MS) quantification of selected endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids (EAAS) from athletes’ urines. To overcome some {{limitations of the}} Burinary steroid profile^ such {{as the presence of}} confounding factors (ethnicity, enzyme polymorphism, bacterial contamination, and ethanol), ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) measurements of blood concentrations of testosterone, its major metabolites, and precursors could represent an interesting and complementary strategy. In this work, two UHPLC-MS/MS methods were developed for the quantification of testosterone and related compounds in human serum, including major progestogens, corticoids, and estrogens. The validated methods were then used for the analyses of serum samples collected from 19 healthy male volunteers after oral and <b>transdermal</b> testosterone <b>administration.</b> Results from unsupervised multiway analysis allowed variations of target analytes to be assessed simultaneously over a 96 -h time period. Except for alteration of concentration values due to the circadian rhythm, which concerns mainly corticosteroids, DHEA, and progesterone, significant variations linked to the oral and <b>transdermal</b> testosterone <b>administration</b> were observed for testosterone, DHT, and androstenedione. As a second step of analysis, the longitudinal monitoring of these biomarkers using intra-individual thresholds showed, in comparison to urine, significant improvements in the {{detection of}} testosterone administration, especially for volunteers with del/del genotype for phase II UGT 2 B 17 enzyme, not sensitive to the main urinarymarker, T/E ratio.

40|$|Constipation is {{an almost}} {{universal}} side-effect associated with chronic opioid analgesia. The resulting discomfort can for some patients be moro severe than the pain itself, leading to a reduction of analgesic use and consequently to increased pain. Clinical trials consistently show less constipation in patients treated with transdermal fentanyl than in patients receiving oral morphine. Several reasons can be identified for this finding: owing to its higher lipophilicity, fentanyl penetrates the blood-brain barrier more easily and lower dosing is possible; owing to the <b>transdermal</b> route of <b>administration</b> of fentanyl, comparatively less opioid {{is available in the}} gastrointestinal tract to block local opioid receptors; finally, the <b>transdermal</b> route of <b>administration</b> leads to stable plasma levels of fentanyl over 72 h and hence minimises the probability of overdosing that can occur with multiple daily dosing.

40|$|Initial {{experience}} in <b>transdermal</b> <b>administration</b> of Restylane SubQ for augmentation of {{the cheek and}} chin suggests that the product is easy to administer via this route and that it provides a stable aesthetic result. Local adverse reactions {{are consistent with those}} expected of an alloplastic filler material and appear {{to be related to the}} injection procedure/site rather than to the product itself. In the event of overcorrection or the appearance of superficial irregularities (nodules), any excess material can readily be removed by needle aspiration. Several measures can be taken to increase the likelihood of a satisfactory aesthetic outcome and minimize the risk of treatment complications with Restylane SubQ. One such measure is to deposit the product in small aliquots at multiple sites (using a multiple tunneling technique) to avoid pooling within the soft tissues. Treatment sites with poor soft-tissue cover pose a chal-lenge because of the high risk of surface irregularities. In cheek augmentation procedures, Restylane SubQ should be placed below the zygomatic arch where the subcutaneous tissue is more fibrous, thereby providing a possible barrier to implant mobility. The chin appears to be particularly well suited to volume augmentation with Restylane SubQ because its dense fibrous tissue creates naturally occurring pockets for product placement.

Cases and controls, frequency matched by age, sex and study centre, were interviewed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quintile of fibre intake, the odds ratios (ORs) for the highest quintile were 0. 3 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 2 - 0. 4] for total fibre, 0. 3 (95 % CI 0. 2 - 0. 5) for soluble non-cellulose polysaccharides (NCP) and for total insoluble fibre, including cellulose (OR = 0. 3, 95 % CI 0. 2 - 0. 4) and insoluble NCP (OR = 0. 4, 95 % CI 0. 3 - 0. 7). The ORs were 0. 2 (95 % CI 0. 1 - 0. 4) for fibre from vegetables, 0. 5 (95 % CI 0. 3 - 0. 7) from fruit and 1. 1 (95 % CI 0. 6 - 1. 9) from grains.

40|$|Background. Severe burn trauma {{leads to}} an {{immediate}} and strong inflammatory response inciting cardiac dysfunction {{that is associated with}} high morbidity and mortality. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether transdermal application of nicotine could influence the burn-induced cardiac dysfunction via its known immunomodulatory effects. Material and Methods. A standardized rat burn model was used in 35 male Sprague Dawley rats. The experimental animals were divided into a control group, a burn trauma group, a burn trauma group with additional nicotine treatment, and a sham group with five experimental animals per group. The latter two groups received nicotine administration. Using microtip catheterization, functional parameters of the heart were assessed 12 or 24 hours after infliction of burn trauma. Results. Burn trauma led to significantly decreased blood pressure (BP) values whereas nicotine administration normalized BP. As expected, burn trauma also induced a significant deterioration of myocardial contractility and relaxation parameters. After application of nicotine these adverse effects were attenuated. Conclusion. The present study showed that <b>transdermal</b> nicotine <b>administration</b> has normalizing effects on burn-induced myocardial dysfunction parameters. Further research is warranted to gain insight in molecular mechanisms and pathways and to evaluate potential treatment options in humans...|$|R
