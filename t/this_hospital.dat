5|$|During {{the rule}} of Grand Master Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to take hold of the Order's hospital. <b>This</b> <b>hospital</b> was a privileged place and nobody could be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident.|$|E

5|$|In November 1944 Duff Cooper was {{appointed}} British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the Hôtel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper {{complained to the}} French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, {{he managed to get}} Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more comfortable than where they had been detained. While in <b>this</b> <b>hospital,</b> Wodehouse worked on his novel Uncle Dynamite.|$|E
5|$|Taken {{together}} with the other sources above, <b>this</b> <b>Hospital</b> {{must be seen as}} a significant medieval establishment. It served a number purposes; especially the provision of a sub-monastic care home for locals. There is no clear evidence about the inclusion of women. The location of the hospital adjacent to a river crossing on the drove road indicates that it was a travellers inn. The hospital at Soutra Aisle in the Scottish Borders served a similar purpose. In addition to being a Traveller's Inn, {{it may have been a}} Chantry for the Cathedral in Old Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following <b>this,</b> <b>hospital</b> staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of 1922, Forbes had met Elias Mortimer, agent for the Thompson-Black Construction Company of St. Louis, which wanted to construct the hospitals. The two men became close, and Mortimer paid for Forbes' travels through the West, looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans. Forbes was also friendly with Charles F. Hurley, owner of the Hurley-Mason Construction Company of Washington state. Harding had ordered that all contracts be pursuant to public notice, but the three worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided three ways. Some of the money went to the bureau's chief counsel, Charles F. Cramer. Forbes defrauded the government in <b>this</b> <b>hospital</b> construction, increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed. A tenth of the inflated construction billings was {{set aside for the}} conspirators, with Forbes receiving a third of the take. The graft then spread to land acquisition, with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract – that was worth less than $20,000 – for $105,000. At least $25,000 of the resulting financial excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer.|$|E
