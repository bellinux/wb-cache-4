5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> {{historian}} Joseph Medicine Crow, {{whose family}} were close friends of Marquis, Marquis would engage in animated sign language with Leforge while driving. This once caused an accident when Marquis rear-ended another vehicle while so distracted.|$|E

5|$|In early September Marquis went to Lame Deer for the Cheyenne annual fair. There, Willis Rowland {{helped him}} compile {{a list of}} elderly Cheyennes. Although the Custer {{battlefield}} was on <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> Reservation, <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> {{had been on the}} US side during the Great Sioux War of 1876, of which the Custer battle was a part, and so would have no eyewitnesses to the battle, everybody fighting with Custer having been killed. Back in Lodge Grass, Marquis made two important contacts. In November, he had his first meeting with Thomas H. Leforge. Leforge lived among <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> and had been a scout and interpreter for General Gibbon in the 1876 war. Leforge would be the subject of the first book Marquis succeeded in publishing, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian. The second contact was William H. White, who was with the Second Cavalry under Gibbon. White would be the subject of Custer, Cavalry & Crows.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in what is today South Dakota for several {{thousand}} years. The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC. Between 500AD and 800AD, a semi-nomadic people known as the Mound Builders lived {{in central and eastern}} South Dakota. In the 14th century, <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> Creek Massacre occurred, in which several hundred men, women, and children were killed near the Missouri River.|$|E

After a break of eleven years, Nesbitt returned to the stage to make his London West End debut in Owen McCafferty's Shoot <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> (2005).|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>crows</b> {{are just}} outdoors, Oswald {{attempts}} to put salt on their tails. One of <b>the</b> <b>crows,</b> however, is clever {{to replace the}} salt shaker with one containing pepper. When Oswald sprinkles pepper which has no effect, that <b>crow</b> blows <b>the</b> condiment on the rabbit's face. But as Oswald sneezes, <b>the</b> <b>crows</b> have their feathers blown off, therefore eliminating their ability to fly. <b>The</b> <b>crows</b> still choose to get away on foot. Oswald resorts to shooting arrows. One of Oswald's arrows unintendedly hits a giant serpent. The provoked serpent heads toward the hippo king's castle. Oswald and <b>the</b> <b>crows</b> hide themselves in the pie. The serpent also enters the dish.|$|R

The Mula Gosain Charita gives an account of his travels to the four pilgrimages of Hindus (Badrinath, Dwarka, Puri and Rameshwaram) and the Himalayas.

5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
50|$|While {{underground}}, <b>the</b> <b>crows</b> {{believe that}} they are safe only to find that the Red knew other cats.

5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC.

The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{was taught}} Indian Sign Language by <b>the</b> <b>Crow.</b> This {{would be a}} great help to him in his {{research}} as the language was common to all the plains tribes. Marquis also had lessons from John Stands in Timber, the Cheyenne tribal historian and grandson of Lame White Man, a Cheyenne chief killed in the battle with Custer. Together with co-author Margot Liberty, Stands in Timber published Cheyenne Memories shortly before he died in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in a review of}} fossil birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina. Finds included an early Miocene loon Colymboides minutus, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern royal tern Sterna maxima, and a member of <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> genus, one of the few fossil passerine birds from that period. The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually be placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E

5|$|Treaties between European {{settlers}} and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands {{and on to}} smaller reservations. In 1861, residents of Mankato formed the Knights of the Forest, with a goal of eliminating all Indians from Minnesota. As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota, tensions rose, leading to the Dakota War of 1862. The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Dakota and the exile {{of most of the}} rest of the Dakota to <b>the</b> <b>Crow</b> Creek Reservation in Dakota Territory. As many as 800 white settlers died during the war.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as <b>the</b> <b>crow</b> flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
