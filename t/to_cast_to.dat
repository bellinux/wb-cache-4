6000|$|Then, as his {{thoughts}} travelled {{on to the}} source of the misapprehension he remembered his son, and the memory was like an icy hand upon his temples that chilled him through and through. Lying there with eyes still closed he groaned. Happiness was within his grasp at last. Love might be his again did he but ask it, and the love of as pure and sweet a creature as ever God sent to chasten a man's life. A great tenderness possessed him. A burning temptation <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>to</b> the winds his plighted word, to make a mock of faith, to deride honour, and to seize this woman for his own. She loved him he knew it now; he loved her--the knowledge had come as suddenly upon him. Compared with this what could his faith, his word, his honour give him? What to him, in the face of this, was that paltry fellow, his son, who had spurned him! ...|$|E

50|$|From North Carolina south the redfish (red drum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{targeted}} fish by surf anglers. Fishermen use rods 10 to 13 feet <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>to</b> drum using baits like cut mullet, bunker (cut menhaden, or pogies as Carolina anglers call them), and cut bait from spot, croaker, or bluefish. Red drum hit a bait aggressively and are a much beloved surf fishing species. The overfished status of this fish for many years due to the blackened redfish craze of the 1980s led to strict recreational size and creel limits, however, so surf anglers must learn the local rules.|$|E
50|$|Players {{also give}} {{specific}} orders {{to each of}} their commanders at the strategic level, such as attacking enemy territory (with any troops under their command); casting a ritual magic spell; forging a magical object; assassinating an enemy commander while hiding in enemy domain; or constructing a building (temple, laboratory, or castle). Planning for combat involves organizing troops under commanders and issuing up to five tactical battle instructions (such as magic spells <b>to</b> <b>cast)</b> <b>to</b> the commanders, and simpler orders to troop squads. Each commander can control up to 5 squads and his leadership skills limit the total and kinds of troops he can command. Leading magical, undead, or demonic troops requires appropriate magical skills. Troops and commanders are organized and a simple overhead-view grid {{can be used to}} place them in specific starting locations for combat.|$|E
50|$|Alisa Freindlich was the director's primary {{choice for}} the role of Kalugina. Eldar Ryazanov created the {{character}} having in mind Freindlich as the one to portray it. Moreover, he started working on the screenplay seriously only after securing consent of all the actors he wanted <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>to</b> participate in the film. It was a rare case in Soviet cinema when a director would be allowed to cast all actors of his own choice without preliminary screen-tests and approval of the Art Council. Ryazanov worried that Freindlich {{would not be able to}} come to Moscow for shooting of the film because of stage performances and rehearsals she was busy with in her native Leningrad. So he assured both the actress and her management that she would be allowed to go to Leningrad on the first demand. It came out that she was compelled to leave for the theater often and thus travel between Moscow and Leningrad all the time.|$|E

5000|$|... 1. Feed {{however much}} line {{you want to}} cast into the river, letting it drift {{downstream}} (to your left).2. Make sure you're facing downstream with the rod tip pointing down or the rod just off the water level. 3. Hold the lower grip of the rod with your hand {{that is on the}} downstream side (your left hand); the right hand is on the upper grip. 4. Lift the rod up at a steady pace so almost all of the line in the river is {{out of the water and}} being brought up towards you, and gently rotate your body to face more across the river & towards your target of the cast.5. As you lift the line with the above move, this is followed by gently dropping the rod tip down in a small arc as you lift it upstream, and smoothly pull the rod up and upstream at the same time.6. The end of the fly line, the nylon leader and the fly should come back upstream towards you, and you should aim for the fly and some of the leader to gently kiss the water about a rod length out in the river and a little upstream of your casting position; right before the fly kisses the water, raise the rod tip as if you were going to make a roll cast, and make a powerful forward stroke in the direction you are facing out across the river.7. You should be able to achieve and angle change (the angle between where the fly line ended up downstream before the next cast, and where you want <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>to</b> target) of around 45 degrees with ease. 8. As you make the forward casting stroke, the upper hand (right hand in this case) will push the rod and tip forwards towards the target, and the aerialised loop of line (from the rod tip to the water) will then be re-energised in the new direction of the casting stroke. The fly line will then progress over the river, unfurling the energised loop (the D Loop) as it goes, and the line, leader and the fly should end up towards the other side of the river (target).|$|E
40|$|Slips {{and casting}} are {{considered}} {{in terms of}} physical and colloidal chemistry. Casting slips are polydisperse suspensions of lyophobic particles in water, whose degree of coagulation is controlled by interaction of flocculating and deflocculating agents. Slip casting rate and viscosity are functions of temperature. Slip rheology and response to deflocculating agents varies significantly as the kinds and amounts of colloid modifiers change. Water is considered as a raw material. Various concepts of water/clay interactions and structures are discussed. Casting is a de-watering operation in which water moves from slip <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>to</b> mold {{in response to a}} potential energy termed moisture stress. Drying is an evaporative process from a free water surface...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Some {{patients}} showed unusual {{responses to}} the immobilization without any objective findings with casts in upper extremities. We hypothesized their that intolerance with excessive anxiety to casts is due to claustrophobia triggered by cast immobilization. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the relevance of cast immobilization to the feeling of claustrophobia and discover how to handle them. Methods. There were nine patients who showed the caustrophobic symptoms with their casts. They were assesed whether they were aware of their claustrophobis themselves. Further we investigated the alternative immobilization to casts. Results. Seven out of nine cases that were aware of their claustrophobic tendencies either were given removable splints initially or had the casts converted to removable splints when they exhibited symptoms. The two patients who were unaware of their latent claustrophobic tendencies were identified when they showed similar claustrophobic symptoms to the previous patients soon after short arm cast application. We replaced the casts with removable splints. This resolved the issue in all cases. Conclusions. We should be aware of the claustrophobia if patients showed unusual {{responses to the}} immobilization without any objective findings with casts in upper extremities, where removal splint is practical alternative <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>to</b> continue the treatment successfully...|$|E

40|$|A new particle-based reduced-complexity {{model to}} {{simulate}} sediment transport and channel morphology in steep streams in presented. The model CAST (Cellular Automaton Sediment Transport) contains phenomenological parameterizations, deterministic or stochastic, of sediment supply, bed load transport, and particle entrainment and deposition in a cellular-automaton space with uniform grain size. The model reproduces a realistic bed morphology and typical fluctuations in transport rates observed in steep channels. Particle hop distances, from entrainment to deposition, are well fitted by exponential distributions, {{in agreement with}} field data. The effect of stochasticity in both the entrainment and the input rate is shown. A stochastic parameterization of the entrainment is essential to create and maintain a realistic channel morphology, while the intermittent transport of grains in CAST shreds the input signal and its stochastic variability. A jamming routine has been added <b>to</b> <b>CAST</b> <b>to</b> simulate the grain‚Äìgrain and grain‚Äìbed interactions that lead to particle jamming and step formation in a step-pool stream. The results show that jamming is effective in generating steps in unsteady conditions. Steps are created during high-flow periods and they survive during low flows only in sediment-starved conditions, {{in agreement with the}} jammed-state hypothesis of Church and Zimmermann¬†(2007). Reduced-complexity models like CAST give new insights into the dynamics of complex phenomena such as sediment transport and bedform stability and are a useful complement to fully physically based models to test research hypotheses...|$|E
