Four years later on August 22, 1848, they were married at Julia's home in St. Louis. Grant's {{abolitionist}} father Jesse, who disapproved of <b>the</b> <b>Dents</b> owning slaves, refused to attend their wedding, which took place without either of Grant's parents. Grant was flanked by three fellow West Point graduates, all dressed in their blue uniforms, including Longstreet, Julia's cousin. At the end of the month, Julia was nevertheless warmly received by Grant's family in Bethel, Ohio. They had four children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr. ("Buck"), Ellen ("Nellie"), and Jesse. After the wedding, Grant obtained a two-month extension to his leave and returned to St. Louis when he decided, with a wife to support, that he would remain in the army.|$|E

2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with <b>the</b> <b>dents</b> {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} a local dent on a {{pressurized}} pipe is studied in this paper. Two case problems of dent are considered - a plain local dent (a smooth local dent without a surface defect), and a local dent associated {{with a loss of}} thickness defect. The strain gauging test and the finite element analysis on <b>the</b> plain local <b>dent</b> showed that <b>the</b> strain distributions in <b>the</b> local <b>dent</b> are different from those of a long and continuous <b>dent.</b> <b>The</b> maximum hoop strain in <b>the</b> local <b>dent</b> is located at the flank of <b>the</b> <b>dent,</b> along <b>the</b> <b>dent</b> axial axis, whereas in the case of <b>the</b> long <b>dent,</b> it is located at the root of <b>the</b> <b>dent.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> peak stress in <b>the</b> local <b>dent</b> is generally lower than that in <b>the</b> long <b>dent.</b> To estimate <b>the</b> stress concentration in <b>the</b> local <b>dent</b> using <b>the</b> analysis for <b>the</b> long <b>dent</b> would be grossly overestimated. The burst pipe tests on 17 dented pipes showed that the pipe failures were generally insensitive to the existence of <b>the</b> local <b>dents.</b> <b>The</b> pipe failures were found to be due to the loss-of-thickness defect. The comparison of results between the burst pipe tests and the plastic collapse formula shows reasonably good agreement. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

60|$|That {{was a year}} ago, {{and since}} then I have only heard {{the history of the}} smoking-table in fragments. My brother liked it immensely; but he thought it was too luxurious for a married man, so he sent it to Reynolds, in Edinburgh.

Later a town man sent it to a country gentleman as just the thing for the country; and it was afterward in Liverpool as the very thing for a town. There I thought it was lost, so far as I was concerned. One day, however, Boyd, {{a friend of mine who}} lives in Glasgow, came to me for a week, and about six hours afterward he said that he had a present for me. He brought it into my sitting-room--a bulky parcel--and while he was undoing the cords he told me it was something quite novel; he had bought it in Glasgow the day before.

I recognized it by <b>the</b> <b>dents.</b> I was too much the gentleman to insist on an explanation from Boyd; but, though it seems a harsh thing to say, my opinion is that these different persons gave the table away because they wanted to get rid of it.

60|$|The {{standard}} of morality at Milby, you perceive, was not inconveniently high in those good old times, and an ingenuous vice or two was what every man expected of his neighbour.

The fact that he read nothing at all now, and that his mind seemed absorbed in the commonest matters, was doubtless due to his having exhausted the resources of erudition earlier in life.
