5|$|While some mythological {{beings are}} common to all Slavic ethnic groups, ale seem to be {{exclusive}} to Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serb folklore. Even so, other Slavic groups also had demons of bad weather. Among East Slavs, this witch was called Baba Yaga, and was imagined as a woman of gigantic stature with a big nose, iron teeth, and protruding chin; {{it was believed that}} she ate children, and her presence brought thunderstorms and cold weather. The term baba is present in customs, beliefs, and toponyms of all Slavic groups, usually as a personification of wind, darkness, and rain. This leads some scholars <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> was a proto-Slavic divinity or demon called Baba, associated with bad weather.|$|E

25|$|In 1877, {{the crew}} of the {{schooner}} Bencleugh was shipwrecked on the islands for four months; folklore says they came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> was hidden treasure on the island. The ship's owner, John Sen Inches Thomson, wrote a book on his sea travels, including his time on the island. The book, written in 1912, was entitled Voyages and Wanderings In Far-off Seas and Lands.|$|E

25|$|This led Cuvier {{to become}} an active proponent of the {{geological}} school of thought called catastrophism, which maintained {{that many of the}} geological features of the earth and the history of life could be explained by catastrophic events that had caused the extinction of many species of animals. Over the course of his career, Cuvier came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> had not been a single catastrophe, but several, resulting in a succession of different faunas. He wrote about these ideas many times, in particular he discussed them in great detail in the preliminary discourse (an introduction) to a collection of his papers, Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupèdes (Researches on quadruped fossil bones), on quadruped fossils published in 1812.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, several murders at the Town Center Mall gained {{national}} attention. In March, a 52 {{year old}} woman was kidnapped and murdered. In December {{of the same}} year, a 47 year old woman and her 7 year old daughter were also kidnapped, and later found bound and {{shot in the head}} in the woman's SUV in the mall parking lot. This case was featured on America's Most Wanted and caused host John Walsh to say he believed a serial killer to be in the city. Though there is no forensic evidence to suggest the murders were committed by the same person, the similarities in the cases lead police <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> were related. To this day, the murders all remain unsolved.|$|E
25|$|Any {{police officer}} may, without warrant, arrest and detain pending {{enquiries}} any person {{in respect of}} whom he has reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> are grounds which would justify the person's detention. In the 1960 case of Re Ong Yew Teck, the High Court held that since a police officer ordering an arrest {{is not required to}} disclose facts which he considers to be against the public interest to disclose, it is futile for a court to objectively decide whether there are grounds justifying detention. Therefore, a subjective test is to be applied – if the police officer honestly supposes he has reason to believe the required element, the court cannot go behind the officer's statement. However, Ong Yew Teck may no longer be good law in view of the Court of Appeal's more recent decision in Kamal Jit Singh (above).|$|E
25|$|A retired Chicago {{police officer}} named Bill Dorsch has stated he has reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> {{may be more}} victims buried within {{the grounds of the}} {{apartment}} building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago; a property which Gacy is known to have been the caretaker of for several years prior to his 1978 arrest. In 1975, Dorsch—then a Chicago police officer—observed Gacy (whom he knew on a casual basis), holding a shovel {{in the early hours of}} the morning. When confronted by Dorsch as to his actions, Gacy stated he was performing work that he was too busy to do during the day. Dorsch has also related that several other residents of West Miami Avenue have stated that, in the early- to mid-1970s, they had observed Gacy digging trenches in the grounds of the property; one of these residents has also stated that Gacy would later place plants in the elongated trenches he had dug. At the time these actions had been observed, Gacy had still been married to Carole Hoff. Following his first murder in January 1972, he is not known to have buried any murder victims beneath his own home until one month after his March, 1976 divorce. (John Butkovitch had been buried beneath his garage and the unknown victim known as Body 28 had been buried in his backyard.) Gacy's wife had informed investigators that, on several occasions in the years preceding their divorce, she had found several men's wallets and identification cards discarded about the property at 8213 Summerdale. When she had confronted Gacy about these items, he had angrily informed her the property was none of her business.|$|E

Guest actor Seth Gabel had previously played just one version of character Lincoln Lee, who existed {{as the head of}} Fringe division in the parallel universe. [...] "Stowaway" [...] marked the first appearance of the character from the prime universe. Gabel described his prime universe character as someone who works for the FBI, [...] "but has no idea about Fringe Division. He's more of a desk jockey [...] eventually comes <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is much more than reality suggests". Executive producer Jeff Pinkner described Lincoln's introduction as [...] "insanely fun -- the characterization Seth has created just makes you smile".

[...] The director of the Bureau of the Budget said no, but would agree to the Navy adapting legislation similar to the WAAC – where women were with, but not in the Navy. [...] This was unacceptable to Knox and the standoff began. Still, the Bureau of Aeronautics continued <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> was a place for women in the Navy, and appealed to an influential friend of naval aviation, Margaret Chung. [...] In Crossed Currents, the authors describe Chung and her involvement. [...] "...Dr. Margaret Chung of San Francisco, a physician and surgeon, had a long time interest in aviation, particularly naval aviation... She had many naval aviation friends who referred to themselves as [...] "sons of Mom Chung." [...] Having learned of the stalemate, she asked Representative Melvin Maas of Minnesota, who had served in the aviation branch of the U.S. Marine Corps in World War I, and was one of her [...] "sons", to introduce legislation independently of the Navy.

[...] Wysel wrote, [...] "When the flugelhorn arrives on 'Nice Weather for Ducks' it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is any evil in the world." [...] Conversely, several critics felt that [...] "Experiment Number Six" [...] did not fit with the mood {{of the rest of the}} album. Wysel called it a [...] "pool of darkness" [...] that [...] "comes as quite a shock." [...] Dahlen felt that the song [...] "is the only break in the [...] mood." [...] While he enjoyed the song's concept, calling it [...] "so different and sinister that it's more intriguing than the rest of the album", he felt that it was [...] "annoyingly displaced."

[...] Prime Minister Pašić himself made these denials to Az Est on 7 July and to the Paris Edition of the New York Herald on 20 July. Other voices eventually spoke out on the “warning”. As Serbian Education Minister Ljuba Jovanović wrote in Krv Sloventsva, in late May or early June, Prime Minister Pašić reviewed {{the plot of the}} impending assassination with members of his cabinet. On 18 June, a telegram, lacking in specifics, ordered Serbia's Ambassador to Vienna, Jovan Jovanović, to warn Austria-Hungary that Serbia had reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> was a conspiracy to assassinate Franz Ferdinand in Bosnia. On 21 June, Ambassador Jovanović met with Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister Bilinski. [...] According to Serbian Military Attaché to Vienna, Colonel Lesanin, Ambassador Jovanović, spoke to Bilinski and [...] "...stressed in general terms the risks the Archduke heir apparent might run from the inflamed public opinion in Bosnia and Serbia. [...] Some serious personal misadventure might befall him. His journey might give rise to incidents and demonstrations that Serbia would deprecate but that would have fatal repercussions on Austro-Serbian relations." [...] Jovanović came back from the meeting with Bilinski and told Lesanin that [...] "...Bilinski showed no sign of attaching great importance to the total message and dismissed it limiting himself to remarking when saying goodbye and thanking him: [...] 'Let us hope nothing does happen.'" [...] The Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister took no action based on Jovanović's remarks.|$|E
