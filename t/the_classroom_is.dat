Once <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> vacant, a pencil holder rattles to create the ringing of a telephone.

25|$|The Education (Scotland) Act 1872, which {{completely}} ignored Gaelic, {{and led to}} {{generations of}} Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> <b>is</b> now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living can recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school. Even later, when these attitudes had changed, little provision was made for Gaelic medium education in Scottish schools. As late as 1958, even in Highland schools, only 20% of primary students were taught Gaelic as a subject, and only 5% were taught other subjects through the Gaelic language.|$|E
25|$|Student {{involvement}} in <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> {{a key part}} of OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E

2500|$|Students {{sometimes}} resist critical pedagogy. Student {{resistance to}} critical pedagogy {{can be attributed}} to a variety of reasons. Student objections may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: [...] "Resistance in this context thus occurs when students are asked to shift not only their perspectives, but also their subjectivities as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed." [...] Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or ideologies, introduced in <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> <b>is</b> a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.|$|E

The lower courts in British Columbia and, later, the Supreme Court of Canada, ruled in favour of Trinity Western University, stating {{that there was no}} basis for the BCCT's decision, and, moreover, that [...] "the concern that graduates of TWU will act in a detrimental fashion in <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> not supported by any evidence".|$|E
2500|$|Waldorf preschools {{employ a}} regular daily routine that {{includes}} free play, artistic work (e.g. drawing, painting or modeling), circle time (songs, games, and stories), outdoor recess, and practical tasks (e.g. cooking, cleaning, and gardening), with rhythmic variations. Periods of outdoor recess are also usually included. <b>The</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> intended {{to resemble a}} home, with tools and toys usually sourced from simple, natural materials that lend themselves to imaginative play. The use of natural materials has been widely praised as fulfilling children's aesthetic needs, encouraging their imagination, and reinforcing their identification with nature, though one pair of reviewers questioned whether the preference for natural, non-manufactured materials is [...] "a reaction against the dehumanizing aspects of nineteenth-century industrialization" [...] rather than a [...] "reasoned assessment of twenty-first century children's needs".|$|E
2500|$|The {{choice to}} {{integrate}} multimodal forms in <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> not accepted unproblematically by everyone in educational communities. In Charles Bazerman’s essay, “The Case for Writing Studies as a Major Discipline,” he states “multimodal compositions {{are seen in}} the classrooms across the country {{but there seems to}} be a lack of support from the institutions to advance what the instructors are bringing into the classroom." [...] The idea of learning has changed over the years and now, some argue, must adapt to the personal and affective needs of new students. According to Kress and Bezemer, “education has to accommodate to ‘life-long’, ‘life-wide’ learning, that is, learning at all times, by those who demand that their interests be taken with utmost seriousness, in all sites, in all phases of professional and personal life.” As a result, some administrations may be reluctant to institute wide-spread change without assurance of results. In order for classroom communities to be legitimately multimodal, all members of the community must share expectations about what can be done with through integration, requiring a [...] "shift in many educators’ thinking about what constitutes literacy teaching and learning in a world no longer bounded only by print text." ...|$|E
