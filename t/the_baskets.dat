5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, {{one of a series of}} eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} parachutes {{as her husband}} had, parachuting dogs from her balloon, {{and as part of}} her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes. Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.|$|E
5|$|The electors {{were then}} told {{to break up}} the Convention and {{assemble}} into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. <b>The</b> <b>baskets</b> that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.|$|E

25|$|Basket interference, or goaltending is a {{violation}} charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot. This violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> unless {{it is obvious that}} the ball has no chance of entering <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim, or in the area extended upwards from <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> or if a player reaches through <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> to interfere with the shot. When a defensive player is charged with goaltending, <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> is awarded. If an offensive player commits <b>the</b> infraction, <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> is cancelled. In either case possession of the ball is turned over to the defensive team.|$|R

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} high desert region are the Northern Paiute people. These Native Americans were once semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who relied on nuts, roots, seeds, berries, and eggs, and animals such as deer, pronghorn, geese, quail, rabbits, and bear, following their food to high and low elevations depending {{on the time of}} year. They make sandals, traps, and fishing nets, and weave baskets. Made out of sagebrush, willow, tule plant, Indian hemp, and sumac fibers, <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> are tight enough to carry water. Archaeological evidence from near Fort Rock has shown that people wove baskets in the area at least 9,000years ago.|$|E

25|$|Making <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> {{required}} great {{skill and}} knowledge in collecting and preparing the needed materials. Materials for weaving baskets {{changed with the}} seasons and years, so did the materials used for <b>the</b> <b>baskets.</b> The Pomo usually covered a basket completely with the vivid red feathers of the pleated woodpecker until the surface resembled the smoothness of the bird itself. With the feathers, 30-50 to every inch, beads were fastened to the basket’s border and hung pendants of polished abalone shell from the basket itself. Pomo women sometimes spent months or years making such gift baskets.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} use of {{a basket}} involves a metallic wire section that is contained within a polythene sheath. <b>The</b> wire <b>basket</b> can be withdrawn or protruded from the sheath using a handle. The advantage of this system is that <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> can be kept shut or open at will within the ureter. Thus one can keep <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> closed in order to maneuver <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> past a stone before opening it above the stone. With the development of efficient and safe lithotripsy modalities becoming widely available and with miniaturization of these and the ureteroscopes, it is becoming less common to dilate the ureter. Therefore it is not frequently possible to extract a stone intact. Baskets still can be used secondarily to extract the fragments. It is possible to use <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> wire without its sheath. The ureteroscope channel effectively becomes the sheath, and <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> opens immediately on protruding it beyond the ureteroscope. This has the following advantages: (a) A larger-diameter basket wire can be introduced. <b>The</b> very small <b>baskets</b> of 2 F and 3 F used via miniature ureteroscopes are very flimsy. When the sheath is removed, it becomes possible to use an otherwise 3 F basket via a 2 F channel. (b) The operator can work <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> using just two fingers close to the instrument channel port. This is more ergonomic than working an opening mechanism {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> because this latter system takes the operator’s hand away from the instrument. (c) <b>The</b> <b>basket</b> can be detached more readily from the ureteroscope, should it become, impacted together with a stone within the ureter. This makes it possible to reinsert the ureteroscope alongside <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and fragment <b>the</b> stone within <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> provided that there is no reinforced section to the inner wire at the handle.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} designs that are woven into <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> that signify different cultural meanings.

25|$|Later, {{where the}} quality of the road permitted, the range might be {{extended}} by the use of charrettes (carts). When designed for this trade, with a minimum of weight put into their construction and provision for harnessing the four horses, these vehicles took the name of chasse-marée. As speed was essential, they were normally hauled by two pairs of horses. The vehicle took the form of two wheels, of a diameter large enough to minimize the slowing effect of bumps in the road. On their axle was mounted an open rectangular frame within which were slung <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> holding the fish, packed in seaweed. More baskets were stacked above. The teams of usually fairly small horses were worked hard and changed at posting stations {{in the same way as}} those of mail coaches.|$|E
25|$|A nopal cactus {{farm for}} the {{production}} of cochineal is traditionally known as a nopalry. The two methods of farming cochineal are traditional and controlled. Cochineals are farmed in the traditional method by planting infected cactus pads or infesting existing cacti with cochineals and harvesting the insects by hand. The controlled method uses small baskets called Zapotec nests placed on host cacti. <b>The</b> <b>baskets</b> contain clean, fertile females that leave the nests and settle on the cactus to await fertilization by the males. In both cases, the cochineals must be protected from predation, cold, and rain. The complete cycle lasts three months, during which time the cacti are kept at a constant temperature of 27°C (81°F). At the end of the cycle, the new cochineals are left to reproduce or are collected and dried for dye production.|$|E

40|$|A {{specific}} messenger ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle, Balbiani ring (BR) granules in the dipteran Chironomus tentans, can be visualized during {{passage through}} the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We have now examined the transport through <b>the</b> nuclear <b>basket</b> preceding <b>the</b> actual translocation through <b>the</b> NPC. <b>The</b> <b>basket</b> consists of eight fibrils anchored to the NPC core by nucleoprotein Nup 153. On nuclear injection of anti-Nup 153, the transport of BR granules is blocked. Many granules are retained on top of <b>the</b> nuclear <b>basket,</b> whereas no granules are seen in transit through NPC. Interestingly, the effect of Nup 153 seems distant from the antibody-binding site {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> We conclude that the entry into <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> is a two-step process: an mRMP first binds to the tip of <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> fibrils and only then is it transferred into <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> by a Nup 153 -dependent process.

25|$|The rich mythical {{history of}} Nanumea {{describes}} a settlement {{led by an}} explorer/adventurer and warrior from the south named Tefolaha. Some accounts say Tefolaha and his crew came from Tonga, others name Samoa, but whether these names refer to today's Tonga and Samoa is not certain. Tefolaha, traditional accounts say, found the island of Nanumea populated by two women, Pai and Vau, whom it was believed had formed it from baskets of sand. Tefolaha wagered with them for the island and eventually won it through trickery, whereupon Pai and Vau departed. Tefolaha's sons and daughters are today the founding ancestors of leading families and the seven chiefly lineages of Nanumea. Today's population also traces descent from crew members who arrived with Tefolaha, and from later visitors from the far distant and more recent past. Nanumean traditions describe the islets, Motu Foliki, Lafogaki and Te Afua-a-Taepoa, as being formed when sand spilled from <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> of two women, Pai and Vau, when they were forced off Nanumea by Tefolaha.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{issues and}} {{additional}} near-fatal accidents {{put an end}} to Blue Angel Cutlass performances. While traveling to an airshow at Naval Air Station Glenview in Chicago, Illinois, both F7U's experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engine's failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview. With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed O'Hare Airport. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at Naval Air Station Memphis, the F7Us were given to the station's training center.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the system}} obtaining under State control, when hauls wore left on deck until all {{operations}} ended, the method adopted was to place each haul of fish straight {{into a separate}} ice-house, and, to prevent-crushing of the lower layers of fish, each ice-house is divided into sections by removable shelves. This system also obviates the use of grappling hooks, which formerly tore {{the flesh of the}} fish, and so made large quantities unsaleable. Under the new system loading into <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> is affected by a simple inclination of the shelves. Mr. Creamer, general manager of the Coastal Trawling Company, which controls the Koraaga, pointed out yesterday that the reduction of handling to a minimum must ensured the good condition of all fish. The ‘Koraaga, moreover, should show a profit with even moderate catches. The weakness of the State trawling enterprise was, in his opinion, the large administrative and storage expenses. The Coastal Trawling Company has entirely eliminated the latter. Arrangements were made for the landing of fish at the markets in as fresh a condition as possible. Voyages were cut short; bonus systems were introduced, which made it worthwhile for the crews to see that no damage was done in the stowage or unloading of their hauls. Unnecessary handling was obviated by all discoverable devices.|$|E
