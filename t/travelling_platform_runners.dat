50|$|QF Mark II was {{a single}} gun {{mounting}} (Mounting Mk 1) anti-aircraft gun in static sites. The pedestal mount was bolted to concrete in an unarmoured turret, a <b>travelling</b> <b>platform</b> was available to transport the gun and mounting between positions. The first unit became operational in February 1939. These 16.5 ton anti-aircraft mountings had a maximum elevation angle of 80 degrees. However, most mountings were Mark 1A with an elevation range of -9.5 to 80 degrees. This enabled the gun to be dual role (anti-aircraft and coastal defence) in coastal areas. Armour piercing rounds were provided for anti-ship engagements.|$|R

The mounting had a pedestal that was fixed to a solidly constructed, preferably concrete, platform on the ground. In 1944, it was found that a temporary platform built from railway sleepers and rails was adequate for the static guns, making them considerably easier to re-deploy without the cost and delay of constructing new concrete platforms. These were known as Pyle platforms, after the head of Anti-Aircraft Command, General Frederick Alfred Pile.|$|R

We have defined an Internet-based ”multimodal <b>travel</b> <b>platform</b> ” that provides in-formation and services able to support new types of connected transport applications. The considered sce-nario is centered on multimodal travelers (both drivers and passengers). In this paper, we present the SM 4 T 1 simulator, that we have designed and implemented to test the platform and to interact with it on behalf of multimodal travelers. SM 4 T is a fully agent-based simu-lator for multimodal travelers mobility. The application simulates the movements of travelers on the different transport networks (road and public transport) while taking into account the changes in travel times and the status of the networks...|$|R

Based on the above motivations, we design and develop a personalized tourism system based on a novel cooperation crowdsourcing model through the Internet. More importantly, data quality control based on the crowdsourcing model is a key problem which affects the accuracy and effectiveness of tourist recommendation. To address this problem, we propose three data quality control schemes for personalized tours based on the crowdsourcing model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach...|$|R

In 2013 Timespan, Helmsdale Heritage and Arts Centre, hosted a program of activities to mark the 200 th anniversary of the Clearances. The centrepiece of these activities was a community excavation of the Caen township in the Strath of Kildonan.

Visitors can experience what life would have been like in the Strath of Kildonan in 1813. This paper reports how the model has been deployed in different settings and on various digital platforms. These include showcasing the model at the Helmsdale Highland Games where visitors could explore the township of the past on stereo head mounted displays, or a Virtual Museum website that welcomes visitors from around the globe, as well as using Google Cardboard to allow visitors to explore Caen today, the virtual reconstruction of Caen simultaneously whilst on the site.

[...] The runners have up-curved fore edges, straight aft edges, and rounded lower edges. Crosspieces keep the runners apart. The superstructure, two rails smaller in diameter than the runners and spaced apart by pieces of bamboo, sits on top of the crosspieces. The runners, crosspieces, and rails are bound together with sennit cordage. The rails are wrapped in white kapa cloth and the rail frame is covered in lauhala matting. Oil from kukui (Aleurites moluccana) nuts coats either the course or the runners to provide lubrication.|$|R

40|$|The EC-funded project Instant Mobility is {{defining}} a comprehensive architecture for transport and mobility applications that aim to innovate by introducing future Internet technologies to this domain. A set of core enabling technologies {{are being developed}} by other projects in the Future Internet PPP such as FI-WARE, while the transport domain Instant Mobility project will use these generic enablers where available, and will develop its own enablers where necessary. In this paper, we describe an Internet-based “multimodal <b>travel</b> <b>platform</b> ” that provides information and services able to support new types of connected transport applications. The considered scenario, a “Personal Travel Companion”, is centred on multimodal travellers (both drivers and passengers). Almost all modes of transport are present in this scenario: private car, public transport modes, car sharing, ride sharing, bikes, etc. The project defines requirements for future Internet technology tools and enablers that can support services available to any Internet-connected traveller, whether using a portable, vehicle-based or fixed terminal. Future Internet technologies offer new horizons for transport information systems and propose for travellers a new experience with means of transport. We are designing and implementing a prototype for multimodal travel assistance taking advantage of these technologies. A demonstration of the application is planned in the ITS world congress-Vienna 2012, while the final prototype is due on March 2013.
