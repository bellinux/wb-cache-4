It was also the first V8 engine to use variable valve lift (Valvetronic). The variable valve lift replaces <b>throttle</b> <b>butterflies</b> (during normal running conditions) for added response, efficiency and power.|$|R

50|$|There is {{essentially}} {{no difference in}} efficiency between the technique of bypassing the <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly</b> and operating the butterfly itself. The IAC allows the ECU to maintain minimum RPM irrespective of changes in engine load, {{sometimes referred to as}} anti-stall feature. Thus the driver can more easily move the car from stand-still by merely releasing the clutch (manual transmission) or the brake (automatic transmission) without having to simultaneously press the accelerator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} successful, {{but the real}} {{breakthrough}} came in 1917, when Friz integrated a basically simple <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly</b> into the [...] "high-altitude carburettor", enabling the engine to develop its full power high above the ground. Burning a special high octane fuel of gasoline blended with Benzole, the carburettor adjusted {{the richness of the}} fuel-air mixture according to the aircraft's altitude. It enabled the engine, now dubbed BMW IIIa, to develop a constant [...] up to an altitude of 2000 meters -a decisive advantage over competitors' engines.|$|E
5000|$|Like all V8-powered E39 models, the E39 M5 was {{equipped}} with a recirculating ball steering system, regarded as less tactile than the rack and pinion set up of other E39s. Overall steering ratio was reduced to 14.7 from 17.9. It featured a Servotronic vehicle-speed-sensitive power assist which provides two levels of resistance controlled via console mounted Sport button. The Sport button also adjusted the electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>butterflies</b> for faster <b>throttle</b> response. The E39 M5 is equipped with four-wheel vented disc brakes measuring 345 mm in diameter in front and 328 mm in diameter in the rear. [...] On European-specification models, the rotors are of a [...] "floating" [...] two-piece design for reduced risk of cone distortion. Their lower unsprung weight improves ride quality and traction on bumpy surfaces as well. Anti-lock brakes, EML (fly-by-wire) throttle control and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) were standard.|$|R
5000|$|Internal {{improvements}} {{were made}} for these model years based on rider reviews and in-house testing. 250 models {{were made for}} North America for 2011 and 2012 years. The KTM engineers included a heavier crankshaft and flywheel aimed at reducing the buzzy nature of the previous RC8R and to emphasize low-end torque. <b>Throttle</b> <b>butterflies</b> were remapped {{to reduce the amount}} of opening under small throttle inputs for much smoother transitions and to address the [...] "snatchy throttle" [...] complaints directed at the earlier models. The new cylinder head uses two spark plugs in each cylinder; below 7,000 rpm only one of the two fires, while above 7,000 both are used for optimum burning and reduced detonation which also allows for a re-tuned ECU that has revamped cam timing and the 52 mm throttle bodies. Also new with this model are cast aluminum Marchesini wheels and strategic front and rear suspension updates.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{more fully}} developed, {{electronic}} valve operation will yield even more benefits. Cylinder deactivation, for instance, {{could be made}} much more fuel efficient if the intake valve could be opened on every downstroke and the exhaust valve opened on every upstroke of the deactivated cylinder or [...] "dead hole". Another even more significant advancement will be {{the elimination of the}} conventional throttle. When a car is run at part throttle, this interruption in the airflow causes excess vacuum, which causes the engine to use up valuable energy acting as a vacuum pump. BMW attempted to get around this on their V-10 powered M5, which had individual <b>throttle</b> <b>butterflies</b> for each cylinder, placed just before the intake valves. With electronic valve operation, {{it will be possible to}} control engine speed by regulating valve lift. At part throttle, when less air and gas are needed, the valve lift would not be as great. Full throttle is achieved when the gas pedal is depressed, sending an electronic signal to the ECU, which in turn regulates the lift of each valve event, and opens it all the way up.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} {{releases}} the accelerator on a moving vehicle {{powered by a}} diesel engine, the vehicle's forward momentum continues to turn the engine's crankshaft. With Mercedes diesels being a notable exception, diesel engines, by design, have no <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly</b> in the intake so regardless of throttle setting a full charge of air is always drawn into the cylinder. As such, each time air is compressed in a cylinder virtually 100% of that energy is returned to the crankshaft providing {{very little in the}} way of engine braking to the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|An unresponsive {{accelerator}} pedal {{may result from}} incursion: i.e., blockage by a foreign object, or any other mechanical interference with the pedal's operation [...] - [...] and may involve the accelerator or brake pedal. <b>Throttle</b> <b>butterfly</b> valves may become sluggish in operation or may stick in the closed position. When the driver pushes harder on the right foot, the valve may [...] "pop" [...] open to a point greater than that wanted by the driver, thus creating too much power and a lurch forward. Special solvent sprays are offered by all manufacturers and aftermarket jobbers to solve this very common problem.|$|E
5000|$|The 2002 Turbo was {{launched}} at the 1973 Frankfurt Motor Show. This was BMW's first turbocharged production {{car and the}} first turbocharged car since General Motors' brief offerings in the early 1960s. It produced [...] at 5,800 rpm, with 240 Nm of torque. The 2002 Turbo used the 2002 tii engine with a KKK turbocharger and a compression ratio of 6.9:1 {{in order to prevent}} engine knocking. Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection was used, with a sliding throttle plate instead of the usual <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly.</b> The 2002 Turbo was introduced just before the 1973 oil crisis, therefore only 1,672 were built.|$|E
5000|$|The 2007 Ducati 1098 {{featured}} a new motor called the Testastretta Evoluzione ("evolution"). It had larger displacement, larger valves, narrower included valve angle, better breathing through oval <b>throttle</b> bodies and <b>butterfly</b> valves, lighter weight (including magnesium valve covers), and higher output than its predecessors. [...] Ducati claim {{this to be}} the most powerful twin-cylinder production motorcycle engine in the world.|$|R
40|$|As {{the need}} to manage water {{resources}} increases, the ability to accurately measure use becomes crucial. In industry, measurement inaccuracies can cost either the supplier or consumer {{large amounts of money}} or even result in a depleted resource. Generally, flow meters need a flow profile to be fully developed to optimize measurement accuracy. In order to produce accurate measurements, most flow meters require a straight section of pipe immediately upstream of the meter. The straight pipe helps to develop the flow profile and produces flow conditions that are as ideal as possible. In many field installations, space restrictions lead to meters being installed with reduced straight pipe between a flow disturbance and the meter. Electromagnetic flow meters are referred to by several different names including: magnetic flow meter, mag meter or mag. The electromagnetic flow meter has grown in popularity in recent years as technology has improved and costs have decreased. Manufacturers commonly claim that their meters can produce highly accurate flow measurements, some as low as ± 0. 10 %, with reduced upstream straight pipe requirements as low as 0 pipe diameters between a disturbance and the meter itself. The results of this study provide quantified error associated with a partially closed butterfly valve on electromagnetic flow meter accuracy. The results show the effect of four valve openings (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % open), at five locations downstream of the valve (1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 pipe diameters), and at two different meter orientations to the valve shaft. It was concluded in the study that twenty pipe diameters of length are required to produce accurate measurements (within the manufacturer’s specified accuracy) when a magnetic flow meter is installed downstream of a <b>throttling</b> <b>butterfly</b> valve. Surprisingly, the largest effect to the meter’s accuracy unexpectedly occurred when the upstream butterfly valve was fully open and not when it was in a throttling position...|$|R
5000|$|Carburetor icing {{occurs when}} there is humid air, and the {{temperature}} drop in the venturi causes the water vapor to freeze. The venturi effect can drop the ambient air temperature by 30-40 degrees F, therefore carburetor icing often occurs when the outside air temperature is in the 60-70 degree F range. Unfortunately, the warm air temperature often causes pilots to overlook the possibility of carb icing. The ice will form on the surfaces of the carburetor throat, further restricting it. This may increase the Venturi effect initially, but eventually restricts airflow, perhaps even causing a complete blockage of air to the carburetor. The engine begins to run more rich as ice formation increases. Without intervention (carb heat or leaning) this can only continue {{until the mixture is}} outside of the [...] "chemically correct" [...] range for combustion. Icing may also cause jamming of the mechanical parts of the carburetor, such as the <b>throttle,</b> typically a <b>butterfly</b> valve.|$|R
50|$|The IAC {{actuator}} is an electrically controlled device, {{which gets}} its {{input from the}} vehicle's ECU. The actuator is fitted such that it either bypasses the throttle or operates the <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly</b> valve directly. The actuator consists of a linear servo actuator servomotor that controls a plunger which varies air flow through the throttle body. The position of the servomotor and hence the amount of air bypass is controlled digitally by the engine ECU. This allows the engine's idle speed to be maintained constant. The linear servo is most commonly {{a combination of a}} DC motor, lead-screw and a digital optical encoder.|$|E
50|$|Twin- or multi-cylinder engines {{may improve}} {{low-speed}} scavenging to one cylinder by {{shutting down the}} other cylinder at low speeds. This may be done simply by cutting the ignition spark to one, thus increasing the load on the other cylinder and thus the power and gas-flow required. This has the drawback of wasting fuel in the un-ignited cylinder, potentially also risking oiling-up its spark plug, More sophisticatedly, as was done for some Johnson outboard motors, the transfer passage for one cylinder may be closed by an additional <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly,</b> shutting that cylinder off completely and routing all gas-flow through the other. This avoids the risk of plug-oiling and again increases gas-flow through the operating cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|On 20 May 1917, Rapp Motorenwerke {{registered}} the documentation {{for the construction}} design for the new engine, dubbed project [...] "BBE". Friz' design, based on Karl Rapp's design) was laid out as an in-line six-cylinder, which guaranteed optimum balance, therefore few, small vibrations.

40|$|Butterfly valves are {{versatile}} components {{widely used}} in hydraulic systems as shutoff and <b>throttling</b> valves. <b>Butterfly</b> valve components {{must be able to}} withstand the forces and torques that are generated with use. Dynamic torque data are usually obtained in a test lab for a variety of steady state flow conditions; however the dynamic torque under transient (unsteady flow) conditions may be significantly different than that found in the laboratory. If a valve is closed too fast, especially in long systems, large transient pressures are generated and travel as waves through the pipeline. These transient waves increase the pressure difference across the valve, which in turn increases the dynamic torque that is applied to the valve. The effects of the increased dynamic torque are more significant in larger butterfly valves since dynamic torque {{is a function of the}} diameter raised to the third power. If the increased dynamic torque is larger than the torque that the valve was built to withstand, valve or actuator failure could result. The objective of this research was to examine the effect of transients on dynamic torque in a 48 -inch diameter butterfly valve operation as a function of pipe length and valve closure time (starting at full open) and compare the results to traditional steady state dynamic torque data. It was found that longer pipeline lengths along with smaller valve closure times created the largest percent difference in transient dynamic torque from the steady state dynamic torque. This difference was as high as 711 % in a 20, 000 -foot long pipeline when the valve was closed in 36 seconds. Transient effects should be considered in the design and manufacturing of butterfly valves as well as during the operation of the valve once it is installed...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of modern VVA systems recently offered new potentialities in improving fuel consumption for sparkignition engines at low and medium load, while granting higher volumetric efficiencies and performance at high load. The recently introduced ‘Multi-Air’ system, by Fiat Powertrain Group, enhanced this concept through {{the possibility of}} contemporary modify the intake valve opening, closing and lift, leading to the {{development of}} ‘throttle-less’ engines. However, at very low loads, the control of air-flow motion inside the cylinder may require to select a proper combination of <b>butterfly</b> <b>throttling</b> and intake valve control, to get the best BSFC improvement. Moreover, a reduced throttling, while improving the fuel consumption, may also produce a higher gasdynamic noise at the intake mouth. To this aim, a ‘Multi-lift’ strategy, along a single intake stroke can be analyzed, too. Of course, the introduction of new degrees of freedom for the engine control also poses new problems in terms of engine calibration and tuning. To best exploit the potential offered by these systems, new methodologies and development tools must be utilized, too. In this paper, an optimization procedure is presented, aiming to select the best combination of control parameters of a twincylinder turbocharged engine in different operating conditions. A detailed 1 D simulation model of the whole engine is firstly developed and validated against experimental data in WOT conditions and in predefined low load operating points. The model is developed within GT-Power, commercial code environment, but employs a in-house developed routine to simulate the combustion process. The latter takes into account the effects on heat release induced by variations on in-cylinder flow field and gas composition. Both of them, in fact, are substantially modified by the actual strategy specified for the intake valve control. The 1 D model is then coupled to an external optimizer (ModeFRONTIER) to perform the minimization of the fuel consumption at defined low-load operating points, with imposed constraints on the intake mouth radiated gasdynamic noise. An external module is employed to predict the overall intake valve lift profile as a function of two control parameters of the system (φ 1 and φ 2). The optimization procedure then selects the best combination of the above parameters together with the spark advance and WG / butterfly valve opening degree. The procedure validated against experimental data gives the possibility to perform a pre-calibration of the engine on a completely theoretical basis, and proves to be very helpful in reducing the experimental costs and time-to-market of new engine prototypes...|$|R
40|$|Modern VVA systems {{offer new}} {{potentialities}} {{in improving the}} fuel consumption for spark-ignition engines at low and medium load, meanwhile they grant a higher volumetric efficiency and performance at high load. Recently introduced systems enhance this concept through the possibility of concurrently modifying the intake valve opening, closing and lift leading {{to the development of}} almost “throttle-less” engines. However, at very low loads, the control of the air-flow motion and the turbulence intensity inside the cylinder may require to select a proper combination of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>throttling</b> and the intake valve control, to get the highest BSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) reduction. Moreover, a low throttling, while improving the fuel consumption, may also produce an increased gas-dynamic noise at the intake mouth. In highly “downsized” engines, the intake valve control is also linked to the turbocharger operating point, which may be changed by acting on the waste-gate valve. Depending on the valve lift and the actual exhaust pressure, different internal-EGR levels can be achieved, requiring a variation in the spark advance as well. Of course, the introduction of new degrees of freedom to the engine control poses new problems in terms of engine calibration and tuning. To best exploit the potential offered by these systems, new methodologies and development tools must be utilized as well. In this paper, an optimization procedure is presented, aiming to select the best combination of four control parameters (intake valve closure angle, butterfly valve opening, waste-gate opening and spark advance) of a twin-cylinder turbocharged engine in different operating conditions. A detailed 1 D simulation model of the whole engine is firstly developed and validated against the experimental data in WOT conditions and in predefined low load operating points. The model is developed within GT-Power™ commercial code environment, but employs an in-house routine that is implemented to simulate the combustion process. This routine takes into account the effects on the heat release induced by the variations of the in-cylinder flow field, turbulence and internal-EGR. These, in fact, are substantially modified by the actual strategy specified for the engine control. An external module is implemented to evaluate the intake valve lift profile {{as a function of the}} closure angle and the engine speed. The 1 D prediction of the gas-dynamic noise at the intake mouth is further validated through the comparison with the results obtained by the unsteady 3 D CFD analysis of the flow field within the air-box device. The 1 D computed pressure profile downstream the device is utilized as boundary condition for the 3 D model. The validated 1 D model of the turbocharged engine is then coupled to a multipurpose commercial optimizer (ModeFRONTIER™). The optimization procedure identifies the best combinations of the previously selected control parameters with the goal of minimizing both the fuel consumption and the gas-dynamic noise, for defined low-load lowspeed operating points. The procedure is validated against the experimental data obtained by a calibration of the engine at the test-bed. The values of the control parameters selected by the optimizer well agree with the experimentally identified ones. Alternative settings are also proposed with the aim to substantially reducing the radiated noise with limited or no penalty for the BSFC. The optimization results are also verified by a 3 D CFD analysis. Therefore, the procedure allows for the pre-calibration of a VVA turbocharged SI ICE on completely theoretical basis and proves to be very helpful in reducing the experimental costs and the engine time-to-market...|$|R

5000|$|In 1962 and 1963 Oldsmobile built a {{turbocharged}} {{version of}} the 215. The small-diameter Garrett T5 turbocharger with integral wastegate was manufactured by Garrett AiResearch and produced a maximum of 5 psi (34 kPa) boost at 2200 rpm. The engine had 10.25:1 compression and a single-barrel carburetor. It was rated at [...] at 4600 rpm and [...] at 3200 rpm. In development, the high compression ratio combined with the charged load created problems with spark knock on hard throttle applications, which led Olds to develop and utilize a novel water-injection system that sprayed metered amounts of distilled water and methyl alcohol (dubbed [...] "Turbo-Rocket Fluid") into the intake manifold air-stream to cool the intake charge. If the fluid reservoir was empty, a complex double-float and valve assembly in the Turbo-Rocket Fluid path would set a second butterfly (positioned between the <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly</b> and the turbocharger) into the closed position, limiting the amount of boost pressure. Unfortunately, many customers did not keep the reservoir filled, or had mechanical problems with the turbocharger system which resulted {{in many of the}} turbo-charger installations being removed and a conventional 4 barrel carburetor and manifold installed in its place.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, {{producing}} {{an entirely new}} product from scratch is never without initial problems, and the Vision suffered from a few. An off-idle carburetion quirk, known as the [...] "Vision stumble", meant the first year machines were prone to initial stuttering on part and full-throttle takeoff. The [...] "Vision stumble" [...] problem, after months of research, was finally solved by racer Marc Salvisberg, who later started Factory Pro Tuning. The problem, it seemed, wasn't a Yamaha development problem at all, but was actually a lean spot, just off idle, caused by {{what appeared to be}} residual casting sand that filled the off-idle bleed holes at the <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly</b> plate in the Weber-style Mikuni carb.

50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the <b>throttle</b> <b>butterfly.</b> The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide carburettor. Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|E
