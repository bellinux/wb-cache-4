500|$|O'Brien {{said that}} the songs on I'm Breathless had a [...] "coquettish" [...] and [...] "pandering nature", and was the polar {{opposite}} to Madonna's previous release, Like a Prayer, which had an introspective composition. I'm Breathless opens {{with the sound of}} an intercom and a shuffle, and power ballad [...] "He's a Man" [...] starts, a song which Madonna sings as if she was a [...] "hooker stalking the boulevard". Also, Madonna's [...] "haunting" [...] vocals continue after the music has faded. One of the Sondheim songs, [...] "Sooner or Later", is a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub, the song finds Madonna in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. [...] "Hanky Panky", the third song and second single, deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a [...] "good spanking". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, [...] "You don't know whether <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> or kiss me".|$|E
500|$|... "Hanky Panky" [...] was {{recorded}} within the three weeks time taken {{for the whole}} project. Personnel working on the song included Leonard on keyboards, Jeff Porcaro on drums, Guy Pratt on bass and Donna De Lory, Niki Haris and N'Dea Davenport on background vocals. Lyrically, the song deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a [...] "good spanking". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from {{a line in the}} film, where Breathless says to Tracy, [...] "You don't know whether <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> or kiss me". The track has a false introduction and starts slowly with piano, but changes after a few moments into a large jazz and swing song, with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a moderately slow groove tempo of 170 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from B3 to D5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm–C–Bm–A7sus in the beginning and changes to Dm–A–B9–A7–Dm–C when the swing starts. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna explained: ...|$|E

He {{was the fourth}} of 11 {{children}} and called his mother [...] "the baddest woman in my book," [...] telling historian Gerri Hirshey: [...] "I get scared of her now. She used <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> with anything, skillets, stove wood — (one time I ran away) and cried for a week. Stayed in the woods, me and my little dog." [...] Pickett eventually left {{to live with his}} father in Detroit in 1955.|$|E

2500|$|Frankfurter's {{argumentative}} {{style was}} not popular among his Supreme Court colleagues. [...] "All Frankfurter does is talk, talk, talk," [...] Chief Justice Earl Warren complained. [...] "He drives you crazy." [...] Hugo Black reported that [...] "I thought Felix was going <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> today, {{he got so}} mad." [...] In the Court's biweekly conference sessions, traditionally a period for vote-counting, Frankfurter had the habit of lecturing his colleagues for forty-five {{minutes at a time}} or more with his book resting on a podium. Frankfurter's ideological opponents would leave the room or read their mail while he lectured.|$|E
2500|$|In the Lords of Chaos interview, Vikernes {{recalls that}} when he was 6 years old, the family moved for about a year to Baghdad, Iraq, because Vikernes' [...] "father was working for Saddam Hussein", {{developing}} a computer program. Since there were no places available in the English school in Baghdad, the young Vikernes went to an Iraqi elementary school during this time. According to his interview, Vikernes here became [...] "aware of racial matters". Corporal punishment was not uncommon in the school, and on one occasion Vikernes had a [...] "quarrel" [...] with a teacher and called him [...] "a monkey". But as Vikernes perceived it the teachers [...] "didn't dare <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> because I was white". Vikernes' mother also recalls how they [...] "spent a year in Iraq", and that [...] "the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers; he would not". She mentions that this created problems, but generally she [...] "has no good explanation" [...] of how Varg developed his views.|$|E
2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had [...] "something to show her". She said that he led her to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them about this because I was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007, Roger Federer, seeking his 5th {{consecutive}} Wimbledon title against Rafael Nadal in the final, practiced with Ivanišević. Federer {{said the}} practice session helped him against Nadal: Well, I mean, it's good <b>to</b> have <b>hit</b> {{at least half}} an hour with a lefty before the finals because I've played against six right handers. So, of course, it's hard to come into a match and you play a lefty. Especially on the returns, I always feel it. The entire points are played in a different manner. Where usually you go backhand cross‑court, with Rafa I have to go backhand long line. I asked Goran yesterday if he wanted <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> with <b>me.</b> He said, Sure, I'm around.

5000|$|On April 21, Machado {{became the}} center of {{controversy}} surrounding his slide that injured Dustin Pedroia and sidelined him for three games. Machado maintained that the allegedly late slide was unintentional, and contacted Pedroia after the game. Nevertheless, two days later, Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez appeared to intentionally throw at Machado’s knees, missing each time. A few innings later, a pitch from reliever Matt Barnes narrowly missed Machado’s head and hit his bat. Barnes was ejected and received a 4-game suspension. Barnes denied the near-miss was intentional: “That’s kind of a line you don’t cross...fortunately, it didn’t hit him, but I think he’s got every right to be mad that that one got loose.” A week later, on May 2, Machado dodged a pitch from Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale that ended up missing behind him. Machado expressed his displeasure with how the MLB had handled the situation after the game in a profanity-laced interview: [...] “If you’re going <b>to</b> f—ing <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> go ahead. Don’t let the s— keep f—ing lingering around and keep trying <b>to</b> f—ing <b>hit</b> people...It’s f—ing bulls—, and MLB should do something about it. F—ing pitchers out there with f—ing balls in their hands throwing 100 miles per hour, trying <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> people. I’ve got a f—ing bat too. I could go up there and crush somebody if I wanted to, but you know what? I’ll get suspended for a year and the pitcher only gets suspended for two games. That’s not cool.” ...|$|R
