50|$|In the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, Zipolite was hard hit by two {{hurricane}}s and a fire. The first hurricane was Hurricane Pauline on 7 October 1997, a category four storm which destroyed nearly everything in town with strong flooding, leaving it -along with Mazunte and Puerto Ángel- {{cut off from}} the mainland, but there were no deaths. Next was Hurricane Rick on 9 November 1997. While not as strong as Pauline, the storm damaged roads and other infrastructure that was only partially rebuilt after Pauline. The last disaster to cause major damage was a fire that broke out on 21 February 2001, burning many of the wood and palm-thatched structures that were on the beach.Since its beginnings in the 1960s, Zipolite has evolved from handful of beachfront cabanas and palm-thatched palapas to concrete, but still basic, hotels and other structures with a few more amenities. Behind the line of beachfront construction is now an area called Colonia Roca Blanca with a street known informally as the Adoquin which has become the town center. Recently, the municipality has added <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> and police patrols on the beach both day and night during the busy season.|$|E

Many studies on ontological approaches to <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> moreover, have been conducted.

Thus, we considered the construction of a task model and task ontology based on mobile users ’ generic activities for a task-oriented tourist information service. In this paper, we introduce 1) a generic task model based on travelers ’ needs and generic activities before and during trips, which model accounts for generic tasks and task processes; 2) a task ontology based on the generic task model, and 3) a task-ontology-based Task-Oriented Tourist Information Service (TOTIS). Using the generic task model and the task ontology, task-oriented menu can be constructed automatically by means simply users’ selections and context-awareness. Additionally, compared with the existing domain-oriented services, the TOTIS can facilitate more flexible searching of tourist information and make real-time determinations with context-awareness...|$|E

40|$|Rural regions, {{such as the}} {{national}} and nature parks involved in the ReGeo project, are often dependent on the tourism sector and thus show a high degree of interest in eco-tourism issues. How can such areas attract new visitors, how can they compete with the big players in the tourism industry and how can they make themselves known to a broad public? The following article presents the ReGeo project, which aims to help rural areas find solutions to these issues by working with modern technology. For most rural regions the solution is to set up an attractive Internet site presenting the region, establish a network of local information points and perhaps even provide information on CD-ROMs and for mobile and PDA devices. It has been proven that such <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> systems {{are becoming more and more}} popular and attractive to the user (Pröll and Retschizegger, 2000). Such systems can be improved through the use of photographs, maps and animation. ReGeo also uses GISfunctions, a central interactive map and remote sensing data system, which not only improves the attractiveness but also the usability of an Internet-based <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> system. It also emphasises the necessity of adapting this system to different devices. The ReGeo-project pays special attention to the specific problems of rural regions, including the lack of a central institution with the ability to administer such a system. Last but not least, ReGeo intends to act not only as a <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> <b>service,</b> but rather as a multi-purpose digital geo-data service through which the test regions is attractively presented to a broad audience...|$|R
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{advances}} in Internet and mobile technologies, there are increasing demands for ubiquitous access to <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> systems for <b>service</b> coordination and process integration. However, due to disparate <b>tourist</b> <b>information</b> and <b>service</b> resources such as airlines, hotels, tour operators, it is still difficult for tourists to use them effectively during their trips {{or even in the}} planning stage. Neither can current tourist portals assist tourists proactively. To overcome this problem, we propose a Collaborative Travel Agent System (CTAS) based on a scalable, flexible, and intelligent Multi-Agent Information System (MAIS) architecture for proactive aids to Internet and mobile users. We also employ Semantic Web technologies for effective organization of <b>information</b> resources and <b>service</b> processes. We formulate our MAIS architecture for CTAS further with agent clusters based on a case study of a large service-oriented travel agency. Agent clusters may comprise several types of agents to achieve the goals involved in the major processes of a tourist's trip. We show how agents can make use of ontology from the Semantic Web to help tourists better plan, understand, and specify their requirements collaboratively with the CTAS. We further illustrate how this can be successfully implemented with Web service technologies to integrate disparate Internet tourist resources.
