25|$|Researchers {{believe that}} a 2-year-old boy was the index case of the current Ebola virus disease epidemic. He died in December 2013 {{in the village of}} Meliandou, Guéckédou Prefecture. His mother, sister, and {{grandmother}} then became ill with similar symptoms and also died. Although Ebola represents a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and was documented in Tai Forest chimpanzees, only one case had been reported in humans in West Africa. With this background and in the context of poor public health systems, the early cases were mis-diagnosed as diseases more common to the area. Thus Ebola virus disease spread for several months before it was recognized as such. In late October 2014, the child was identified as Emile Ouamouno. In a Tuesday, December 30, 2014 online world news story article by Richard Ingham from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that was featured on the MSN homepage, it was revealed that a tree in the area where children had played at, playing with insect-eating free-tailed bats and hunting and grilling them to eat (they are a cousin of another well-known Ebola reservoir, the fruit bat, whose role in this outbreak is not as clear), {{is believed to be the}} point where human infection– likely by the bats– with Ebola in this current outbreak occurred, the 'ground zero' of the epidemic.

40|$|At {{what point}} in a firm’s life should it <b>go</b> <b>public?</b> How do a firm’s ex ante product market {{characteristics}} relate to its going public decision? Further, {{what are the implications}} of a firm going public on its post-IPO operating and product market performance? In this paper, we answer the above questions by conducting the first large sample study of the going public decisions of U. S. firms in the literature. We use the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) of the U. S. Census Bureau, which covers the entire universe of private and public U. S. manufacturing firms. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, a private firm’s product market characteristics (market share, competition, capital intensity, cash flow riskiness) significantly affect its likelihood of going public. Second, private firms facing less information asymmetry and those with projects that are cheaper for outsiders to evaluate are more likely <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>public</b> (consistent <b>with</b> Chemmanur and Fulghieri (1999)). Third, IPOs of firms occur at the peak of their productivity cycle (consistent with Clementi (2002)) : the dynamics of total factor productivity (TFP) and sales growth exhibit an inverted U-shaped pattern. Finally, sales, capital expenditures, and other performance variables exhibit a consistently increasing pattern over the years before and after the IPO. The last two findings are consistent with the widely documented post-IPO operating underperformance of firms being due to the real investment effects of a firm going <b>public,</b> and inconsistent <b>with</b> underperformance being solely due to earnings management immediately prior to the IPO. ...|$|R
