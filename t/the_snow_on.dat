The FBI interviewed family from Massachusetts, and the Haverhill police chief disclosed that the search was now nationwide. Ten days after her disappearance, New Hampshire Fish and Game conducted a second ground and air search, using a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera, tracking dogs and cadaver dogs.

5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> the roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Bramham Moor was fought, in <b>the</b> <b>snow,</b> <b>on</b> 19 February 1408.

25|$|Another story {{involved}} Jon {{going away}} {{on a business trip}} around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> Christmas Eve (1984 December 3 to 23). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special Garfield on the Town.|$|E
25|$|Lake Erie {{was covered}} by a deep, powdery snow; January's unusually cold {{conditions}} limited the usual thawing and refreezing, so <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> the frozen lake remained powdery. The drifted snow on roadways was difficult to clear because the strong wind packed the snow solidly. In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists {{had to deal with}} vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds and blowing snow.|$|E
25|$|The {{claim of}} cloven hoof prints in <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> January 1, 1976, was {{rejected}} by other researchers, because weather records showed {{that there had been}} no snow in Amityville on that date. Neighbors reported nothing unusual during the time that the Lutzes were living there. Police officers are depicted visiting the house in the book and 1979 film, but records showed that the Lutzes did not call the police during the period that they were living on Ocean Avenue. There was no bar in Amityville called The Witches' Brew at the time; Ronald DeFeo, Jr. was a regular customer at Henry's Bar, a short distance from 112 Ocean Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Adding to the plane's {{troubles}} was the pilots' {{decision to}} maneuver closely behind a DC-9 that was taxiing {{just ahead of}} them prior to takeoff, due to their mistaken belief that the warmth from the DC-9's engines would melt the snow and ice that had accumulated on Flight 90's wings. This action—which went specifically against flight manual recommendations for an icing situation—actually contributed to additional icing on the 737. The exhaust gases from the other aircraft melted <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> the wings, but during takeoff, instead of falling off the plane, this slush mixture froze on the wings' leading edges and the engine inlet nose cone.|$|E
25|$|Drigo was {{vacationing in}} his native Italy during the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, which prevented him from returning to Russia for another two years. Soon after his arrival in Petrograd he was evicted from his home at the Grand Hotel, which was converted to offices for the newly established Soviet government. For a time Drigo was forced to live in considerable poverty in a camp {{with a group of}} his fellow Italian émigrés. He later recalled in his memoirs of the many cold evenings he spent with his close friend and colleague Alexander Glazunov waiting for hours in bread lines and subsequently carrying their rations home through <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> a sled. Upon his first engagement as conductor after his return to the former Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, Drigo received a fifteen-minute standing ovation from the audience.|$|E
25|$|News soon reaches The Nine that Alric's {{army has}} been destroyed, {{and he has}} been {{captured}} by The Deceiver. He was sent to The Barrier to search for a suit of enchanted armor by the Head, who now claims to have been an ally of Connacht, although some are beginning to doubt the veracity of its claims. A small group from The Legion fly over the mountains in a hot air balloon, and rescue Alric. The Legion is then ordered to Silvermines to look for The Watcher's arm, lost when Balor freed him from captivity beneath the Cloudspine, as The Nine believe the arm can be used to fashion a weapon to use against The Watcher. However, The Deceiver is also in Silvermines searching for the arm, as he and The Watcher were enemies before the rise of Balor. The Legion find the arm, but soon thereafter, a volcano erupts, melting <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> the Cloudspine, and allowing The Deceiver to move west. At the same time, The Watcher attacks Rabican's army, crushing it. However, the army of The Deceiver, heading west, and the army of The Watcher, pursuing the remnants of Rabican's army east, begin to fight one another, with Maeldun using the distraction to retake the passes.|$|E

500|$|The {{base was}} also the {{location}} of an experimental system of steam pipes in 1957, to test the viability of using steam to melt <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> the runways. Pipes were spaced at different intervals in the experiment. That same year, the first KC-135 Stratotanker, christened the [...] "Aroostook Queen", arrived at Loring. By December, all of the KC-97s had left, and by April 1958, 20 KC-135s had arrived, allowing the 42nd Air Refueling Squadron to reach full operational capacity in May. [...] Later that year, an alert force was created at Loring, consisting of six B-52's. The following year, {{in response to a}} conflict in Lebanon, the entire wing was placed on alert.|$|E
500|$|At the Flag Station Wilkes and {{his eight}} {{remaining}} men built a circular wall of lava rocks {{and covered the}} shelter with a canvas tent. A snowstorm was in progress and several suffered from altitude sickness. That night (December 23), <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> the canvas roof caused it to collapse. At daylight some of the group went down the trail to retrieve firewood and the gear abandoned on the trail the day before. After another day's climb, nine men reached the rim of Mokuʻāweoweo.

[...] Many passengers in planes, either inbound or outbound, were held in the planes, eating peanuts and other snacks {{for as much as}} 10 hours before {{the decision was made to}} cancel the outgoing flights or a gate had opened for the inbound ones. Several airports including Bradley International Airport in Connecticut, Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport, and John C.

The University of Illinois canceled their classes for two consecutive days for the first time in at least 27 years. A blizzard warning forced Purdue University to suspend classes for the first time in 13 years. SUNY Oneonta closed its doors for the first time since the 1970s, and stayed closed for 3days for the first time in its 119-year history.

2500|$|For icebreaking operations, Robert LeMeur had an {{extensive}} outfit of various [...] "ice management systems" [...] {{designed to reduce}} friction between ice and the hull of the vessel. A powerful hull wash system {{could be used to}} wet <b>the</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> ice ahead of the vessel by spraying water through eighteen openings on the hull, reducing the ice resistance by 20 to 30 percent based on ice trials in various ice conditions. A secondary system could be used to pump water below the waterline between hull and ice floes. Two air bubbler systems were fitted: one in the bow to lubricate the hull and another in the stern to prevent ice from entering the nozzles. The hull was coated with an abrasion-resistant low-friction epoxy paint. Finally, a heeling system capable of rocking the vessel back and forth could be used to prevent the vessel from getting stuck and assist in turning.|$|E
