Cylinder indicated pressures were measured for all three cylinders of a two-stroke Diesel engine with pressure transducers. Time-resolved angular position was measured at the crankshaft front and at the flywheel. A six degree-of-freedom torsional crankshaft model was developed. Two solution methods are described to solve the equations of motion: a time-marching ODE solver, and a Finite Element solution in the time domain. Using these methods with the measured cylinder torques, the angular positions are predicted and compared to measured angular positions for model calibration. An inverse solution method was developed to determine the cylinder <b>indicated</b> <b>torques</b> from the measured angular position at the crankshaft endpoints.

Objective: To assess the test-retest reliability of knee flexor/extensor strength using the Biodex Multi-Joint System 4 Isokinetic Dynamometer in children. Methods: Peak isometric knee extensor (KE) and peak isokinetic knee flexor (KF) torques of the dominant and nondominant limbs were assessed twice in 11 children aged 10 to 13 yrs, 7 to 10 days apart. Results: Peak torques {{were higher in the}} dominant limb (p ≤ 0. 006). Peak isometric KE torque was 8. 4 % higher (SEM 2. 5 %) at the second testing session, but there was no inter-action with the limb tested (p > 0. 2). Peak isokinetic KE/KF torque ratios agreed well between tests and had intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0. 96.

Based on its membrane topology, {{it has been suggested}} that MotB might be a linker that fastens the torque-generating machinery to the cell wall. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a number of motB mutants. As found previously for motA, many alleles of motB were dominant, as expected if MotB is a component of the motor. In other respects, however, the motB mutants differed from the motA mutants. Most of the mutations mapped to a hydrophilic, periplasmic domain of the protein, and nothing comparable to the slow-swimming alleles of motA, which show normal torque when tethered, was found. Some motB mutants retained partial function, but when tethered they produced subnormal <b>torque,</b> <b>indicating</b> that their motors contained only one or two functional torque generators.

Direct evaluation of the ligament laxity can be obtained through the objective measurement of extreme passive inversion and eversion movements, but there are few studies on the use of the evaluation of the passive resistive torque of the ankle to assess the capsule and ligaments resistance. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the inversion and eversion passive torque in athletes with and without ankle sprains history. Method: 32 female basketball and volleyball athletes (16. 06 +/- 0. 8 years old; 67. 63 +/- 8. 17 kg; 177. 8 +/- 6. 47 cm) participated in this study. Their ankles were divided into two groups: control group (29), composed of symptom-free ankles, and ankle sprain group, composed of ankles which have suffered injury (29). The resistive torque at maximum passive ankle movement was measured by the isokinetic dynamometer and the muscular activity by electromyography system. The athletes performed 2 repetitions of inversion and eversion movement at 5, 10 and 20 degrees/s and the same protocol only at maximum inversion movement. Results: The resistive passive torque during the inversion and eversion was lower in the ankle sprain group. This group also showed lower torques at the maximum inversion movement.

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a genetic disorder in which muscle weakness and fragility contribute to ongoing muscle degeneration. Although exercise-induced muscle damage {{is associated with}} adaptation that protects normal muscle from further damage, exploiting this process to protect dystrophic muscle has been avoided for fear of inducing excessive muscle degeneration. However, muscle-specific over-expression of the class 1 :Ea isoform of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) reduces myofibre necrosis in dystrophic mdx mice (a model for DMD) and, therefore, may enhance the adaptation process in response to eccentric exercise. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of transgenic class 1 :Ea IGF- 1 over-expression on the susceptibility to muscle damage and subsequent adaptation in 12 -week-old dystrophic mdx and non-dystrophic control mice. Experiments were conducted in vivo using a custom-built isokinetic mouse dynamometer to measure the deficit in joint <b>torque</b> (<b>indicating</b> muscle damage) after 20 maximal lengthening (eccentric) contractions. Adaptation to this damaging exercise was evaluated by repeating the protocol 7 days after the initial exercise. The over-expression of IGF- 1 significantly increased the normalised joint torque in non-dystrophic mice and appeared to ameliorate the muscle weakness in dystrophic mice. All mice displayed a marked reduction in the susceptibility to muscle damage on day 7; however, this adaptation was unaffected by IGF- 1, showing that IGF- 1 does not protect the dystrophic muscles of adult mdx mice against damage resulting from maximal lengthening contractions...|$|R

Electrical stimulation before and after a 5 s maximal isometric voluntary contraction was performed before the start of the time trial and immediately (< 5 s) after each 20 % of the time trial as well as 1, 2, 4 and 8 min after time trial termination. Potentiation was observed before the time trial and as early as 1 - 2 min after the time trial, but no potentiation was detected during or immediately after the time trial for neither single or paired stimuli. At termination of the time trial, “potentiated” peak torque was significantly more reduced than “unpotentiated" peak torque for single stimulus (- 65 ± 10 % and - 42 ± 18 %, respectively) and paired stimuli at 100 Hz (- 51 ± 10 % and - 33 ± 15 %, respectively). Faster recovery for “potentiated” compared to “unpotentiated” peak <b>torque</b> <b>indicate</b> that potentiate peak torque measurements or delay the post-exercise measurements more than a few seconds, will underestimate peripheral fatigue.

40|$|Haptic {{steering}} guidance is {{an advanced}} driving assistance system which provides guidance torques {{on the steering}} wheel to assist a human driver. Improvements in performance, safety margins and workload have been reported for lane-keeping and curve negotiation tasks. On the other hand, the guidance system instigates increased driver <b>torques,</b> <b>indicating</b> the occurrence of a mismatch between driver and automation intention. A novel, criticality-based control structure was developed, capable of adapting to different driving conditions by using safety margins (operationalized as time-to-line crossing, TLC) as input. Twenty-four participants drove through a single-lane, 10. 8 km long road, with as independent variables the road width (normal road width of 3 m, wide road width of 5 m) and the type of guidance received: no guidance (manual), haptic steering guidance based on lateral deviation from the center-line (performance-based guidance, PBG) and criticality-based guidance (CBG). On the normal road, results show similar benefits for both guidance systems compared to manual control, in terms of performance and safety margins. Workload was reduced by PBG, but both guidance systems yielded increased driver torques. On the wide road, participants drove closer to the center-line with PBG, but at the cost of significantly more guidance torques than CBG. Interestingly, this reduction in lateral deviation did not result in a significant improvement for lowest safety margins encountered. No subjective preference was found for either feedback condition. It can be concluded that criticality-based guidance is capable of adjusting to different driving conditions, without compromising safety margins, whilst greatly reducing guidance torques in situations where they are unneeded. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} of stretch reflexes to overall joint stiffness are unknown in normal and pathological function. The {{main reason for}} this is difficulty in distinguishing the mechanical {{contributions of}} the two mechanisms. We used a new non-linear system identification technique to achieve this and address three specific objectives. First, we identified intrinsic and reflex contributions to dynamic ankle stiffness over a wide range of tonic voluntary contraction levels and ankle positions in healthy human subjects (normals). Intrinsic and reflex dynamic stiffness were strongly modulated with operating points; reflex mechanisms made their largest relative contribution to ankle stiffness at low levels of contraction and near the mid-positions. In some cases, reflexes contributed significantly to overall <b>torque</b> <b>indicating</b> that stretch reflexes have a potential to {{play a significant role in}} control of posture and movement. Second, we examined the nature and origin of mechanical abnormalities associated with spasticity in chronic spinal cord injured subjects (SCIs). Reflex and intrinsic stiffness were larger in SCIs than normals. The magnitude and relative size of the changes were strongly dependent on joint position and contraction state. Overall joint stiffness was abnormally and significantly high in SCIs and stretch reflexes contributed strongly to it. Third, we explored the effects of long-term FES-assisted walking on intrinsic and reflex dynamic stiffness in SCIs. Both reflex and intrinsic stiffness decreased substantially following long-term (> 16 months) FES-assisted walking. The results indicate that this rehabilitation approach may cause spastic joint mechanics to become closer to normal behavior, and consequently could be useful for treatment as well as restoring function...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn seam bowling, {{the spin}} vector {{precesses}} rapidly into the torque vector, thereby crossing from one hemisphere {{to the other}} once torque is imparted onto the ball. However, the spin axis reaches the torque vector only at large times. If the spin axis does not coincide with the pole of the ball, the seam wobbles and introduces another roughness element. Thus, if the seam is angled toward the smooth side (for half a period per spin revolution) then the flow is turbulent {{on both sides of}} the ball and the aerodynamic side force decreases and vanishes, thereby disturbing the swing. The aim of this study was to investigate how accurate is the placement of the spin axis at release of the ball. A smart cricket ball instrumented with three high-speed MEMS gyroscopes was used for this purpose and the data of four spin bowlers were analysed. It was found that the spin axis can under- and overshoot the optimal position of the ball as well as deviate off the pole. The spin rates recorded were 15 - 20 rps produced by peak torques of 0. 29 - 0. 39 Nm. The deviation of the spin axis correlated with the <b>torque,</b> <b>indicating</b> that too much torque imparted onto the ball worsens the accuracy of bowling. Undershooting the optimal position is due to equal torques imparted by index and middle fingers. The optimal position of the spin axis can be achieved if the middle finger is closer to the seam than the index. This causes an overshooting torque vector and allows the spin axis to be placed at the pole of the ball at release...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} structure of WTe_ 2 and orthorhombic γ-MoTe_ 2, are claimed to contain pairs of Weyl type-II points. A series of ARPES experiments claim a broad agreement with these predictions. We synthesized single-crystals of MoTe_ 2 through a Te flux method to validate these predictions through measurements of its bulk Fermi surface (FS) via quantum oscillatory phenomena. We {{find that the}} superconducting transition temperature of γ-MoTe_ 2 depends on disorder as quantified by the ratio between the room- and low-temperature resistivities, suggesting {{the possibility of an}} unconventional superconducting pairing symmetry. Similarly to WTe_ 2, the magnetoresistivity of γ-MoTe_ 2 does not saturate at high magnetic fields and can easily surpass 10 ^ 6 %. Remarkably, the analysis of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) signal superimposed onto the magnetic <b>torque,</b> <b>indicates</b> that the geometry of its FS is markedly distinct from the calculated one. The dHvA signal also reveals that the FS is affected by the Zeeman-effect precluding the extraction of the Berry-phase. A direct comparison between the previous ARPES studies and density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations reveals a disagreement in the position of the valence bands relative to the Fermi level ε_F. Here, we show that a shift of the DFT valence bands relative to ε_F, in order to match the ARPES observations, and of the DFT electron bands to explain some of the observed dHvA frequencies, leads to a good agreement between the calculations and the angular dependence of the FS cross-sectional areas observed experimentally. However, this relative displacement between electron- and hole-bands eliminates their crossings and, therefore, the Weyl type-II points predicted for γ-MoTe_ 2.
