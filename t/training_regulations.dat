25|$|The {{investigation}} {{following the}} crash, especially regarding {{the failure of}} the pilot to respond to crew concerns about the deicing procedure, led to a number of reforms in pilot <b>training</b> <b>regulations.</b> Partial blame was placed on the young, inexperienced flight crew, who had a combined age of only 65 and had begun their careers as commercial pilots less than five years earlier. Typical of upstart low-cost carriers, Air Florida frequently hired youthful pilots who worked for less money than veterans and were for the most part seeking to gain flight experience prior to joining a major airline. It became a widely used case study for both air crews and rescue workers. Another result of the accident was the development of an improved rescue harness for use in helicopter recoveries.|$|E

Â Training of emotion regulation was done over the fiveconsecutive sessions,Â and observed aggressive behavior during the six days before training (phaseA), six days after training (phase B) and four days at follow-up. ObservationÂ results were analyzed with a visual inspection technique using a graph, andÂ showed there is reduction in aggressive behaviorâ€™s subject at phase BÂ after emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>training.</b> The results obtained showed that emotion <b>regulation</b> <b>training</b> can reduce aggressive behavior for child in elementaryÂ school according to the criteria of the subject.

50|$|The deck {{department}} {{is divided into}} deck officers and ratings. All ranks in the {{deck department}} are required to have undertaken training {{in accordance with the}} STCW Convention. For officers this involves the passing of an exam to receive a certificate of competency, the level of understanding and certification varies according to ship size. All ranks are required to have undertaken generic maritime training, which usually involves time at sea and time in an approved college. International standards under the STCW Code set out the minimum requirements for training, however individual nations also have their own maritime <b>training</b> <b>regulations.</b> For example, in the United Kingdom the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ensure that the deck department receive training and examinations in order to assume the responsibilities of their rank at sea. All seafarers of the deck department are also required to have undertaken a series of short course training, in various elements under the STCW Convention. This includes general security, safety and lifeboat training, as well as vessel-specific training, such as operations in the Polar regions and on tankers.|$|E
