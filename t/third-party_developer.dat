5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created by a {{different}} <b>third-party</b> <b>developer,</b> Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E
5|$|Although Acclaim, SNK, Ubisoft, Midway, Activision, Infogrames, and Capcom {{supported}} the system {{during its first}} year, <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> support proved difficult to obtain due {{to the failure of}} the Sega Saturn and the profitability of publishing for the PlayStation. Namco's Soul Calibur, for example, was released for the Dreamcast because of the relative unpopularity of the Soul series at the time; Namco's more successful Tekken franchise was associated with the PlayStation console and PlayStation-based arcade boards. Nevertheless, Soul Calibur received overwhelming critical acclaim and has been frequently described {{as one of the best}} games for the system. Capcom produced a number of fighting games for the system, including the Power Stone series, in addition to a temporary exclusive in the popular Resident Evil series called Resident Evil Code: Veronica. The Dreamcast is also known for several shoot 'em ups, most notably Treasure's Bangai-O and Ikaruga.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1980s, {{following}} {{the success of}} their isometric Filmation game engine behind titles like Knight Lore, the Stampers founded a separate company: Rare Designs of the Future, later shortened to Rare. While Ultimate was built for the British home microcomputer market, Rare was founded with an eye toward the burgeoning Japanese video game console market, having been apprised of Nintendo by their Japanese arcade industry contacts. Nintendo initially rebuffed the brothers' interest in 1983, which led Chris Stamper to study the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) hardware for six months. The brothers flew to Kyoto to present software samples to Nintendo executives. Nintendo purchased the Stampers' Slalom, which sold half a million units, and made the Stampers into Nintendo's first Western <b>third-party</b> <b>developer.</b> As interest in Filmation and the Spectrum began to wane, the brothers sold part of Ultimate to U.S. Gold and began to focus on Rare, though the Stampers retained a majority stake in Ultimate.|$|E
5|$|Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure {{are three}} action-adventure games {{produced}} by Philips for the CD-i {{as part of}} Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games owe their existence to negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have Philips create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> games. The Faces of Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994. The games were given little funding or time for completion, and Nintendo provided only cursory input.|$|E
5|$|The Capcom Five {{are five}} video games {{unveiled}} by Capcom in late 2002 and published from March 2003. At {{a time when}} Nintendo's GameCube console had failed to capture market share, Capcom announced five new GameCube titles with the apparent goal of boosting hardware sales and showing off <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> support. Capcom USA followed up with confirmation {{that they would be}} exclusive to the GameCube. The five games were P.N.03, a futuristic third-person shooter; Viewtiful Joe, a side-scrolling action-platformer; Dead Phoenix, a shoot 'em up; Resident Evil 4, a survival horror third-person shooter; and Killer7, an action-adventure game with first-person shooter elements. Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by Resident Evil director Shinji Mikami and, except Killer7, developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4. Capcom USA later clarified that only Resident Evil 4 was intended to be exclusive; the initial announcement was due to a miscommunication with their parent company.|$|E

25|$|Early on in its history, Nintendo had {{achieved}} considerable success with <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> {{support on the}} Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super NES (SNES). Competition from the Sega Genesis and Sony's PlayStation in the 1990s changed the market's landscape, however, and reduced Nintendo's ability to obtain exclusive, third-party support on the Nintendo 64 (N64). The console's cartridge-based media was also increasing the cost to manufacture software, {{as opposed to the}} cheaper, higher-capacity optical discs used by the PlayStation.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to compete with Sega, <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> Catapult Entertainment created the XBAND, a {{peripheral}} which allowed Genesis players to engage in online competitive gaming. [...] Using telephone services to share data, XBAND was initially offered in five U.S. cities in November 1994. [...] The following year, the service was extended to the SNES, and Catapult teamed up with Blockbuster Video to market the service, but as interest in the service waned, it was discontinued in April 1997.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the system}} was no longer {{supported}} by Sega in 2000, <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> Majesco Entertainment released {{a version of the}} Game Gear at US$30, with games retailing at US$15.

[...] This version was also compatible with all previous Game Gear games, but was incompatible with the TV Tuner and some Master System converters.

40|$|Digital {{application}} marketplaces {{are increasingly}} relevant for digital platform owners seeking {{to reap the}} benefits of distributing, brokering, and operating applications by <b>third-party</b> <b>developers.</b> Owners of such marketplaces have two vital goals: address the needs of heterogeneous end-users and attract <b>third-party</b> <b>developers.</b> A key element in simultaneously accommodating these goals is value creation. However, while there is emerging literature on digital application marketplaces, little empirical evidence exits about the value creation process for and by application developers. Drawing on a research study of <b>third-party</b> <b>developers,</b> we synthesize the value creation perspective and digital platforms literature to develop an understanding of value creation in digital application marketplaces from the perspective of <b>third-party</b> <b>developers.</b> Our study identifies and explores six different value sources and their associated value creation and realization. In doing this, our research extends and complements existing digital platform literature and contributes new knowledge about new forms of value creation. ...|$|R
500|$|Interplay, {{now known}} as Interplay Entertainment and a {{publisher}} in its own right, produced several late 1990s RPG titles through two new developers, Black Isle Studios and BioWare. Black Isle released the groundbreaking Fallout (1997) which, reminiscent of Interplay's earlier Wasteland, was set in an alternate history future America following a nuclear holocaust. One of the few successful late-1990 video game RPGs not set in a swords-and-sorcery environment, Fallout was notable for its open-ended and largely non-linear gameplay and quest system, tongue-in-cheek humor, and pervasive sense of style and imagery. Players were afforded numerous moral choices to shape the game world based on how NPCs reacted to the player, much like the original Ultimas. Fallout was nearly as influential on post-crash RPGs as Ultima was on Golden Age RPGs, and is considered {{by some to be}} the first [...] "modern" [...] CRPG. Black Isle produced a sequel, Fallout 2, in 1998. <b>Third-party</b> <b>developer</b> Micro Forté produced , a tactical RPG based on the franchise, which was published in 2001 under Interplay's strategy division 14 Degrees East.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{concluded}} that the game lacked the revolutionary potential of Donkey Kong Country but was of a sufficient high quality to sell well during the holiday season. [...] "The 3D platform genre doesn't evolve with Donkey Kong 64", AllGame wrote. While hyped fans would be disappointed, IGN wrote that Donkey Kong 64 remains an excellent and expansive platformer with an overwhelming amount of things to do. GameFan, on the other hand, was most disappointed by how the game [...] "truly offers nothing new" [...] and compared its monotony and repetition with Eyes Wide Shut: [...] "a big bloated project with not enough brilliant moments to justify the numbness ... sitting through the whole thing". The game, the reviewer continued, [...] "fails {{to live up to}} the Rare name". Donkey Kong 64 3D platforming was commonplace by the time of its release and, according to GameSpot, would have fared better as a Nintendo 64 launch title. With its competition considered, Daily Radar wrote that Donkey Kong 64 was simply the best 3D platform game on the console. Edge qualified this thought: Donkey Kong 64 was the closest any <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> had come to outdoing Nintendo's mastery of game structure, but its gameplay was derivative and unimaginative compared to the freedom and flexibility of Nintendo's Super Mario 64. Nevertheless, the 3D Donkey Kong was [...] "a fine effort ... in its own right".|$|E
500|$|On May 22, 2000, Okawa {{replaced}} Iramajiri {{as president}} of Sega. Okawa had long openly advocated that Sega abandon the console business. His sentiments were not unique; Sega co-founder David Rosen had [...] "always {{felt it was a}} bit of a folly for them to be limiting their potential to Sega hardware", and Stolar had previously suggested that Sega should have sold their company to Microsoft. In September 2000, in a meeting with Sega's Japanese executives and the heads of the company's major Japanese game development studios, Moore and Bellfield recommended that Sega abandon its console business and focus solely on software—prompting the studio heads to walk out. Nevertheless, on January 31, 2001, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast after March 31 and the restructuring of the company as a [...] "platform-agnostic" [...] <b>third-party</b> <b>developer.</b> The decision was Moore's. Sega also announced a Dreamcast price reduction to $99 to eliminate its unsold inventory, which was estimated at 930,000 units as of April 2001. After a further reduction to $79, the Dreamcast was cleared out of stores at $49.95. The final Dreamcast unit to be manufactured was autographed by the heads of all nine of Sega's internal game development studios as well as the heads of Visual Concepts and Wave Master and given away with 55 first-party Dreamcast games through a competition organized by GamePro magazine. Okawa, who had previously loaned Sega $500 million in the summer of 1999, died on March 16, 2001; shortly before his death, he forgave Sega's debts to him and returned his $695 million worth of Sega and CSK stock, helping the company survive the third-party transition. As part of this restructuring, nearly one-third of Sega's Tokyo workforce was laid off in 2001.|$|E

2500|$|During the NES era, Nintendo {{maintained}} exclusive {{control over}} titles released for the system—the company had to approve every game, each <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> could only release {{up to five}} games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami's [...] "Ultra Games" [...] brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega's console brought {{an end to this}} practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.|$|E
2500|$|During Capcom's {{fiscal year}} 2004, Viewtiful Joe 2 sold 270,000 copies in North America and 80,000 copies in Japan.

Although the ending for Viewtiful Joe 2 {{suggests}} an immediate continuation to {{the plot of the}} series, a Viewtiful Joe 3 has not been produced.

2500|$|Updated Motorola CPUs made {{a faster}} machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took {{advantage}} of the new Motorola technology and introduced the Macintosh II at $5500, powered by a [...] Motorola 68020 processor. The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked {{the start of a new}} direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several NuBus expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud. One <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty.

2500|$|The first {{indication}} of Apple Inc.'s interest in ZFS was an April 2006 {{post on the}} opensolaris.org zfs-discuss mailing list where an Apple employee mentioned being interested in porting ZFS to their Mac OS X operating system. In the release version of Mac OS X 10.5, ZFS was available in read-only mode from the command line, which lacks the possibility to create zpools or write to them. Before the 10.5 release, Apple released the [...] "ZFS Beta Seed v1.1", which allowed read-write access {{and the creation of}} zpools,; however, the installer for the [...] "ZFS Beta Seed v1.1" [...] has been reported to only work on version 10.5.0, and has not been updated for version 10.5.1 and above. In August 2007, Apple opened a ZFS project on their Mac OS Forge web site. On that site, Apple provided the source code and binaries of their port of ZFS which includes read-write access, but there was no installer available until a <b>third-party</b> <b>developer</b> created one. In October 2009, Apple announced a shutdown of the ZFS project on Mac OS Forge. That is to say that their own hosting and involvement in ZFS was summarily discontinued. No explanation was given, just the following statement: [...] "The ZFS project has been discontinued. The mailing list and repository will also be removed shortly." [...] Apple would eventually release the legally required, CDDL-derived, portion of the source code of their final public beta of ZFS, code named [...] "10a286".
