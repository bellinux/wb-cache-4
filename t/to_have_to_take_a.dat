[...] Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm. He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties. The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid. Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid. Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area. In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet [...] wide referred to as Eloise Inlet. Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models. In 1995, reports from the aftermath of Hurricane Opal created a more extensive collection of data.|$|E

40|$|Jackendoff (1987, 1990) {{has brought}} up various {{problems}} with the current use of thematic roles (Kiparsky, 1987; Bresnan & Kanerva, 1989 and references cited therein) and suggested {{a different way of}} thinking of thematic roles as structural configurations in his semantic Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCSs). Conversely, Joshi (1989) has claimed that Jackendoff’s LCSs alone are insufficient, and that an analysis of certain facts in Marathi additionally requires the existence of a level of predicate-argument structure (PAS). Below we will mention a few of Jackendoff’s arguments against the current conception of thematic roles. We will then look at Joshi’s arguments about the necessity of a level of PAS in addition to LCS and conclude that providing Jackendoff’s LCSs are integrated into a suitable syntactic theory, neither of her points are problematic to Jackendoff. 1 From there we will go on to re-examine some of the facts of Marathi, and show that certain facts that have merely been stipulated or left unanalyzed when using thematic roles, receive a rather elegant treatment when described via a combination of their syntax and LCS. To keep this paper to a squibbish length, we’re going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few things on trust. Firstly, we’ll assume that Joshi’s (1989, 1990) syntactic analysis of Marathi is essentially correct. 2 Secondly we’re going to assume a grammatical formalism that allows one to wed together LFG-is...|$|E
40|$|According to Brunkhorst (2001) and Raeberg (1997), governments who are {{responsible}} for regional (territorial) planning are in effect planning blindly as they are not taking into account the brilliant work done in related fields which could change their attitude towards planning, design, ecology & technology. The global debates on scarce resources and climate change which are causing governments <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> stand, pose questions such as: How are Scarce Resources Managed? How will injustices to the poor be rectified? What policies and guidelines are in place to promote sustainability? The theory is out there, but little or no practical implementation of the theory at broad scale through fine scale has been done to date. To this end I have created a model which takes into consideration these global issues, and tested it on the SW Wildlife ecosystem of Botswana which has all the characteristics mentioned above. Lessons have been learned from failures in Implementation Strategies at Gudigwe (N Botswana) where insufficient planning for the needs and capabilities of the local villagers created a mismatch of the socio-economic product created and the outcomes anticipated. Another example of failure was the unanticipated social culture of the Baswara who {{take care of each other}} above the needs of outsiders. The guests and management were at odds with the staff due to these cultural differences at Mababe Village Sankuyo Trust, NW Botswana. The study will contribute a model of bioregional planning from broad to fine scale which can be used in the planning & design of such regions in the future. The macro biogeographic region is defined at the Broad Scale and at the Fine Scale appropriate socioeconomic sustainable interventions are detailed...|$|E

30|$|Without {{acknowledgement}} and articulation {{how some}} conflicts—especially {{between humans and}} non-humans—can {{become a matter of}} basic survival, any deliberative, pluralist politics may encounter serious limits (Cannavó 2008). Considering the fact that continuous advocacy and representation is needed to represent non-humans (who will never speak for themselves), we need to push justice debate beyond academic compounds. This might require much more ‘affirmative action’. As a prominent anthropologist Eugene Anderson (2014) has remarked: ‘Today, with the world ecosystem crashing around us, we are going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> stands’. If animal life had been placed on an existential par with human life – or animals have been recognized as subjects of their lives – then their exploitation and that of their homelands would have been rendered morally unfeasible (Crist 2013).|$|R
