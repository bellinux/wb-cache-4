50|$|The {{first film}} in the series, Carnosaur was {{released}} to theaters on May 14, 1993. Loosely based on the John Brosnan's 1984 novel, Carnosaur. Jane Triptree (Diane Ladd), a mad scientist specializing in agricultural genetic engineering, uses chickens from the plant she works at to breed dinosaurs, eventually attempting to create a virus containing dinosaur DNA that will impregnate women with dinosaurs and kill them after birth, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> and exterminate all of humanity, which she believes needs to be destroyed, so that the dinosaurs may essentially rule the planet once again. Now {{it is up to}} the alcoholic security guard and an environmental activist to attempt to stop her and the rampaging reptiles before the military kills everyone in town to quarantine the virus, or before these Mesozoic monsters can achieve their goal in world conquest. It was a modest box-office success, reportedly grossing $1,753,979, despite a limited theatrical release.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Association of Reptile Keepers, or USARK, is a 501(c)(6) {{organization}} that lobbies {{on behalf of}} the captive bred reptile industry, which is made up of both pet owners and professional breeders of captive reptiles, as well as supporting zoos and sanctuaries. USARK has argued against a national ban that HSUS has lobbied for since its writing in 2009, which was originally intended to ban the import and interstate transport of nine constrictor snake species. However, due to pressure from the reptile keepers association, the U.S. government lessened the ban to include only four of the original nine species. As a response, Wayne Pacelle wrote on his blog in response that [...] "these large constricting snakes are not suitable as pets," [...] continuing with [...] "they suffer from capture in the wild and long-distance transport for trade; they can injure and kill people who possess or interact with them; and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> on our natural resources as an invasive species, killing native wildlife, including endangered animals." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ever {{since the}} days of the September 11 {{terrorist}} attacks many efforts have been made to increase preparation for various terrorist attacks and threats, which include the prospect of a bomb threat. One facet of bomb threats that saw major improvements in their reactive bomb threat training, is that of bomb threats dealing with air travel. Aviation professionals and US government bomb disposal operatives, succeeded in creating a Virtual Reality simulator that places trainees in a Virtual Reality scenario that range from in-flight threat interception to in airport threat interception (Chung, 2005). In the scenario, trainees are given numerous options to deal with the threat, and are given an assessment of their skills pre- and post- simulation. This is a considerable development that allows Call Bombing to be properly dealt with through sufficient training. Before the development of this tech Commercial Airline companies would neglect sufficient bomb threat training time to save in operational time. Terrorism can take many forms and bombing is one of them. Typically bombings don't cause many casualties compared to other types of terrorism, but as evidenced by the 9/11 attacks <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> on a population.|$|E
