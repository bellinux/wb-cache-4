5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trial and error to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E

Bell elaborated that this was preferable so that people who do not watch the films can still follow the series, and vice versa. He stated that [...] "ABC and Marvel both want the series {{to be able to make}} sense on its own", but that it was beneficial for the films to have the series fill in any [...] "gaps" [...] for them, due to having to be [...] "big" [...] and moving [...] "quickly <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> huge pieces", unlike television which has time to deal with more nuances.|$|E

Baker further notes that Aaronson's poetry deals with several issues of his time, such as the rise of fascism and the Second World War, but points out that Aaronson did not directly write about the Holocaust. Upon Aaronson's death, the poet Arthur Chaim Jacobs compared him with Isaac Rosenberg, the more celebrated poet of the same Anglo-Jewish generation. According to Jacobs, Aaronson was [...] "clearly influenced by him in terms of diction, and {{in a kind of}} verbal energy which runs <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> his poetry.

[...] The poet Jon Silkin also unfavourably compared Aaronson to Rosenberg, writing [...] "it cannot be said that his work attains to either the burning majesty or the depth of Rosenberg's poetry, and this is explicable perhaps by the fact that Aaronson does not altogether care to acknowledge his roots." ...|$|E
