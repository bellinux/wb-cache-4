25|$|NIS took in March 1990 {{initiative}} to centralize the local ship registers and jointly locate them with NIS. They emphasized that NIS operated an around-the-clock duty service. A joint {{location of the}} registers would allow for economies of scale, cutting costs. It would also allow time to be freed up at the magistrate offices and at the district courts. Another concern was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> rationalization program following the introduction of electronic registers had given little savings due to the decentralized nature of the operations.|$|E
25|$|Lyell's most {{important}} specific work {{was in the}} field of stratigraphy. From May 1828, until February 1829, he travelled with Roderick Impey Murchison (1792–1871) to the south of France (Auvergne volcanic district) and to Italy. In these areas he concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> strata (rock layers) could be categorised according to the number and proportion of marine shells encased within. Based on this he proposed dividing the Tertiary period into three parts, which he named the Pliocene, Miocene, and Eocene.|$|E

25|$|Peace {{following}} the Imperial victory at Stadtlohn (1623) proved short-lived, with conflict resuming at {{the initiation of}} Denmark-Norway. Danish involvement, {{referred to as the}} Low Saxon War or Kejserkrigen ("the Emperor's War"), began when Christian IV of Denmark, a Lutheran who also ruled as Duke of Holstein, a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire, helped the Lutheran rulers of neighbouring Lower Saxony by leading an army against the Imperial forces in 1625. Denmark-Norway had feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> Catholic successes threatened its sovereignty as a Protestant nation. Christian IV had also profited greatly from his policies in northern Germany. For instance, in 1621, Hamburg had been forced to accept Danish sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The role of Stephen III {{in these}} events is {{somewhat}} obscure. According to the historian Horace Mann, Stephen was an impotent observer, {{and that the}} responsible agent was in reality the Chartularius, Gratiosus. However, according to Louis Marie DeCormenin, Stephen was the key person responsible for issuing the orders, and took great delight in destroying his rival and his supporters. A middle position {{was taken by the}} historian Ferdinand Gregorovius, who observed that Stephen, while he may not have instigated or ordered the atrocities, did not seek to prevent them either, either through self-interest or the weakness of his position. What is clear however, is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> creation of the Papal States had seen the traditional rivalries of the ruling families of Rome transformed into a murderous desire to control this new temporal power in Italy, dragging the papacy with it.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, in {{response}} to JDL tactics against Soviet personnel being condemned by the Israeli Cabinet and American Jewish leaders, eight former Soviet Jews living in Israel sent cables to American Jewish leaders denouncing their condemnation of the JDL and denying that the JDL’s acts endangered Soviet Jews. The cables said they were convinced that the JDL’s “policy and activities are most effective.” The group also attacked Israeli authorities for alleged softness in fighting the Soviet Union {{on the issue of}} Jewish rights. One of the signatories, Dov Sperling, claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> cancellation of the Bolshoi Ballet’s scheduled American tour was forced by the JDL and hailed it as the first public surrender by Soviet authorities to Jewish pressure. Herut leader Menachem Begin also declared support of acts of harassment against Soviet diplomatic establishments abroad.|$|E
