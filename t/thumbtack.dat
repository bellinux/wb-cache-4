5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the <b>thumbtack</b> and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

50|$|The {{solution}} is to empty the box of <b>thumbtacks,</b> use the <b>thumbtacks</b> to nail the box to the wall, put the candle into the box, and light the candle with the match.

500|$|In 1950, Fisher's illegal {{residency}} was {{endangered by}} {{the arrest of}} Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, for whom Lona Cohen had been a courier. The Cohens were quickly spirited to Mexico {{before moving on to}} Moscow. They were to resurface in the United Kingdom using the identities of Peter and Helen Kroger. Fisher was relieved the Rosenbergs did not disclose any information about him to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), but the arrests heralded a bleak outlook for his new spy network. However, on October 21, 1952, as instructed by Moscow, Reino Häyhänen left a <b>thumbtack</b> on a signpost in New York's Central Park. The <b>thumbtack</b> signaled to Fisher that Häyhänen, his new assistant, had arrived. Codenamed [...] "VIK", Häyhänen arrived in New York on the RMS Queen Mary, under the alias Eugene Nikolai Maki. The real Maki had been born in the United States to a Finnish-American father and a New York mother in 1919. In 1927, the family migrated to Estonia. In 1948, the KGB called Häyhänen to Moscow where they issued him a new assignment. In 1949, Häyhänen freely obtained Maki's birth certificate. He was then to spend three years in Finland taking over Maki's identity.|$|E

One item on Jim and Pam's table that piques his interest is a packet of [...] "miracle legumes." [...] Dwight initially believes Jim is trying to prank him, but is astonished when they reappear after Jim had seemingly destroyed the packet. Eventually, his curiosity gets the better of him and he trades Jim a $150 telescope for the legumes. At {{the end of the}} episode, Dwight plants and waters the seeds and Jim secretly replaces the pots with full-grown plants.|$|E

After the match, both men were ravaged by the wire, and burned by the C4 explosions.
