5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being an antiprogestogen, mifepristone is also an antiglucocorticoid and a weak antiandrogen. Mifepristone's relative binding affinity at the progesterone receptor is more <b>than</b> twice <b>that</b> <b>of</b> progesterone, its relative binding affinity at the glucocorticoid receptor is more <b>than</b> three times <b>that</b> <b>of</b> dexamethasone and more <b>than</b> ten times <b>that</b> <b>of</b> cortisol; its relative binding affinity at the androgen receptor is less <b>than</b> one-third <b>that</b> <b>of</b> testosterone. It does not bind to the estrogen receptor or the mineralocorticoid receptor.|$|R
40|$|The oviposition, larval period, and {{survival}} rate of Culex pipiens were studied in three animal manure suspensions (camel, cow, and sheep). Gravid Cx. Pipiens female have significant laid more egg masses and more egg/mass in camel manure suspension <b>than</b> in <b>that</b> <b>of</b> either cow or sheep. The adult survival rate was higher in cow and sheep manure suspensions <b>than</b> in <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the camel. Culex pipiens larvae pupate significantly faster in cow manure suspension <b>than</b> in <b>that</b> <b>of</b> either camel or sheep. The possible reasons behind those variations were discussed...|$|R

5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– lower <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> iodine (2.66) {{and the same}} as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted {{to be on the}} hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E
5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the naturals and less <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most silver {{compounds}} have significant covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is higher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6kJ/mol is much higher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen (72.8kJ/mol) and not much less <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> oxygen (141.0kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals. Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable {{even in the absence}} of π-acceptor ligands.|$|E
