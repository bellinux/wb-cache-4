40|$|In {{this paper}} I develop a {{rational}} choice model which will provide some {{answers to the}} central question of the paper, under which conditions it becomes probable to observe free <b>trade</b> <b>policies.</b> This rational choice model constitutes a synthesis of a game theoretic and an institutional analysis of <b>trade</b> <b>policies.</b> The game theoretic analysis presented in the paper exemplifies that traditional game theory provides a good framework for a strategic analysis of <b>trade</b> <b>policies.</b> However, it is not without interpretive problems. In order to provide a correct interpretation of <b>trade</b> <b>policies,</b> {{it is necessary to}} gain a good understanding of {{the true nature of the}} players as well as the domestic framework and foundation of their <b>trade</b> <b>policies.</b> This leads us to the analysis of domestic institutions. It is shown that they define the true nature of the players and provide a framework for the trade game. When we combine the insights of the institutional analysis with traditional game theory, we add a new dimension to the strategic analysis of <b>trade</b> <b>policies.</b> It becomes possible to trace and explain the underlying causes for past and present <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> and predict future <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> with more accuracy. Furthermore, we can clarify the conditions under which it becomes probable to observe free <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> and how to achieve this cooperative solution. The rational choice model presented in this paper makes an important contribution to the understanding of <b>trade</b> <b>policies.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper generalizes {{the recent}} {{political}} economy model of Helpman and Grossman in which contributions by producer lobbies and government decisions about <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> are modeled {{as a common}} agency game. We allow the government to choose among domestic as well as trade interventions. When production and <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> are available, the equilibrium production policies serve the lobbies while the <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> reflect the country's international market power. When consumption and <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> are available, tariffs and export subsidies are applied in a small-country model to serve the special interests, and the domestic policies are selected to restore consumer prices to world levels. In a large-country model, the optimal consumption and <b>trade</b> <b>policies</b> reflect terms-of <b>trade</b> as well as special-interest considerations. The political equilibrium policies of Grossman and Helpman are special cases where the government has only trade instruments at hand.

5|$|John Stuart Mill was {{impressed}} by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in The Malay Archipelago. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his Land Tenure Reform Association, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873.

5|$|The European {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products and industrial commodities stipulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids {{played a leading role}} in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the Red Sea. The <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> of the Ayyubids placed them in a position of great advantage; although they cooperated with the Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the Red Sea. Thus, they kept the trade of the Indian Ocean exclusively in their hands. In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids drew large benefits in the form of taxes and commissions which they learned from the Italians.|$|E

5|$|While the Lowlands {{had seen}} {{widespread}} agricultural improvement, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional.

As late as 1878, 68 families owned {{nearly half the}} land in Scotland. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society.

In May 2004 Bo {{was one of the few}} ministers hand-picked to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe. The <b>trade</b> <b>policy</b> of the United States toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in Washington.

5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the {{highlands}} remained very poor and traditional, with few {{connections to the}} uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers.

5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in the mid-nineteenth century, when Britain adopted a free <b>trade</b> <b>policy,</b> and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E
