5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen <b>to,</b> <b>analyze</b> <b>and</b> respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
5|$|At the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main {{responsibilities}} were <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> <b>and</b> report {{field data}} on fish populations, {{and to write}} brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote {{a steady stream of}} articles for The Baltimore Sun and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{conventional}} classroom learning, {{in which}} a teacher lectures to the student and the student memorizes and repeats the information back in tests, and unlike an academic seminary, where students do independent research, chavrusa learning challenges the student <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> <b>and</b> verbally explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely {{new insights into the}} meaning of the text.|$|E

25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of serialism eventually became rooted in set theory, {{and uses a}} seemingly quasi-mathematical vocabulary to describe how the basic sets are manipulated to produce the final result.

25|$|Natural {{products}} may {{be extracted}} from the cells, tissues, and secretions of microorganisms, plants and animals. A crude (unfractionated) extract from {{any one of these}} sources will contain a range of structurally diverse and often novel chemical compounds. Chemical diversity in nature is based on biological diversity, so researchers travel around the world obtaining samples <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> <b>and</b> evaluate in drug discovery screens or bioassays. This effort to search for natural products is known as bioprospecting.|$|E
25|$|Merchants {{are also}} {{required}} to lease or purchase processing equipment, {{in some cases}} this equipment is provided free of charge by the processor. Merchants must also satisfy data security compliance standards which are highly technical and complicated.
