500|$|The zombie {{argument}} {{is based on}} a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' {{argument is}} that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics, the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one. Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie {{is a product of the}} physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that [...] "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!" ...|$|E

500|$|The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis was another important {{issue in the}} election, even more so after Portugal applied for an EU bailout on 6 April, {{the first day of}} advance voting. According to an opinion poll nearly 60% of Finns were against Finland's participation in bailing out the crisis-ridden countries. All four parties of the governing coalition (Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Green League and the Swedish People's Party) support Finland's participation in the bailout and all four opposition parties (Social Democrats, Left Alliance, Christian Democrats and the True Finns) oppose such measures. The issue helped Soini become the most visible opposition leader. Soini then also stated that his party would not join in any coalition that supports guarantees to the crisis-ridden EU countries. He said that their crises are a consequence of the EU's failure. Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen had commented that a bailout for Portugal should only happen if the Portuguese parliament passed even tougher austerity measures than the failed programme that led to an early Portuguese election: [...] "The package must be really strict because otherwise it doesn't make any sense. The package must be harder and more comprehensive than the one the parliament voted against." [...] Despite his comments, the National Coalition Party believed the bailout to be in Finland's interests. It, along with the Centre Party, supported the bailout under the EU's auspices, while the True Finns and the Social Democrats were opposed to it. The True Finns said that Finnish taxpayers were being unjustly burdened by [...] "squanderers" [...] within the eurozone and pointed out that no one aided Finland during its own financial crisis in the 1990s. Helsingin Sanomat read the affair as having added [...] "confusion" [...] and complexity to the electoral race. The effect of the Finnish election on a possible EU bailout caused concern amongst to international investors as [...] "it is a very distinct possibility that the next government and parliament of Finland will not want to agree to <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current government has signed up for, namely supporting Portugal and agreeing to the permanent and temporary crisis mechanisms," [...] as there was said to be an [...] "even chance" [...] of Finland blocking a bailout for Portugal as its support was crucial because it would need the unanimous support of all national governments to pass. Finland's participation was further thrown in doubt as it was the only eurozone country to require parliamentary approval of any such measure. Should a new Finnish administration opt out of the bailout, this could throw into doubt the eurozone's capacity to maintain financial stability.|$|E

2500|$|Chalmers' {{argument}} is that it seems plausible that such a being could exist because {{all that is needed}} is that all and only <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> physical sciences describe and observe about a human being must be true of the zombie. None of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be described scientifically via physics whether it is conscious or not. The mere logical possibility of a p-zombie demonstrates that consciousness is a natural phenomenon beyond the current unsatisfactory explanations. Chalmers states that one probably could not build a living p-zombie because living things seem to require a level of consciousness. However (unconscious?) robots built to simulate humans may become the first real p-zombies. Hence Chalmers half-joking calls for the need to build a [...] "consciousness meter" [...] to ascertain if any given entity, human or robot, is conscious or not.|$|E
2500|$|Early Baconians were {{influenced}} by Victorian bardolatry, which portrayed Shakespeare as a profound intellectual, [...] "the greatest intellect who, in our recorded world, has left record of himself {{in the way of}} Literature", as Thomas Carlyle stated. In conformity with these ideas, Baconian writer Harry Stratford Caldecott held that the Shakespearean work was of such an incalculably higher calibre than that of contemporary playwrights that it could not possibly have been written by any of them. Even mainstream Shakespearean scholar Horace Howard Furness, wrote that [...] "Had the plays come down to us anonymously – had the labour of discovering the author been imposed upon future generations – we could have found no one of that day but Francis Bacon to whom to assign the crown. [...] In this case it would have been resting now upon his head by almost common consent." [...] "He was," [...] agreed Caldecott, [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plays of Shakespeare demand that the author should be – a man of vast and boundless ambition and attainments, a philosopher, a poet, a lawyer, a statesman." ...|$|E

Moses repeated the commandments to the people, who answered: [...] "All <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lord has commanded we will do!" [...] Moses then wrote the commandments down. He set up an altar and some young Israelite men offered sacrifices. Moses took a book {{referred to as the}} Book of the Covenant and read the covenant aloud to the people, who once again affirmed that they would follow it. Moses took blood from the sacrifices and dashed it on the people. Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the 70 elders of Israel then ascended, saw God, ate, and drank. Moses and Joshua arose, and Moses ascended Mount Sinai, leaving Aaron and Hur in charge of legal matters. A cloud covered the mountain, hiding the Presence of the Lord for six days, appearing to the Israelites as a fire {{on the top of the}} mountain. Moses went inside the cloud and remained on the mountain for 40 days and nights.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving etymology of {{the word}} is from late antiquity. The 5th century (AD) Etymologicon by Orion of Thebes offers two alternative origins for the word eunuch: first, to tēn eunēn ekhein, [...] "guarding the bed", a derivation inferred from eunuchs' established role {{at the time as}} [...] "bedchamber attendants" [...] in the imperial palace, and second, to eu tou nou ekhein, [...] "being good with respect to the mind", which Orion explains based on their [...] "being deprived of male-female intercourse (esterēmenou tou misgesthai), <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancients used to call irrational (anoēta, literally: 'mindless')". Orion's second option reflects well-established idioms in Greek, as shown by entries for noos, eunoos and ekhein in Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, while the first option is not listed as an idiom under eunē in that standard reference work. However, the first option was cited by the late 9th century Byzantine emperor Leo VI in his New Constitution 98 banning the marriage of eunuchs, in which he noted eunuchs' reputation as trustworthy guardians of the marriage bed (eunē) and claimed that the very word eunuch attested to this kind of employment. The emperor also goes further than Orion by attributing eunuchs' lack of male-female intercourse specifically to castration, which he said was performed with the intention [...] "that they will no longer do the things that males do, or at least to extinguish whatever has to do with desire for the female sex". The 11th century Byzantine monk Nikon of the Black Mountain, opting instead for Orion's second alternative, stated that the word came from eunoein (eu [...] "good" [...] + nous [...] "mind"), thus meaning [...] "to be well-minded, well-inclined, well-disposed or favorable", but unlike Orion he argued that this was due to the trust that certain jealous and suspicious foreign rulers placed in the loyalty of their eunuchized servants. Theophylact of Ohrid in a dialogue In Defence of Eunuchs also stated that the origin {{of the word}} was from eunoein and ekhein, [...] "to have, hold", since they were always [...] "well-disposed" [...] toward the master who [...] "held" [...] or owned them. The 12th century Etymologicum Magnum (s.v. eunoukhos) essentially repeats the entry from Orion, but stands by the first option, while attributing the second option to what [...] "some say". In the late 12th century, Eustathius of Thessalonica (Commentaries on Homer 1256.30, 1643.16) offered an original derivation of the word from eunis + okheuein, [...] "deprived of mating".|$|E
