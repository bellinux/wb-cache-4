40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy based leader-follower flocking system. To maintain {{the distance between}} robots, we use a fuzzy logic controller to design a "force function" which {{is related to the}} relative distance between neighbours. The "force function" is used to control velocity of robots. To prove stability of <b>the</b> <b>flocking</b> system, we build a Hamilton function which is kinetic energy of <b>the</b> <b>flocking</b> system. Utilizing <b>the</b> LaSalle's invariance principle, we prove that the system is stable. Specially, we develop a flocking controller in local form. By using the local controller, the robots in <b>the</b> <b>flocking</b> system only need to know local information (relative distances and relative angles between neighbours). To evaluate performance of <b>the</b> <b>flocking</b> system, we simulate <b>the</b> <b>flocking</b> system tracking trajectories with different shapes. <b>The</b> local <b>flocking</b> algorithm is tested with three Pioneer robots.

5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time.

Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to <b>the</b> <b>flock,</b> became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in <b>the</b> <b>flock.</b>|$|E

5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common {{starlings}} in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted.

Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used.

40|$|From 2007 – 2008, data {{on animal}} {{health and welfare}} and farm {{management}} during rearing and laying periods were collected from 49 flocks of organic laying hens in the Netherlands. Our aim was to investigate how organic egg farms performed in terms of {{animal health and welfare}} and which farm factors affected this performance. <b>The</b> <b>flocks</b> in our study were kept on farms with 34 to 25, 000 hens (average 9, 300 hens). Seventy-one percent of <b>the</b> <b>flocks</b> consisted of ‘silver hybrids’: white hens that lay brown eggs. Fifty-five percent of <b>the</b> <b>flocks</b> were kept in floor-based housing and 45 % of <b>the</b> <b>flocks</b> in aviaries. No relation was found between {{the amount of time spent}} outdoors during the laying period and mortality at 60 weeks. Flocks that used their outdoor run more intensively had better feather scores. In 40 % of <b>the</b> <b>flocks</b> there was mortality caused by predators. The average feed intake was 129 g/day at 30 weeks and 133 g/day at 60 weeks of age. The average percentage of mislaid eggs decreased from three at 30 weeks to two at 60 weeks. The average mortality was 7. 8 % at 60 weeks. Twenty-five percent of <b>the</b> <b>flocks</b> were not treated for worms in their first 50 weeks. Flubenol© was applied to <b>the</b> <b>flocks</b> that were treated. Ten percent of <b>the</b> <b>flocks</b> followed Flubenol© instructions for use and were wormed five or more times. The other 65 % percent were treated irregularly between one and four times. Sixty-eight percent of <b>the</b> <b>flocks</b> showed little or no feather damage, 24 % showed moderate damage and 8 % showed severe damage. The feather score was better if the hens used the free-range area more intensely, the laying percentage at 60 weeks was higher, and if they were allowed to go outside sooner after arrival on the laying farm. In 69 % of <b>the</b> <b>flocks,</b> hens had peck wounds in the vent area: on average this was 18 % of the hens. Keel bone deformations were found in all flocks, on average in 21 % of the birds. In 78 % of <b>the</b> <b>flocks,</b> an average of 13 % of the hens had foot-sole wounds, mostly a small crust. Combs were darker in <b>flocks</b> that used <b>the</b> range area more intensively. More fearful flocks had lighter combs. We conclude that organic farms are potentially more animal friendly than other poultry systems based on the animal welfare benefits of the free range areas. However, we also observed mortality rates, internal parasites, keel bone deformities, and foot sole lesions on organic farms that were comparable to or worse than in other husbandry systems. It is unclear whether these ‘remaining’ problems can be attributed to housing or if they are the result of keeping high productive genotypes in an artificial environment. Organic farms use the same high productive genotypes as other husbandry systems...|$|R

5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of <b>the</b> <b>flock.</b> The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash. Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from <b>the</b> <b>flock</b> of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City.

5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger <b>the</b> <b>flock</b> size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
