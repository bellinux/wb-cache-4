5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} ornamentation {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on <b>the</b> <b>transom,</b> the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a lectern that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} there was a repair done on the {{portside}} hull. To patch it, a larger portion of the hull was worked away and a rebate was cut around the edges. Then, a repair patch, some 1.25 m long, was manufactured with similar rebates so both parts would perfectly match. In both parts, the corresponding holes were cut and tree-nails used to fasten them from outside. The other repair, which was done to the starboard inner face of the hull at the stern, was patched by an insertion of a pre-shaped block and fastened by a tree-nail. Based on the analysis of the hull, this repair was initiated as a split stopper. Boring a hole at one end of a split is a recognized way of minimizing a possibility of its spreading. The split was therefore caulked, a section of wood around <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> removed, and the repair block inserted and <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> finished.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to Japanese Shinyo motorboats, MT boats, though very {{dangerous}} {{to use in}} combat, were not designed as suicide weapons: The pilot, installed over <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> had a crude ejector seat and after bailing out, the seat acted as a miniature raft to keep the pilot {{out of the water}} and immune from the lethal shock of the underwater explosion. Another very innovative design was the Isotta-Fraschini Z-drive transmission system, featuring an inboard engine and twin outboard contra-rotating propellers.|$|E

25|$|Transoms – These timbers extend {{across the}} low {{parts of the}} hull near the rudder, and are secured (notched and/or bolted) to the sternpost. <b>The</b> <b>transom</b> located {{at the base of}} the stern, and the {{uppermost}} of the main transoms, was typically called the wing transom; the principal transom below this and level with the lower deck was called the deck transom; between these two were a series of filling transoms. If the stern had transoms above the wing transom, they would no longer be affixed to the sternpost. The first of these might be called a counter transom; next up was the window sill transom; above that, the spar deck transom. The larger the vessel, the more numerous and wider the transoms required to support its stern.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of arbori suspendere—hanging on an arbor infelix ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the supplicium more maiorum, punishment {{in accordance with the}} custom of our ancestors) consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death. Tertullian mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion, but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase infelix lignum (unfortunate wood) for <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> ("patibulum") or the whole cross. Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibulum to the upright stipes.|$|E

Below <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> were the main entry doors, with glazed panels and side lights matching the flanking windows. A radial fanlight filled the lunette above <b>the</b> <b>transom.</b> In each of the spandrels to the left and right of the arch, Dance set a carving of a lyre inside a ribboned wreath. Above all this ran a panelled band course dividing the lower storey from the upper.|$|E
500|$|Payne's initial {{intent was}} to make the ship's stern profile with a spoon shape, similar to that on most {{previous}} ocean liners, but the mounting of the propeller pods required a flat transom. The compromise was a Constanzi stern— a combination of the two. The final design was agreed upon, as a Constanzi stern provides <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> required for azimuthal pod propulsors, and provides better seaholding characteristics in a following swell than a standard transom stern.

500|$|In his classification, Sharpe first {{identified}} two main classes, {{according to whether}} the arches were [...] "circular" [...] or [...] "pointed". [...] The class characterised by the circular arch was the Romanesque class; that by the pointed arch was the Gothic. [...] He divided the Romanesque class into two periods by date rather than by stylistic differences, the dividing date being 1066; this divided the [...] "Saxon" [...] from the [...] "Norman" [...] stage. Whereas Rickman allowed pointed arches when they occurred {{in the same building}} as round arches in his Norman period, Sharpe separated buildings that contained both types of arches into a separate intermediate style, the [...] "Transitional". When it came to the Gothic class, Sharpe identified four styles, in contrast to Rickman's three, using the windows to differentiate between them. [...] The earliest style was characterised by windows resembling a lancet [...] "in its length, breadth, and principal proportions". [...] These windows might be single, or in groups of two, three, five, or seven. [...] This style he termed the [...] "Lancet Period". During the next period, tracery appeared in the windows, and originally consisted of simple geometric forms, in particular the circle. [...] This period he called the [...] "Geometrical Period". Later the tracery became more complex, including the ogee curve; the characteristic feature being the [...] "sinuosity of form" [...] in the windows and elsewhere. [...] This Sharpe termed the [...] "Curvilinear Period". Finally, <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> appeared in the windows, and the curved line in the tracery became replaced by straight lines, an [...] "angularity of form", and a [...] "square edge was preferred". [...] This style he named the [...] "Rectilinear Period". The approximate dates Sharpe gave for his periods were, following 1066, the Norman Period up to 1145, the Transitional Period to 1190, the Lancet Period to 1245, the Geometrical Period to 1315, the Curvilinear Period to 1360, and the Rectilinear Period to 1550.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{the stern}} {{is at the}} right angle {{to the rest of}} the boat. Approximately [...] forward of the stern, a {{transverse}} groove was cut into the bottom and sides to support <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> piece. Forward of <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> several grooves were cut to support transverse shelves, with the most aft shelf covering <b>the</b> <b>transom.</b> Such fitted transoms, which enclose the end of the log, were relatively common in prehistoric logboats. In the case of the Hasholme boat, the rotted heart prevented the construction of an integrated bow and stern, therefore both sections had to be precisely fitted and watertight. <b>The</b> <b>transom</b> itself is 1 m high and 1.08 m in breadth, with rounded lower profile and upper corners cut away. The thickness varies from 25mm to 90mm. At the top portion of <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> there are two horizontal holes without any visible wear. Since the original transom weighed between [...] those holes were necessary to place it inside the grooves. Those grooves were later caulked with some mixture of mosses and twigs to make the whole structure watertight. The upper corner of the starboard was cut away and a long tree-nail driven through both sides of the hull. tightening <b>the</b> <b>transom</b> in place. The second function of this tree-nail was to form a tie between both sides of the hull, with similar beam-ties in the bow section of the boat.|$|E
