500|$|At {{approximately}} 7:20 pm on Friday, September 19, 2014, Gonzalez scaled {{the iron}} perimeter fence of the White House. Several agents pursued him, {{as he ran}} directly towards the North Portico doors, which were unlocked. President Barack Obama and his daughters had just left the White House and were heading to Camp David {{at the time of}} the incident. Michelle Obama was also not home, having travelled to the retreat earlier. Agents stated they chose not to shoot at Gonzalez as he did not have a weapon in his hands, and was not wearing clothing that could conceal a significant amount of explosives; the possibility of accidentally hitting civilians beyond the fence was also cited. A senior official stated: [...] "A lot of people want to judge the Secret Service for not shooting, but [...] number of <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be considered in this situation, including whether or not the principal is in the residence" [...] adding, [...] "given what's emerged about [...] since the arrest, maybe we'll look back and say the Secret Service played a role in saving his life." ...|$|E

Space media reported that SpaceX had [...] "already {{begun to take}} market share" [...] from Arianespace. Arianespace has requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX. European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce Ariane 5 and the future Ariane 6 rocket launch prices {{as a result of}} competition from SpaceX. According to one Arianespace managing director in 2015, it was clear that [...] "a very significant challenge [...] coming from SpaceX ... Therefore <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change ... and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined." [...] Jean Botti, Director of innovation for Airbus (which makes the Ariane 5) warned that [...] "those who don't take Elon Musk seriously will have a lot to worry about." [...] In 2014, no commercial launches were booked to fly on the Russian Proton rocket.|$|E

2500|$|Paragraph 20:Of these duties, the {{following}} bind the proletarian and the worker: fully and faithfully {{to perform the}} work which has been freely and equitably agreed upon; never to injure the property, nor to outrage the person, of an employer; never to resort to violence in defending their own cause, nor to engage in riot or disorder; and to {{have nothing to do}} with men of evil principles, who work upon the people with artful promises of great results, and excite foolish hopes which usually end in useless regrets and grievous loss. The following duties bind the wealthy owner and the employer: not to look upon their work-people as their bondsmen, but to respect in every man his dignity as a person ennobled by Christian character. They are reminded that, according to natural reason and Christian philosophy, working for gain is creditable, not shameful, to a man, since it enables him to earn an honorable livelihood; but to misuse men as though they were things in the pursuit of gain, or to value them solely for their physical powers—that is truly shameful and inhuman. Again justice demands that, in dealing with the working man, religion and the good of his soul must be kept in mind. Hence, the employer is bound to see that the worker has time for his religious duties; that he be not exposed to corrupting influences and dangerous occasions; and that he be not led away to neglect his home and family, or to squander his earnings. Furthermore, the employer must never tax his work people beyond their strength, or employ them in work unsuited to their sex and age. His great and principal duty is to give every one what is just. Doubtless, before deciding whether wages are fair, many <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be considered; but wealthy owners and all masters of labor should be mindful of this—that to exercise pressure upon the indigent and the destitute for the sake of gain, and to gather one’s profit out of the need of another, is condemned by all laws, human and divine. To defraud any one of wages that are his due is a great crime which cries to the avenging anger of Heaven. [...] "Behold, the hire of the laborers … which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth; and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth." [...] Lastly, the rich must religiously refrain from cutting down the workmen’s earnings, whether by force, by fraud, or by usurious dealing; and with all the greater reason because the laboring man is, as a rule, weak and unprotected, and because his slender means should in proportion to their scantiness be accounted sacred. Were these precepts carefully obeyed and followed out, would they not be sufficient of themselves to keep under all strife and all its causes? ...|$|E
