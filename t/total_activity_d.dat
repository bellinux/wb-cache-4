When darkened protoplasts were illuminated, both activation and <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> increased, but at different rates; the t½ were 2. 3 and 6. 7 minutes, respectively. The light response of rubisco activation state and <b>total</b> <b>activity,</b> measured after 15 minutes of illumination, were similar but their responses to light transitions and photosynthetic inhibitors were different. When irradiance was reduced from saturating to subsaturating, deactivation of rubisco in protoplasts was immediate, whereas there was little change in <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> during the first 20 minutes following the transition.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Physical activity (mean accelerometry counts/minute) was assessed over 3 days using the Computer Science and Applications accelerometer in 3 - to 4 -year-old children (n = 104; 52 boys; mean age, 3. 7 +/- 0. 4 years). In 60 children (30 boys), measurements were repeated 1 year later. RESULTS: Mean <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> at baseline was 777 +/- 207 counts/minute in boys and 657 +/- 172 counts/minute for girls; this gender difference was significant (p &# 60; 0. 001). In the cross-sectional analysis, <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> was significantly positively related to age (r = 0. 37, p = 0. 007).

40|$|IntroductionThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the associations of accelerometer-derived <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day and minutes of bouted moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with insulin resistance. MethodsThe sample included 2, 394 adults (aged 22 ̆ 030520 y) from the 200322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Time spent in MVPA, measured by using 2 cutpoints (22 ̆ 03052, 020 counts/min [MVPA 2, 020] and 22 ̆ 0305760 counts/min [MVPA 760]), was calculated for bouts of at least 8 to 10 minutes. <b>Total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day reflects the <b>total</b> amount of <b>activity</b> across all intensities. Insulin resistance was measured via the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Two nested regression models regressed HOMA-IR and QUICKI, respectively, on minutes of bouted MVPA and <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day. We used an adjusted Wald F statistic to illustrate strength of association. ResultsAfter adjustment for covariates, <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day was more strongly associated with both HOMA-IR (adjusted Wald F = 36. 83, P <. 001) and QUICKI (adjusted Wald F = 29. 44, P <. 001) compared with MVPA 2, 020 (HOMA-IR, adjusted Wald F = 4. 00, P =. 06; QUICKI, adjusted Wald F = 1. 08, P =. 31). <b>Total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day was more strongly associated with both HOMA-IR (adjusted Wald F = 13. 64, P <. 001) and QUICKI (adjusted Wald F = 12. 10, P <. 001) compared with MVPA 760 (HOMA-IR, adjusted Wald F = 1. 13, P =. 30; QUICKI, adjusted Wald F = 0. 97, P =. 33). ConclusionOur study indicated that <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> counts per day has stronger associations with insulin resistance compared with minutes of bouted MVPA.
