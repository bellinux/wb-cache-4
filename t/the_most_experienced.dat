5|$|After a {{full season}} in 1988 and the team's first {{championship}} points, courtesy of Claudio Langes in 1989, {{it became apparent that}} Forti was improving as a competitive force. In 1990, Gianni Morbidelli scored Forti's first victory in an F3000 race, and although no Forti driver won a championship title in this category, the team established itself as a frequent front-runner, scoring nine wins and five pole positions in International F3000. From 1993 onwards, Forti concentrated solely on F3000, and ran drivers such as Naspetti, Fabrizio Giovanardi, Andrea Montermini and Hideki Noda. 1991 was Forti's most successful season in F3000, with Naspetti finishing third in the Drivers' Championship, ten points behind champion Christian Fittipaldi. Although the team's form dipped over subsequent years, by 1994 Forti was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>experienced</b> team in the championship, employing Noda and Pedro Diniz as drivers.|$|E
5|$|As expected, the Australian team's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller, {{retired from}} cricket after the tour. Harvey {{replaced}} Johnson as Victorian captain {{and was the}} logical choice as successor to the Test captaincy, as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>experienced</b> {{member of the team}} (48 Tests). Queensland's captain, the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall, was no longer an automatic Test selection. However, both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. Harvey was surprisingly overlooked for the captaincy, which went to Ian Craig, who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper. Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests; he had yet to establish himself in the team. After several disappointing results against England, the selectors chose a youthful team. Harvey was named vice-captain to Craig for both the 1956–57 non-Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957–58 Test tour to South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Dean's {{plan was}} to airlift one {{battalion}} of the 24th Infantry Division into South Korea via C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft and to block advancing North Korean forces while {{the remainder of the}} division was transported on ships. The 21st Infantry Regiment was identified as the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>experienced,</b> having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. On July 5, Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan, delaying 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being defeated. The 540-man force suffered 60 killed, 21 wounded and 82 captured, a very heavy casualty rate. In the chaos of the retreat, most of the bodies were left behind, and the fates of many of the missing were unknown for several weeks.|$|E

On 5 March, the Allied command decided that several senior RAF and RAAF officers {{had to be}} evacuated from Bandung. Winckel {{was chosen as the}} pilot.

However, Winckel was seen to be one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>experienced</b> pilots because of his terrain knowledge as a flight instructor at Bandung and his recent refugee flights. Another factor was that his Lodestar, although it had been damaged in the attack on Broome, was considered the most suitable plane for the evacuation mission. Winckel flew to Java, where he managed to land his plane on a road lit by jeep headlights. He picked up fourteen passengers, refuelled the plane and successfully returned to Australia.|$|E
