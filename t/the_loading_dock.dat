5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>dock,</b> the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E

5000|$|The massive 14-story {{building}} covered {{an entire}} city block, bounded by Market, Washington, Bank and Halsey Streets. The phone exchange, 565, was devoted solely to Bamberger's, with local direct-dial numbers for most of New Jersey's suburbs for telephone orders, known as [...] "Tele-Service." [...] <b>The</b> building's <b>loading</b> <b>dock</b> was located well below ground on the fourth-basement level, avoiding the blocking of busy city streets by delivery trucks at street-level. Two massive elevators carried fully loaded 18-wheeled trucks from Washington Street down to <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>docks.</b>|$|R
25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>dock</b> area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to the showroom and warehouse. Crews entering the showroom reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light puffs of smoke visible near the ceiling {{at the back of}} the showroom. Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter the showroom. Firefighters were ordered to stretch two hose lines into the showroom to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected hose line from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small handline to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|E
25|$|In November 2001, club owner Marc Barnes {{opened a}} new, large, luxurious nightclub, Dream, at 1350 Okie Street NE. The four-story club had several {{extensive}} dance floors, semi-private space for patrons {{who paid for}} it, a number of bars, and catered {{to a wide range}} of races and age groups as well as people with musical tastes ranging from 1980s New Wave to hip-hop to Hi-NRG electronic dance music. The extreme popularity of Dream created several problems for Ivy City residents, including excessive traffic and parking problems, loud noise from patrons and automobiles, public urination, street fights, and even stabbings and gunfire. In an attempt to alleviate the parking problems, Dream began offering valet parking. To do so, it illegally closed the two blocks of Okie Street NE every night the club was open. Even individuals who lived on Okie Street had to pay $15 to park where they were legally entitled to do so. The club also illegally commandeered <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>dock</b> at the shuttered Hecht's warehouse for parking. The club changed its name to Love in 2005, underwent a significant renovation, and opened a fourth floor.|$|E
500|$|The {{handling}} of the car was then tested. It climbed a set of hills with blind turns while increasing its speed by 10% each time. At the top, the car almost crashes into an oncoming semi-truck before swerving out of the way. [...] The car was now brought to the final test shown in the briefing room: the barrier test. The car lined up across from a barrier and began to accelerate towards it. [...] Just before hitting the barrier a series of flashes occurred, where {{a picture of the}} guests was taken, and the barrier opened to a track outside. The car took a lap around the building with banked turns and a max speed of 64.9mph (104.6km/h). [...] As the car returned to <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> <b>dock,</b> a thermal scan was taken of the guests and shown on a large screen.|$|E
