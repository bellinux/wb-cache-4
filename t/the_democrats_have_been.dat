5000|$|Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) {{accused the}} Democrats of only being {{interested}} in politics and not in actually encouraging companies {{to stay in the}} United States. McConnell pointed to reducing corporate tax rates as a step that would keep businesses in the United States that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unwilling to take. According to McConnell, the bill is [...] "designed for campaign rhetoric and failure - not to create jobs here in the U.S." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{endorsed}} by several notable figures in Norway.

Professional Elvis impersonator Kjell Elvis has long endorsed Vidar Kleppe, and subsequently the Democrats, and stood as a low-key candidate for it in 2011. Country artist Åsmund Åmli stood as a low-key candidate for the party in both the 2007 and 2011 local elections.|$|E
50|$|The Republican National Convention met in mid-May 1860, after <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{forced to}} adjourn their {{convention}} in Charleston.

5000|$|After {{years of}} joint {{occupation}} of the disputed area between Mexican California and Russian America known as the Oregon Country to the Americans, and as the Columbia District to the British, American expansionists like U.S. Senator Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana urged U.S. President James K. Polk to annex the entire Oregon Country up to latitude 54°40′N, as <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> elected on <b>the</b> slogan [...] "Fifty-Four Forty or Fight".|$|R
50|$|Congress adjourned in October for the 1968 presidential elections, and the ABM system {{became a}} {{political}} issue during the campaign. Nixon <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stating {{for some time that}} <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> deliberately dragging their feet on the ABM issue, which, during the early campaign, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> non-contentious. But by the time the elections had concluded in November, local opposition groups had grown in size and popularity, and formed in almost all of the cities hosting the bases.|$|R
50|$|New York City {{is split}} between 12 of the state's 27 congressional districts, {{all but one}} held by Democrats. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{particularly}} dominant in the city's federal politics since the 1990s; even before then, Republicans only had a realistic chance at winning three of the city's districts. With former city councilman Michael McMahon's victory in the Staten Island-based 13th District (now the 11th District) — historically the most conservative district in the city — the Democrats took all of the city's congressional seats {{for the first time}} in 76 years. The status would be short lived as Republican Michael Grimm would defeat McMahon 2 years later. Due almost entirely to the Democrats' near-total dominance at the local level, the Democrats have held a majority of the state's congressional seats since the late 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|The Los Angeles Times also {{published}} a supportive review. Reporter Carolyn Kellogg wrote that Clinton had authored [...] "a book with the chutzpah that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> missing." [...] She also remarked, The {{most interesting thing}} about this book is not the economic arguments themselves, but that they're being made in one place, in plain language, by Clinton. The former president has blossomed as an elder statesman, standing {{side by side with}} both Bush presidents to support emergency relief, forming his nonpartisan foundation and friendships with powerful players of all stripes... close political watchers may take issue with parts of the book— the characterizations are broad, he omits his own administration's healthcare efforts and underplays its role in financial deregulation, his hopes for green technology are rosier than others predict, and very real political influences like money and lobbyists don't factor into his analysis or prescriptions. But Clinton himself seems convinced he's put together a coherent economic picture that is honest, persuasive and necessary.|$|E

40|$|On Tuesday, New Yorkers {{will vote}} in primary {{elections}} {{to choose the}} Democratic and Republican candidates for the city’s directly elected mayoralty. Tony Travers writes that while <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> out of power for two decades, {{in a city that}} is generally supportive of them, they have now emerged as front runners to win the vote in November, most likely in the form of Bill De Blasio.

40|$|For decades, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{viewed as}} the party of the poor, with the Republicans {{representing}} the rich. Recent presidential elections, however, have shown a reverse pattern, with Democrats performing well in the richer blue states in the northeast and coasts, and Republicans dominating in the red states {{in the middle of the}} country and the south. Through multilevel modeling of individuallevel survey data and county- and state-level demographic and electoral data, we reconcile these patterns. Furthermore, we find that income matters more in red America than in blue America. In poor states, rich people are much more likely than poor people to vote for the Republican presidential candidate, but in rich states (such as Connecticut), income has a very low correlation with vote preference...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the origins and development of Hong Kong's embattled democracy. It seeks to explain why, although Hong Kong has already acquired most of the "prerequisites" for democratization, its democracy has been so restricted and contested compared {{to those in the}} East Asian newly industrialized economies (NIEs). It also argues that Hong Kong possesses much less favorable structural conditions for democratization than its East Asian neighbors because it has a stronger conservative alliance of state and Big Business on the one hand, and a weaker populist alliance of service professionals and grass-roots population on the other. However, the Tiananmen incident of June 1989 revitalized the Hong Kong democracy project almost overnight, and now that <b>the</b> <b>democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> strengthened, {{they have been able to}} contest the rules of restricted democracy as imposed by the conservative alliance of Beijing and Big Business...|$|E

5000|$|According to the News of Delaware County, the {{senators}} predicted [...] "you're {{going to get}} Ike" [...] and repeated an oft-used G.O.P. accusation that the administration allowed China to fall to the Communists in the late 1940s and this in turn, helped fuel the war in Korea.

40|$|We {{find that}} income matters more in “red America ” than in “blue America. ” In poor states, rich people {{are much more}} likely than poor people to vote for the Republican presidential candidate, but in rich states (such as Connecticut), income has a very low {{correlation}} with vote preference. In addition to finding this pattern and studying its changes over time, we use the concepts of typicality and availability from cognitive psychology to explain how these patterns can be commonly misunderstood. Our results can be viewed either as a debunking of the journalistic image of rich “latte ” Democrats and poor “Nascar ” Republicans, or as support for the journalistic images of political and cultural differences between red and blue states— differences which are not explained by differences in individuals ’ incomes. For decades, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> viewed as the party of the poor, with the Republi-cans representing the rich. Recent presidential elections, however, have shown a reverse pat-tern, with Democrats performing well in the richer “blue ” states in the northeast and west coast, and Republicans dominating in the “red ” states {{in the middle of the}} country.

As Marshal Plaek was still Premier, tensions between the military and the Democrat/palace-alliance steadily increased. On November 29, 1951, the military and the police seized power, just as King Bhumibol's ship was returning to Thai waters. Although the military's 1952 constitution, which was similar to the 1932 Constitution, called for elections, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> practically barred from government for the following 23 years for their anti-military stance, denying them chances to serve the people.|$|R
