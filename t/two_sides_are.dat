The school is closed and students cope in their own ways. The parents of Springfield attempt to act as substitute teachers until the strike is over but this is deemed unsuccessful. Eventually, the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> forced into talking and think of a resolution: using the school to house prisoners from the overcrowded prison system, thus generating money and returning the school to normal.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's main rivals {{historically}} {{have been with}} near neighbours Bury, though this has lessened since the Second World War as the two clubs have rarely {{been in the same}} league. The club also has a rivalry with Blackburn Rovers, as the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> separated by just fifteen miles and are both founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E

5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E

The patio is a closed {{courtyard}} formed by 5 structures on the west and south sides, while the other <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> formed by the retaining walls of Patios A and C. The structures were residential buildings built upon low platforms, with the principal structure {{on the south side of}} the patio. A long, low platform on the west side supports two structures, labelled as Structures 1 and 2. Excavations of this platform recovered ceramic remains dating to the Late and Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders and Chiefs rivalry {{has only}} existed recently. In 2012 and 2013 the Chiefs {{defeated}} the Crusaders in the semi-final, 20-17 and 20-19 respectively. All matches between the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> characterised by high intensity matches and altercations throughout. The Chiefs have identified and recruited {{large amounts of}} talent from traditional Crusaders territory, causing more friction between the fan bases. In the 2017 semi-final, the Crusaders repaid the Chiefs in kind, defeating the Chiefs 27-13.|$|E

The north and south faces are clear glass, while the other <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the building. Bricks on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging roof line contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only parts that jut out from the primarily rectangular building.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry with}} IFK Malmö is both {{geographical}} and historical. The two clubs {{come from the}} same city and used to play at the same stadium in the early 20thcentury. The supposed actions of board members of IFK Malmö in 1933, revealing Malmö FF's breaches of amateur football rules to the Swedish Football Association, further contribute to the competitive tensions between the two clubs. IFK Malmö have not played in Allsvenskan since 1962; thus matches between the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> rare.|$|E

5|$|Juventus have {{significant}} rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino and matches {{between the two}} side are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, {{the capital of the}} neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other {{at the top of the}} league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A. They also have rivalries with Milan, Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> local rivals, having both formed {{originally}} around local companies, with players {{living in the}} same localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.|$|E

25|$|A {{converse}} of a theorem is {{a statement}} formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and {{what is to be}} proved. For example, the isosceles triangle theorem states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.|$|E

25|$|Although Barthel (1958) {{starts his}} {{transcription}} at the wide end of side a, {{the start of}} the text could just as well be at the narrow end (Barthel's line Da8); {{the same is true of}} side b. However, as the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> written with different hands, it is likely that these are distinct texts, and therefore that the question of recto vs. verso is irrelevant.|$|E
25|$|The {{main feature}} of the site is the nearly quadrangular {{enclosure}} which {{has been called a}} plaza. It is bounded on two sides by a walk paved with flat stones while the other <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> defined with flat slabs. Many of the stones surrounding the plaza bear petroglyphs. It {{should be noted that the}} terrain within the ball courts and plaza have been artificially modified. Several shell middens are scattered irregularly throughout the site and is some instances the ball courts intrude into them, indicating that the site was occupied for an extended period of time with a gradual evolution into a ceremonial center.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the writing}} of {{characters}} in vertical columns, from top to bottom, is {{for the most part}} carried over from the bamboo books to oracle bone inscriptions. In some instances lines are written horizontally so as to match the text to divinatory cracks, or columns of text rotate 90 degrees in mid-stream, but these are exceptions to the normal pattern of writing, and inscriptions were never read bottom to top. The vertical columns of text in Chinese writing are traditionally ordered from right to left; this pattern is found on bronze inscriptions from the Shang dynasty onward. Oracle bone inscriptions, however, are often arranged so that the columns begin near the centerline of the shell or bone, and move toward the edge, such that the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>are</b> ordered in mirror-image fashion.|$|E
