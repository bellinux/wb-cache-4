The current study aimed to have quick survey on merits and demerits of implementing <b>teleworking</b> project in Iran's governmental organizations. Furthermore, it intends to design a model for <b>teleworking</b> implementation in Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoH&ME). Methods: This is a descriptive and analytical study and its variables are also qualitative. Since in this study no occupation in MoH & ME couldnot (1000 percent) be purely <b>teleworked,</b> a <b>teleworking</b> applicant form was devised as the research to be filled by <b>teleworking</b> appliers. Afterwards, their <b>teleworking</b> applicant form was evaluated; having passed from the required filters, their <b>teleworking</b> would be accepted or rejected. Results: According to the duty description of MoH&ME's occupations, it was clarified that the only 78 out of 250 job positions could be done by <b>teleworking</b> provided the required conditions as well as the reconsideration of duty descriptions were satisfied. Indeed the study results regarding the job positions of Human Resource Management Office showed that from total of 46 job positions in this office, only 22 % can be done through <b>teleworking</b> method.

There are also legal and human resource issues surrounding the implementation of <b>teleworking.</b> In Malaysia, this new work style has yet to penetrate the business environment. Reported research on this topic is still very limited, confined mostly to perceptual and prevalence studies. This study intended to broaden the horizon by focusing on the individual and job-related aspects of <b>teleworking.</b> The sample of the study comprised of employees from four functional departments in a local telecommunication company. The objective was to discover job functions that can be <b>teleworked.</b> In addition, the study wanted to look into the differences and similarities in the personalities of the employees from these departments.

The main conclusion from this study is that the perception of all the respondents, regardless from which department, did not differ very much. However, certain job functions and personalities have been empirically proven to be different between functional departments. These results can become a guideline in the formulation of a future <b>teleworking</b> program. The management must ensure that employees are willing accept this new work mode.

40|$|<b>Teleworking</b> {{was defined}} in terms of comprehension: root definition, {{conceptual}} definition and abstraction definition. The definitions were subsequently modelled in terms of four theories: socio-factors of <b>teleworking</b> (model 1 of 4), maturity model of <b>teleworking</b> (model 2 of 4), technical factors of <b>teleworking</b> (model 3 of 4) and taxonomy of <b>teleworking</b> (model 4 of 4). The modelling of the definitions of <b>teleworking</b> as stated adds further comprehension to the concept of <b>teleworking.</b> <b>Teleworking</b> is a socio and technical working practice and so, the research study turned to the socio aspect: {{there were a number of}} socio-factors (minor and major) identified as per existing literature. Subsequently, major socio-factors were mapped to a <b>teleworking</b> maturity model in terms of layers, resource, policy and connectivity. The technical aspect of the research study was able to identify and divide factors into dimensions, attributes and organisational roles. The three models (socio, technical and maturity) were brought together in terms of taxonomy of teleworking: an amalgamation of the socio and technical factors of <b>teleworking</b> in addition to three layers of a maturity model. The research methodology followed a positivist viewpoint with socio-factors measured using 7 -point Likert scales. There were a large number of measures for socio-teleworking and so two research methods were adopted to reduce the number to a manageable amount namely: initial questionnaire design and Q-sort study. Following exclusions, a web-based survey was created with the remaining socio-measures of <b>teleworking.</b> The web-based survey was conducted in terms of a pilot study (at councils in the north of England) before surveying 264 employees at Council-Z (the primary study). Data collected from Council-Z was analysed in terms of confirmatory factor analysis. Theoretical models (factor structures) were created in terms of resource, policy and connectivity. The factor structures of each stated layer were tested for consistency to data. Four factor structures of resource were identified, A, B, C and D. Factor structure D showed the highest level of convergence of theory to observed data that is, the best-fitting model. Six factor structures of policy were identified, with factor structure C 2 the most favourable in terms of exclusion of ambiguities and model-fit statistics. Three factor structures of connectivity were identified and for each of the absolute and incremental fit statistics factor structure B was consistently within the cut-off values for good model-fit, factor structure B was also the best fitting model. In terms of the utility of the study, definitions of <b>teleworking</b> and the modelling of the definitions have improved understanding of the research area. The extensive number of factors of <b>teleworking</b> identified through the theoretical modelling process and the measurements of these have demonstrated improved measurement techniques. The best-fitting models as per the confirmatory factor analyses have broad applicability to other similar organisations, and finally the data from the three best-fitting models can be utilised by Council-Z to introduce informed <b>teleworking</b> initiatives. In terms of limitations and future work, technical factors were out of scope in this research study. Hence, types of <b>teleworking</b> practices linked to technical factors of <b>teleworking</b> would be future work as would studies of the linkage between the socio-and technical factors. In terms of the taxonomical model empirical validation would be sought of each of the seven major socio-factors in terms of factor structures. This study empirically tested for each of the three layers of the maturity model, as opposed to each of the major socio-factors within the three layers. Furthermore, additional factors may be identifiable through future work, adding to the taxonomy and in turn, the comprehension of <b>teleworking</b> would be enhanced alongside further standardisation of <b>teleworking</b> definitions and measurements...|$|R
