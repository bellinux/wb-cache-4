5|$|The Sainte-Laguë {{method is}} used for allocating {{parliamentary}} seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives is roughly equal to <b>the</b> <b>nationwide</b> percentage of votes. Still, a party with {{a high number of}} votes in only one constituency can win a seat there even if <b>the</b> <b>nationwide</b> percentage is low. This has happened several times in Norwegian history. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament is proportionally less than its share of votes, the party may seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that <b>the</b> <b>nationwide</b> percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. In 2005, nineteen seats were allocated via the leveling system.|$|E
