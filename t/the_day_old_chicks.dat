Average Live weight, egg weight and Feed conversion Ratio showed significant (P 0. 05) difference between the two feeding regimes.

Most of the data available is quite dated, as can be seen from some recent reviews, and in general little attention is given to the impact of parental nutrition on the subsequent broiler performance. It is in fact more usual to find data about dam nutrition influence on egg fertility and hatchability than on subsequent progeny performance. The objectives of this review were to assess, on the basis of published reports, the effects of selected nutrients and anti-nutrients normally prevailing in commercial broiler breeder feeds - vitamins, micro-minerals, mycotoxins, - trying to pinpoint which could be the positive and the negative effects of both on the subsequent broiler performance, with a particular attention to the impact on immune function and carcass yield...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Over {{the last}} few decades various authors have {{reported}} the influence of day old chick quality on integrated broiler industries. Although various methods of determining chick quality have been reported, defining a good or a first grade day old chick can be problematic as it involves many subjective measurements. Incubation temperature (embryo temperature) is probably the biggest, most influential factor during incubation on chick quality. High temperatures cause the most damage. It leads to poor growth, stress, black buttons, threads, weak chicks, chicks with poorly erupted down that are bleached in appearance, low hatchability, late embryonic death and early broiler mortality. This trial was designed to test whether 37. 2, 37. 4 or 37. 5 ºC was the optimum incubation temperature for hatching Hybro G+ chicks with superior quality. The parameters that were measured were the chick length, bodyweight, and the yolk residue of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks</b> of the flocks set at different setter temperatures. After hatching, 1 440 chicks (480 chicks per temperature treatment) were placed at a broiler facility where the daily mortalities, weekly bodyweight gain and feed conversion were recorded and calculated. The age of the breeder flock had a significant effect on all three parameters measured in the incubation trial with p values of < 0. 001, < 0. 001 and 0. 005 respectively. There {{were no significant differences in}} chick quality parameters due to different incubation temperatures. The age x temperature interaction could be attributed to the large influence of the age of the breeder on egg size and consequently chick parameters. The results could be related to the fact that bigger eggs from older breeder flocks have higher initial egg mass, which will result in heavier embryos and thus converted to a larger day old chick. The performance trial performed after the incubation trial showed no significant effect of the incubation temperature on 7 -day and daily mortalities, weekly bodyweight gain and feed conversion efficiency to 42 days of life. The lack of effects observed in these trials could be attributed to the small range of temperatures used in addition to the difficulties brought about the use of multi-stage incubators...|$|E

40|$|Caring for chicks Cue: When rearing chickens, {{either for}} eggs or meat, most poultry farmers buy young chicks, often called ?day old chicks?, from a hatchery. These young birds are very vulnerable, {{and must be}} {{protected}} by the farmer against cold and disease. In particular, the chicks must be kept completely separate from adult birds on the farm, and if possible, people working with the adult birds should not enter the chicks? ?brooder house?. This will help {{to ensure that no}} diseases are transmitted to the chicks. Farmers must also pay attention to vaccination, feed and water requirements, so that the young birds grow strong and healthy. Bob Akinwumi is a poultry farmer who keeps layer hens on his farm in Nigeria. Tunde Fatunde spoke to him about how he cares for his day old chicks IN:		?For the day old chick ? OUT:		?. we do not mix. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Bob Akinwumi was talking to Tunde Fatunde. Transcript Akinwumi	For the day old chick you have to carve out a space that is well protected against cold. So that you put in your day old chick here with some heat source to give them the warmth for two weeks. If you go to acquire, which most of us do, from the hatchery, some hatcheries may be as far as a thousand kilometres away because some of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks</b> come from Europe, from France for example. You assume that these birds have been put under certain stress so immediately after their arrival they are treated against stress by giving them a solution of sugar and water. Fatunde	What next? Akinwumi	Now the next day what we do by experience is we do not start the day old chick with the chicken feed. We crush some maize and give this to them because we realise from experience the day old chick are very susceptible to constipation when they are introduced to the new feed immediately. So you keep them on maize only. Fatunde	For how long? Akinwumi	Just for a day. Fatunde	And then what next? Akinwumi	On the third day you introduce your normal feed, the starter feed. The starter feed is different from the growing feed because they are richer in protein. And when you have the adequate formula you can put this together yourself. Fatunde	So what do you do yourself? Akinwumi	You go to the market to buy the ingredients like maize which is about 60 % of your feed mixture. You get the Soya bean cake, cotton seed cake, these are to boost the protein content. You add some fishmeal, which you also get from the market. You add some pulverised seashells or animal bone, crushed animal bone to improve the calcium content of your feed. You add some salt for the mineral and then you put in some additives which are already premixed from the pharmacy shop, from the veterinary shop. Fatunde	Now you do that for what space of time? Akinwumi	The starter feed is for {{just a couple of weeks}} between the second day to about two weeks after. Two weeks after they are removed from this special room where they are kept warm and put in your normal rearing deep litter shed and then you can start them off with your growers feed. Fatunde	What do you mean by grower feeds? Akinwumi	Grower feed is the feed they feed on to develop before they start laying which is also a little different in formulation to the starter. Fatunde	Yes what is the difference and what is grower feed?????. Akinwumi	The difference is that the birds can now tolerate? [...] Fatunde	They can easily digest? Akinwumi	They can digest easily the cotton seed which you do not put in a larger quantity for the day old chick. Fatunde	Now lets talk about diseases. These day old chicks, are they susceptible to diseases? Akinwumi	Yes poultry is very very susceptible to diseases and there are many kinds of diseases. Fatunde	Yes and what are these diseases? Akinwumi	The common diseases around here are the Gumboro, the Newcastle, the Infectious Bronchitis which is the infection of the breathing system. There is the coccidiosis which is easily transmitted from one bird to the other through their droppings and the fowl pox. Fatunde	Do you have to wait for these diseases to manifest themselves or you go ahead and do preventive? Akinwumi	Usually a poultry farmer should prevent his birds [getting sick] from day one. Fatunde	Ok now what are these??? [...] Akinwumi	As soon as <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks</b> come in from the second day onwards there is a table to be followed, a table that tells you the kind of vaccine that should be used periodically for your birds to prevent them from contracting these common diseases. Fatunde	Yes and is it you who applies these vaccines and drugs or do you do it with the help of?? [...] Akinwumi	Yes, yes they are easily applied because most of these vaccines are - some of them are injectable - but you can also go for liquid that you can push into their drinking water and makes it very easy. Fatunde	Do you also boost the immunity or you boost the energy of these day old chicks with vitamins? Akinwumi	Yes what you usually do in poultry, since you are subjecting your birds to all kinds of vaccines it is assumed that these vaccines are another source of stress for the birds. So to help the animal to overcome this stress every time you introduce a vaccine you cover it up by giving them vitamins. Fatunde	Have you had any cause to mix old and new birds together? Akinwumi	No this is never done. Fatunde	Why? Akinwumi	We avoid doing this in my farm because usually you find out that the old birds have the tendency of claiming the landlordship of the area where they are and therefore the tendency is to attack the new birds. That?s the first thing. The second thing will be, it will not be advisable if even if they are tolerable because you risk transferring of infection from the old birds to the smaller birds, or to the new birds. Fatunde	So you don?t do it? Akinwumi	We do not mix. End of track. Bob Akinwumi, who keeps layer hens, describes the feeding and disease control methods he uses in raising day old chicks...|$|E

Garlic and ginger were each added to broiler diets at 1, 1. 5 and 2 %. Four mixtures of garlic and ginger were also formulated. Control diet did not contain any test ingredient. The results showed that garlic, ginger and mixtures contained 7. 41, 5. 85 and 6. 62 % crude protein respectively. Dietary treatment significantly influenced the final liveweights (FLW) of broiler chicks (P< 0. 001) and chickens (P< 0. 01). The mixtures of garlic and ginger significantly (P< 0. 001) improved FLW and weight gain th of <b>the</b> 28 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks</b> than those of control birds. Garlic at 1. 5 and 2 % ginger significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased the FLW of the chickens relative to the control.

40|$|Purpose: In this {{feasibility}} study, a mechanically loaded in-vitro {{tissue culture}} model of joint morphogenesis using the isolated lower extremity of <b>the</b> 8 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chick</b> embryo {{was developed to}} assess the effects of mechanical loading on joint morphogenesis. Methods: The developed in-vitro system allows controlled flexion and extension of the chick embryonic knee {{with a range of}} motion of 20 degrees from a resting position of 90 - 100 degrees of flexion. Joint morphogenesis at 2, 3, 4 and 7 days of culture was assessed by histology and micro MRI in 4 specimen types: undisturbed in-ovo control embryos, in-ovo paralyzed embryos, in-vitro unloaded limb cultures, and in-vitro loaded limb cultures. Relative glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentration across the joint was assessed with an MRI technique referred to as dGEMRIC (delayed gadolinium enhanced MRI of cartilage) where T 1 is proportional to glycosaminoglycan concentration. Results: Average T 1 over the entire tissue image for the normal control (IC) knee was 480 msec; for <b>the</b> 4 <b>day</b> loaded specimen average T 1 was 354 msec; and for <b>the</b> 7 <b>day</b> loaded specimens T 1 was 393 msec. <b>The</b> 4 <b>day</b> unloaded specimen had an average T 1 of 279 msec while <b>the</b> 7 <b>day</b> unloaded specimen had an average T 1 of 224 msec. The higher T 1 values in loaded than unloaded specimens suggest that more glycosaminoglycan is produced in the loaded culture than in the unloaded preparation. Conclusion: Isolated limb tissue cultures under flexion-extension load can be viable and exhibit more progression of joint differentiation and glycosaminoglycan production than similarly cultured but unloaded specimens. However, when compared with controls 2 consisting of intact undisturbed embryos in-ovo, the isolated loaded limbs in culture do not demonstrate equivalent amounts of absolute growth or joint differentiation...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{quality of}} <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks</b> {{is crucial for}} {{profitable}} broiler production, but a difficult trait to define. In research, both qualitative and quantitative measures are used with variable predictive value for subsequent performance. In hatchery practice, chick quality is judged on a binomial scale, as chicks are divided into first grade (Q 1 -saleable) and second grade (Q 2) chicks right after hatch. Incidences and reasons for classifying chicks as Q 2, and potential of these chicks for survival and post-hatch performance have hardly been investigated, but may provide information for flock performance. We conducted an experiment to investigate (1) {{the quality of a}} broiler flock and the relation with post-hatch flock performance based on a qualitative score (Pasgar©score) of Q 1 chicks and based on the incidence of Q 2 chicks and (2) the reasons for classifying chicks as Q 2, and the potential of these chicks for survival and post-hatch growth. The performance was followed of Q 1 and Q 2 chicks obtained from two breeder flocks that hatched in two different hatching systems (a traditional hatcher or a combined hatching and brooding system, named Patio). Eggs were incubated until embryo day 18, when they were transferred to one of the two hatching systems. At embryo day 21 /post-hatch day 0, all chicks from the hatcher (including Q 2 chicks) were brought to Patio, where the hatchery manager marked the Q 2 chicks from both flocks and hatching systems and registered apparent reasons for classifying these chicks as Q 2. Chick quality was assessed of 100 Q 1 chicks from each flock and hatching system. Weights of all chicks were determined at days 0, 7, 21 and 42. There were no correlations between mean Pasgar©score and post-hatch growth or mortality, and suboptimal navel quality was the only quality trait associated with lower post-hatch growth. Growth was clearly affected by breeder flock and hatching system, which could not be linked to mean Pasgar©score or incidence of Q 2 chicks. Q 2 chicks showed lower post-hatch growth compared to Q 1 chicks but effects on flock performance at slaughter weight were limited because early mortality in Q 2 chicks was high (62. 50 % at 7 days). We concluded that chick qualitative scores and the incidence of Q 2 chicks may be informative for the quality of incubation, but are not predictive for post-hatch flock performance. Culling Q 2 chicks after hatch is well-founded in terms of both animal welfare and profitability...|$|R

40|$|This study {{carried out}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of bitter vetch seeds on serum proteins and biochemical parameters in broiler chickens. A total of 1320 one-day <b>old</b> broiler <b>chicks</b> of a commercial breed were placed in 64 pens. Treatments were included raw and four different processed bitter vetch seeds in three levels (150, 300 and 450 g kg - 1) and a corn-soybean based diet as control. Each treatment group consisted of four replicates. Processing methods were included soaked in water for 12 h, autoclaved, then dried at room temperature (SAD); ground, soaked in water for 24 h, autoclaved and dried (GSAD); ground, soaked in water for 47 h with exchange water every 12 h, cooked and dried (GSCD) and ground, soaked at 1 % acetic acid solution for 24 h at 60 °C (AA). Feeding raw, AA and GSAD seeds decreased serum albumin significantly (p< 0. 05) in 21 <b>days</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks.</b> Chickens that fed with raw and treated bitter vetch seed had lower α 1 and γ globulins than control (p< 0. 05). Increasing raw and treated bitter vetch seeds from 15 to 30 and 45 % decreased albumin, α 1 and γ globulins and increased α 2 and β globulins significantly (p< 0. 05). In 14 <b>days</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks</b> feeding raw and treated biter vetch {{had no effect on}} serum urea, but uric acid concentration decreased significantly (p< 0. 05). Feeding SAD seeds increased serum urea significantly (p< 0. 05), but uric acid concentration did not change with feeding raw and treated bitter vetch seeds in 42 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks.</b> Adding raw and treated bitter vetch seeds to diet increased T 4 and decreased T 3 concentrations in all ages. At 28 <b>days</b> <b>old</b> <b>chicks,</b> feeding raw and treated biter vetch seeds decreased alkaline phosphatase concentration significantly than control. Results showed that raw bitter vetch seeds have some toxic effects on metabolism in broiler chickens and GSCD and SAD treatments were more effective to detoxification of this seed...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} made to compare {{physical}} chick quality indicators such as chick length and feather colour and their effects on the uniformity and subsequent growth performance in broiler. For this reason; 600 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> male <b>chicks</b> were used. Chicks were classified into two groups {{on the basis of}} their feather colour: deep and light yellow. Then, chicks in each group were further divided into three groups as small, middle and large according to their body length. The length of the middle group animals was varied between 18. 0 – 18. 3 cm, while that of the largest group was greater than 18. 3 cm and the small group was lesser than 18. 0 cm. A positive correlation between chick length and chick weight was observed in all groups at <b>the</b> 0 <b>day</b> of age. Body length uniformity in <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chick</b> was more important than body weight uniformity. Longer chicks exhibited better growth potential throughout the experiment. The feeding efficiency and survival rate of longer chicks were numerically greater compared to smaller chicks. There were no significant differences for subsequent growth parameters in feather colour groups. Consequently; length of <b>day</b> <b>old</b> <b>chick</b> can be used as important criteria for selection of higher quality chicks having better growth performance...|$|R
