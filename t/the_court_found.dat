5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
5|$|In Barker v. Wingo (1972), the Supreme Court {{announced}} {{four factors}} {{relevant to the}} determination of a Speedy Trial Clause violation: (1) {{the length of the}} delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether the defendant demanded a speedy trial, and (4) prejudice. Applying Barker, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> such a violation in Doggett v. United States (1992), which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and arrest. The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice.|$|E
5000|$|At {{trial and}} on appeal, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> {{in favour of}} Robertson. It was noted that for the Globe to seek {{protection}} under its collective copyright the database must constitute a newspaper or consist of a [...] "substantial part thereof in any material form whatever". A substantial part of a newspaper exists in the arranging and formatting of articles, much of which is lost when the articles are put on a database. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> that <b>the</b> database was not merely a newspaper in a different guise but a new work.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Intel {{alleged that}} Cyrix had infringed several patents and {{initiated}} legal action. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>found</b> that Cyrix had indeed reverse engineered the Intel part, but had conceived their own compatible design, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> also <b>found</b> that Texas Instruments, SGS-Thomson and IBM were licensed to produce Intel designs.

5|$|On June 29, 2006, the Court {{issued a}} 5–3 {{decision}} holding {{that it had}} jurisdiction, and that the administration did not have authority to set up these particular military commissions without congressional authorization, {{because they did not}} comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention (which <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> to be incorporated into the Uniform Code of Military Justice).|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|Stack v. Boyle (1951) is {{the only}} {{case in which the}} Supreme Court has held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally {{excessive}}. There, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> $50,000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act. In United States v. Salerno (1987), the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which authorized the consideration of future dangerousness in the determination of the amount of, or the denial of, bail.|$|E

5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E
5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> that making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a gun is {{in violation of the}} Gun Control Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased gun. In the Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E

5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs v. United States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>found</b> he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck v. United States, in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{the defence}} {{argued that the}} {{proceedings}} were invalid as Knight had been granted immunity by the Attorney-General's Chambers in 1991 from further charges arising from his corruption investigations, in exchange for him to plead guilty in the earlier trial. They argued that the latest set of charges stemmed from that investigation and thus were subject to the immunity clause. The CPIB revealed {{that it had been}} tipped off about the misappropriation of money only in 1997 by an unnamed informant. The court ruled that the proceedings could continue because the 1991 probe into Knight's dealings did not investigate his misappropriation of money. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> him guilty of two charges of misappropriation and sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and another day in jail.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collision}} at least 31 lawsuits seeking damages were brought against United Airlines, the U.S. Government, or both. On September 24, 1958, United Airlines filed for damagesbased on the Federal Tort Claims Actagainst the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The airline {{alleged that the}} United States through its agents in the United States Air Force negligently operated the F-100F, and sought damages of US$3,576,698. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> neither crew was negligent for a failure to see and avoid each other, but held the United States was liable because of other negligence. The case was settled on December17, 1962, with the United States agreeing to pay the airline $1.45million.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the California {{legislature}} {{passed a}} statute authorizing the California Attorney General to bring claims {{on behalf of}} the tribes in the Court of Claims. The next year, Congress passed a statute granting that court jurisdiction for such claims. California Attorney General Earl Warren (future Chief Justice) finally argued the case in 1941. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>found</b> liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. After the passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act, the same group of tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E
5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v.
