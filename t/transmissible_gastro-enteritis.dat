40|$|<b>Transmissible</b> <b>gastro-enteritis</b> (TGE) is an {{economically}} important viral disease of pigs in Britain, particularly in East Anglia. Starlings are often abundant at pig farms where they feed on pig food. The {{close association between}} starlings and pigs has led farmers to believe that starlings transmit TGE from one farm to another, but evidence has been circumstantial. The following {{study was designed to}} establish whether starlings do move between farms. Starlings which were wing-tagged at a pig farm were relocated at 25 other sites, including eleven other pig farms, so the possibility that starlings can transmit TGE from one farm to another cannot be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|THE {{important}} role of breast-feeding in reducing the incidence and mortality of infantile gastroenteritis has been recognised since 191 1 (Dudfield, 1912). Although a number of antibacterial factors have been recognised in human milk (Goldman and Smith, 1973) and specific antibodies against bacterial cell-wall antigens (Allardyce et al., 1974; Goldblum et al., 1975) and enterotoxin (Holnigren et al., 1976; Stoliar et al., 1976) have been detected, similar pro-tective factors against enteropathogenic viruses have not as yet been demon-strated. Specific antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (Downham et al., 1976) and non-specific antiviral inhibitors (Falkler, Diwan and Halstead, 1975; Matthews et al., 1976) have been demonstrated in human colostrum and milk, but any effect on enteric viral pathogens {{has yet to be}} established. Observations on rotavirus infection of calves (Woode, Jones and Bridger, 1975) and lambs (Snodgrass and Wells, 1976) and on <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastro-enteritis</b> of swine (Abou-Youssef and Ristic, 1975) have revealed that immunity of the gastrointestinal tract to invasion by enteric pathogens is not related t...|$|E
