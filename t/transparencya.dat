Atransparent plastic material, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is used as the substrate. In order to promote the <b>transparency,a</b> meshed double circle rings unit-cell is designed using several 50 μm width metal grid lines. Good agreement between meshedand non-meshed unit-cells is reached at Ka-band. Atransparent TA with diameter of 9. 9 wavelengths is designedand simulated by the commercial software Ansys HFSS at Kabandusing the proposed elements. By moving the feed alongthe focal plane of TA, beam scanning up to 30 ° with low sidelobe level, low cross polarization level and widebandperformance is reached...|$|E
