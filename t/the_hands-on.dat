25|$|The war's {{prosecution}} involved <b>the</b> <b>hands-on</b> {{participation of}} two controversial Roman {{political and military}} leaders. Gaius Marius celebrated his triumph due to his success in finishing Rome's long war against Jugurtha. A wealthy novus homo and populares, Marius was the first Roman general to enlist proletari (landless citizens) into his army; as a politician he was chosen Consul an unprecedented seven times (107, 104–100, 86), but his career ended badly. On the opposing side politically, the optimate Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix, later Consul (88, 80), and Dictator (82–79), had served as quaestor under Marius in Numidia. In 106 Sulla had persuaded Bocchus I of Mauritania to hand over Jurgurtha, which ended the war. This conflict was later (c. 40 BC) described by the ancient Roman political writer Sallust (86–35), in his well-known monograph Belum Jugurthinum..|$|E

25|$|The University of Ottawa’s {{cooperative}} education program is an optional program which presents students with excellent work experiences and other various benefits {{the program has}} to offer. The program is offered for both undergraduate programs and certain graduate programs. The program was first introduced to the school over 30 years ago, in the year 1980. The University of Ottawa's co-operative program has expanded very quickly since its creation and now stands as the second largest program in Ontario with a placement success rate of over 98 percent. The co-operative education {{program is designed to}} generally have students work full-time during altering semesters, in their area of study. One work term generally lasts 15 or 16 weeks. Every work term is a paid work term where students’ pay varies on the program of study related to their job; however, student pay can range anywhere from 400-700 dollars per week. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>hands-on</b> experience students may acquire through this program, the co-op program at the University of Ottawa can further offer a range of services to the students such as: one on one consultations concerning resume or cover letter reviews, various workshops, and numerous training possibilities for different purposes such as for interview preparation and work term success. The University of Ottawa’s co-op program claims to offer excellent experiences to students as the program maintains “regular contacts with over 4000 active private- and public-sector employers throughout the year”. The University of Ottawa’s co-op program has five fees, with prices varying each year. There is a fee issued for each work term and an additional free which is paid when the student accepts the co-op offer for the training and support provided by staff leading up to the work terms. The fees go towards the preparation and training of students, allowing them to develop {{a better understanding of the}} job market, resume reviews, and extensive preparation for interviews and jobs.|$|E

The third and last Treblinka II commandant was Kurt Franz, nicknamed [...] "Lalka" [...] (...) by the prisoners {{because he had}} [...] "an innocent face". According to survivor Hershl Sperling, as deputy commandant Franz beat prisoners to death for minor infractions or had his dog Barry tear them to pieces. He managed Treblinka II until November 1943. The subsequent clean-up of the Treblinka II perimeter was completed by prisoners of nearby Treblinka I Arbeitslager in the following months. Franz's deputy was Hauptscharführer Fritz Küttner, who maintained a network of Sonderkommando informers and did <b>the</b> <b>hands-on</b> killings.|$|E

500|$|Goldstone was {{hindered}} by the inflexible bureaucracy of the UN, finding {{the newly established}} ICTY in a shambles {{when he joined the}} tribunal. The tribunal lacked political legitimacy, financial support and prosecutorial direction; its failure to even bring any prosecutions had led to it being criticised by the media as [...] "a fig leaf for inaction", and Goldstone was asked by the former British prime minister Edward Heath: [...] "Why did you accept such a ridiculous job?" [...] He had to make repeated appeals to the UN's hierarchy and to donor nations for the equipment and funding that the tribunal needed to operate. He quickly found that the key to the job was to take [...] " [...] big-picture diplomatic role and [...] that <b>the</b> <b>hands-on</b> prosecution work could be pushed down to experienced prosecutors and investigators like [...] Blewitt – {{at least for the time}} being." [...] He undertook a flurry of media appearances and financial negotiations that led to the tribunal being properly staffed for the first time, with many staff being recruited through his own personal networks; a budget of eight million dollars from thirteen countries, supplemented by a $300,000 donation from George Soros; and the first indictment, of Bosnian Serb prison camp guard Duško Tadić.|$|E

2500|$|The head of {{sculpture}} at the Glasgow School of Art was Benno Schotz (1891–1984). Born in Estonia of Jewish parents, he migrated to Glasgow {{as a young}} man and studied sculpture at night-classes while working for a shipbuilding company. Being foreign-born, Schotz was not liable to be called up for war work, so the sculpture department at the School of Art functioned throughout the war. He was an excellent teacher: “ had excellent rapport with his small group of students. Formal classes were held in the morning, then they had the studio to themselves {{for the rest of the}} day and into the evening. ... Schotz had the highly developed technical skills of a successful practising artist and was alive to <b>the</b> <b>hands-on</b> realities of making sculpture as much as he was to the compelling political and social ideas of the times.” He also “supported refugees and worked throughout his life to bring their suffering to public notice.

2500|$|Columnist Conrado De Quiros, {{writing in}} The Philippine Daily Inquirer, {{expressed}} how [...] "deeply, deeply ashamed" [...] he felt over the incident. In a follow up column, he castigated Mendoza as a [...] "traitor", adding that [...] "to bury {{him in a}} pauper's grave will insult paupers". [...] Columnist Alex Magno in The Philippine Star wrote about the [...] "immaturity" [...] of the diplomatic response of the newly installed Aquino administration in what is commonly seen as its first serious leadership test of the administration, in its first one hundred days in office. Magno listed a string of mistakes from the administration, starting with how it failed to initiate contact with the Hong Kong government, to how it insulted the Hong Kong Chief Executive by not promptly responding to his call, and then later unilaterally announcing the sending of a high level delegation to the Hong Kong and Chinese governments in what Magno interpreted as a damage control measure without first confirming that Hong Kong and the PRC would receive the delegation. Magno sees the Chinese as responding with the diplomatic equivalent of [...] "the penalty of death by a thousand cuts." [...] John Nery writing in The Philippine Daily Inquirer said it was indeed appropriate for Aquino to have kept his distance from the crisis management, despite <b>the</b> <b>hands-on</b> approach the general public was demanding with hindsight; he said the skepticism directed towards the Aquino administration was not being applied equally to the Tsang administration's account of trying unsuccessfully to reach Aquino since 4pm. [...] Analysts agreed that the Aquino administration's approval rating would fall, {{if not for the}} handling of the hostage taking crisis, then from a natural move off the high it was coming from.|$|E
