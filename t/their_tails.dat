5|$|The wrens {{are mainly}} small and {{inconspicuous}} except for their loud songs. These birds have short wings and thin down-turned bills. Several species often hold <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> upright. All are insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|C. b. macrorhynchus, {{given the}} name great-billed {{cockatoo}} by Mathews, is found across northern Australia. Although {{thought to be}} widespread and abundant, this subspecies has been little studied. It is also large and has a large beak, as its subspecific name implies. Females lack red colouration in <b>their</b> <b>tails.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{displays}} of aggression, males {{engage in a}} social display behaviour called stink fighting, which involves impregnating <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> with secretions from the antebrachial and brachial glands and waving the scented tail at male rivals.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Kangaroos {{can stand}} erect on their hind legs, {{supported}} by <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> {{as the third}} leg of a tripod (they can even balance on <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> alone).|$|R
25|$|A {{relatively}} few animals use five limbs for locomotion. Prehensile quadrupeds may use <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> {{to assist in}} locomotion and when grazing, the kangaroos and other macropods use <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> to propel themselves forward with the four legs used to maintain balance.|$|R
50|$|The Stegosaurus toy had {{motorized}} walking action, {{while the}} Pachycephalosaurus and Saurolophus both had a mechanism that allowed {{their bodies to}} thrust from a horizontal position with <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> in the air into a vertical position with <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> on the ground.|$|R
5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> {{back and forth}} with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton {{described}} comets as {{compact and}} durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, ignited or heated by the Sun. Newton suspected that comets were {{the origin of}} the life-supporting component of air.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> on the water surface or house mice rattle <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E
50|$|Anomalures {{also have}} scales on <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> undersides.|$|R
50|$|Kicking horses or stallions {{should have}} a ribbon (red) tied in <b>their</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like geckos {{they can}} drop <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> and grow {{a new one}} when attacked.|$|R
5|$|The stalk: The wolves {{attempt to}} conceal {{themselves}} as they approach. As {{the gap between the}} wolves and their prey closes, the wolves quicken their pace, wag <b>their</b> <b>tails,</b> and peer intently, getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee.|$|E
5|$|When under attack, some {{octopuses}} {{can perform}} arm autotomy, {{in a manner}} similar to the way skinks and other lizards detach <b>their</b> <b>tails.</b> The crawling arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations. Octopuses can replace lost limbs.|$|E
5|$|Wrens {{are small}} and {{inconspicuous}} birds, except for their loud songs. They have short wings and a thin downturned bill. Several species often hold <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> upright. All are insectivorous. Seven species have been recorded in Massachusetts.|$|E
2500|$|Phantom poodles {{have the}} {{colouring}} of a Doberman Pinscher, with a lighter color appearing on their [...] "eyebrows", muzzle and throat, {{legs and feet}} and below <b>their</b> <b>tail.</b> Like Dobermans, phantom poodles have either a black or brown main coat with a tan (usually apricot or red) lighter colorings around the eyebrows, muzzle, throat, legs, feet, and below <b>their</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|R
50|$|These slugs are {{notable for}} being able to self-amputate (autotomy) a portion of <b>their</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> in defense.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Harmless watersnakes of {{the genus}} Nerodia are often mistaken for it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be {{aggressive}} when provoked, but they behave differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee quickly into the water, while A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not vibrate <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> when excited. A. piscivorus usually holds its head at an angle around 45Â° when swimming or crawling.|$|E
50|$|These slugs can self-amputate ({{autotomy}}) {{a portion}} of <b>their</b> <b>tail.</b> This autotomy has been observed in the species Prophysaon andersoni.|$|R
50|$|The Ymphes: dinosaurs several meters {{high that}} can carry very heavy loads. <b>Their</b> <b>tail</b> {{resembles that of}} the scorpions. Primitive animals, tame.|$|R
50|$|Some arthropods, such as {{lobsters}} and shrimps, can propel themselves backwards {{quickly by}} flicking <b>their</b> <b>tail,</b> known as lobstering or the caridoid escape reaction.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates {{that they were more}} likely to feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. <b>Their</b> <b>tails</b> and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near <b>their</b> <b>tails,</b> {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{two members}} of the genus Drepanornis are {{sometimes}} included in Epimachus, but <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> is far shorter and their sexual dimorphism is less extreme.|$|R
25|$|Adults {{are black}} with {{electric}} blue edges on <b>their</b> <b>tail,</b> pectoral, and dorsal fins, whereas juveniles are yellow. Geographically speaking, they show little variation in color.|$|R
2500|$|The initial {{change is}} called [...] "hyperactivation", which {{causes a change}} in {{spermatozoa}} motility. They swim faster and <b>their</b> <b>tail</b> movements become more forceful and erratic.|$|R
5|$|Muskrats {{spend much}} of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life. They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes. Their bodies, like those of seals and whales, are less {{sensitive}} to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals. They can close off their ears to keep the water out. Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of <b>their</b> <b>tails</b> propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|Samson went out, {{gathered}} 300 foxes, {{and tied}} {{them together in}} pairs by <b>their</b> <b>tails.</b> He then attached a burning torch to each pair of foxes' tails and turned them loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines. The Philistines learned why Samson burned their crops and burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.|$|E
