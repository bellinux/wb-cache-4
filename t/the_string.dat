5|$|In the searched CASE expression, <b>the</b> <b>string</b> 'Null Result' is {{returned}} for all rows {{in which i}} is Null.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{expression}} i = NULL evaluates to Unknown {{no matter what}} value column i contains (even if it contains Null), <b>the</b> <b>string</b> 'Is Null' will never be returned.|$|E
5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than <b>the</b> <b>string</b> scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of <b>the</b> <b>string.</b> Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
50|$|On guitar, damping (also {{referred}} to as choking) is a technique where, shortly after playing <b>the</b> <b>strings,</b> <b>the</b> sound is reduced by pressing the right hand palm against <b>the</b> <b>strings,</b> right hand damping (including palm muting), or relaxing the left hand fingers' pressure on <b>the</b> <b>strings,</b> left hand damping (or left-hand muting). Scratching is where <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> are played while damped, i.e., <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> are damped before playing. The term presumably refers to the clunky sound produced. In funk music this is often done over a sixteenth note pattern with occasional sixteenths undamped.|$|R

5|$|In {{standard}} tuning, playing {{scales of}} one octave requires three patterns, which depend on <b>the</b> <b>string</b> {{of the root}} note. Chords cannot be shifted diagonally without changing finger-patterns. Standard tuning has four finger-patterns for musical intervals, four forms for basic major-chords, and three forms for the inversion of the basic major-chords.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along <b>the</b> <b>string</b> by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along <b>the</b> <b>string</b> in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in <b>the</b> <b>string</b> acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E
5|$|The symphony is scored for solo soprano, four flutes (two players {{doubling}} on piccolos), four clarinets in B, two bassoons, two contrabassoons, four horns in F, four trombones, harp, {{piano and}} strings. Górecki specifies exact complements for <b>the</b> <b>string</b> forces: 16 first violins, 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos, and 8 double basses. For {{most of the}} score, these are in turn divided into two parts, each notated on a separate staff. Thus <b>the</b> <b>string</b> writing is mainly in ten different parts, on ten separate staves. In some sections some of these parts are divided even further into separate parts, which are written on the same staff, so that ten staves are still used for {{a greater number of}} parts.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach <b>the</b> <b>string</b> of boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep <b>the</b> <b>string</b> of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the bridge on a {{classical}} guitar is to transfer the vibration from <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> to <b>the</b> soundboard, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by <b>the</b> <b>strings.</b> <b>The</b> bridge holds <b>the</b> <b>strings</b> in place on the body.

5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of <b>the</b> <b>string</b> theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than <b>the</b> <b>string</b> scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of <b>the</b> <b>string.</b> In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>String</b> Quartets, Op. 50 (Hob. III/44-49, L. 36-41), were {{composed}} by Joseph Haydn in 1787. The set of six quartets {{was dedicated to}} King Frederick William II of Prussia. For this reason the set {{is commonly known as}} the Prussian Quartets. Haydn sold the set to the Viennese firm Artaria and, without Artaria's knowledge, to the English publisher William Forster. Forster published it as Haydn's Opus 44. Haydn's autograph manuscripts for Nos. 3 to 6 of the set were discovered in Melbourne, Australia, in 1982.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present <b>the</b> null <b>string</b> origin of <b>the</b> ambitwistor <b>string.</b> Classically, <b>the</b> null <b>string</b> is <b>the</b> tensionless limit of string theory, and so too is <b>the</b> Ambitwistor <b>string.</b> Both have as {{constraint}} algebra the Galilean Conformal Algebra in two dimensions. But something interesting {{happens in the}} quantum theory since there is an ambiguity in quantizing <b>the</b> null <b>string.</b> We show that, given a particular choice of quantization scheme and a particular gauge, <b>the</b> null <b>string</b> coincides with <b>the</b> ambitwistor <b>string</b> both classically and quantum mechanically. We also show that the same holds for the spinning versions of <b>the</b> null <b>string</b> and Ambitwistor string.
