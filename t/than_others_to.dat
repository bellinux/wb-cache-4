5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to have many names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> <b>To</b> know the true name of a deity was to have power over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power.|$|E

In the coldest of these areas, it may require considerable protection to survive the winter. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Horticultural Society has assigned it hardiness rating H4, indicating that it tolerates temperatures as low as , hardy in most of the country through typical winters.|$|E

At the same time, established scientists are more likely <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> be sought out as referees, particularly by high-prestige journals/publishers. There are also signs of gender bias, favouring men as authors. As a result, ideas that harmonize with the established experts' {{are more likely to}} see print and to appear in premier journals than are iconoclastic or revolutionary ones. This accords with Thomas Kuhn's well-known observations regarding scientific revolutions. A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Carlton swiftly {{fell from}} {{being one of}} the most {{successful}} clubs, both on-field and off-field, to one of the least successful. The club had been much slower <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> embrace the AFL Draft as a means for recruitment, so when its champion players from the 1990s began to retire in the early 2000s, on-field performances fell away quickly, and in 2002, the club won the wooden spoon for the first time in its VFL/AFL history; it was the last of the twelve Victorian clubs to win the wooden spoon. At the same time, the club was starting to struggle financially, due to unwise investments under John Elliott – most significantly, building a new grandstand at Princes Park during the 1990s, at a time when other clubs were finding it more profitable to play at the higher-capacity central venues. Then, at the end of 2002, it was revealed that Carlton had been systematically cheating the league salary cap during the early 2000s. The scandal resulted in the loss of draft picks and a fine of $930,000, which exacerbated the club's poor on-field and off-field positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the {{continued use}} of racial categories {{in health care and}} as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services. Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups are less likely <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.|$|E

500|$|One {{issue that}} {{occasionally}} rises {{is whether the}} monarchies are too expensive when compared to republics, or whether particular monarchies are more expensive <b>than</b> <b>others,</b> <b>to</b> maintain. This comparison {{may be hard to}} draw, since financial administration may differ radically from country to country, and not all profits and costs are publicly known, and because of different arrangements regarding [...] the private property of the monarch. In the UK, the Crown Estate has a special legal status making it neither government property nor the private property of the monarch. Revenues from these hereditary possessions have been placed [...] at the disposition of the British government (thus proceeding directly to the Treasury) by every monarch since the accession of George III in 1760; the revenues of GBP 304.1 million (fiscal year of 2015/16) far exceed the expenses of the British royal family in this sense resulting in a [...] "negative cost" [...] of the British monarchy.|$|E

2500|$|In {{languages}} {{that today}} maintain the T-V distinction, usage varies. Following the British usage, early francophone Quakers preferred {{the use of}} the more informal tu to address even those who would by convention be addressed with the more formal vous. In more contemporary times, however, usage has swung the other way, and French-speaking Quakers today are more likely <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> use the formal vous. In part, this is a recognition of the complexity of the notion of simplicity in speech, whose intent might be understood to be not a requirement of informality, but a desire to address everyone [...] "simply", i.e., uniformly. The rejection of the past use of tu by white French missionaries to address Africans may be a factor in the contemporary francophone usage.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{genetics}} {{are once}} again thought by some prominent researchers to play {{a large role in}} mental illness.

2500|$|Emanuel {{said that}} it is a myth that most {{patients}} who want to die choose euthanasia because they are in extreme pain. He said that in his own experience, [...] "those with pain are more likely <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> oppose physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia." [...] He said that patients were more likely to want euthanasia because of [...] "depression and general psychological distress ... a loss of control or of dignity, of being a burden, and of being dependent." [...] He also said that the kind of legalized euthanasia practiced in the Netherlands would lead to an ethical [...] "slippery slope" [...] which {{would make it easier for}} doctors to rationalize euthanasia when it would save them the trouble of cleaning bedpans and otherwise caring for patients who want to live. He said that legalized euthanasia in the Netherlands did not adhere to all the legal guidelines, and that some newborns were euthanised even though they could not possibly have given the legally required consent. As Emanuel said, [...] "The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others. Indeed, the persistence of abuse and the violation of safeguards, despite publicity and condemnation, suggest that the feared consequences of legalization are exactly its inherent consequences." ...|$|E
