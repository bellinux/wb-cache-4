5|$|Cuts {{in federal}} {{construction}} funds for Metro again delayed construction. Metro announced in December 1982 that {{service on the}} line would not cross the Anacostia River until late 1989 at the earliest. The federal contribution to Metro's construction fund was lowered to $44 million from $95 million for fiscal 1983, and Metro {{said that it would}} divert most of <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> dig tunnels from the Gallery Place Station to the Mount Vernon Square station. In February 1983, the Reagan administration proposed cutting Metro's construction budget by $145 million to $230 million, which Metro said would push the opening of the Green Line to 1991. Metro, {{for the first time in}} its history, formally announced that (absent full construction funding) it could not build the Green Line, the Red Line from Wheaton to Glenmont, or the Yellow Line from Franconia-Springfield to King Street – Old Town.|$|E

Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E
5|$|In Canada Butlin {{struggled}} {{to fit in}} at school and soon left {{for a job in}} a Toronto department store Eatons. In the First World War he enlisted as a bugler in the Canadian Army. After the war, Butlin returned to England, bringing only £5 with him. Investing £4 of <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> hire a stall travelling with his uncle's fair, Butlin discovered that giving his customers a better chance to win brought more custom in, and he quickly became successful. One stall became several, including prominent locations such as Olympia in London, and Butlin soon was able to purchase other fairground equipment, and started his own travelling fair. He proved successful in this endeavour as well, and by 1927 he opened a static fairground in Skegness. Over the next 10 years Butlin expanded his fairground empire, all the time harbouring an idea {{to increase the number of}} patrons in his Skegness site by providing accommodation.|$|E

In 1951, the U.S. Treasury had been fully reimbursed, and the 25 percent of the revenue that had previously gone to the Treasury now reverted to the counties; in 1953, the counties opted to divert <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> maintenance {{of the land and}} roads, reforestation, as well as recreational facilities and other improvements. A 1970 GAO report contained an estimate that from its implementation through 1969, the counties had received a total of $300 million {{as a result of the}} Act.

25|$|After {{returning}} from Calexico, Lopez-De La Cruz {{and her husband}} recognized {{the power of their}} labor and knowledge and became inspired to start their own farm. In spring 1973 they started their own farm with five other families, thanks to Rodger McAfee (the same small farmer responsible for sending the $102,000 bail out to Angela Davis in 1972) who leased them 6 acres.They had some success as the first people to grow, sell, and nationally distribute cherry tomatoes under the label Rancho El Bracero (Also the name of their farm.) They made $64,000 off the sales from the cherry tomatoes, and used <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> purchase land. In 1974, the Lopez-De La Cruz family and three other families decided to purchase 40 acres near Raisin City, CA and started their own cooperative farm selling cherry tomatoes and other produce to local and national sellers. They attempted to expand their land and acquire some land with water by purchasing land from millionaire farmer Giffen, but he refused to sell any plot for less than a half of a million dollars.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{preparing}} and filing all business and {{personal income tax}} returns {{is estimated to be}} $250–$300 billion each year. Approximately {{the same amount of money}} was estimated for calculating the tax implications of business decisions. That means approximately $500 to $600 billion was spent in the process of collecting roughly four times as much in taxes. According to a 2005 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the efficiency cost of the current tax system—the output that is lost over and above the tax itself—is between $240 billion and $600 billion every year. Supporters argue that the FairTax system would reduce these compliance and efficiency costs by 90% and return a larger share of <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the productive economy. With the FairTax system, the cost of compliance would be built into the tax by allowing the business and the State to keep 1/4 of 1% of taxes collected. A 2007 study by the Beacon Hill Institute found that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system from the point of view of the administration, collection, and filing costs.|$|E

25|$|Bush's {{selection}} by the New Orleans Saints in the NFL Draft generated {{excitement and}} celebration among Saints fans. By {{the end of}} the week after the draft, Reebok reported receiving over 15,000 orders for Bush's Saints jersey, even though his jersey number with the Saints had not yet been determined. Bush had petitioned the NFL to wear the number 5, which he has worn throughout his high school and college careers. However, in order for him to wear that number, the NFL would have to revise its numbering regulations, which require running backs to wear a number between 20 and 49. Bush was allowed to wear the number 5 during the Saints' minicamp practices pending the NFL's ruling. On May 23, 2006, the NFL competition committee officially rejected his request, and on May 25 it was officially announced that Bush would be wearing number 25, acquired from Saints running back Fred McAfee. Although Bush had earlier pledged to donate a quarter of the money he received from jersey sales to Hurricane Katrina victims if allowed to wear the number 5, he later said he would make that donation no matter what number he wears. As part of the deal with McAfee to wear the number 25, Bush agreed to allocate half of <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> charities of McAfee's choosing, with the other half going to charities of Bush's choosing. McAfee pledged to donate his share to Katrina victims in his home state of Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|The colony was {{established}} on November 7, 1924, and was initially named Colonia Regina de Alvear, {{in honor of}} the first lady, Regina Pacini de Alvear. Héctor Valsecchi was named the first president of the company. Bonoli and his helper, Emilio Bignami, planned the organization and development of the area. The company spent most of its starting capital of US$1.4 million buying the 5,000 hectares. During the first year, they worked 1,300 hectares, which were divided into lots of 5, 10 and 15 hectares. To settle this area, the company gave preference to the Italian immigrants that already lived in Argentina. During the second stage, the company cultivated 1,200 hectares; these were given to Italian families that wanted to immigrate to Argentina. Those in this second wave of settlement were selected by the officials of the company. By 1927, 1,000 people had settled in the town. Soon a hospital, a church, a school, a library and a sports club were built. The Bank of Rome gave the settlement a loan of 5 million lire, in spite of Benito Mussolini's plan to use <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> support Italian workers in Italy. Further loans to the settlement were leveraged by Bonoli's connection to Ottavio Dinale. Dinale, a collaborator of Mussolini, had influence with the General Commissariat of Emigration (Italian: Commissariato Generale dell'Emigrazione). The loans were given by the Banca Commerciale Italiana, through the Francés y Italiano para América del Sur bank and the Italia y Río de la Plata bank.|$|E
500|$|StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty {{features}} {{the return of}} the three species from the original game: Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. In the Terran campaign, the original StarCraft briefing room is replaced with an interactive version of the battlecruiser Hyperion, with Jim Raynor, now a bitter and hard-drinking mercenary captain, as the central character. In a departure from previous Blizzard games, the campaign is non-linear, with Raynor taking jobs for money and using <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy additional units and upgrades. Although each play through will vary, the end result remains consistent, keeping the storyline linear. Blizzard's Vice President Rob Pardo stressed that each campaign will function very differently. The Terran campaign, Wings of Liberty, places players in a mercenary-style campaign, as Terran rebel group Raynor's Raiders raise funds by taking assignments from outside groups. The second release, Heart of the Swarm, is Zerg-focused and has role-playing elements. Kerrigan is the focus of the campaign, and the story revolves around the possibility of her redemption. [...] The Protoss-themed Legacy of the Void will be the final expansion, with the Protoss Artanis attempting to reunite the Protoss tribes in order to stop Amon, a fallen Xel'Naga.|$|E
