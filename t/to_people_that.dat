25|$|Other {{risk factors}} that {{influence}} the development of alcohol abuse or alcoholism include social and genetic factors. Several {{researchers have found that}} starting drinking before the age of 15 is associated with a fourfold increased risk for developing alcoholism compared <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> delay drinking until age 20 or later. It has been estimated by some that if the age at which people started drinking could be delayed to age 20, there would be a 50 percent {{reduction in the number of}} cases of alcohol use disorder. However, it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship, or a function of confounding familial (and other) factors associated with both age at first drink and propensity for alcoholism.|$|E

In 1995 Bull sold Heathkit to a private investor group called HIG, which then sold it to another investment group in 1998. Wanting to only concentrate on the educational products, this group sold the Heath/Zenith name and products to DESA International, a maker of specialty tools and heaters. In late 2008, Heathkit Educational Systems sold a large portion of its collection of legacy kit schematics and manuals along with permission to make reproductions to Don Peterson, though it still retained the copyrights and trademarks, and has pointers <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> can help with the older equipment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the article}} Why Tie Health Insurance to a Job?, Emanuel said that {{employer}} based health insurance {{should be replaced}} by state or regional insurance exchanges that pool individuals and small groups to pay the same lower prices charged to larger employers. Emanuel said that this would allow portable health insurance even <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> lose their jobs or change jobs, {{while at the same}} time preserving the security of employer based health benefits by giving consumers the bargaining power of a large group of patients. According to Emanuel, this would end discrimination by health insurance companies in the form of denial of health insurance based on age or preexisting conditions. In Solved!, Emanuel said that Universal Healthcare Vouchers would solve the problem of rapidly increasing health care costs, which, rising at three times the rate of inflation, would result in higher copayments, fewer benefits, stagnant wages and fewer employers willing to pay for health care benefits.|$|E

25|$|Enríquez {{pursued the}} rights to become the Royal Guinea Company sole {{representative}} in Puerto Rico. Established in 1701, this entity served as a major slave trader and became the only one sanctioned by the Spanish Crown {{to do business in}} their American colonies. On May 16, 1710, he officially completed this goal, signing a loan contract with the company's general director, Juan Bautista Chouirrio. With this accord, Enríquez became a major slaver in the territories of Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Margarita, Cumaná, Cumanagoto and Maracaibo, also permitting the adquisicion of slaves from adjacent islands such as Jamaica, St. Thomas and Curaçao depending on convenience. Under this agreement, he was able to import 40 African slaves per year, which he could sale under his own criteria. The contract lasted for three years and it also provided exemptions for clothes and maintenance. With the liberty to purchase these from any port in the Caribbean without right charges, it is likely that this was further exploited to import products at cheap prices, providing a large margin of profit. For every peça sold, Enríquez paid 100 pieces of eight, which were combined with an additional fee of 4,000 per year. Danío was involved in the transaction (which would also prove convenient for him as an official of the company) and along the other parts, an accord to secure that wins and losses were divided on three equal parts between them. Enríquez was jubilous with this development and proposed public celebration to commemorate it. He held the contract for a period of four years, leading 19 voyages under the premise of acquiring slaves and maintenance for them. Most of them were destined to St. Thomas. However, only ten of these incursions returned with new slaves for a total of 96, the others were used to import 109 barrels of flour. This cereal was supposedly bought to feed his slaves, but instead it was sold to the wealthier classes for profit. It is presumed that other odd products acquired under this premise, such as wine, beer, sugar, aguardiente, cocoa, paper and even copper, were sold in similar fashion. His enemies were quick to publicly denounce this practice, albeit with some exaggeration. Years later, these rights were supplanted despite the protests of Enríquez. In 1713, the Royal Guinea Company lost its status and was instead replaced with the Royal Asiento of Great Britain. Enríquez immediately pursued a position within this new entity and quickly coordinated moves with some friends, Santiago Gibbens in St. Thomas and Felipe Henríquez in Curaçao, to establish a new business model once he acquired these rights. To further secure the success of this venture, Enríquez offered gifts and even stakes <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> were already involved with the company. In June 1718, attorney in fact Tomás Othey granted him the title of factor and completed a loan contract. Enríquez was only able to employ this office until September, experiencing a series of complications based on international politics. During this timeframe, Othey himself imported slaves through the South Sea Company.|$|E

An updated Xbox Development Kit issued in June 2014 allows developers to explicitly disable motion tracking functionality in games, allowing access to additional system resources that represent about 10% of the GPU processing power. These resources were previously reserved for Kinect skeletal tracking, regardless of whether the Kinect sensor was attached or in use.|$|E

In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie.

Edge Magazine also complained that even when there were two players playing, the camera would always center on Scarygirl, even if that meant that Bunnyguru wound up off screen. Reviews were also mixed for the exploration and collection aspects of the game. Parkin of Eurogamer described these aspects by stating that: [...] "Branching paths through levels add the illusion of depth but, for players who wish to collect 100 per cent of the gems in a stage, trekking backwards and forwards through a level is an inelegant slog". Peter Eykemans of IGN found that the game's branching paths created difficulty for players seeking to gain a rating of [...] "perfection", but goes on to recommend the game <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> enjoy searching for collectables.|$|E

[...] "Bad" [...] {{was viewed as a}} rived [...] "Hit the Road Jack" [...] progression. Davitt Sigerson, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine, commented on the track's lyrical content while reviewing Bad, [...] "When Jackson declares that 'the whole world has to answer right now,' he is not boasting but making a statement of fact regarding his extraordinary stardom. If anything, he is scorning the self-coronation of lesser funk royals and inviting his fickle public to spurn him if it dare." [...] Sigerson compared the track to material by James Brown, whose [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" [...] is openly referenced by the four chromatic note brass introduction to the song. Lyrically, [...] "Bad" [...] pertains to proving <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> you are tough boasting, with Jackson asking [...] "who's bad?"

The final song written for the album was the ballad [...] "Beneath the Surface", which is also its closing track. Petrucci wrote the song himself, demoed and recorded it, and then presented it to the band, who were open to including it on the album.|$|E

500|$|Tensions on the Amazonian set were high, {{due in part}} to the {{location}} and to the nature of the production itself. Yorke describes the set as having [...] "a level of cruelty unknown to me," [...] while Kerman described Deodato as remorseless and uncaring; he and Deodato got into long, drawn-out arguments every day of shooting, usually because of remarks made by Deodato. Cast members also experienced unscrupulous payment practices, which further heightened tensions. Yorke's first payment for the film came in the form of Colombian pesos and was less than what had been agreed upon. Yorke refused to continue shooting until he was paid fairly in United States dollars. The native extras also went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes, including a scene in which they were forced to stay inside a burning hut for a prolonged period of time. Robert Kerman also noted unfair treatment of the natives by Deodato, stating, [...] "He was a sadist. He was particularly sadistic <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> couldn't answer back, people that were Colombian, [...] people that were Italian but could be sent home".|$|E
500|$|In 1943 Vaughan Williams {{conducted}} {{the premiere of}} his Fifth Symphony at the Proms. Its serene tone contrasted with the stormy Fourth, and led some commentators to think it a symphonic valediction. William Glock wrote that it was [...] "like {{the work of a}} distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say, but says it in exquisitely flowing language". The music Vaughan Williams wrote for the BBC to celebrate the end of the war, Thanksgiving for Victory, was marked by what the critic Edward Lockspeiser called the composer's characteristic avoidance of [...] "any suggestion of rhetorical pompousness". Any suspicion that the septuagenarian composer had settled into benign tranquillity was dispelled by his Sixth Symphony (1948), described by the critic Gwyn Parry-Jones as [...] "one of the most disturbing musical statements of the 20th century", opening with a [...] "primal scream, plunging the listener immediately into a world of aggression and impending chaos." [...] Coming as it did near the start of the Cold War, many critics thought its pianissimo last movement a depiction of a nuclear-scorched wasteland. The composer was dismissive of programmatic theories: [...] "It never seems to occur <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> a man might just want to write a piece of music." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Montag {{revealed}} <b>to</b> <b>People</b> <b>that</b> she {{had undergone}} ten cosmetic surgery procedures {{in a single}} day two months prior, performed by Frank Ryan. Among the procedures were brow-lifts, ear-pinnings, a chin reduction, as well as a second rhinoplasty and second breast augmentation. She commented that she almost died from too much Demerol, reducing her heart rate to five beats per minute. Her debut studio album Superficial was digitally released later that month to an overwhelmingly negative critical response from critics. The self-funded record cost nearly $2 million and sold approximately 1,000 copies in first-week downloads, failing to earn back the money spent making it. In May, she and Pratt made their final appearance on The Hills halfway through the sixth and final season. In December 2013, Montag stated that she and Conrad have [...] "talked a few times" [...] since the series' conclusion, elaborating that [...] "it's unfortunate things happened the way that it did, but we're both different people now, older and more mature." [...] However, in 2015, Montag angrily excoriated Conrad when she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp, during a sequence where the contestants were asked to forgive someone who had hurt them in the past; Montag told a stand-in for Conrad that Conrad had [...] "ruined my life with her lies", said that Conrad DID have a sex tape and had falsely blamed it on her, and that she [...] "forgave" [...] Conrad for being terrible and trying to ruin her life. Montag was universally lambasted for bringing up the sex tape lies anew, parroting the views of Pratt (who Conrad actually blamed for spreading the false rumors; Conrad felt Montag knew he was lying but took Pratt's side because she loved him) and trying to use Conrad's name to get publicity for herself.|$|E
