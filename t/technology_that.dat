5000|$|Kaku {{writes that}} since {{scientists}} understand the basic {{laws of physics}} today {{they are able to}} perceive or imagine a basic outline of future <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> might work. Kaku writes: [...] "Physicists today understand the basic laws physics extending over a staggering forty three orders of magnitude, from the interior of the proton out to the expanding universe." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} physicists can discern between future <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> are merely improbable and those <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> are truly impossible. He uses a system of Class I, Class II, and Class III to classify these science-fictional future <b>technologies</b> <b>that</b> are believed to be impossible today.|$|R

5|$|A {{localized}} {{earthquake in}} New York City damages only one building, killing nearly all inside. The Fringe team discovers {{that a second}} building appeared at the same location as the first, fusing the structure and people inside together. Walter (John Noble) realizes that the second building has been pulled from the parallel universe by Thomas Jerome Newton, using the <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> Walter and William Bell had discovered years ago. Walter warns that because of conservation of mass, a building of similar mass will be taken from the prime universe to the parallel one {{sometime in the next}} few days.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{supplements}} include audio {{commentaries on}} both films featuring Jon Lee Anderson—author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, and a 20-page booklet featuring an essay by film critic Amy Taubin. There are also three short documentaries on Guevara: Making Che—a {{documentary about the}} film's production, Che and the Digital Revolution—a documentary about the Red One Camera <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> {{was used in the}} film's production, and End of a Revolution—a 1968 documentary by Brian Moser who was in Bolivia looking for Che when Che was executed.|$|E

5|$|After {{five days}} and {{multiple}} attempts to rescue Hambleton, five aircraft {{had been shot}} down and another 16 seriously damaged, 10 service members had been killed or were missing in action, two were POWs, and two were behind front lines also waiting to be rescued. On April 8, Gen. Creighton Abrams was briefed on the high losses in the several failed attempts to rescue Hambleton and Clark. He ordered that no further air CSAR would be attempted, but that given Hambleton's Top Secret clearance and knowledge of missiles and counter-measure <b>technology,</b> <b>that</b> every effort {{should be made to}} bring him out.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E
5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> {{enables the use of}} multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E

This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman {{had turned out to be}} Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Henry Kolm went on {{to start}} Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the {{magnetic}} transportation <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> O'Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran at a speed of 40mph (65km/h), far slower than the high-speed trains O'Neill envisioned.|$|E

Quantum cellular automata, one way of performing computations using the principles of quantum mechanics, are often required to be reversible. Additionally, many problems in physical modeling, such as the motion of particles in an ideal gas or the Ising model of alignment of magnetic charges, are naturally reversible and can be simulated by reversible cellular automata.|$|E

5|$|The Loudest Engine {{features}} a sound {{adapted to the}} genres of folk and rock, {{more so than the}} previous two Howling Bells records. Juanita explained that the band relied less on the sound <b>technology</b> <b>that</b> was prominent in Radio Wars, instead returning to the more organic state of Howling Bells. For the new album, Joel was inspired by prog rock and krautrock acts such as Amon Düül and Aphrodite's Child. Howling Bells were inspired by The Doors documentary When You're Strange, which the members watched just before beginning to record The Loudest Engine.|$|E
