5|$|The Mongalla region {{suffered}} {{an outbreak of}} cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) between 1918 and 1924, apparently introduced by Ugandan porters who had served in German East Africa during World War I. CSM caused high mortality for a six-year period as it spread from one family to another. A less devastating CSM epidemic started in 1926, causing 335 deaths in 1928, 446 in 1929 and 335 in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1930 before rapidly dying out.|$|E
5|$|After staying healthy through <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the 2010–11 season, Brulé {{suffered}} continued injury {{problems for}} the rest of the campaign. After being sidelined with a stomach virus for four games, he suffered an abdominal injury the following month and missed 23additional contests. After returning to the lineup, he sustained a concussion during a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on March13,2011. In total, Brulé missed 39games with injuries in 2010–11, limiting him to 7goals and 2assists.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the {{season on the}} bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of music downloads, only sales of {{physical}} formats—such as CD, vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards positions on the UK music charts. The first chart to record sales of downloads was the UK Singles Downloads Chart, which was launched in September 2004 to list weekly sales of single downloads. Downloaded singles were growing considerably at this time, rising ten-fold {{in the first half}} of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. As single downloads grew in popularity, so did album downloads – 1.8million albums were downloaded in 2005; a further 825,000 were downloaded during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 2006.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar's {{passenger}} numbers initially {{failed to}} meet predictions. In 1996, London and Continental Railways forecast that passenger numbers would reach 21.4million annually by 2004, but only 7.3million was achieved. 82 million passengers used Waterloo International Station from its opening in 1994 to its closure in 2007. 2008 was a record year for Eurostar, with a 10.3% rise in passenger use, which was attributed {{to the use of}} High Speed 1 and the move to St Pancras. The following year, Eurostar saw an 11.5% fall in passenger numbers during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 2009, attributed to the 2008 Channel Tunnel fire and the 2009 recession.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Julian joined Conference National side Newport County on a free transfer.

30|$|To {{summarise}} {{the discussion}} up front, {{we find that}} the characteristics of individuals most strongly associated with unemployment in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after graduation are not necessarily those associated with participation in the programme. In fact, the data suggest no relationship between the risk of unemployment in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after graduation and participation in the programme. There is some evidence also that the risk of unemployment is negatively associated with the timing of SIVP participation – i.e. those individuals most likely to be unemployed for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after graduation are those who tend to have to wait the longest before they participate in the programme. Overall, therefore, these findings suggest that the SIVP programme is not effectively targeting those who need it most.|$|R

5|$|Admiral Graf Spee spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> {{her career}} {{conducting}} extensive sea trials to ready the ship for service. The ship's first commander was Kapitän zur See (KzS) Conrad Patzig; he was replaced in 1937 by KzS Walter Warzecha. After joining the fleet, Admiral Graf Spee became the flagship of the German Navy. In {{the summer of}} 1936, following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War, she deployed to the Atlantic to participate in non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. Between August 1936 and May 1937, the ship conducted three patrols off Spain. On the return voyage from Spain, Admiral Graf Spee stopped in Great Britain to represent Germany in the Coronation Review at Spithead for King George VI on 20 May.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents {{taken from his}} employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, {{this led to a}} high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by Chadian forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller Chadian attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the Chadian victories in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1987, more than 3,000 Libyan soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya sent its own aircraft to bomb abandoned Libyan equipment to deny its use to the Chadians. It was reported that, in many cases, Libyan soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle. At Ouadi Doum, panicked Libyans had suffered high casualties running through their own minefields.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Imperial County {{businessmen}} {{hoped to}} promote {{the use of this}} road over the route from Phoenix to Los Angeles, to increase tourism. Eventually, US 80 did become the most used road into Southern California from the east, but by 1947, the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road, since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again. Four years later, US 80 was reported to be the most used transcontinental highway, and there was a 40 percent increase in the out-of-state cars that traveled through the state inspection station at Yuma during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> that year. But in 1954, there were reports that traffic had decreased, because the road to Phoenix, Arizona from Lordsburg, New Mexico had improved.|$|E
5|$|Robertson {{originally}} pitched for the Buffalo Bisons, the Indians' AAA-class {{affiliate in}} the minor leagues.

In 14 appearances with Buffalo, 12 of them starts, Robertson had a 4–5 record with a 7.27 ERA. The Indians called Robertson up to the major league roster on June 25 after placing Rafael Betancourt on the disabled list. In eight games for the Indians, Robertson had a record of 1–1 and a 12.21 ERA. In his final appearance in the major leagues, a July 21 game against the Chicago White Sox, Robertson was ejected after hitting Magglio Ordóñez with a pitch in the fifth inning.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} {{launched}} {{after three years}} of trials on 1 September 1997. Three million cards were issued within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the system's launch. The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly. Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head coins in Hong Kong would rise in value, so many people hoarded these older coins and waited for their value to increase.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the practical implementation of terrestrial laser scanning for ovalisation measurements of newly built concrete railway tunnels. Also an accuracy assessment is performed {{and then an}} overview of the measured deviations is given. This research is based on the ovalisation monitoring of concrete railway tunnels for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> projects of this kind in Belgium. These tunnels are measured with laser scanning during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after construction. For all measurements, the concrete surface of the tunnel rings is scanned with a lateral resolution of 5 mm or higher with a phase-based Leica HDS 6100 laser scanner. Based on the recorded point clouds of the tunnel rings, the deviations from ovalisation and the changes in ovalisation during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after construction are determined. During this research, a workflow has been developed to determine the deviations from ovalisation and the changes during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after placement. <b>The</b> differences that are observed between the control measurements at the different points in time show a stabilization of the construction after one or two weeks after construction...|$|R

5|$|Apple {{unveiled}} the PowerBook100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex computer expo in Las Vegas, {{with two other}} models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The advertisement and the product were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks {{in the first year}}, with peak demand in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in the first year after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.|$|E
5|$|Before {{an attack}} on Moscow could begin, {{operations}} in Kiev needed to be finished. Half of Army Group Center had swung to {{the south in the}} back of the Kiev position, while Army Group South moved to the north from its Dniepr bridgehead. The encirclement of Soviet forces in Kiev was achieved on 16 September. A battle ensued in which the Soviets were hammered with tanks, artillery, and aerial bombardment. After ten days of vicious fighting, the Germans claimed 665,000 Soviet soldiers captured, although the real figure is probably around 220,000 prisoners. Soviet losses were 452,720 men, 3,867 artillery pieces and mortars from 43 divisions of the 5th, 21st, 26th, and 37th Soviet Armies. Despite the exhaustion and losses facing some German units (upwards of 75 percent of their men) from the intense fighting, the massive defeat of the Soviets at Kiev and the Red Army losses during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the assault contributed to the German assumption that Operation Typhoon (the attack on Moscow) could still succeed.|$|E
5|$|Established on 25 March 1941 in {{response}} to lobbying by women wanting {{to serve in the}} war, and to free more male ground crew for overseas postings, the WAAAF was the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in Australia, predating similar organisations in the Army and Navy. Fewer than two hundred personnel had been recruited when Stevenson became Director in June; this number would grow to around a thousand {{by the end of the}} year. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> its existence the WAAAF had been under the temporary command of Flight Officer Mary Bell, wife of an RAAF group captain and former Australian Commandant of the Women's Air Training Corps, an organisation of female pilots and ground staff that had been formed in 1939 and had been providing voluntary support to the Air Force. Bell chose to resign on learning of Stevenson's appointment, rather than stay on as Deputy Director and report to someone from outside the service fraternity; she later rejoined at Wrigley's request, on the condition that she would receive no promotion higher than flight officer.|$|E
