40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{electronic}} devices are the upmost {{destiny of the}} miniaturization trend of electronic components. Although not yet reproducible on large scale, molecular devices are since recently subject of intense studies both experimentally and theoretically, which agree in pointing out the extreme sensitivity of such devices on the nature {{and quality of the}} contacts. <b>This</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>intends</b> to provide a general theoretical framework for modelling electronic transport at the molecular scale by describing the implementation of a hybrid method based on Green function theory and density functional algorithms. In order to show the presence of contact-dependent features in the molecular conductance, we discuss three archetypal molecular devices, which are intended to focus on the importance of the different sub-parts of a molecular two-terminal setup. ...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{psychology}} considers {{communication in}} terms of semantic and intentional transparency. This idea should be overcome, since the borderline between what is communicated and what is miscommunicated cannot be split up and partitioned in two separate and discrete domains. The starting point of this chapter {{is based on the}} assumption that a viable theory of communication has also to explain miscommunication in its different forms. In this perspective, communication sets up a unique and global category, including miscommunication phenomena, coming to the eventuality of not communicating. In particular, our aim is to outline some general principles that might connect communication and miscommunication processes to each other in a global, parsimonious and coherent theoretical perspective. <b>This</b> <b>chapter</b> <b>intends</b> to sketch out a miscommunication as a chance theor...|$|E
