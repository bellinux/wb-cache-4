5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (<b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E

From another early operation (K-Shell, <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
5|$|Rulers {{sponsored}} Theravada {{and often}} {{took steps to}} stop <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> of Mahayana beliefs.

Voharika Tissa and Gothabhaya (249–262) expelled several monks from the order for supporting such views. A change in this occurred when Mahasena embraced Mahayana teachings and acted against Theravada institutions. However, he too accommodated Theravada teachings after the population rebelled against him. As the kingdom and the authority or kings declined, Mahayana and Tantric doctrines again began to spread, however, Theravada remained the main and most widespread doctrine.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>The</b> notion <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of {{a matrix}} was first {{introduced}} fifty years ago in algebra. In this article, we define <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator by applying the same idea to submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds. We prove that <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of shape operator is a conformal invariant for any submanifold in a Riemannian manifold. Then, we prove that, for a compact submanifold of a Riemannian manifold, <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator is bounded above by a geometric quantity proportional to the Willmore-Chen functional. For a complete non-compact submanifold, we establish a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator and the Willmore-Chen functional. In the last section, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a surface of rotation to have finite integral of <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator...|$|R

We hypothesize that the power-law decay of <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> {{is a consequence of}} the strategic limit order placement of liquidity providers. We support this hypothesis by investigating several quantities, such as order placement rates and distribution of prices and times of submitted orders, which affect the decay of <b>the</b> <b>spread...</b>|$|R

Currently, the earliest evidence for <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of agriculture into this region comes from Sichuan Province, where two types of agriculture {{appear to have been}} intertwined with <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of populations and possibly language families.

Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis.

5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged that some of the Shah's advisors were Bahá'ís. Bahá'ís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Bahá'ís increased.|$|E

The Army of the Andes had 4,000 soldiers instead, and Cochrane's navy another 1,600. With this disparity of forces, San Martín tried to avoid battles. He tried instead to divide the enemy forces in several locations, as he did during the Crossing of the Andes, and trap the royalists with a pincer movement with either reinforcements of the Army of the North from the South or the army of Simón Bolívar from the North.

5|$|The {{creation}} of the abyssal plain {{is the result of}} <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E
