25|$|The second-floor balcony {{is framed}} on either end by pilasters {{decorated}} with candelabra. Each wall is angled inward by two bays, {{with one of}} the bays behind the balustrade. It is reached via French doors which are framed by slit windows on either side. Pilasters decorated with candelabra are set between the four windows and the doors. A circular escutcheon framed with fruit-and-drapery swags tops each bay and <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors,</b> while fruit-and-drapery swags link the pilaters over the slit windows.|$|E
25|$|The central corps de logis {{is entirely}} {{taken up with}} the ballroom as it {{appeared}} on White's plans which, with the Louis XIV furniture removed, could serve as Newport's largest ballroom at 40 by 80 feet. Its scheme of single and paired Corinthian pilasters alternating with arch-headed windows and recessed doorways echoes the articulation of the exterior. This is reached through <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> on either side, to a plain terrace dropping by broad stairs to the lawn facing the ocean, or to a planted terrace garden with a central fountain.|$|E
25|$|The {{third floor}} balcony is reached through French doors (framed with slit windows) as well. It {{features}} a low balustrade of turned granite interrupted by pedestals, which {{are decorated with}} variegated marble panels. The placement of the pedestals mimics the pillars and pilasters below. The two bay windows {{on either side of}} the balcony feature the same torches, swag, putti, panels, and molding similar to the rest of the third floor. Above <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> is a large oval estucheon with fruit-and-drapery swag which mimics the estucheon over the doors to the loggia. A standing putto over each slit window supports the swag.|$|E
50|$|When Sathish agrees, Vijay {{explains}} {{his plan to}} murder Latha the following evening. His plan consists of taking Anand to a party while leaving Latha at home and hiding the latchkey outside {{the front door of}} their house. Sathish will then sneak in when Latha is asleep and hide behind the curtains in front of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>door</b> to <b>the</b> gardens. At 10:50, Vijay will telephone the house from the party so that when she answers the phone, Sathish can kill Latha.

50|$|The western {{verandah}} has a stone paved floor, with timber posts {{supporting a}} skillion awning. A centrally positioned multi-paned <b>French</b> <b>door</b> with battered reveals and external timber shutters opens onto the verandah. A multi-paned casement window with external timber shutters is positioned above <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>door</b> and opens above the awning level. A plaque commemorating {{the construction of}} the building is hung on {{the southern end of the}} western wall, and the name 'Wiseman's Cottage' is located centrally hung from the verandah top- plate.|$|R

500|$|Asher {{produced}} {{and directed the}} episode. A high school student who was granted the role of assistant director at one point screamed [...] "Quiet on the set!", a memory that Sargent later recalled fondly. For the scene in which Samantha casts a spell that makes Mr. Brockway see everyone as having black skin, the white actors, including Sargent and White, appeared in blackface. The name of Mr. Brockway's toy company is never mentioned. Samantha's statement {{at the end of}} the episode, [...] "We're having integrated turkey: white meat and dark", was repeated in Spike Lee's 1986 film She's Gotta Have It. The final shot of the episode, which zooms out from the scene of Samantha and Darrin kissing to reveal <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> at the back of their house as [...] "Silent Night" [...] plays in the background, is the only shot in any episode of Bewitched to depict the interior of the house from the perspective of the backyard. [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] is the only episode of the series in which Lisa appears. Seven years before acting together in [...] "Sisters at Heart", Montgomery and Baer appeared together in an episode of the CBS television series Rawhide called [...] "Incident at El Crucero", which aired when the pilot episode of Bewitched was in pre-production. In 1970, Montgomery appeared on The Merv Griffin Show to promote [...] "Sisters at Heart", thereby making one of the only three talk show appearances of her career. After Griffin left the network, CBS wiped all episodes of The Merv Griffin Show produced between 1969 and 1972, but a copy of the episode featuring Montgomery's promotion of [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] was later discovered when it became known that relevant kinescopes and master tapes had survived.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Ashton Gifford Estate" [...] {{was put up}} {{for sale}} by auction in 1920, on the [...] "order of Captain H. N. Fane". [...] Rawlence and Squarey were the auctioneers, and the auction {{took place at the}} White Hart Hotel, Salisbury on 1 June. Fane had {{purchased}} the property on the death of Harding in 1916 [...] The house was described at this time as having sixteen bedrooms and dressing rooms and the [...] "usual offices". The dining room (now kitchen) and drawing room did not have <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> to the south terrace that they currently have. The estate included a bailiff's house, two lodges and two additional cottages and was described as [...] "an attractive gentleman's residence.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned at}} last wearily {{away from the}} window, rose to his feet, opened <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> which led out into the gardens, and strolled across the lawn to where Letitia was seated. She laid down her book and welcomed him with a smile which had in it just a shade of fatigue.|$|E
50|$|At {{the western}} end of <b>the</b> verandah, <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> open to a large bedroom with a timber framed bay window (casements). The room, {{similarly}} to the open living and dining room, has a timber panelled ceiling.|$|R
50|$|The Jameson-Richards Cafe is a {{historic}} commercial building on Arkansas Highway 367 in Bald Knob, Arkansas. Built in the 1930s, it is a typical roadside cafe of that period, a single-story brick structure with English Revival features. It is T-shaped in plan, with half-timbered stucco gable ends above brick walls. Most of it windows are original casement, as is <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>door</b> that is <b>the</b> main entry. The cafe stands next to the similar Jameson-Richards Gas Station, another period roadside building.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, his daughter, Jill Faulkner Summers, {{sold the}} house to the University of Mississippi. The University {{maintains}} the home in order to promote Faulkner's literary heritage. Tours are available. The home has been visited by such writers as John Updike, Czesław Miłosz, Charles Simic, Richard Ford, James Lee Burke, Bei Dao, Charles Wright, Charles Frazier, Alice Walker, the Coen brothers, Bobbie Ann Mason, Salman Rushdie, and others. Writer Mark Richard once repaired a faulty doorknob on <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>door</b> to Faulkner's study.|$|R
5000|$|After Hagen {{leaves the}} room, Vito takes Michael {{out to the}} garden though <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> in the study. (Exclusive to the Saga only) ...|$|E
50|$|Internally {{the timber}} trusses {{have been left}} exposed on the upper level and <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> with lead lights which opened onto the first floor balcony remain.|$|E
50|$|Few {{significant}} external alterations {{were subsequently}} {{made to the}} building. The tile hanging {{on the east side}} of the house and the horizontal sliding sash windows of the kitchen (east wing) are of 19th century origin, as are <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> in the ground floor north room at the west side of the house. The glazing of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> is consistent with an Arts and Crafts era and this may be attributable to Arthur Weekes and his wife Jessie Nelson Weekes, resident together from the date of their marriage in 1888 until Arthur’s death in 1917.|$|E
60|$|He strode hastily to <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>French</b> {{and one of}} the plain-clothes {{men were}} {{descending}} the stairs.|$|R
50|$|Internal doors feature fanlights above, and rooms open onto <b>the</b> verandahs via <b>French</b> <b>doors.</b> Rooms to <b>the</b> {{rear of the}} {{building}} have double-hung sash windows with window hoods of timber and Durabestos shingles.|$|R
50|$|To {{the south}} a timber wing (s) is {{connected}} to the core via the verandahs. Although more modest in scale and materials, it has <b>the</b> same <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> as <b>the</b> core, a double fireplace with marble surrounds, and a small oriel window and folding dividing doors in the long southern room. It has been divided into two flats.|$|R
50|$|When Swann agrees, Tony {{explains}} his plan: the following evening {{he will take}} Mark to a party, leaving Margot at home and hiding her latchkey outside {{the front door of}} their flat. Swann is to sneak in when Margot is asleep and hide behind the curtains in front of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> to the garden. At eleven o'clock, Tony will telephone the flat from the party. Swann must kill Margot when she answers the phone, open <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors,</b> leave signs suggesting a burglary gone wrong, and exit through the front door, hiding the key again.|$|E
5000|$|The {{limestone}} plaque on {{the outside}} Library facade above <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> facing the Library Terrace has ROBERT HENRY ALLERTON and the date MDCCCC incised on the surface. This {{takes the place of}} a traditional cornerstone.|$|E
50|$|His {{daughter}} Elizabeth {{inherited the}} farm {{when he died}} in 1876. It was less successful under her ownership. Around that time the interior was further reworked with more Victorian touches added, as well as the exterior changes like <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} in double brick, {{and it is this}} unreinforced masonry construction that was unable to cope with the earthquake forces. Upstairs, windows were round-headed. Downstairs, many of <b>the</b> openings were <b>French</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} a nightclub {{at the southern}} end with a restaurant to the north. Both have access to <b>the</b> verandah via <b>French</b> <b>doors,</b> with <b>the</b> southern corner having been enclosed to form office space.|$|R
40|$|This {{detailed}} {{view of the}} back terrace of Rosecliff shows McKim, Mead and White 2 ̆ 7 s unusual use of white glazed terra-cotta as the exterior, giving the mansion a pristine, gleaming appearance. <b>The</b> massive <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> separating <b>the</b> ballroom from the terrace face the harbor and allow the interior, also white, {{to take on the}} changing hues of daylight. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Most {{exterior}} {{walls are}} of twelve inch chamfer-boards, while interior walls are lined horizontally with beaded {{tongue and groove}} boards, as are the high ceilings. For ventilation purposes, casement windows with small wooden knobs may be opened above <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kicking off {{at midnight}} of 12 November 2005 with the short film <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>Doors,</b> the event continued, {{alternating}} between {{long and short}} with Loft, Jona/Tomberry, Boy Eats Girl (starring Samantha Mumba), Something Red, Zombie Honeymoon, 12 Hot Women, and finally Gusha No Bindume (or [...] "Hellavator").|$|E
50|$|Interior {{walls are}} of {{rendered}} masonry with some fibrous cement partitions {{and the original}} arched entrance has been bricked in. A few casement windows survive, {{but most of the}} windows, doors and all of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> opening onto the front verandah have been removed. The upper floor is of timber. There is no internal access between floors.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper floor}} {{contains}} accommodation for the manager and 6 guest bedrooms leading off a central hall. Guest rooms to <b>the</b> verandah have <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> and modern toilets {{have been constructed}} on the rear verandah at the south west.|$|R
50|$|While {{on shore}} leave, the seaman visited a dance hall. An {{adjoining}} room overlooking <b>the</b> ocean had <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> that opened to an unprotected ledge. The seaman {{stepped out onto}} the ledge, lost his balance, and fell. He sued to recover maintenance and cure.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{walls are}} {{plastered}} and most rooms have decorative plaster ceilings. An Art Deco influence is evident with a nautical design, consisting of three concentric circles with intersecting rippled or straight lines, {{which is used}} in the wrought iron stair railing and repeated in <b>the</b> leadlight <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> opening off <b>the</b> foyer, is outlined in brass strips in the main bathroom's aggregate floor and is depicted on the chrome hood of the fireplace.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} three bedrooms and one bathroom. Two of the bedrooms {{have access to}} the front verandah via <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors.</b> The internal doorways have rectangular fanlights with decorative timber fretwork. The walls and ceilings are of timber VJs and all of the rooms have ceiling roses. The interior and exterior of the building and out-buildings is remarkably intact.|$|E
50|$|The facades of 10-12 Logan Road are {{restrained}} {{with openings}} defined by simple architraves. The original cantilevered verandahs {{on the two}} upper levels have been removed and some of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> replaced with casement windows. Six pairs of the original doors remain on the Stanley Street facade but all have been replaced on the Logan Road facade. The original transom lights and cast iron vents remain.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the Homestead {{is divided}} into three {{principal}} rooms, to which <b>the</b> <b>french</b> <b>doors</b> provide access. These rooms are internally clad with fibrous cement sheeting braced with timber strips. Some of the internal walls are covered with calico and hessian lining. A chimney piece, with rudimentary timber mantle, is found in the largest of the rooms on the north west end of the homestead, and another in the adjacent room.|$|E
50|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the first}} and second floors retain original finishes including pressed metal ceilings and plastered masonry walls ornamented by arches and mouldings. Panelled timber doors with fanlights open off <b>the</b> central hallway. <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> with fanlights lead from the bedrooms and principal public areas to the verandahs.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>French</b> {{crossover}} <b>doors</b> {{and one of}} {{the piston}} relief duct doors failed to close properly, allowing to smoke to enter the other running tunnel. Furthermore, control centre staff were overwhelmed, having not been sufficiently trained for an emergency and were using procedures and systems that were complex. This led to, for example, the supplementary ventilation system being brought online late and running incorrectly for fifteen minutes.|$|R
50|$|Several early {{photographs}} of the residence and stables at Canning Downs survive {{from the time of}} Davidson's ownership. These show a substantial timber slab house with a steeply pitched hipped roof of shingles, and shingled verandah awnings surrounding <b>the</b> building. <b>French</b> <b>doors</b> open onto <b>the</b> verandahs. Davidson may have replace the shingled roof of the main residence with a corrugated iron roof as one of the photographs apparently dating from this time shows the replacement occurring.|$|R
