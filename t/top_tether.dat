Methods: Vehicle characteristics were extracted from prior surveys of more than 100 top-selling 2010 - 13 vehicles. Use and correct use of LATCH was determined from records of child restraint installations in these vehicles that were inspected by child passenger safety technicians at Safe Kids car seat checkup events during 2010 - 12.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to quantify the}} effects of the misuse in LATCH lower webbing. In the short period since the implementation of the LATCH system several cases of potential misuses have been reported. A series of sled tests in frontal impact mode were conducted with various misuse conditions (loose attachment of LATCH lower webbing, misrouting of LATCH lower webbing and child seat back inclination) for both forward and rearward facing child safety seats (FFCSS and RFCSS). Results from these tests are compared and discussed with that of the standard test with no misuse and showed that as the slack in the lower LATCH webbing increased, ATD injury measures exceeded the limits. The FFCSS tests in the reclined condition yielded lower injury values for all except the chest G’s when compared to the standard upright test. In the misrouting tests the ATD kinematics depended on the routing pivot point, the lower the pivot point the better the ATD kinematics. Similar findings were also observed in the RFCSS tests. The use of <b>top</b> <b>tether</b> with the FFCSS substantially improved the performance of the Hybrid III 3 year old ATD in spite of misuse conditions and the injury values were lower than the corresponding tests with no <b>top</b> <b>tether.</b> The effective reduction was 37 % in the HIC values, 6 % in the chest G’s, 30 % in the head excursion, 22 % in the knee excursion and finally 37 % reduction in the Nij values...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a concept evaluation of novel station keeping concept for offshore vertical axis wind turbines based on the well-known tension leg platform (TLP) principle. The main characteristic of this concept is the two-stage approach of installing the turbine offshore. In general terms the concept consists of four major components: the turbine, cylindrical floater, submerged docking station {{and an array of}} vertical <b>top</b> tensioned <b>tethers.</b> The idea behind this concept is that the docking station is towed out to the field and attached to the tethers prior to the float out operation of the turbine. The turbine is towed out on separate cylindrical floater, which is mated to the docking station, situated at a certain depth below sea level. The top-tensioning of the tendons is achieved in two stages, first by de-ballasting the docking station to maintain a level of pre-tension prior to the mating procedure with the turbine floater. The turbine floater, which also maintains a certain mass of temporary ballast to achieve operating draft, is later used to achieve the desired pre-tension for the operating condition after installation. This concept was applied for patenting in Norway by Prof. A. Nergaard on 31 st June 2009 and granted 20 th September 2010 (Patent no. 329254). In this thesis the aim was to determine a set of promising floaters and docking stations by assessing relevant parameters based on spreadsheet calculations. The key considerations here were sufficient pre-tension capacity and stability in float out for a vertical axis wind turbine with a rated power of 2. 3 MW. Adjustments were made to the principal dimensions such as the diameters, drafts, pontoon radii and ratios of permanent ballast to temporary ballast to achieve stable floaters and docking stations that satisfied a set of design criteria. Due to limited available research on this particular concept, the design criteria were set based on existing information on horizontal axis wind turbine TLPs, along with several engineering assumptions. In general terms the work presented in this thesis cover three principal stages: spreadsheet analysis of parameters, hydrodynamic modelling and dynamic simulation in one operational and extreme sea state. The parameter study resulted in the selection of three cases with combined displacements ranging between 6047 and 9811 m 3, with associated pre-tension capacities per tendon between 5. 3 and 10 MN. Following the selection of cases, work was done to determine the frequency dependent added mass and potential damping properties of each case along with the specification of load and displacement RAOs. These properties were used to create a new set of vessels in OrcaFlex to assess the motion characteristics and tendon tension for the two aforementioned environmental conditions. The analysis conducted in this thesis was limited to linear effects only, i. e. second order effects were neglected. The {{objective of}} the thesis was to evaluate this concept based on the results obtained from the dynamic simulation in terms of loads at the floater-docking station connection, the tension in the tendons under both environmental conditions and assess the motion characteristics of each case. The results obtained for the selected cases resulted in slack tendons in the severe sea state corresponding to a 50 - year storm, which indicated that the selected cases did not satisfy the requirement for this type of station keeping concept. Despite the fact that none of the cases were sufficient to survive the storm, some trends were uncovered for possible further work on this concept to reach a suitable combination of parameters. The main problems that were found for this concept was the bending moment at the connection between the floater and docking station, and the occurrence of slack. In the 50 -year storm, maximum bending moments between 270 and 320 MNm were found, exceeding the capacity of standard collet connectors, which was the envisioned connection method in this thesis. In regards to slack tendons, it was found here that an increased pontoon radius (> 35 m) would yield significantly improved results in terms of avoiding slack, which coincided with the studied literature. A reduction in draft of the floater component, which in this thesis ranged between 50 and 60 m, would also result in improvements for both the connection load and the loss of tension in the downwind tendon. Higher pre-tension was also found to give lower variation in tendon load, coinciding with the studied literatur...|$|R

The advancement of technology in ultra deepwater has been leading Brazil into one of the promising offshore market. A Brazilian state-owned oil operator, Petrobras, confirms that 33 % from their total exploration area are located at water depth below 1500 m (Salies, 2005). It can be seen that the future of oil and gas exploration and production lies in ultra deepwater. The development of ultra deepwater field posed many challenges, in particular, on the selection of the riser concept. For ultra deepwater environment, the long suspended length of riser will significantly increase the vessel payload. High external hydrostatic pressure on the riser will increase the probability of collapse failure. Large dynamic motions of the vessel due to waves, and also large vessel offsets from wind, current and slow-drift motion yields potential buckling issues at the touch-down-point (TDP). In addition, potential fatigue problems due to vessel motions and soil-riser interactions also present at touch-down-point (TDP) area. Large current speed in deepwater field might also lead to vortex induced vibration (VIV) which eventually will contribute to significant fatigue damage for particular riser sections. By looking into these challenges, {{it is very important to}} select the most appropriate riser concept for the ultra deepwater field. Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) as newly developed hybrid riser concept offers a solution to overcome the challenges in ultra deepwater field. In general, COBRA riser arrangement consists of a catenary riser section with a long-slender sub-surface buoyancy module on <b>top</b> which is <b>tethered</b> down to sea bed via two mooring lines. The catenary section from top of the sub-surface buoy is connected to the floater by a flexible jumper. This flexible jumper can effectively absorb the floater motions, which give significant improvements for both strength and fatigue performance on the overall system. As a hybrid riser concept, this concept offers cost effective solution by avoiding all the expensive bottom assemblies that normally needed for a hybrid riser concept. This thesis focuses on COBRA riser concept for offshore Brazil ultra deepwater environment, specifically for Santos Basin Central Cluster region at 2200 m water depth. It is observed that there is common sudden change phenomenon on the current direction in Santos Basin area. In this thesis, the effect of bidirectional (2 -directions) current is analyzed, and the comparison with unidirectional current is discussed thoroughly. The analyses are focused on the global strength design performance under extreme environmental load and global fatigue design performance of the riser due to wave induced and VIV induced. This thesis captures detail analysis of COBRA base case configuration. In addition, further sensitivity studies from the base case riser arrangement are also presented.

This is an observational, cross-sectional survey of drivers transporting children 15 years and younger and drivers collected at 25 convenience locations randomly selected in Indiana during summers 2005 through 2010. Observations were conducted by Certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians (CPST). As the driver completed a written survey collecting demographic data on the driver and children, the CPST recorded the vehicle seating location, the type of restraint, direction the car safety seat (CSS) was facing, {{and use of the}} CSS harness or safety belt as appropriate. Data was analyzed for infants younger than twelve months, children in forward facing CSS, and children < 13 y. Between 2005 and 2010, 514 infants (age < 12 m) were observed in motor vehicles. On average 83. 5 % (SD 4. 8 %) of the infants were rear facing. The percent of infants rear facing was 75. 5 % during 2005 and rose to 88. 9 % during 2010.

40|$|The {{head and}} thorax {{of the child}} {{occupant}} are mainly injured regions in passenger car side impacts. In {{order to reduce the}} injury risks of head and thorax, a multi-objective optimization design of child restraint system (CRS) and side airbag is conducted in terms of CRS safety performances. A mathematical model of a child occupant in side collision is developed by using MADYMO software and the validity of the model is evaluated by comparing results between simulation and sled test. For the purpose of minimizing accelerations of child head and thorax, a sensitivity analysis of the design variables is conducted using the orthogonal design of experiment (DOE) and analysis of variance. The primary design variables are therefore determined, including material permeability of side airbag, location of <b>top</b> <b>tether</b> in X-direction and stiffness coefficient of lower anchorage. The objective functions for accelerations of child head and thorax are generated with second-order multinomial regression equations in terms of the determined design variables. Optimization is carried out byusing non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The optimized configuration of the CRS is obtained by further analysis based on the Pareto-optimal solutions. The results indicate that main design parameters of child restraint system are material permeability 0. 037 of side airbag, location − 0. 25 m of <b>top</b> <b>tether</b> in X-direction, stiffness coefficient 0. 5 of lower anchorage.

40|$|Aviation safety {{regulations}} in Australia and overseas permit the carriage {{of an infant}} passenger on the lap of an adult; however, this practice {{is known to be}} unsafe in an emergency landing scenario. While automotive child restraint systems (CRS) have been found to provide adequate protection to infant passengers, safety issues associated with their use have been identified. Principally, they may interfere with the dynamic behaviour of the aircraft seat, increasing the risk of injury to an adult seated directly behind. This study compared and evaluated the safety of seating arrangements involving infant air transport passengers under emergency landing conditions. Two arrangements were considered: the infant was either held on the lap of an adult or seated in a forward-facing CRS. A partially validated numerical model was used to study seat behaviour and measure injury potential. Results were analysed to compare the safety of different configurations, to evaluate safety in terms of an occupant protection standard and to predict the occurrence and severity of a particular injury using existing biomechanical relationships. One of two practices applies to lap-held infants depending on the jurisdiction a flight is operating under: the infant is either unrestrained or restrained by a supplementary loop belt. This study found that an unrestrained infant is likely to be projected through the aircraft cabin during the impact sequence while a restrained infant is at risk of serious abdominal injuries. Though the adoption of an emergency brace position by an adult carrying a lap-held infant was found to be beneficial, infant injury potential remained high. Of the three brace positions studied, a modified position proposed by this study was the most effective in reducing head injury potential for the infant. Three CRS installation methods - the aircraft seat lap belt, ISOFIX and LATCH - were analysed in terms of CRS performance and behaviour. Each method adequately protected the CRS occupant. The ISOFIX method resulted in a small increase in head injury potential for an adult seated directly aft while in the lap belt and LATCH cases a significant increase was observed. Some airlines specifically prohibit the use of Australian-certified CRS, presumably due to a requirement for installation using a &lsquo;top tether&rsquo; strap. This study found that the use of a <b>top</b> <b>tether</b> does not present any benefit in terms of CRS motion or injury potential for the CRS occupant. This study makes four recommendations: 1. The practice of holding an infant passenger on the lap should be prohibited. Until this is the case, advice on emergency brace positions involving lap-held infants should be revised to include a lateral offset between the head of the infant and that of the adult. 2. The use of automotive child restraints to restrain infant passengers should be mandated. 3. &nbsp;Any requirement for the use of a <b>top</b> <b>tether</b> in aircraft CRS installations should be removed. 4.

40|$|Installing {{deep water}} risers in harsh {{environmental}} conditions {{even in the}} icing environment, {{in the near future}} seems like inevitable. Especially in the Norwegian Sea, the development of deep water technology requires an urgent solution of how to transfer hydrocarbons from sea bed to the host facility in a remote area with considering hostile environment conditions. In every subsea production system combined with a floating facility, the need of risers is a must. Deeper water causes various challenges, for instance; higher payload of the vessel, increase probability of collapse failure of the riser, higher probability for riser failure due to buckling and fatigue issue at the touch-down-point (TDP) as well as presence of Vortex Induce Vibration (VIV) in the long suspended riser span. In addition, the polar climate which is occurring in the Norwegian Sea should be considered during designing, installing and operating of the system which caused this area to be different from other places. In order to reduce excessive floater motions, an uncoupled riser system is introduced. By using buoy elements, the riser system is able decouple the motion effect of the floater, riser and mooring system that may magnify the extreme hull/floater response. This can significantly improve strength and fatigue performance of the riser. This system is widely used in deep water conditions with various riser configurations. In general, an uncoupled riser system consists of two different types of riser concepts (flexible and steel) with buoy in between. There are three main components in this configuration; a flexible jumper that is directly connected to the floater, a sub-surface buoyancy module at the connection point, and a steel riser at the bottom parts. The flexible jumper is used to absorb the floater motions, and the result the configuration gives the optimum riser concept which is best suited for deep water conditions. In this topic, we limit the uncoupled riser configurations into two types; Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) and Single Line Offset Riser (SLOR). The difference between these two riser configurations is at the bottom part and at the connection point; COBRA configures the steel pipe as a catenary riser with a long-slender sub-surface buoyancy module on the <b>top</b> which is <b>tethered</b> down to sea bed via mooring lines while SLOR configures the steel pipe as a tensioned riser by using an air can as a buoyancy module to maintain the riser in tensioned position all time. By means of these riser configurations we have the possibility to use different types of riser arrangements since a standalone flexible riser is very expensive to use in deep water conditions. The main advantage of the two uncoupled riser configurations is that they enable possibilities for the floater to drift/side-step in case of drifting icebergs, which {{will be one of the}} study cases. This thesis focuses on a comparison study of the two uncoupled riser configurations based on ultimate limit state (ULS) and accidental limit state (ALS) results by considering the possibility to avoid/prevent iceberg collision. As explained previously, the risers to be studied are set to be installed in the Norwegian Sea which has harsh environmental conditions. Three different water depths have been chosen on purpose, which are 100 m, 400 m, and 1500 m. In the event of iceberg approach, this thesis work presents two solutions for comparison study. The two solutions are to drift/side-step the floating structure or to disconnect the riser/mooring system using a disconnectable turret. The repot will suggest the optimum solutions; the most suitable uncoupled riser configuration for the Norwegian Sea condition with respect to the riser performance for the case of floater drift off and the geometry of a disconnected riser. Based on detail strength analysis in operating and accidental conditions, this thesis concludes that COBRA riser concept has robust and efficient design to install in the Norwegian Sea conditions. In addition, the COBRA configuration in 1500 m water depth is feasible to perform a 250 m side-stepping in the event of an iceberg approach...|$|R

The study was part of a broad research program to identify suitable child restraint systems (CRS) to fit a large sedan vehicle to maximise protection in a crash. Dummies were restrained in the rear seat of a vehicle buck in three restraint configurations with boosters: (i) with a standard adult lap-sash seatbelt, (ii) with a seatbelt plus H-harness and crotch strap, or (iii) with a seatbelt plus H-harness with the crotch strap disengaged (to simulate the effects of real-world misuse conditions), and a fourth condition (iv) with an adult seatbelt only. Boosters were fitted in the vehicle with two different anchorage systems: a standard seatbelt and a system including a retrofitted rigid ISOFIX attachment and <b>top</b> <b>tether.</b> HyGe sled tests were conducted to simulate a 64 km/h offset deformable barrier frontal impact with a change in velocity of around 71 km/h. Preliminary investigations were also conducted using side impact simulations with a change in velocity of around 15 km/h. Overall, the booster seats for both the 6 year old dummy and the 3 year old dummy when a (with harness and crotch strap) provided superior crash protection than use of the adult seatbelt. For tests when the H-harness was used to restrain the dummy, use of the crotch strap was critical in eliminating ‘sub-marining’.

40|$|Australia is {{considering}} allowing {{the use of}} lower anchorage systems for child restraints in motor vehicles. However, care {{needs to be taken}} to ensure that the mix of existing Australian child restraint systems and any proposed lower anchorage system does not pose safety risks for children. In addition, it is desirable to avoid unique requirements for an Australian lower anchorage system and hence an assessment of UNECE ISOFIX and US FMVSS LATCH requirements was undertaken. A series of 28 frontal impact sled tests were conducted based on the Australian Standard AS/NZS 3629 child restraint dynamic test method. A further series of 15 tests were conducted in a vehicle body mounted on an impact sled with an acceleration-time history representative of a 56 km/h full frontal rigid barrier crash. Three different models of forward-facing child restraint were tested, with varying anchorage configurations including rigid ISOFIX, flexible LATCH strap and 3 -point seatbelt. Top tethers were evaluated with anchorages directly behind the child restraint (0 °) and offset at an angle of 20 °. P 3 and Hybrid III 3 year old dummies were used. Anchorage loads and safety performance of the restraint system were assessed. In tests in the vehicle body, maximum dynamic <b>top</b> <b>tether</b> loads were in the range of 7 - 8 kN and maximum dynamic lower anchorage loads are estimated to be in the range 13 - 14 kN. Tests using rigid ISOFIX anchorages generally produced lower head acceleration and forward excursion than other tested anchorage types. However, this was accompanied by increased chest deflections and neck flexion moments. These data suggest that lower anchorage systems may be acceptable in Australia, but that modifications to the UNECE and LATCH requirements may be required to ensure compatibility with existing Australian child restraint systems without a degradation of child safety...|$|E
