5|$|In 1946, the North Circular Road {{became a}} <b>trunk</b> <b>road,</b> funded from a {{national}} budget set by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) rather than a local one.|$|E
5000|$|At that time, 4500 mi of British {{roads were}} {{classified}} as <b>trunk</b> <b>roads.</b> Additional roads have been [...] "trunked", notably in the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Roads</b> Act 1946. Others, like virtually all British motorways, have entered {{the system as a}} result of new construction. As of 2004, Great Britain had 7,845 miles (12,625 km) of <b>trunk</b> <b>roads,</b> of which 2,161 miles (3,478 km) were motorways.|$|R
50|$|Since 1994, <b>trunk</b> <b>roads</b> in England {{have been}} managed by Highways England (formerly the Highways Agency), while Scotland has had {{responsibility}} {{for its own}} <b>trunk</b> <b>roads</b> since 1998; these are currently managed by Transport Scotland, created in 2006. The Welsh government has had responsibility for <b>trunk</b> <b>roads</b> in Wales since its establishment in 1998.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>trunk</b> <b>roads</b> {{were first}} defined for Great Britain in the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Roads</b> Act 1936. Thirty major roads were classed as <b>trunk</b> <b>roads</b> and the {{minister}} of transport took direct control of them and the bridges across them. The <b>Trunk</b> <b>Roads</b> Act came into force in England and Wales on 1 April 1937, and in Scotland on 16 May 1937. This development did not extend to Northern Ireland, which {{has always had a}} separate system of highway and road traffic law.|$|R
5|$|The A118 runs east to {{west from}} Stratford in East London to the Gallows Corner. At the Gallows Corner, the road intersects with the A127 road to Southend and the A12 <b>trunk</b> <b>road</b> between London and East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|The A125 runs {{north to}} south, from the A12 <b>trunk</b> <b>road</b> traffic lights with the B175, to the A1306 near Rainham. At Rush Green the road intersects with the A124 which runs from Canning Town to Upminster.|$|E
5|$|The A87 <b>trunk</b> <b>road</b> {{traverses}} {{the island}} from the Skye Bridge to Uig, linking {{most of the}} major settlements. Many of the island's roads have been widened in the past forty years although there are still substantial sections of single track road.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{interurban}} <b>trunk</b> <b>roads</b> are [...] "primary routes", {{the category}} of roads recommended for long distance and freight transport. Not all primary routes are <b>trunk</b> <b>roads,</b> the difference being that maintenance of <b>trunk</b> <b>roads</b> is paid for by national government bodies rather than the local councils in whose area they lie. Primary routes are identified by their direction signs, which feature white text on a green background with route numbers in yellow. <b>Trunk</b> <b>roads,</b> like other [...] "A" [...] roads, can be either single- or dual-carriageway.|$|R

25|$|<b>Trunk</b> <b>Roads</b> were broadly {{equivalent}} to the present National routes, and Link Roads to the present Regional roads. Most of the National Primary and National Secondary routes had been <b>Trunk</b> <b>Roads</b> and generally they followed the routes of these <b>Trunk</b> <b>Roads,</b> albeit with a different numbering system. However, some National Primary and Secondary routes also incorporated Link Roads and unclassified roads into their routes. After {{the introduction of the}} new road numbering system, some <b>Trunk</b> <b>Roads</b> (either in whole or in part) were downgraded to Regional roads, effectively 'de-trunked'.|$|R
5|$|The Grand <b>Trunk</b> <b>Road,</b> {{otherwise}} known as GT Road, is the original highway that links Faisalabad to most parts of Pakistan as well as neighbouring countries. GT Road was the main highway that ran through the district before {{the completion of the}} motorways.|$|E

5|$|A {{transportation}} study (the Bristol/Bath to South Coast Study) {{was published}} in 2004 after being initiated by the Government Office for the South West and Bath and North East Somerset Council.

Furthermore, many <b>Trunk</b> <b>Roads</b> were downgraded to Regional roads, effectively 'de-trunked'. Some newer National Primary routes were built as new roads in the 1990s and therefore did not incorporate former Trunk, Link or unclassified roads into their routes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trunk</b> <b>roads</b> linking {{major cities}} and towns {{in the country are}} called federal <b>trunk</b> <b>roads,</b> and are {{generally}} 2 lanes single carriageway roads, in places with a third climbing lane for slow lorries.|$|R
5|$|Communications within Wales are {{influenced}} by the topography and the mountainous nature of the country: the main rail and road routes between South and North Wales loop to the east and pass largely through England. The only motorway in Wales is the M4 motorway from London to South Wales, entering the country over the Second Severn Crossing, passing close to Newport, Cardiff and Swansea and extending as far west as the Pont Abraham services before continuing northwest as the A48 to Carmarthen. The A40 is a major <b>trunk</b> <b>road</b> connecting London to Fishguard via Brecon and Carmarthen. The A487 coast road links Cardigan with Aberystwyth, and the A44 links Aberystwyth with Rhayader, Leominster and Worcester. The main <b>trunk</b> <b>road</b> in North Wales is the A55 dual carriageway road from Chester past St Asaph and Abergele, continuing along the coast to Bangor, crossing Anglesey and terminating at Holyhead.|$|E
5|$|Navenby village lies at {{the eastern}} end of Navenby parish and is best {{accessed}} by road, as the A607 <b>trunk</b> <b>road</b> passes through the heart of the village. Navenby can also be reached from the A15 road, which runs past the end of Green Man Lane and links Lincoln with Sleaford. Editors of the website RoadGhosts.com claim {{this is one of the}} most haunted roads in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The A350 road is Poole town centre's main artery, running north along Holes Bay {{and on to}} the A35, and as {{a single}} {{carriageway}} to Bath and Bristol. To the east, the A337 road leads to Lymington and the New Forest. The A35 <b>trunk</b> <b>road</b> runs from Devon to Southampton and connects to the A31 {{on the outskirts of the}} town. The A31, the major <b>trunk</b> <b>road</b> in central southern England, connects to the M27 motorway at Southampton. From here the M3 motorway leads to London, and fast access may also be gained via the A34 to the M4 north of Newbury. Poole Bridge, a narrow bascule bridge constructed in 1927, connects the town centre and Hamworthy. Approval for a second bridge was given by the Department for Transport in 2006 and the £37million Twin Sails bridge was completed in 2012. A road link to Studland and the Isle of Purbeck across the narrow entrance of Poole Harbour is provided by the Sandbanks Ferry.|$|E

5|$|The Grand <b>Trunk</b> <b>Road</b> – {{connecting}} Chittagong in Bangladesh to Peshawar in Pakistan – {{has existed}} for over {{two and a half}} millennia. One of the important trade routes of the world, this road has been a strategic artery with fortresses, halting posts, wells, post offices, milestones and other facilities. Part of this road through Pakistan also coincided with the Silk Road.|$|E
5|$|The M32 is a <b>trunk</b> <b>road,</b> {{therefore}} its {{maintenance and}} upkeep is paid for by Highways England, the national roads authority. Most of the road has two lanes in each direction, though an extended sliproad north of junction 2 provides a climbing lane, and the short section between junction 1 and the M4 has three lanes both ways.|$|E
5|$|The nearby port of Scrabster {{provides}} ferry {{services to}} the Orkney Islands. The A9 <b>trunk</b> <b>road,</b> which connects Thurso to Inverness, Perth and the Central Belt ends at the ferry terminal.

It is the only motorway in Shropshire, and forms {{a vital part of the}} county's road network. The motorway handles an AADT of between 50,300 (J2-3) and 41,800 (J4-5) vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} urban {{settlement}} {{in the area of}} modern-day Dhaka dates to the first millennium.

The Grand <b>Trunk</b> <b>Road</b> passed through the region, connecting it with North India, Central Asia and the southeastern port city of Chittagong.|$|E
