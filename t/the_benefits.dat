5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. <b>The</b> <b>benefits</b> of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E

30|$|We {{also tested}} the {{hypothesis}} whether <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to completion {{in respect to}} four outcomes (employment, salary, occupational status, and further study) was associated with completion outcomes. The {{results show that the}} impact of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to completion is very limited, and in the area of a one percent impact on completion probability. Only <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to completion in terms of further study is slightly more pronounced with about a three percentage point increase in completion probability between first and third tertile of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to completion. These results showing a relative lack of impact of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to completion on the probability of completions were somewhat unexpected. Two limitations of these predictor variables should thus be considered. First, it would appear that it is somehow implied that individual students are aware of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of completing their course of study. This may not necessarily be the case and it can thus not be assumed that <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to completion plays a role in their decision making on whether or not to complete. Secondly, the way the variables indicating <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> to completion are constructed means that they represent <b>the</b> overall <b>benefit</b> to completion, rather than <b>the</b> net <b>benefit.</b> In other words, individual economic costs to obtain <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> are not taken into account. This represents a shortcoming of all <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> variables and is difficult to overcome with presently available data. In the future {{it might be possible to}} address this via a survey that collects data on individual’s time, effort, and financial input into their training.|$|R
50|$|Under <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> theory, tax {{levels are}} {{automatically}} determined, because taxpayers pay proportionately for <b>the</b> government <b>benefits</b> they receive.

These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on optimum currency areas argues {{that in the}} presence of countryspecific real shocks, the cost of fixing exchange rates is decreasing in the degree of trade openness. This study uses a stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model of endogenous specialization to assess <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of exchange rate flexibility. <b>The</b> <b>benefit</b> of exchange rate flexibility consists of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> along <b>the</b> extensive margin through adjustment in the composition of trade, and <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> along <b>the</b> intensive margin through adjustment in the relative prices.

40|$|This paper studies a new {{representation}} of individ~l preferences termed <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> function. <b>The</b> benetit function b(g; x,u) measures {{the amount that}} an individual is willing to trade, {{in terms of a}} specific reference commodity bundle g, for the opportunity to move from utility level a to a consumption bundle x. <b>The</b> <b>benefit</b> function is therefore a generalization of the willingness-to-pay concept. This paper studies properties of this function, including its continuity and structural properties and its indirect relation to the underlying utility function. A very important property of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> function is that it is the natural precursor of the expenditure function, {{in the sense that the}} expenditure function is a (special) dual of <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> function. This duality is shown to be complete by proving that when appropriate convexity properties hold, the (correspondingly special) dual of the expenditure function is, in fact, <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> function. <b>The</b> duality makes <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> function a powerful tool for analysis of welfare issues. 1...|$|R

5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
