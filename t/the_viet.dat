5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support from heavy artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 am, all tactical air support was called off in order to clear the way for B-52 strikes against Viet Cong formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong were in complete control of Lộc Ninh District.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00pm on 6 February 1965, about 300 Viet Cong {{soldiers}} of the 30th Company assembled at their positions outside Camp Holloway, where they began breaking through the wire fences. However, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong's mission nearly turned into a disaster when their combat engineers accidentally tripped an electrical wire after breaking through the third fence barrier, but the U.S. Military Police patrolling the area did not detect it. At 1:50am on 7 February 1965, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong attackers opened fire with their AK-47 rifles, having successfully penetrated Camp Holloway. Shortly afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong mortared the airfield and the U.S. advisory compound, while the sections of the 30th Company attacked their respective targets with small arms fire. About five minutes later, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong began retreating from the facility. Later that morning <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong claimed victory, having caused the death of eight U.S. soldiers, and another 126 wounded. In addition, ten aircraft were destroyed and 15 more were damaged.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong {{had won a}} clear {{victory over}} the regular units of the South Vietnamese army, they did not get away with light casualties. After the battle, a {{combined}} total of 126 Viet Cong bodies were recovered within the Special Forces compound and the district headquarters, and several hundred more were strewn all over the battlefield. Indeed, individual Viet Cong soldiers usually spare no efforts to evacuate their dead or wounded comrades; but as military operations were conducted during the rainy season, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong struggled to evacuate all their casualties from the battlefield as conditions on the main roads deteriorated. Despite the minor setbacks, the Đồng Xoài campaign marked the rapid maturity of <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 9th Division as a fighting force. For their efforts during the battle, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 272nd Regiment received the title of 'Đồng Xoài Regiment' to mark their achievements.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the initial stages in their campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong forces were ordered to regroup and prepare for the next offensive in the Long Khánh region. Viet Cong soldiers from the two regiments were assembled in War Zone D, where they were trained to attack well-fortified enemy strongholds. On November 20, 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong reached the Long Khánh battlefield, having completed a 200 kilometres march from War Zone D. On the battlefield <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 186th Battalion (from Military Region 5), the 500th and 800th Battalions (from Military Region 7), and the 445th Company also joined the offensive. To kick-start their offensive in the Baria-Long Khánh region, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong selected Bình Giã as their next target.

5|$|In July 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 271st and 272nd Regiments, {{began moving}} into the provinces of Bình Dương, Bình Long and Phước Long {{to carry out their}} mission.

Between August and September 1964, Viet Cong regiments executed deep thrusts into Bình Dương and Châu Thành to apply additional pressure on South Vietnamese outposts situated on Route 14. During the second phase of their campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong ambushed two South Vietnamese infantry companies and destroyed five armoured vehicles, which consisted of M24 Chaffee light tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers. <b>The</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong defeated regular ARVN units at the strategic hamlets of Bình Mỹ and Bình Co.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, the National Liberation Front's Military Region 2 ordered <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 261st Battalion and the 514th Battalion, {{the home}} {{battalion}} of Dinh Tuong Province, {{to destroy the}} strategic hamlets in their region {{and at the same}} time to attack South Vietnamese sweeping operations. Between 28–30 December 1962, an American aircraft equipped with eavesdropping equipment located a Viet Cong radio transmitter. It intercepted radio signals in the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province where the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was headquartered. The radio intercept and other information obtained by Jim Drummond, Vann's intelligence officer, indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong were using Ap Tan Thoi as a headquarters location. Furthermore, South Vietnamese and American intelligence personnel believed <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong had deployed a reinforced company of about 120 men to protect the transmitter. Certain that <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong unit was no larger than the reported number, the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was instructed to attack Ap Tan Thoi.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 5 April, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong's 5th Division launched another major ground assault on Lộc Ninh from the west to try {{to break through the}} defenses of the southern compound. American AC-130 and AH-1 Cobra gunships stopped <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong formations in their tracks, as supporting North Vietnamese tanks were either destroyed or forced to pull back. Despite having suffered many casualties as a result of U.S. air strikes, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong continued their assaults well into the evening. In order to deal with the onslaught, Smith continued to direct the AC-130 Spectres against targets around Lộc Ninh. Vinh, on the other hand, was either planning to surrender or desert when he ordered two of his soldiers to open the gates of the command compound at around 10 pm. Throughout the night, the North Vietnamese 69th Artillery Command continued bombarding South Vietnamese positions around Lộc Ninh, as <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong massed for another assault.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of June 9, 1965, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong made final {{preparations}} for their assault on Đồng Xoài. While <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong assembled their formations, U.S.-led forces inside the Special Forces Camp were suddenly placed on alert, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong to commence their attack 70 minutes earlier than scheduled. At 11:30pm Viet Cong heavy mortar rounds began to fall on South Vietnamese and American positions around Đồng Xoài, soon followed by an infantry assault led by the 272nd Regiment. During the initial assault, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong sustained heavy casualties {{as they tried to}} navigate through the surrounding minefields and barb wire fences, which they had failed to pick up during previous reconnaissance missions. At about 1:30am, two helicopter gunships from the U.S. Army's 118th Aviation Company were dispatched to support the Special Forces Camp, they fired on <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong around the compound, and returned to base only after their weapons load was emptied. At around 2:30am, the Americans {{and a few of the}} Cambodian soldiers retreated to the district headquarters, where other local troops were holding out. Meanwhile, at Biên Hòa Air Base, all flight crews of the 118th Aviation Company were on the flightline preparing for combat assault at first light. By that time, however, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong had captured the Special Forces compound, and they began massing for an attack on the district headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Since May 1965, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong {{offensive}} in Phước Long Province {{had been in}} full-swing.

Simultaneously, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 272nd Regiment overran South Vietnamese government positions in the sub-sector of Phước Bình. During their brief occupation of Phước Long district, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong destroyed several major strategic hamlets in the surrounding areas, such as Ba Ra, Thuan Kiem, Thuan Loi, Phu Rieng, Da Kia, Bu Dop, Duc Bon and Song Be.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle of}} Bình Giã {{reflected}} <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong's growing military strength and influence, {{especially in the}} Mekong Delta region.

5|$|The {{highway to}} Xuyen Moc {{in the east}} had been reopened by the Australians in March and April, and with <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 275th Regiment {{believed}} to have been severely weakened following Long Tan, a series of operations aimed at destroying <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 274th Regiment were subsequently launched by 1 ATF. Australian assessments of <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 275th Regiment were seemingly reinforced by its unsuccessful attempt to ambush a convoy from US 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment (11 ACR) on 2 December 1966. Meanwhile, after Westmoreland had again pressed Vincent on what he saw as the limited results achieved by Australian tactics, a large joint US-Australian operation was mounted against the May Tao mountains in Phuoc Tuy, moving against the communist bases in the area. The largest search and destroy operation mounted by the Australians to that point, Operation Paddington (9–15 July) was carried out in co-operation with American and South Vietnamese units based in Bien Hoa province, and targeted <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 5th Division.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong {{commenced}} {{a series}} of large-scale military operations against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), as ordered by the North Vietnamese government.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong.

5|$|By that stage, Vann was {{frustrated}} by the Civil Guard soldiers of Task Force B, because {{they appeared to be}} in no hurry to reach Ap Bac, as they searched one house at a time while marching up from the southwest flank of the battlefield. In his final effort to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong, Vann flew into Tan Hiep and asked Cao to deploy an airborne battalion {{on the east side of}} Ap Bac, the most logical retreat route for <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong. Vann hoped to trap <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong inside the hamlets by blocking their retreat routes on all sides, and annihilate them using an elite battalion of South Vietnamese paratroopers. To Vann's disappointment, Cao strongly opposed the idea and decided to drop one of his airborne battalions behind the M113 formation on the west side instead. Vann accused Cao of wanting to let <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong escape in order to avoid further South Vietnamese casualties. However, Cao argued that a surrounded and well-entrenched enemy would fight more fiercely than a retreating one, so he wanted <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong units inside the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi to expose themselves by retreating through the eastern side of the battlefield, where he could destroy them with artillery and air power. Cao had also lost confidence in Vann, because Cao felt Vann had placed the lives of many South Vietnamese soldiers at risk to save the lives of a handful of Americans. Major-General Tran Thien Khiem, Chief of the ARVN Joint General Staff, was present during the argument. He did not object to Cao's plan because it was consistent with President Diem's objective to save Vietnamese lives through the Rural Revolutionary Development and Chieu Hoi Programs, which encouraged Viet Cong fighters to join the South Vietnamese military.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the optimistic}} Australian {{assessments}} of Viet Cong capability, {{rather than having}} left Phuoc Tuy the communists were more likely reinforcing and consolidating in preparation for future operations, avoiding battle with the Australians {{in order to preserve}} their strength. Regardless, D445 Battalion had suffered heavy casualties and posed a diminished threat, while the headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 5th Division was located near the northern border, west of the May Tao mountains, with its fighting formations widely dispersed. <b>The</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 275th Regiment was reported to have moved north to War Zone D for retraining and refitting, and <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 274th Regiment had moved from its scattered locations in the north-west Hat Dich to replace it in the north-east of the province, and was now operating in unfamiliar terrain. Meanwhile, casualties, illness and poor local recruitment meant they were now largely reliant on reinforcements from North Vietnam. Unsure of the next move, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 5th Division adopted a cautious posture, with only the 1st Battalion, 275th Regiment remaining in the May Tao mountains while the 274th Regiment dispersed east of Route 2 {{for the remainder of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months of 1967, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong absorbed heavy losses as a result of {{large-scale}} search and destroy missions conducted by the United States Army, and it prompted North Vietnamese leaders to review their war strategy in South Vietnam. In light of the setbacks which North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces had experienced early in 1967, North Vietnamese General Trần Văn Trà suggested that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces could still be victorious if they inflicted as many casualties as possible on U.S. military units, hoping that the Americans would conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from Vietnam. Thus, towards mid-1967, <b>the</b> <b>Viet</b> Cong 7th and 9th Divisions returned to the battlefield again, with the objective of inflicting casualties on U.S. military formations in III Corps Tactical Zone.
