5|$|Anyone {{can apply}} for time on the telescope; there are no {{restrictions}} on nationality or academic affiliation, but funding for analysis is only available to US institutions. Competition for time on the <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> intense, with about one-fifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} is {{no longer}} used for research purposes, though the <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> still used as a teaching tool in the university's astronomy classes. In addition, a University of Illinois student astronomy organization uses the telescope. The observatory dome underwent a renovation that included repainting in 1996.|$|E
50|$|However, {{all these}} {{advantages}} do {{come with a}} price. Space <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> much more expensive to build than ground-based telescopes. Due to their location, space <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> also extremely difficult to maintain. The Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>was</b> serviced by the Space Shuttle while many other space <b>telescopes</b> cannot <b>be</b> serviced at all.|$|R
25|$|The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Charles Husband at the instigation of Bernard Lovell, with design work starting around September 1960. Funding {{for the construction}} of the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> requested on the 19 December 1960, and the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> operational by the summer of 1964.|$|R
50|$|The One Mile <b>Telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} by the Radio Astronomy Group of Cambridge University in 1964. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> used to produce the 5C catalogue of radio sources.|$|R
5|$|The Rooftop <b>Telescope</b> <b>is</b> a 9.5-inch {{refractor}} {{that was}} originally constructed in 1894 by Warner and Swasey {{for their own}} use. The telescope was the first instrument of the Warner and Swasey Observatory and was originally used at the Taylor Road facility, but was put into storage when the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University was relocated to the A. W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the telescope was reinstalled in a new dome {{on the roof of}} the A. W. Smith building.|$|E
5|$|The nickel {{hydrogen}} battery {{was used}} {{for the first time in}} 1977 aboard the U.S. Navy's Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2). For example, the ISS, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Global Surveyor are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries. In the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>is</b> also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009, more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond their design life.|$|E
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} to provide the most reliable results possible by minimising any factor which could affect the images produced, for example the 11 m tower where the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> situated was mechanically isolated to prevent vibrations {{from the rest of}} the building affecting the equipment. [...] The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> inside a large upside-down dome which served as a ground shield to minimise interfering thermal radiation from the earth.|$|R
50|$|Many space <b>telescopes</b> have <b>been</b> launched. , over 20 <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> {{known to}} be operational.|$|R
5000|$|The two QUIJOTE <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> {{placed at}} the Teide Observatory, run by the Spanish Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC). Both <b>telescopes</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by the IDOM company in Spain.|$|R
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
25|$|The European Space Agency's Gaia space <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> launched.|$|E
25|$|The 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt <b>Telescope</b> <b>is</b> {{actively}} {{working on}} a new sky survey, the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF).|$|E
50|$|Also in 1891, Patrick Alexander {{acquired}} an 8 in aperture refractor <b>telescope</b> which <b>was</b> erected in Bath. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> a substantial instrument, which together with its mounting, must have weighed several tons. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> fully equipped for astronomical observations and Patrick {{was a member}} of the Royal Astronomical Society until 1921. Although he enjoyed showing his telescope to friends and distinguished visitors, any interest he had in astronomy was overshadowed by his other passions; the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> probably a scientific toy. Barry Bellinger suggests that the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> used to track pilot balloons released into the air, before releasing any main balloons; however, a telescope of this size and type seems unsuited to such a task.|$|R
500|$|When the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> proposed, {{a series}} of {{objectives}} for the <b>telescope's</b> observations <b>were</b> set out. These included: ...|$|R
5000|$|Three {{categories}} of <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> available from Tasco - Novice, Luminova, and Spacestation. Each family has several models. The Novice family features the most economical telescopes using manual focus and view finding, while {{the high end}} Spacestation utilizes fully automated sky-mapping, [...] "GoTo" [...] technology. Magnification ranges of the <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> advertised as between 25 and 675 power. Both reflecting telescopes and refracting <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> available in each category.|$|R
25|$|The Arecibo Observatory, until July 2016 the world's largest radio <b>telescope,</b> <b>is</b> located here. Arecibo is {{the seat}} of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arecibo.|$|E
25|$|The 60-inch <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} a variety of {{projects}} including follow-up observations for the Palomar Transient Factory and is a rapid response telescope for gamma-ray bursts.|$|E
25|$|A typical size of {{the single}} antenna of a radio <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> 25 meters. Dozens of radio telescopes with {{comparable}} sizes are operated in radio observatories all over the world.|$|E
50|$|In 1891, Patrick Alexander {{ordered the}} {{telescope}} from the well-known Victorian telescope makers Thomas and Howard Grubb of Dublin {{with all the}} usual fittings associated with a professional instrument of the time. It is not entirely clear where the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> first installed, accounts vary. It is probable that the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> first erected at one of Patrick Alexander's several private workshops in Bath: either 'DeMontalat Wood' or 'The Mount'. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> a substantial instrument, which together with its mounting, must have weighed several tons. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> fully equipped for astronomical observations and Patrick became a fellow member of the Royal Astronomical Society up until 1921. Although he enjoyed showing his telescope to friends and distinguished visitors, any interest he had in astronomy was overshadowed by his other aviation related passions â€” especially ballooning; the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> probably a scientific toy. Barry Bellinger suggests that the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> used to track pilot balloons released into the air, before releasing any main balloons; however, a telescope of this size and type seems ill-suited to such a task.|$|R
50|$|On {{the basis}} of Archenhold's plans, the world's longest moving refracting <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> built with a focal length of 21 meters. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> part of the Great Industrial Exposition of Berlin. The giant <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} in Treptow, a suburb of Berlin. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{opened to the public}} on 1 May 1896 in a temporary wooden structure which was completed in September. By 1908 Archenhold had raised the funds to replace the wooden structure with the building that stands today. Some of the funds came from admission fees to lectures but he also was able to secure funds from the Scottish American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.|$|R
50|$|The Magellan <b>Telescopes</b> <b>are</b> {{a pair of}} 6.5 m (21.3 ft) {{diameter}} optical telescopes {{located at}} Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The two <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> named after the astronomer Walter Baade and the philanthropist Landon T. Clay.|$|R
25|$|In {{gestation}} since 1996, {{it is part}} of NASA's Flagship program. The <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} James E. Webb, the second administrator of NASA, who played an integral role in the Apollo program.|$|E
25|$|A 25-meter-diameter radio <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Chichijima, {{one of the}} {{stations}} of the very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) project, and is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.|$|E

50|$|The Great Melbourne <b>Telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{built by}} Thomas Grubb in Dublin, Ireland in 1868, and {{installed}} at the Melbourne Observatory in Melbourne, Australia in 1869. In 1945 that Observatory closed and the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> sold {{and moved to the}} Mount Stromlo Observatory near Canberra. It was rebuilt in the late 1950s. In 2003 the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> practically destroyed in a severe bush fire, but a project to restore it to working condition is under way.|$|R
50|$|The observatory's main <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> a 1.6 m {{reflecting}} telescope. The primary instrument {{attached to}} the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> a fiber-fed, cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph. Astronomers used this instrument to study chromospherically active stars, binary stars, and pre-main sequence stars.|$|R
50|$|Funding for the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{obtained}} in 1963 from the DSIR. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> designed by Husband and Co. consulting engineers, and was constructed by Fairey Engineering. It started observations in July 1967. The <b>telescope</b> could <b>be</b> controlled either locally, or by remote control over UHF and microwave links from Jodrell Bank Observatory (normally the latter).|$|R
25|$|A 60-inch {{reflecting}} <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} the Oscar Mayer Building. It was dedicated in 1970 {{to take some of}} the load off of the Hale Telescope. This telescope was used to discover the first brown dwarf star.|$|E
25|$|A {{supermassive black}} hole, created from {{the merger of}} the black holes {{at the center of}} two merging galaxies {{detected}} by the Hubble <b>telescope,</b> <b>is</b> theorized to have been ejected from the merger center by gravitational waves.|$|E
25|$|The Harvard-Smithsonian {{group is}} now {{building}} a dedicated all-sky optical survey system {{along the lines}} of that described above, featuring a 1.8-meter (72-inch) telescope. The new optical SETI survey <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> being set up at the Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|The first {{relatively}} large Schmidt <b>telescopes</b> <b>were</b> built at Hamburg Observatory and Palomar Observatory {{shortly before the}} Second World War. Between 1945 and 1980, about 8 more large (1 meter or larger) Schmidt <b>telescopes</b> <b>were</b> built around the world.|$|R
500|$|A Polar Axis <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{built at}} Jodrell Bank in 1962. This had a {{circular}} 50ft (15.2m) dish on a polar mount, and was mostly used for moon radar experiments. It {{has since been}} decommissioned. There has also <b>been</b> an optical <b>telescope</b> at the observatory; an [...] reflecting optical <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> donated to the observatory in 1951. However, this <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> not used much, and was in turn donated to the Salford Astronomical Society around 1971.|$|R
50|$|The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> modernised in 2000 and 2001 {{to include}} the {{experimental}} use of Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) which are 40 times more sensitive than standard photography.The Uppsala Schmidt <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> the instrument used by the Siding Spring Survey to conduct the only professional search for dangerous asteroids being made in the Southern Hemisphere. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> de-commissioned by the ANU late in 2013 and the Siding Spring Survey near-Earth object search program closed down after funding dried up.|$|R
