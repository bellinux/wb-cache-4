5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at <b>the</b> <b>gates,</b> the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at <b>the</b> <b>gates,</b> the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at <b>the</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|E

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} {{a reduction in}} <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs by suppressing gate edge silicidation. We found that the silicidation of Ni in <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> edge during formation of the SiN passivation film caused a lower work function and increased <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current. A NiOx barrier layer inserted between <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> electrode and passivation film prevented silicidation of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> metal and drastically reduced <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current. We also determined that silicidation was prevented by a higher oxidation rate of NiOx. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current was attributed to both <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> edge and Schottky junction. Moreover, we confirmed no initial degradation in a DC stress test at high temperature. These results indicate that suppressing NiSi formation has {{a key role in}} reducing <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> leakage current...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> bump <b>gate</b> {{self-closing}} mechanism {{consists of}} two cables mounted on <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> and also on an elevated crossbar. <b>The</b> <b>gate</b> does not swing on a conventional hinge.

After <b>the</b> vehicle passes through, gravity causes <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to swing like a pendulum (parallel to the ground) until it settles in the closed position.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the principles, {{measurement}} techniques, {{and analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> delay of high-electron-mobility-transistors (HEMTs) mainly based on an InP material system are discussed. In the measurement techniques, de-embedding of the pad parasitics is also described. The intrinsic part of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> delay of HEMTs is the transit time for electrons to travel in <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> depletion region. When <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> length is large enough, <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>gate</b> delay is dominant in <b>the</b> total <b>gate</b> delay. However, as <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> length becomes less than 100 nm, the delay analysis reveals that <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>gate</b> delay is now no longer dominant but <b>the</b> parasitic <b>gate</b> delay ascribed to the resistance and capacitance out of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> region. Based on these results, ways for further improvement of the frequency response are also discussed...|$|R
