5|$|As the war {{had ended}} with the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under the Articles of Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect <b>to</b> <b>Vermont,</b> Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined. Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{appeared}} before the Continental Congress as early as September 1778 on behalf of Vermont, seeking recognition as an independent state. He reported that due to Vermont's expansion to include border towns from New Hampshire, Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood <b>to</b> <b>Vermont.</b> Between 1780 and 1783 Allen participated, along with his brother Ira, Vermont Governor Thomas Chittenden, and others, in negotiations with Frederick Haldimand, the governor of Quebec, that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges, but were really about establishing Vermont as a new British province and gaining military protection for its residents. The negotiations, once details of them were published, were often described by opponents of Vermont statehood as treasonous, but no such formal charges were ever laid against anyone involved.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was born}} oldest of nine {{children}} in Barnet, {{a town in}} Caledonia County in northeastern Vermont, and {{spent much of his}} childhood in Rhode Island. In his autobiography, Senator from Vermont, Flanders described life on his family’s subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, before he left to work in the machine tool industry for most of his career. In his first years as a machinist and draftsman, he spent his vacations traveling by bicycle over country roads between Rhode Island and Vermont and New Hampshire. Later, he lived for a time in New York City where he edited a machine tool magazine, but after five years decided to move back <b>to</b> <b>Vermont.</b> In 1911, he married Helen Edith Hartness, daughter of inventor and industrialist James Hartness. They made their home in Springfield, Vermont, where Flanders became president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company. Flanders and his wife had three children: Elizabeth (born 1912), Anna (also known as Nancy—born 1918), and James (born 1923).|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways without a posted route number {{were given a}} signed designation for the first time. The Altona–Chazy Landing state highway was designated as NY191. At its east end, the route connected <b>to</b> <b>Vermont</b> RouteF-2 on Isle La Motte {{by way of a}} ferry across part of Lake Champlain. The ferry was discontinued in 1937; however, the endpoints of NY191 remained unchanged. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of all of NY191 was transferred from the state of New York to Clinton County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The entirety of the highway was designated as CR23 by Clinton County and NY191 was truncated to consist only of the portion of the route between Sciota and Chazy. The route was decommissioned on March 18, 2015.|$|E

5|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. Two of the routes assigned at this time were NY6, a north–south route extending from the New York City line to the Canadian border, and NY30, another north–south route connecting NY6 in Mechanicville to the Vermont state line west of Fair Haven. NY6 left Albany on modern NY32 and followed it to Mechanicville, where NY6 veered westward on what is now NY67 and NY30 picked up the current alignment of NY32. NY30 continued north on modern NY32 to Glens Falls, at which point it went east to Hudson Falls via Warren and River streets. It headed northward from there <b>to</b> <b>Vermont</b> on modern US4. From Mechanicville to Schuylerville, NY30 utilized the alignment of legislative Route44. By 1926, NY30 was rerouted north of Whitehall to continue north toward the Canadian border. The old alignment of NY30 between Whitehall and Vermont was not assigned a new number. Meanwhile, an alternate route of NY6 {{on the east side}} of the Hudson River between NY5 (now US20) in East Greenbush and NY6 in Waterford was designated as NY6B by 1926.|$|E
