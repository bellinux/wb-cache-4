5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{is one of}} twelve cranial nerves found in amniotes including reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> or nerve pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or lapping water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, {{and then to the}} affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> have been explored through studies of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> in rodents and reptiles. <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate nerve over the course of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> of the fourth arch {{gives rise to the}} superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> only <b>nerves</b> {{containing}} SVE fibers are cranial nerves: <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> (V), <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve</b> (VII), <b>the</b> glossopharyngeal <b>nerve</b> (IX), <b>the</b> vagus <b>nerve</b> (X) and <b>the</b> accessory <b>nerve</b> (XI).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>nerves</b> {{supplying}} <b>the</b> {{shoulder joint}} all {{arise in the}} brachial plexus. They are <b>the</b> suprascapular <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> axillary <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> lateral pectoral <b>nerve.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> cranial <b>nerves</b> {{that contain}} GVA fibers include <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> {{glossopharyngeal}} <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> vagus <b>nerve.</b>|$|R
5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of <b>the</b> <b>nerve.</b> These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> by an artery as <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{entrapment}} {{occurs at}} specific anatomic locations. Familiarity with the anatomy and the {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) features of nerve entrapment syndromes is important for accurate diagnosis and early treatment of entrapment neuropathies. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to illustrate the normal anatomy of peripheral <b>nerves</b> in <b>the</b> upper and lower limbs and to review the MRI features of common disorders affecting <b>the</b> peripheral <b>nerves,</b> both compressive/entrapment and noncompressive, involving <b>the</b> suprascapular <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> axillary <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> radial <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> ulnar <b>nerve,</b> and <b>the</b> median verve in the upper limb and <b>the</b> sciatic <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> common peroneal <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> tibial <b>nerve,</b> and <b>the</b> interdigital <b>nerves</b> in <b>the</b> lower limb...|$|R
5000|$|The {{branches}} {{are listed}} below. Most branch from the cords, {{but a few}} branch (indicated in italics) directly from earlier structures. The five on the left are considered [...] "terminal branches". These terminal branches are <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> axillary <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> radial <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> median <b>nerve,</b> and <b>the</b> ulnar <b>nerve.</b> Due to both emerging from the lateral cord <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> median <b>nerve</b> are well connected. <b>The</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve</b> has even been shown to send a branch to <b>the</b> median <b>nerve</b> further connecting them.There have been several variations reported in the branching pattern but these are very rare.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> cranial <b>nerves</b> {{containing}} GVE fibers include <b>the</b> oculomotor <b>nerve</b> (CN III), <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve</b> (CN VII), <b>the</b> glossopharyngeal <b>nerve</b> (CN IX) and <b>the</b> vagus <b>nerve</b> (CN X).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> cells of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin sheath by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> {{is a major}} {{branch of}} the sacral plexus, with fibers {{originating}} in Onuf's nucleus in the sacral region of the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} leading causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E
50|$|Tissue {{damage to}} <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> that support <b>the</b> tongue can cause ageusia, {{especially}} damage to <b>the</b> lingual <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> glossopharyngeal <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> lingual <b>nerve</b> passes {{taste for the}} front two-thirds of the tongue and <b>the</b> glossopharyngeal <b>nerve</b> passes taste for the back third of the tongue. <b>The</b> lingual <b>nerve</b> can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{lacrimal}} <b>nerve,</b> {{derived from}} <b>the</b> ophthalmic <b>nerve,</b> supplies <b>the</b> sensory {{component of the}} lacrimal gland. <b>The</b> greater petrosal <b>nerve,</b> derived from <b>the</b> facial <b>nerve,</b> supplies <b>the</b> parasympathetic autonomic component of the lacrimal gland. <b>The</b> greater petrosal <b>nerve</b> traverses alongside branches of the V1 and V2 divisions of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> proximity of <b>the</b> greater petrosal <b>nerve</b> to branches of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> explains <b>the</b> phenomenon of lesions to <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> causing impaired lacrimation although <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> does not supply the lacrimal gland.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> nasociliary <b>nerve</b> is {{a branch}} of <b>the</b> {{ophthalmic}} <b>nerve</b> (CN V1; one of three branches of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve</b> a.k.a. CN V). It is intermediate in size between the two other main branches of <b>the</b> ophthalmic <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> frontal <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> lacrimal <b>nerve,</b> and is more deeply placed.|$|R
5|$|Any {{electrical}} current generates a magnetic field; neural oscillations induce weak magnetic fields, and in functional magnetoencephalography the current produced can show localised brain function in high resolution. Tractography uses MRI and image analysis to create 3D images of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> tracts of the brain. Connectograms give a graphical {{representation of the}} neural connections of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E
5|$|In Ortner's {{syndrome}} or cardiovocal syndrome, a rare {{cause of}} left recurrent laryngeal nerve , expansion of structures within the heart or major blood vessels impinges upon <b>the</b> <b>nerve,</b> causing symptoms of unilateral nerve injury.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> pudendal <b>nerve</b> {{may vary}} in its origins. For example, <b>the</b> pudendal <b>nerve</b> may {{actually}} originate off of <b>the</b> sciatic <b>nerve.</b> [...] Consequently, damage to <b>the</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> can affect <b>the</b> pudendal <b>nerve</b> as well. Sometimes dorsal rami of <b>the</b> first sacral <b>nerve</b> contribute fibers to <b>the</b> pudendal <b>nerve,</b> {{and even more}} rarely [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{upper lip}} {{receives}} its sensibility from <b>the</b> infraorbital <b>nerve,</b> {{which is a}} branch of the maxillary division of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> infraorbita <b>nerve</b> provides sensation to the upper lip, cheek, ala, and nasal sidewall. The sensory innervation of the lower lip is provided by <b>the</b> mental <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> mental <b>nerve</b> is <b>the</b> terminal branch of <b>the</b> inferior alveolar <b>nerve,</b> which in turn is {{a branch of the}} mandibular division of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{anterior}} labial <b>nerves</b> are {{branches of}} <b>the</b> ilioinguinal <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> equivalent <b>nerves</b> in <b>the</b> male are <b>the</b> anterior scrotal <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> was severed. Injury to <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Inside the pudendal canal, <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> divides into branches, first {{giving off}} the {{inferior}} rectal nerve, then the perineal nerve, before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis (in males) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (in females).|$|E
5|$|It's my {{definitive}} {{statement in}} regards to the incredible pay-back I've received for having <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> to talk about the things that I did {{in the past few years}} with my Sex book and my record. It's getting it off my chest. It is defensive, absolutely. But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{anterior}} scrotal <b>nerves</b> are {{branches of}} <b>the</b> ilioinguinal <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nerves</b> innervates <b>the</b> scrotum in males.The equivalent <b>nerves</b> in <b>the</b> female are <b>the</b> anterior labial <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> brain, where <b>nerve</b> fibers obliquely cross {{from one}} lateral {{part to the}} other, {{that is to say}} they cross at a level other than their origin. See for {{examples}} Decussation of pyramids and sensory decussation. Decussation describes the point where <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> cross {{from one side of the}} brain to the other, and typically <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> from <b>the</b> left side of the body decussate to the right side of the brain and <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> from <b>the</b> right side of the body decussate to the left brain, however depending on the function of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>the</b> level of decussation is variable.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> mylohyoid <b>nerve</b> {{branches}} from <b>the</b> inferior alveolar <b>nerve</b> (a {{branch of}} <b>the</b> mandibular <b>nerve,</b> <b>the</b> third part of <b>the</b> trigeminal <b>nerve)</b> {{just before it}} enters the mandibular foramen.|$|R
5|$|Operation Grand Slam {{begins with}} Pussy Galore's Flying Circus {{spraying}} the gas over Fort Knox. However, Bond had seduced Galore and convinced her to replace <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> gas with a harmless substance and alert the US government about Goldfinger's plan. The military personnel of Fort Knox play dead {{until they are}} certain that they can prevent the criminals from escaping.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{otic vesicle}} in turn form the vestibulocochlear nerve. These form bipolar neurons which supply {{sensation}} {{to parts of}} the inner ear (namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals, macular of the utricle and saccule, and organ of Corti). <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> begins to form around the 28th day.|$|E
5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> is affected. If the part of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
50|$|The parietal pleura is {{innervated by}} <b>the</b> {{intercostal}} <b>nerves</b> and <b>the</b> phrenic <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> costal pleura is innervated by <b>the</b> intercostal <b>nerves.</b> <b>The</b> diaphragmatic {{portion of the}} parietal pleura overlies the diaphragm and is innervated by <b>the</b> phrenic <b>nerve</b> in its central portion and by <b>the</b> intercostal <b>nerves</b> in its peripheral portion.
