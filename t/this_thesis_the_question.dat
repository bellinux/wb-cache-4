40|$|In <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> in {{what way}} the Sino-Russian {{relationship}} {{is most likely to}} move as a result of developments in the energy sector is explored. The answer is sought by using the theories of Multi-level Governance and Complex Interdependence to analyse the military, ideological and economic dimensions of the relationship. Scenarios are used to put this information into perspective and assess in which direction Sino-Russian relations are likely to develop. It is concluded that while at first glance the Chinese and Russian energy sectors seem highly compatible very little cooperation between both states has materialised. Extrapolating the current situation by using scenarios yielded the result that China and Russia are unlikely to become intertwined in the near future. It is most likely that the relationship will develop into a form of ‘strategic tension’ where the relationship will characterised by joint ideological statements but very little actual integration or engagement. ...|$|E

First, we identify {{the class of}} perturbations for which the system remains controllable thereby stabilizable by the same feedback law as for the nominal system. That is, sufficient conditions are presented that guarantee stabilizability of the perturbed system given that the unperturbed system has similar properties. Secondly, we present a methodology for designing feedback controllers such that the feedback system is stable. It is shown that exponential stability {{can be achieved by}} choice of suitable additional state feedback controls even in the presence of unbounded and nonlinear perturbations. Both deterministic and stochastic systems are considered. Finally, we apply these stabilization results to a simplified SCOLE model proposed by NASA. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the impact of perturbations on the performance of the space structures and the effectiveness of the stabilizing control...|$|E

In <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how circular economy business models can contribute to make the clothing business more sustainable is investigated. Two small companies in Jämtland, Sweden, are used as case studies. Case A, Rent-a-Plagg, is renting outdoor wear on a ski resort. By providing the possibility to get access instead of ownership they make their customers avoid an unsustainable consumption pattern. This decreases the resource flows through a displacement effect in avoided production. Case B, Saiboo is producing healthcare work wear and they run a research project that aims for developing new technologies to recycle textile fibres. If such technology comes out successfully enough to become realised in a large scale, that could be a big game changer for the clothing sector. These companies are circular in different ways and all forms of circularity will be needed in the future for improving all steps in the waste hierarchy and design out waste...|$|E
40|$|In <b>this</b> <b>thesis,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of {{optimal control}} system design when {{constrained}} to using a stable controller is addressed. The performance index that is minimized is H∞-norm of {{the sensitivity of}} the closed-loop system to external disturbances. It is shown that the resulting feedback associated with the minimum value of the optimality criterion is irrational. A design algorithm is developed to find an approximation whose deviation from a sub-optimal controller lies within a pre-specified error bound, thus guaranteeing internal stability. For multivariable systems, a characterization is provided of all sensitivity functions that result from a stable controller; and two important special cases are solved for optimality. Next, the problem of finding the H 2 -optimal stable feedback controller for a general optimality criterion is considered. It is shown that this optimization reduces to finding the "best" function in RH 2 (i. e. of minimum norm) that satisfies an avoidance constraint. A design procedure is proposed for obtaining an optimal stable controller that minimizes the performance index and maintains internal stability. Given an initial point, this is achieved by minimizing a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear inequality constraints via a sequential gradient programming method...|$|E

40|$|In <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how {{the social}} factors of language, {{education}} and territorial concentration influence the seeking of voice at the center and/or at the periphery. This question was asked {{in the context of}} Ethiopia with a specific focus on one of its multi-ethnic regions, Benishangul-Gumuz by qualitatively assessing the documented evidence of the respective groups’ voice seeking behaviors. The analysis of the Ethiopian Constitution as well as the country’s distinct history implied that the selected social variables -interacting with the constitutional provisions of Amarigna as a central language, partially weak guarantees for group representation and the constitutional promise of self-rule- might influence the voice-seeking behavior of groups differently. Firstly, groups not speaking the official language as their mother tongue tend to concentrate their voice-seeking efforts in the periphery. Secondly, groups with lower educational levels appear to be more likely to demand proportionality in institutions not subject to guaranteed group representation, whereas higher educated groups tend to at least not support such demands. Finally, territorially concentrated groups potentially controlling their own territory seem to be more likely to seek a greater group voice whilst more dispersed groups sharing their territory tend to refrain from doing so...|$|E
40|$|In <b>this</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> will be {{answered}} why women, between 1730 and 1811 in the Dutch Republic, {{were less likely}} to be convicted for same-sex offenses than men. Moreover, it will be discussed what sodomy actually entailed and if women were included in this term, and secondly why these female convictions were so late in comparison to the male convictions. In the eighteenth century male sodomites were increasingly prosecuted because of a changing perception of gender. The ‘one-sex model’ in which male sodomites could sleep with both boys and women evolved into a ‘two-sex model’ wherein the effeminate sodomite failed to act according to the two genders: male or female. In the case of the Dutch Republic sodomites were accused of causing the downfall of the Republic and with their hedonistic behaviour bringing down the wrath of God on them. Literature suggests that female same-sex acts were not perceived as that damaging. Other reasons for the lack of female same-sex convictions was the absence of one central law code, the different definition people in the Dutch Republic gave to the word sodomite and the difficulty to prove that someone was a sodomite...|$|E

In the context of this thesis the term digital tabletop refers to an emerging class of devices that afford many novel ways of interaction with the digital. Allowing users to directly touch information presented on large, horizontal displays. Being a relatively young field, many developments are in flux; hardware and software change at a fast pace and many interesting alternative approaches are available at the same time. In our research we are especially interested in systems that are capable of sensing multiple contacts (e. g., fingers) and richer information such as the outline of whole hands or other physical objects. New sensor hardware enable new ways to interact with the digital.

This research is interested in explaining how the Russian imperial machine devised and executed successful strategies to use its relative superiority over the Ottomans and the Qājārs and secure domination of the region.

In <b>this</b> <b>thesis,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of why Russia was more successful than the Ottoman state and Iran in the Caucasus between 1821 and 1833 is explained in three main ways: the first and most important factor in this process was the well-functioning fiscal-military machine of the Russian empire; the second factor was the diplomatic and military skill of the Russian leadership which helped to avert any effective political and military alliance between the Ottoman empire and Iran and defeated its rivals in two separate and successive wars; the last main factor in Russian success was its geopolitically superior position...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn response to Presidential Executive Order 13514, the Secretary of the Navy established the 1 GW Task Force to meet theNavy's goal of producing {{at least half}} of shore-based energy requirements from alternative energy sources. In <b>this</b> <b>thesis,</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is investigated whether renewably produced hydrogen can contribute to the accomplishment of this goal. It is known that ocean wind energy has yet to be fully exploited as a renewable energy source. It is therefore proposed to use sailing ships equipped with hydroturbines and electrolysers to convert this ocean wind energy into storable energy in the form of hydrogen. The hydrogen is then compressed and transported to nearby naval facilities. The technical and economic aspects of this energy-ship concept are analyzed by estimating the drag of the sailing ships, sail lift, and the power requirements of the desalinator, electrolyser, and hydrogen compressor. A previous study of the power requirements of the 76 inhabitants of Grimsey Island, near Iceland, is used to compare the energy-ship power production method with wind turbine based hydrogen production. It is found that 13 Catalina 36 sized, autonomously operating, sailboats can provide the Grimsey Island power at an economically competitive cost with the previously proposed wind-hydrogen method.

The state, organizations and trade unions have implemented legislation and policies that support work-life balance. However, the role of trade unions and collective labor agreements in relation to work-life balance policies is unclear. Therefore, {{the role of the}} trade unions will be of central focus in <b>this</b> <b>thesis.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> is how the presence of parental leave, long-term care and flexible working changed in collective labor agreements in the Netherlands in the period 2009 - 2014 and how this can be explained. Using quantitative techniques and the FNV CAO-database, the results show that during this period, the presence of parental leave arrangements remained stable. Long-term care and flexible working arrangements increased until 2013, only to decline in 2014. The presence of parental leave and flexible working arrangements differs across the public and private sector and is higher in sectors with a large proportion of women in that sector. Similar effects are not evident for long-term care. The findings also suggest that the size of the organization has a moderating effect in relation to parental leave and flexible working arrangements...|$|E
