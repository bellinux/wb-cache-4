5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the cylinder walls is directly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> pressure, and this affects the buoyancy characteristics of the cylinder.

5|$|There was an {{unsubstantiated}} {{rumor that}} Lucasfilm pressured Paramount {{to change the}} film's original working title, The Vengeance of Khan, claiming {{that it was too}} close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> title for their upcoming Star Wars film. However, as soon as the name change was made, Lucasfilm also changed their title to Return of the Jedi, justifying the change by claiming that the Jedi did not seek revenge, only the Sith.|$|E
5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to provide a}} high level of patient care for Jews, Christians, and Arabs, Shaare Zedek operated without electricity, indoor plumbing, central heating, or gas cooking stoves. Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater, and paraffin lamps were used in the operating room. It was difficult to retain staff due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> conditions and to the exacting, temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach. Nevertheless, Schwester Selma worked 18-hour days, and expected her nurses and aides to display the same work ethic.|$|E
5|$|In late 1925, a {{small group}} of young Hanoi-based intellectuals, led by a teacher named Pham Tuan Tai and his brother Pham Tuan Lam, started the Nam Dong Thu Xa (Southeast Asia Publishing House). They aimed to promote violent {{revolution}} as a means of gaining independence for Vietnam from French colonisation, and published books and brochures about Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese Revolution of 1911, as well as opening a free school to teach quoc ngu (Romanised Vietnamese script) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> class. The group soon attracted the support of other progressive young northerners, including students and teachers led by Nguyễn Thái Học. Học was an alumnus of Hanoi's Commercial School, who had been stripped of a scholarship because of his mediocre academic performance.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> and middle classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} the World Wars saw the {{election}} of reformist mayor Fiorello La Guardia and the fall of Tammany Hall after 80 years of political dominance. As the city's demographics stabilized, labor unionization brought new protections and affluence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> class, the city's government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under La Guardia. Despite the Great Depression, some of the world's tallest skyscrapers were completed in Manhattan during the 1930s, including numerous Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of the city's skyline today, most notably the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the GE Building.|$|E
5|$|Trotsky and his {{supporters}} had been organised since 1923 as the Left Opposition. They opposed the bureaucratisation of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the Soviet economy. Stalin's theory of socialism in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution, which argued that capitalism was a world system and required a world revolution in order {{to replace it with}} socialism. Prior to 1924, the Bolsheviks' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> class.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1940, {{following}} the rising tension between the Soviet Union and Germany over territories in the Balkans, an eventual invasion of the Soviet Union seemed to Hitler {{to be the only}} solution. While no concrete plans were made yet, Hitler told one of his generals in June that the victories in Western Europe finally freed his hands for his important real task: the showdown with Bolshevism. With the successful end to the campaign in France, General Erich Marcks was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>working</b> group drawing up the initial invasion plans of the Soviet Union. The first battle plans were entitled Operation Draft East (but colloquially it was known as the Marcks Plan). His report advocated the A-A line to be the operational objective of any invasion of the Soviet Union. This goal would extend from northern city of Arkhangelsk on the Arctic Sea through Gorky and Rostov to the port city of Astrakhan {{at the mouth of the}} Volga on the Caspian Sea. The report concluded that this military border would reduce the threat to Germany (and the Third Reich) from attacks by enemy bombers.|$|E
