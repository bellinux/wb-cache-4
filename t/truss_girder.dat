40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation into the behaviour of precast hybrid FRP-concrete, two-panel <b>truss</b> <b>girders</b> under static loading are presented. The investigation {{is part of a}} comprehensive research program on the development of a corrosion-free system for short and medium span bridges. The <b>truss</b> <b>girders</b> consist of pretensioned concrete chords connected by vertical and diagonal truss elements made of glass FRP tubes filled with concrete. The truss elements are reinforced and connected to the top and bottom chords by means of long double-headed steel or glass FRP bars. The top and bottom chords are also reinforced with glass FRP stirrups and double-headed longitudinal bars. This new system is expected to reduce the initial and maintenance costs and enhance the durability of bridges, and thus, extend their useful life. Moreover, by replacing the solid concrete web of traditional precast I-girders with the truss elements, the weight of the structure is significantly reduced, and thus, longer spans can be achieved and the number of supporting piers and size of the substructure can be reduced. The main objective of the research presented herein was to examine the efficiency of the FRP in comparison to steel reinforcement. The work included fabricating and testing three large-scale two-panel <b>truss</b> <b>girders</b> with an overall depth of 1. 32 m and length of 2. 83 m. The test parameters included the type and amount of reinforcement. The girders were tested under monotonic loading up to failure.

5000|$|The viaduct, {{situated}} {{at the bottom of}} the Lydbrook Valley where it meets the Wye Valley, consisted of five stone arches and three wrought iron lattice <b>truss</b> <b>girders.</b> The viaduct rose some 80 feet above the roadway below, linking Forge Hill on the east with Randor on the west.|$|R
50|$|To {{develop a}} {{reliable}} <b>truss</b> <b>girder</b> for long-span bridges, Brunel {{carried out a}} remarkable experiment with a full size girder. This used a single wrought iron plate girder, 70 ft in length, which was loaded {{up to the point}} of collapse, first with 165 tons load then, after repair, to 188 tons. Brunel was aware that the likely failure mechanism of this girder was by buckling collapse in the upper flange, which would be under compression forces. To resist this, the flange was supported by triangulated plates and the flange was also slight curved. The experiment was a great success, the bridge eventually failing at a considerable load, representing an efficient use of construction materials for a bridge of this capacity, compared to previous designs.|$|E
5000|$|The Middlefield-Becket Stone Arch Railroad Bridge District is a {{historic}} district extending through parts of the towns of Chester, Middlefield, and Becket, Massachusetts. [...] The district encompasses a 3.7 mi stretch of railroad right of way {{in which there are}} ten bridge crossings, including nine over the west branch of the Westfield River. The bridges were built in four time periods: 1840, 1866, 1912, and 1928. Nine of the ten bridges are stone or concrete masonry work, and one is a <b>truss</b> <b>girder</b> bridge. All are, with only minor exceptions, in excellent and original condition. The bridges were built to carry the Western Railroad through on its run from the Connecticut River to the Hudson River. This section of railroad was the most expensive the company had to build, costing over $1 million in 1840.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the only}} {{connection}} between the two places was by punt. Then the first bridge was built in 1870/71 by the armed constabulary for £1,500. It was near river level, with some piers in the river. It was destroyed by a flood on 17 November 1875, and replaced by the Red Bridge in 1876. That was a wooden <b>truss</b> <b>girder</b> bridge, 143 feet long and 14 feet wide, which cost £2345 and was 12 feet above the level of the 1870 bridge. Heritage New Zealand says both these early bridges were built {{on the site of the}} present Fergusson bridge, but an undated photograph suggests one of the early bridges may have been on the site of the present Victoria Bridge. The shaky state of the Red Bridge prompted the building of Victoria Bridge. Red Bridge was demolished in 1909.|$|E

50|$|The 1830 bridge {{needed a}} replacement.With site {{investigations}} in 1841 by John Harris, Robert Stephenson designed a five span cast iron <b>trussed</b> <b>girder</b> bridge on piled masonry piers.This was {{built over the}} period 1841 - 1844 by contractor Grahamsley and Read and {{when it opened in}} May 1844 it replaced the suspension bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{transferred}} {{over to the}} city in 1916, and as Lilla Essingen was being exploited in the 1930s, the bridge {{was replaced by the}} current steel bridge with <b>trussed</b> <b>girders.</b> It is 109 meters long; offers a horizontal clearance of 12 metres; is 15 metres wide with a roadway of 10 metres.|$|R
50|$|Brunel {{was known}} for his {{distrust}} of cast iron as a material, at least for large beams. This distrust of cast iron was vindicated when his friend Stephenson's adventurous cast-iron Dee Bridge (1846) collapsed in 1847. Brunel gave evidence in his support at the following inquiry, but this was on the basis of Stephenson being a competent engineer within the bounds of current knowledge, rather than in support of large cast-iron beams. Stephenson's Dee Bridge had used a <b>truss</b> <b>girder,</b> where an inverted T-shaped cast iron girder was trussed by applied wrought iron tension bars. This faulty design was instrumental in the bridge failure, where tension in the truss rods increased compression in {{the upper part of the}} girder such that it underwent columnar failure. Despite this, although with the advantage of hindsight, Brunel would use similar applied tension chains for his truss design.|$|E
5000|$|The viaduct is {{constructed}} of wrought iron and cast iron, {{one of two}} surviving wrought iron <b>truss</b> <b>girder</b> railway bridges in the United Kingdom. The only other surviving example is Bennerley Viaduct, between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. It consists of six warren truss spans, each of , and is supported by five lattice trestles. [...] The original bridge (that now forms part of the up line) was constructed {{of a pair of}} trusses at [...] centres. [...] When the bridge was later widened to allow double track operation, a second structure of almost identical construction was erected 7 feet 6 in from the original bridge with the gap spanned by timber decking. [...] The trusses are 9 feet 4 in high and the older trusses are unusual in that the tension (bottom) member is made of plate metal rather than a rolled girder. The trestles vary in height from [...] to [...] and are constructed of four wrought iron piers supported by horizontal and diagonal bracing. [...] The trestle sections taper inwards from the base and rest on [...] wide masonry bases.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a canard configuration monoplane whose structure made {{extensive use of}} a beam design patented by Fabre. This was a Warren <b>truss</b> <b>girder</b> with all members having a streamlined section. Two of these beams, one above the other and connected by three substantial struts, formed the fuselage of the aircraft. The wing, which had pronounced dihedral and whose leading edge was formed by an exposed Fabre beam, was mounted below {{the rear of the}} upper beam, and the Gnome Omega rotary engine driving a two-bladed pusher Chauvière propeller was mounted behind it. Additional bracing for the wings was provided by kingposts extending down from the leading edge at mid-span. There were two small foreplanes, which, like the wing, had exposed Fabre beams forming their leading edges, one mounted above the upper beam and the second on the strut connecting the two beams. A rectangular rear-mounted rudder was situated above the wing: below the wing there was a similar rectangular fixed surface extending down to the lower fuselage beam. The pilot sat astride the upper fuselage beam. The {{aircraft was}} equipped with three broad floats: one {{at the front of the}} aircraft, the other two mounted on struts extending down from the wing.|$|E
50|$|Trestles in cast- or wrought-iron {{were used}} during the 19th Century on the {{developing}} railway network in the United Kingdom. These generally carried decking consisting of some form of <b>trussed</b> <b>girder,</b> as at Crumlin Viaduct, Belah and Meldon; though two rare examples, at Dowery Dell (demolished in 1962), and Bennerley had lattice girder decks.|$|R
50|$|After gradual {{closure of}} the {{intervening}} stations in the late 1950s, both passenger and goods services between Bishop Auckland and Barnard Castle, across the viaduct, were withdrawn in June 1962. Two years after closure, the <b>truss</b> <b>girders</b> were removed for scrap. In 1966, two of the brick piers were toppled by explosives, but left on site.|$|R
