Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state <b>that</b> <b>police</b> officials fired bullets and helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged <b>that</b> <b>police</b> guided the mob of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations <b>that</b> <b>police</b> themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E

5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions.

5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and <b>that</b> <b>police</b> power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails <b>that</b> <b>police</b> officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E

5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools {{could no longer}} be considered isolated incidents, and <b>that</b> <b>police</b> and security forces had to approach them with a new perspective in the aftermath of Kauhajoki.

5|$|In July 2012 it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>police</b> {{have been given the}} power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences. In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park. Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs in the park and are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time. In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37mph in the park. In March 2015 a cycling club member was fined for speeding at 41mph and faced disciplinary action from his cycling club, which uses the park for training. In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park.|$|E
40|$|Policing is {{regarded}} as an important mechanism for maintaining cooperation in human and animal social groups. A simple model providing a theoretical overview of the coevolution of policing and cooperation has been analyzed by Frank (1995, 1996 b, 2003, 2009), and this suggests <b>that</b> <b>policing</b> will evolve to fully suppress cheating within social groups when relatedness is low. Here, we relax some of the assumptions made by Frank, and investigate the consequences for policing and cooperation. First, we address the implicit assumption that the individual cost of investment into policing is reduced when selfishness dominates. We find that relaxing this assumption leads to policing being favored only at intermediate relatedness. Second, we address the assumption <b>that</b> <b>policing</b> fully recovers the loss of fitness incurred by the group owing to selfishness. We find that relaxing this assumption prohibits the evolution of full policing. Finally, we consider the impact of demography on the coevolution of policing and cooperation, in particular the role for kin competition to disfavor the evolution of policing, using both a heuristic "open" model and a "closed" island model. We find that large groups and increased kin competition disfavor <b>policing,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>policing</b> is maintained more readily than it invades. Policing may be harder to evolve than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|The {{problematic}} of any {{analysis of}} public <b>policing</b> is <b>that</b> {{it is primarily}} {{based on the premise}} <b>that</b> <b>policing</b> is a state centred activity. As public policing has always been associated with the political institutions of the state, and with the advent of modernity, it has reinforced the notion <b>that</b> <b>policing</b> is power exercised through control by the (Weberian) resort to the legitimate use of force. However, developments in the theories of Globalisation and postmodernisation suggest <b>that</b> <b>policing</b> cannot continue to be analysed, explained, theorised, or compared merely on this basis. This thesis examines the current contributions by Reiner (1992 & 2000), Johnston (2000), and Wright (2002) that assess the impact of either Globalisation or postmodernisation, or both. It also examines policy discourses, and discursive practices, that indicate the tensions within the public police and policing of England & Wales and the US that may be said {{to be associated with the}} processes of Globalisation and postmodernisation. The postmodern notions of power/knowledge, and the role of agency, are utilised, as well as the multidisciplinary approach of the new Political Sociology. A comparative historical approach to the concept of public policing is undertaken and case studies, including the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York on 11 th September 2001, are utilised in order to contextualise the conceptual developments as they unfold. In essence, this thesis argues for a greater appreciation of, and emphasis on, the processes of Globalisation and postmodernisation when policing is analysed. It concludes <b>that</b> <b>policing</b> should be reconceptualised as power through control of information and knowledge, rather than through the legitimate use of force. In consequence, there would be a move towards a more strategic appreciation of policing as a major factor in the political economy of the state at the local, national and global level...|$|R

5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) finds <b>that</b> <b>police</b> {{across the}} United States have {{received}} calls from {{witnesses to the}} killing.

5|$|On 14 August, Deputy Superintendent of Police Steve Brown {{announced}} that fourteen statements had been collected {{and that the}} investigation was progressing. In October 2013, {{a group of men}} set fire to the place in which Jones had lived as a squatter, forcing its four occupants to flee, in what was also believed to be an anti-LGBT hate crime. Everald Morgan, an officer at the St James Public Health Department, requested <b>that</b> <b>police</b> provide protection for the four youths made homeless by the arson attack, but they declined to do so. Meanwhile, a charity named Dwayne's House was set up in Jones' memory to aid homeless LGBT youth in Jamaica. As of May 2014, however, no one had been arrested or charged, and in August 2015 the crime was still considered unsolved.|$|E

Dunderdale spoke on the issue the following day, she said that due to privacy reasons she was partially reluctant to take on a bodyguard but respects the RNC’s decision. Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security.|$|E
