5|$|AJ's Infinite Summer is an {{animated}} television pilot created by Toby Jones for Cartoon Network. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> follows AJ, whose new job {{during the summer}} drives him crazy with power. It is loosely based on Jones' 2006 film, AJ Goes to France. Both the film and <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> star AJ Thompson as the eponymous character. Jones additionally sought inspiration from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and the comics he drew featuring Thompson and his other friends. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> was released on the official website of Cartoon Network on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Although not <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, in <b>the</b> cockpit, <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> work to {{overcome}} a developing mechanical problem that endangers the aircraft. They realize they must make an emergency landing as they pass over the orange-producing town of Finleyville, California. Unbeknownst to <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> <b>the</b> arachnids have escaped and begin to swarm the cockpit, attacking <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b> <b>The</b> plane crash-lands near Finleyville.|$|R
40|$|Predicted {{results of}} a {{simulation}} of <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> approach control strategy in <b>the</b> presence of <b>pilot</b> remnant are presented. The aircraft dynamics and the turbulence environment are representative of a trainer-type aircraft. <b>The</b> non-intrusive <b>pilot</b> identification program (NIPIP) was used to identify <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> control strategy required by this highly-coupled, multiloop control task. The results are presented in terms of frequency responses of the individual elements of <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> control strategy and indicate that NIPIP can identify <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> describing functions even {{in the presence of}} significant amounts of pilot remnant...|$|R
50|$|Until {{recently}} <b>the</b> Fowey Harbour <b>Pilots</b> traditionally {{came from}} Polruan. Pilotage for commercial shipping {{was carried out}} from open boats with <b>the</b> <b>Pilots</b> boarding <b>the</b> ships via a <b>pilot</b> ladder. <b>The</b> Fowey <b>Pilots</b> Association describes <b>the</b> work of <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b>|$|R
5|$|Carter next {{began work}} on the Amazon Studios {{television}} series The After. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> episode was made available for viewing on February 6, 2014; the series was green-lit the following month, but finally cancelled on January 5, 2015, without another episode beyond <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> being shot.|$|E
5|$|HBO did {{not make}} a {{decision}} for four months after <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> was delivered. In March 2010, HBO's decision to greenlight the series including <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> was announced, with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010. HBO however demanded extensive reshoot of <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped. A cameo appearance by George RR Martin as a Pentoshi nobleman at Daenerys's wedding filmed in Morocco was therefore also cut. In all 90 percent of <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> was re-shot in 2010, with some cast changes and a different director.|$|E
5|$|Reception of <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> varied {{according}} to the audience in question. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> was very well received by the mathematics community. Within {{a couple of weeks}} of Pegg's article for the MAA, Keith Devlin, another member of the association, gave <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> a very favorable review.|$|E
50|$|On September 21, 2007, AirTran <b>pilots,</b> {{represented}} by <b>the</b> National <b>Pilots</b> Association, rejected <b>the</b> carrier's contract proposal. Two weeks earlier, <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> voted {{to dump the}} union president and vice president. On April 10, 2009, 87% of <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> at AirTran voted to merge <b>the</b> National <b>Pilots</b> Association with <b>the</b> world's largest <b>pilot</b> union, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA).|$|R
2500|$|In March 1889, <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> and {{engineers}} of the Oregon Railway & Navigation company {{went on strike}} for higher wages. [...] On Friday, March 8, 1889, <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> and <b>the</b> engineers appointed three men each {{to negotiate with the}} company, with George Pease being one of men selected by <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} general specifications {{for each of}} <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> that {{will be part of}} the INVADE Project. <b>The</b> <b>pilots</b> are located in five countries: Norway, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Germany and Spain. It´s specified a list of sections for each one of <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b> A general description, grid topology, flexibility services, technical details and a list of the general equipment that will be necessary in the execution of the project. For each of <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> <b>the</b> use cases will be related to the PUCs defined in D 4. 1 which has been a good input in order to identify the possible use cases for all <b>the</b> different <b>pilots...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., premiered on the Fox network at 8:00pm on Friday, August 27, 1993, with {{a two-hour}} pilot movie. To bolster viewer {{interest}} in the show, Fox rebroadcast <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> two days later at 7:00pm. Both airings of <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> returned strong ratings. Brisco's ratings for <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and first episode were high, particularly with the demographic of adults aged 18–49. The series was aired in Canada, including on Global Toronto (channel 29).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> lay flat on {{the lower}} wing, as planned, to reduce {{aerodynamic}} drag. As a glide ended, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Portland <b>Pilots</b> were a Class-B {{minor league}} {{baseball}} team in Portland, Maine out of the New England League. Created in 1946 as the Portland Gulls, <b>the</b> <b>Pilots</b> lasted until 1949, when the New England League collapsed. <b>The</b> <b>Pilots</b> were affiliated with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1948-49.|$|R
25|$|The {{investigation}} found that ineffective flight deck management by <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> in {{adverse weather conditions}} caused <b>the</b> accident. <b>The</b> <b>pilots</b> had inadequate flying experience, training and competence level in the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Safety Board is {{extremely}} concerned that no federal investigators {{were allowed to}} speak to <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> of flight 5050 until almost 40 hours after the accident. Specific requests to USAir and ALPA to interview <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> and to have them provide toxicological samples were made about ten hours and again about 20 hours after the accident. USAir representatives stated {{they did not know}} where <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> were sequestered. <b>The</b> Air Line <b>Pilots</b> Association representatives initially stated that they also did not know where <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> were, then later stated that their location was being withheld so they could not be found by the media. This complicated the investigative process to a great degree. The sequestering of <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> for such {{an extended period of time}} in many respects borders on interference with a federal investigation and is inexcusable." ...|$|R

5|$|ATC also {{advised that}} I-29 ran North and South just East {{of the airport}} they could land on if they didn't think they could make the runway. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> opted to try for the runway instead.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the series}} {{shared the same}} mockumentary style as The Office, Daniels and Schur sought to {{establish}} a slightly different tone in the camerawork of <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> episode of Parks and Recreation. For example, the documentary-style interviews with characters sometimes feature two separate angles on the same person, with footage of the two different angles intercut into a single scene for the final episode. This distinguishing technique was inspired by The Five Obstructions, a 2003 documentary by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, which Daniels watched {{at the suggestion of}} actor Paul Schneider. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> episode also makes use of the jump cut technique more often than in The Office. In one example from <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> episode, a scene repeatedly jumps cuts to several brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project.|$|E
50|$|The {{doctor on}} {{call in the}} Awaruda basement. Physical and mental status of <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> are her top {{priority}} and she constantly updates Miya Shikitani on <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> condition. She's also the one person <b>the</b> Dangaioh <b>pilots</b> turn to when they have problems with their lives or complaints and enjoys making fun of <b>the</b> younger <b>pilots,</b> especially Kuya. She's rather close to Miya Shikitani for some reason.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the wind}} was calm, Cali's {{controllers}} asked <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> whether they wanted to fly a straight-in approach to runway 19 rather than coming around to runway 01. <b>The</b> <b>pilots</b> agreed, hoping to make up some time. <b>The</b> <b>pilots</b> then erroneously cleared the approach waypoints from their navigation computer. When the controller asked <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> to check back in over Tuluá, north of Cali, {{it was no longer}} programmed into the computer, and so they had to pull out their maps to find it. In the meantime, they extended the aircraft's speed brakes to slow it down and expedite its descent.|$|R
25|$|The Israeli Air Force {{pilots who}} took part in the {{operation}} were personally handpicked by General Eliezer Shkedy, commander of the Israeli Air Force. Shkedy chose pilots whose flying skills matched his own. <b>The</b> <b>pilots</b> began training weeks before <b>the</b> raid. <b>The</b> <b>pilots</b> trained to hit a small target at an angled dive of thirty degrees. During the practice missions, <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> used dummy bombs which exploded white phosphorus smoke on the target to determine the accuracy of the drops. The drills were carried out over the Negev at night. <b>The</b> <b>pilots</b> were not told of their target until they were briefed by General Shkedy shortly before the operation began. During the briefing, Shkedy assured <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> that Syrian air defenses would be jammed, and warned them that no bombs were to fall on civilians.|$|R
5|$|An airman {{removed the}} pins, {{showed them to}} <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> and {{took them to the}} CDO.|$|E
5|$|Another Congolese Su-25K {{crashed on}} 30 June 2007 during an Independence Day display, {{near the city}} of Kisangani, killing <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b> Investigations {{revealed}} that the crash was due to an engine failure.|$|E
5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of the}} characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> was inspired by a local event. David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E
30|$|Notice that channel {{estimation}} may not {{be performed}} reliably if multiple transmitters simultaneously transmit <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> since <b>the</b> signals of all transmitters superimpose, unless <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> are somehow made orthogonal, i.e., by individual orthogonal codes.|$|R
50|$|A {{investigation}} into the accident found {{that the cause of}} <b>the</b> crash was <b>pilot</b> error. <b>The</b> <b>pilots</b> inadvertently entered <b>the</b> wrong radial into their navigation system and went off course. Because of <b>the</b> fog <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> did not know they were {{on a collision course with}} the mountain.|$|R
50|$|Troubled by {{the deaths}} of <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> <b>the</b> group was disbanded in November 1911.|$|R
5|$|Carey and Helford co-wrote <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> episode together. Helford had {{expected}} The Drew Carey Show to air at 8:30pm. When ABC placed {{the show in}} the 7:30 pm slot, Helford agreed to soften the language in <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b> An executive from Standards and Practices had asked for nine words deemed offensive {{to be removed from}} the script, as well as a mention of Jack Daniel's and a line that implied one of the characters was going to buy and use drugs.|$|E
5|$|Chase {{directed}} two episodes himself, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> episode and {{the series}} finale.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{first started}} writing the script {{in the summer}} of 2008, when they were {{in the early stages of}} conceiving the series. Like the rest of the series, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> was filmed in the same mockumentary style as The Office, the NBC comedy series also {{directed}} by Daniels. About one month before <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> aired, a focus group report discussing several perceived problems with the episode was leaked to the media, which led to speculation that Parks and Recreation was not ready for prime-time television. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> episode featured a number of cultural references to such people as Bob Knight, Larry Bird and Laura Linney, as well as female political figures to whom Leslie compares herself, such as Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
50|$|In the video, Kate Nash is {{an airline}} {{stewardess}}, {{and is a}} rival to another stewardess (who is shown serving alcoholic drinks to <b>the</b> <b>pilots)</b> for <b>the</b> affections of a handsome male steward. At {{the end of the}} video, whether due to air turbulence, or the drunkenness of <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> or <b>the</b> deliberate actions of <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> Nash is literally thrown into the arms of the steward by the motions of the plane.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the {{previous}} Scout B. These early Scout Cs also had their main oil tank moved to a position directly behind <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> shoulders, requiring a raised rear dorsal fairing immediately behind <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> seat to accommodate it.|$|R
