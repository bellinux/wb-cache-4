5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third.

5|$|After Rollins {{suffered}} a legitimate severe knee injury at a live event, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was vacated {{and it was}} announced {{that there would be a}} tournament <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>a</b> new champion at Survivor Series. On the November 9 episode of Raw, Triple H offered to give Reigns a bye to the finals of the tournament if he joined The Authority, but Reigns refused. At Survivor Series, Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose in the tournament finals to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H came out and attempted to congratulate Reigns, but was instead hit with a spear. This allowed Sheamus to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and quickly defeat Reigns to win the championship, resulting in Sheamus aligning with The Authority.|$|E

5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>a</b> battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>a</b> sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>a</b> national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>a</b> decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{absence from}} television, The Miz {{returned}} to SmackDown! to host an interview segment named Miz TV. After the unsuccessful segment, The Miz returned to in-ring competition {{with a more}} intense style and began to pick up wins once again. On the June 11, 2007 episode of Raw, Mizanin faced off against Snitsky in a match <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>a</b> draft pick for SmackDown!. Snitsky easily defeated The Miz to give ECW the draft pick, but after constantly assaulting The Miz after the match, the referee reversed the decision and awarded the match to Miz, thus allowing SmackDown! a draft pick. SmackDown!'s pick was then revealed to be Chris Masters.|$|E
