5|$|The First World War saw no decisive engagements between battlefleets {{to compare}} with Tsushima. The role of battleships was {{marginal}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> fighting in France and Russia; it was equally marginal to the German war on commerce (Handelskrieg) and the Allied blockade.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{to reunite}} with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking him back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Living by pretending {{he wants her}} to meet his parents. She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, to return Victor and Emily {{temporarily}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Living. Once back home, Victor asks Emily {{to wait in the}} forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings. Just as they are about to share a kiss, Emily arrives and sees the two of them together. Feeling betrayed and hurt, she angrily drags Victor back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Dead. Victoria tells her parents that Victor has been forcibly wed to a dead woman, but no one believes her. With Victor gone, Victoria's parents decide to marry her off against her will to a presumed-wealthy newcomer in town named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.|$|E
5|$|Amenemhat IV {{may have}} been the son, {{grandson}} or step-son of his predecessor, the powerful Amenemhat III. His reign started with a two-year coregency with Amenemhat III and was seemingly peaceful. He undertook expeditions in the Sinai for turquoise, in Upper Egypt for amethyst and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of Punt. He also maintained trade relations with Byblos as well as the Egyptian presence in Nubia. Amenemhat IV built some parts of the temple of Hathor at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai and constructed the well-preserved temple of Renenutet in Medinet Madi.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the RAAF {{were also}} {{available}} <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> <b>landing.</b> <b>The</b> {{plan for the}} operation specified that, if required, No. 6 Squadron, reinforced with Beauforts from No. 8 and No. 100 Squadrons, would attack <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> area before 6 am on 4 November. An additional two Beauforts could also observe for any bombardments made by <b>the</b> warships. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing,</b> <b>the</b> air strike was cancelled by the RAAF officer who was attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> force <b>to</b> coordinate air support as no opposition was expected.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the main}} common {{threats to the}} park are glacier retreat due to global warming; {{hydropower}} projects; legal and illegal mining operations with low environmental standards; and loss of biodiversity to agricultural land and pastures (the latter mainly due to a conflict between the park purposes and the ancestral rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> by the locals).|$|E
5|$|Before 1950, Gulfton {{consisted}} of farm land {{and much of}} the area belonged to Westmoreland Farms. In the mid-1950s, the Shenandoah subdivision was established; consisting of sixteen city blocks of ranch-style homes. Shenandoah was located adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> which would later become the site of the Gulfton apartment complexes. Decades later these communities would clash as the apartments surrounding Shenandoah deteriorated and property values became threatened.|$|E
5|$|Ceawlin (also spelled Ceaulin and Caelin, died ca. 593) was a King of Wessex. He {{may have}} been the son of Cynric of Wessex and the {{grandson}} of Cerdic of Wessex, whom the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle represents {{as the leader of the}} first group of Saxons to come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> which later became Wessex. Ceawlin was active during the last years of the Anglo-Saxon expansion, with little of southern England remaining in the control of the native Britons by the time of his death.|$|E

5|$|Eardwulf's {{whereabouts}} {{after his}} recovery are not known. In surviving King Æthelred's anger {{he was more}} fortunate than Ælfwald's sons, who were drowned on Æthelred's orders in 791. Osred returned from exile but was betrayed, and killed by Æthelred's command on 14 September 792. Æthelred himself was assassinated on 18 April 796, perhaps at Corbridge, by conspirators led by the dux Ealdred. Æthelred was followed as king by Osbald, whose antecedents are unknown: he was deposed after twenty-seven days and fled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> of the Picts with a few supporters.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Nepalis, {{who settled}} in the region during British rule, {{comprise}} the majority of Gangtok's residents. Lepchas, native <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> and Bhutias also constitute a sizeable portion of the populace. Additionally, {{a large number of}} Tibetans have immigrated to the town. Immigrant resident communities not native to the region include the Marwaris, who own most of the shops; the Biharis, who are employed in mostly blue collar jobs and the Bengalis.|$|E
5|$|Gotoh then arrives {{to inform}} Marth that Gharnef has kidnapped several female clerics, {{including}} Princess Nyna {{and his own}} sister Elice, to serve as sacrifices for the revival of Medeus. Marth leads his army to an ancient temple where Gharnef holds the ceremony. After killing Gharnef, retrieving Falchion, and rescuing the clerics, Marth confronts Medeus, who has taken {{the form of an}} enormous dark dragon. Using the Falchion and Shield of Seals, Marth slays Medeus. With peace restored <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> Marth and Caeda, now married, become the rulers of all Archanea.|$|E

5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to make their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E
5|$|However, the two missionaries, who {{had become}} just as much explorers as they were missionaries, became quite {{interested}} in Kilimanjaro, and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa governor for an expedition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> of the Jagga, a people {{now known as the}} Chaga, who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro. Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work-based. Despite this, Krapf actually did not accompany Rebmann on the journey, so only Bwana Kheri and Rebmann left for Kilimanjaro on April 27, 1848.|$|E
5|$|In 1251, the sheriffs {{were ordered}} to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep for the King's polar bear, a gift from Haakon IV of Norway in the same year; the bear {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention from Londoners when it went fishing in the Thames while tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> by a chain.|$|E

5|$|Jost Hite, a German immigrant, {{purchased}} a large land grant {{in the northern}} Shenandoah Valley in 1731. Peter Stephens and a small party of German Protestants from Heidelberg, in the Palatinate, arrived about 1732 to buy and settle that land, including the site of what became Stephens City, named for the Stephens family. Although Hite's title <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> was challenged by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, the land baron of the area, the matter was settled amicably.|$|E
5|$|Lacks {{was buried}} in an unmarked grave in the family {{cemetery}} {{in a place called}} Lackstown in Halifax County, Virginia. Lackstown is the name that was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in Clover, Virginia that was originally owned by white, land- and slave-owning members of the Lacks family before the Civil War. Later generations gave the land to the many black members of the Lacks family who were descendants of African slaves and their white owners.|$|E
5|$|Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land.</b> Their {{dwellings}} were {{restricted to}} immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain {{cool in the}} heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.|$|E

5|$|Numbered Treaties {{were signed}} {{in the late}} 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area. These {{treaties}} made specific promises of land for every family. As a result, a reserve system was established {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Federal Government. The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> through aboriginal land claims, many of which are still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Partly in {{response}} to economic pressures {{and in order to}} protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary. Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Reclamation methods varied {{somewhat}} {{during the}} 19th century, but three basic operations featured; constructing drains at appropriate intervals; building {{a system of}} roads to allow access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> so that materials such as clay, lime or marl could be dumped on it, to give it body; and fertilising the land by adding manure, often {{in the form of}} the euphemistically named night soil, collected from neighbouring towns.|$|E
