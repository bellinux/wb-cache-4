2500|$|Culpeper {{spent the}} greater part of his life in the English {{outdoors}} cataloguing hundreds of medicinal herbs. He criticized what he considered the unnatural methods of his contemporaries, writing: [...] "This not being pleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers, [...] and , and took a voyage <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> <b>my</b> mother , by whose advice, together with the help of , I at last obtained my desire; and, being warned by , a stranger in our days, to publish it to the world, I have done it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 {{before his}} coronation, it was {{initially}} envisaged that his successor George VI would ultimately visit India and {{have his own}} Durbar. [...] The Indian National Congress passed a motion weeks after his accession calling for a boycott of any such visit, and in February 1937 Communist MP Willie Gallacher decried expenditure on such festivities {{in a country of}} such poverty. [...] The King's Speech of October 1937 included [...] "I am looking forward with interest and pleasure to the time when it will be possible for Me <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> <b>My</b> Indian Empire"; however, the onset of World War II and the movement towards Indian independence meant this visit never happened.|$|E

2500|$|... "It's a Long Way There": [...] "I {{wrote that}} song about how I {{moved to another}} state and I missed Adelaide a lot. I used to drive home 8–10hours each month <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> <b>my</b> family. That's where the title came from. And then {{as we used to}} play 7 nights a week, we were battling for material, we'd go for very long jams on that song, {{sometimes}} 20minutes at a time. And during the long outros, I would hear and come up with different passages, so I would often jot them down and rehearse them and add or take out a bit here and there. Today, I believe that the lyric is about a personal journey, a journey through lifetimes to your soul evolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{afterward}} I resolved <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> <b>my</b> town of Taal; {{nothing was}} left of it except {{the walls of the}} church and convento. All the rest, the government house, the walks of the rope factory, the warehouse, everything was buried beneath a layer of stones, mud, and ashes more than 10 spans [...] thick; only here and there could be seen an upright post, the only remnant of a comfortable dwelling. I went down to the river and found it completely filled up, with a boat belonging to the alcalde and many of private persons buried in the mud. After incredible efforts I finally succeeded in unearthing in what had once been the church and sacristy, the chests which contained the sacred vestments and vessels. Nearly all of them were demolished by the rocks and beams which had fallen upon them, and filled with foul-smelling mud that had ruined or disfigured their contents. With the aid of some natives of Bauang, I likewise recovered some property from among the ruins of the convento.|$|E
2500|$|I've had a wing fold up at a {{thousand}} feet while sitting on a dud parachute. I've been backed {{up against a wall}} looking down the rifle barrels of a firing squad. I've felt the automatic of my own commanding officer poked in my ribs. While being smuggled from Spain into France <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> <b>my</b> wife, I've had a speed boat pilot killed by Fascist bullets in the Bay of Biscay. I've fought half a dozen German pursuit planes in the air with an orchestra leader as a gunner. And of all places to be during a bomb raid I was there - locked up in jail - and with my wife. And these events have not been an accumulation of my war service in France, or Russia, or Mexico, but happened during the past few months while serving as a pilot with the Government forces in Spain. ... A Spanish pilot, Jose Galarza, bailed out from a crippled ship, during a fight, and landed safely in Franco's line. But the next day a Junker bomber droned over our field and dropped a box. It contained the chopped up cadaver of Jose ... Lafayette! Pulaski! Rochambeau! Who were they? Glorious foreign volunteers who aided us in time of need. We name bridges, boats, and towns after them now. Our kids read about them in our histories. ... And over in Spain foreign volunteers are fighting that a friendly democratic nation may survive. In most instances those volunteers came from the army of unemployed in their countries where they were without hope. In all cases they are highly skilled technical men. Their hope is a new lease on life; but the usual reward has been a nameless grave. ...|$|E
