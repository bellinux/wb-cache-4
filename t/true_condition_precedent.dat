50|$|A general {{ruling that}} can be gleaned from the court's {{judgment}} is that in circumstances where parties have equal knowledge as {{to the existence of}} the subject matter, {{and it turned out to}} be false, then it would justify the implication of a <b>condition</b> <b>precedent.</b> In that case, the contract would be void for the failure of the <b>condition</b> <b>precedent,</b> and parties would be restored to their original position. However, in a case where only one party has knowledge of the subject matter (such as the present circumstances), and the other simply relies on what the first party intimates, then there could be no <b>condition</b> <b>precedent.</b> The first party promises or guarantees the existence of the subject matter and will be in breach if it does not exist.|$|R
