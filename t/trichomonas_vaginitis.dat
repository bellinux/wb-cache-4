5000|$|<b>Trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis</b> is an {{infection}} acquired through sex that {{is associated with}} vaginal discharge. It can be transmitted by way of the penis to the vagina, the vagina to the penis, or from vagina to vagina. The discharge in Trichomonas is typically yellowish-green in color. [...] It sometimes is frothy and can have a foul smell. [...] Other symptoms may include vaginal burning or itching, pain with urination, or pain with sexual intercourse. Trichomonas is diagnosed by looking at a sample of discharge under the microscope showing trichomonads moving on the slide. [...] However, in women with trichomonas the organism is typically detected in only 60-70% of cases. Other testing, including a culture of the discharge or a PCR assay, are more likely to detect the organism. Treatment is with a one time dose of oral antibiotics, most commonly metronidazole or tindazole.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} an assay system which overcomes the difficulty of detecting immune responses of patients with <b>Trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis</b> by making use of peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from such patients. When peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient were stimulated in microcultures with the soluble antigen extracted from Trichomonas vaginalis, significant degrees of proliferation ensued, as measured by the incorporation of [methyl- 3 H]thymidine 4 to 5 days after initiation. The antigen-induced proliferation response of peripheral blood leukocytes is specific for T. vaginalis antigen. The T. vaginalis-specific [methyl- 3 H]thymidine incorporation is mediated by Leu- 1 -positive cells, namely, T lymphocytes, in the peripheral blood leukocyte population. This assay system should prove useful for the analysis of the immune response to the protozoa in patients with <b>Trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} effect of {{treatment}} of vaginal infections on vaginal shedding of cell-free human immunode®ciency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and HIV- 1 ±infected cells, HIV- 1 ±seropositive women were examined before and after treatment of Candida vulvovaginitis, <b>Trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis,</b> and bacterial vaginosis. For Candida (), vaginal HIV- 1 RNA decreased from 3. 36 ton p 98 2. 86 log 10 copies/swab (), as did the prevalence of HIV- 1 DNA (36 % to 17 %; oddsP!. 001 ratio [OR], 2. 8; 95 % con®dence interval [CI], 1. 3 ± 6. 5).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the vaginal cytokine concentration varies during the course of uncomplicated pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Prenatal visits of healthy women to University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium were considered. Cytokine levels in vaginal washings from 30 unselected healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies were monitored during pregnancy and compared with those from 62 nonpregnant healthy control subjects. Exclusion criteria included bacterial vaginosis, moderate or severe aerobic <b>vaginitis,</b> <b>Trichomonas</b> vaginalis, Candida <b>vaginitis</b> (wet mount or culture), gonorrhea, and Chlamydia. Interleukin- 6, interleukin- 8, interleukin- 1 beta, interleukin- 1 -receptor antagonist, leukemia inhibitory factor, and tumor necrosis factor were measured. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Welch tests were used for univariate analysis, and the Spearman rank test was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Compared with concentrations in nonpregnant women, interleukin- 1 beta concentrations were similar, but interleukin- 1 -receptor antagonist production was depressed throughout pregnancy. Vaginal interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 8 were less often discovered during pregnancy than outside pregnancy and dipped significantly in the middle trimester, to rise again to prepregnancy levels in the third trimester. Leukemia inhibitory factor was lower during the beginning of pregnancy (P=. 038) but otherwise did not differ from nonpregnant values throughout pregnancy nor did tumor necrosis factor. Sexual activity could not explain these findings. CONCLUSION: Vaginal cytokine levels, especially interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist, from pregnant women may differ from nonpregnant values; some levels, such as interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 8, may fluctuate during normal pregnancy. These spontaneous variations during pregnancy must be taken into account when mucosal immunologic responses to infection of the lower genital tract are being studied. status: publishe...|$|R

Unfortunately, recurrence of infection has occurred in a high proportion of the cases and the problem of satisfactory treatment remains unsolved. Local application of the pentavalent arsenical " acetarsol " is accepted by most clinicians as the treatment of choice. This type of therapy is, however, contra-indicated if the patient has in the past shown sensitivity to an arsenical preparation. Long-continued use of acetarsol has occasionally resulted in arsenical dermatitis, a serious complication which inevitably recurs if an arsenical is used again.

40|$|<b>Trichomonas</b> vaginalis causes <b>vaginitis</b> and {{increases}} the risk of HIV transmission by het-erosexual sex, while Tritrichomonas foetus causes premature abortion in cattle. Our goals were to determine the effects, if any, of anti-retroviral lectins, which are designed to prevent heterosexual transmission of HIV, on adherence of Trichomonas to ectocervical cells and on Tritrichomonas infections in a mouse model. We show that Trichomonas Asn-linked gly-cans (N-glycans), like those of HIV, bind the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) {{that is part of the}} innate immune system. N-glycans of Trichomonas and Tritrichomonas bind anti-retroviral lectins (cyanovirin-N and griffithsin) and the 2 G 12 monoclonal antibody, each of which binds HIV N-glycans. Binding of cyanovirin-N appears to be independent of susceptibility to metronidazole, the major drug used to treat Trichomonas. Anti-retroviral lectins, MBL, and galectin- 1 cause Trichomonas to self-aggregate and precipitate. The anti-retroviral lectins also increase adherence of ricin-resistant mutants, which are less adherent than parent cells, to ectocervical cell monolayers and to organotypic EpiVaginal tissue cells.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} whether single-dose treatments are {{as effective as}} standard therapy in the syndromic management of vaginal discharge. METHODS: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial compared single-dose tinidazole plus fluconazole (TF) with treatment for 7 days with metronidazole plus 3 days of treatment with vaginal clotrimazole (MC) among 1570 women presenting with vaginal discharge at primary health care institutions in Ghana, Guinea, Mali and Togo. Participants were randomly allocated {{to one of the}} two treatments by research nurses or physicians using precoded envelopes. Effectiveness was assessed by symptomatic response on day 14. CLINICAL IDENTIFIER ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00313131. FINDINGS: The two treatment regimens had similar effectiveness: complete resolution was seen in 66 % (TF) and 64 % (MC) and partial resolution in 33 % (TF) and 34 % (MC) of participants (P = 0. 26). Effectiveness was similar among subgroups with vulvovaginal candidiasis, <b>Trichomonas</b> vaginalis <b>vaginitis</b> or bacterial vaginosis. The two treatment regimens had a similar effectiveness among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected (TF: n = 76, 71 % complete resolution, 28 % partial; MC: n = 83, 72 % complete resolution, 25 % partial, P = 0. 76) and HIV-uninfected women (TF: n = 517, 68 % complete, 32 % partial; MC: n = 466, 65 % complete, 33 % partial, P = 0. 20). Cervical infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium were uncommon among women not involved in sex work, were associated with bacterial vaginosis or T. vaginalis vaginitis, and did not alter response to treatment with agents active against vaginal infections. Four-fifths of women not relieved by a single dose of TF had a favourable response when MC was administered as second-line treatment. CONCLUSION: Single-dose TF is as effective as multiple-dose MC in the syndromic management of vaginal discharge, even among women with HIV-infection. Given its low price and easier adherence, TF should be considered as a first-line treatment for vaginal discharge syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Mardin {{is an area}} of low {{socioeconomic}} {{level with}} low rates of contraceptive method use. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the effects of the contraceptive methods used in the area on epithelial cell abnormalities and vaginal flora changes. Material and Method: Cervical smear samples received at the Pathology Department between 2010 and 2012 of 526 patients who had used a contraceptive method and 112 who had never used one were included in the study. The cases were divided into 3 groups as those using hormonal contraception (107, 20. 3 %), those using an intrauterine device (343, 65. 2 %) and those using a barrier method (76, 14. 4 %). The evaluation was made using the Bethesda 2001 criteria for cervical epithelial abnormalities and specific cervicovaginal infections. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups for epithelial cell abnormalities while bacterial vaginitis (12 %, p= 0. 03) and Trichomonas vaginalis (7. 6 %) were more common in the IUD users.

40|$|Introduction: Trichomonas is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} disease and its agent is a flagellated parasite called <b>trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis.</b> This is the third common reason of vaginities and 180 millions women at world and 2 - 3 millions at U. S suffer from it. Because of its high prevalence and expensive treatment, we decided to evaluate its clinical and para- clinical diagnosis. Methods: This is an analytic cross-sectional study and carried out on 300 women with signs of vaginitis infections and had indication for Pap smear which referred to shahrood city heath care centers. In this study we took two samples of secretion from both endocervix and exocervix by speculum spred them on two lame contemporaneous, and one sample from posterior koldosace secretions with cotton soup and entered to tube with sterilized physiological serum. Questionnaires were filled among patients by midwife. The cases were followed by taking Pap smear and wet smear, calturing and filling the second questionnaire. Finally, the results in medical, microbiological and cytological diagnosis were compared. The sensivity and specifity of each diagnostic method were evaluated using statistical methods. Results: Results of the study showed that the most outbreaks of <b>trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis</b> were at age group between 21 to 35 (52. 6 %) and the lowest prevalence was among women less than 20 (5. 3 %) years old. It is reported 78 cases of trichomonas in clinical examination, but none of culture medias has demonstrated trichomonas. Percentage of false positive at clinical diagnosis method was 26 % more than culture method and 25. 7 % more than wet smear and Pap smear methods. Conclusion: Paraclinic with clinical examination {{play an important role}} in diagnosis and treatment of vaginitis.

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the clinical and laboratory features of <b>trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis</b> (TV) in a chronic vaginitis clinic. Methods: We studied 45 women with symptomatic TV attending a specialty chronic vaginitis clinic. These patients were older than the usual symptomatic patients with TV. They frequently described unusual chronicity of symptoms, half being referred because of clinical resistance {{and the other half}} referred because of chronic vaginitis of unknown etiology. Results: In spite of the chronicity of infection, the signs and symptoms of florid inflammation were still evident and high numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and parasitic load were present. Conclusions: A longstanding infection, especially if previously untreated, invariably responded to conventional nitroimidazole therapy. In. addition, the majority of patients seen with clinical resistance to the conventional doses of metronidazole responded to high-dose oral metronidazole therapy. Unsuspected TV should always be considered in low-risk patients with chronic vulvovaginal symptoms. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mucosal infections {{including}} {{vulvovaginal candidiasis}} {{are a common}} problem for women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Our objective was to determine which factors predict the development of symptomatic disease among HIV-infected women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study from 1991 to 1995, 205 HIV-positive women were evaluated every 6 months for occurrences of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Included {{in the study were}} all initially asymptomatic women, whether they were fungal-culture-positive or -negative at baseline. Excluded from the study were all women with symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis at the initial visit, those who developed <b>trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis</b> at any visit, and those who used any antifungal agents. RESULTS: The risk of the development of vulvovaginal candidiasis did not differ between women who were asymptomatically colonized at baseline and those who were fungal-culture-negative. However, the risk of developing vulvovaginal candidiasis was increased 6. 8 times for women with CD 4 counts less than 200 cells/mm 3 at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal culture is not predictive of the development of symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis. Women infected with HIV who have CD 4 counts below 200 cells/mm 3 should be monitored more carefully for vulvovaginal candidiasis...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Vaginitis {{is one of}} the {{principal}} motives that lead women to seek out an obstetrician or gynecologist. Bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and trichomoniasis are responsible for 90 % of the cases of infectious vaginitis. OBJECTIVE: To verify the frequency of the three main causative agents of <b>vaginitis,</b> <b>Trichomonas</b> vaginalis, Candida sp and Gardnerella vaginalis, in four different decades (1960 's, 1970 's, 1980 's and 1990 's). DESIGN: Retrospective. PLACE: A tertiary referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Patients attended to as gynecology and obstetrics outpatients at the Faculdade de Medicina do Triângulo Mineiro during the years 1968, 1978, 1988, 1998, taken as samples of each decade. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Diagnoses of infection by Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida sp and Gardnerella vaginalis were gathered from 20, 356 cervical-vaginal cytology tests on patients attended to as gynecology outpatients at Faculdade de Medicina do Triângulo Mineiro during the years 1968, 1978, 1988, 1998, representing the four decades. The results were grouped according to the age group of the patients: under 20, between 20 and 29, between 30 and 39, between 40 and 49, and 50 or over. Statistical analysis was done via the chi-squared (Mantel-Haentzel) test with a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: In 1968 infections by Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida sp were diagnosed in 10 % and 0. 5 % of the cytology tests and in 1978, 5. 1 % and 17. 3 %, respectively (P < 0. 0001). Infection by Gardnerella vaginalis could only be evaluated in the latter two decades. In 1988, 19. 8 % of the women had positive tests for Gardnerella vaginalis, which was the most frequent agent in that year, diminishing in the subsequent decade to 15. 9 % (P < 0. 0001). Candidiasis was the most frequent infection in 1998, detected in 22. 5 % of the tests (P < 0. 0001). In a general manner, all the infections were most frequent among younger patients, especially those aged under 20, in all decades, whereas infections were least frequent among patients aged 50 or over (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: There was a reduction in the frequency of cervical-vaginal infection by Trichomonas vaginalis and an increase in the frequency of Candida sp over the four decades studied. All the infections were most frequent in patients aged under 20 years...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review {{critically}} and {{to summarize}} the evidence of diagnostic tests and culture media for the diagnosis of <b>Trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis.</b> METHODS: We performed a systematic review of literature indexed in MEDLINE of studies that used Trichomonas culture as the reference standard (9, 882 patients, 35 studies). Level I studies (5, 047 patients, 13 studies) fulfilled {{at least two of}} three criteria: 1) consecutive patients were evaluated prospectively, 2) decision to culture was not influenced by test results, and 3) there was independent and blind comparison to culture. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR) was 95 % (95 % CI 91 % to 99 %), and the specificity was 98 % (95 % CI 96 % to 100 %). One study was classified as Level I evidence (52 patients). The sensitivity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 82 % (95 % CI 74 % to 90 %), and the specificity was 73 % (95 % CI 35 % to 100 %).

40|$|Trichomonas vaginalis is {{a common}} sexually {{transmitted}} infection (STI) causing vaginitis. Microscopy has poor sensitivity but is used for diagnosis of trichomoniasis in resource-poor settings. We aimed {{to provide a more}} reliable diagnosis of trichomoniasis by investigating an association with leukorrhea. Women presenting for evaluation of vaginal discharge, STI exposure, or preven-tative gynecologic examination were evaluated for Trichomonas infection. Vaginal pH was determined andmicroscopy was per-formed by the provider, who recorded the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) per epithelial cell and the pres-ence of clue cells, yeast, and/or motile trichomonads. Leukorrhea was defined as greater than one PMNL per epithelial cell. Culture and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were used to detect T. vaginalis. Patients were evaluated for Chlamydia trachomatis andNeisseria gonorrhoeae using NAATs and bacterial vaginosis using Gram stains. Two hundred ninety-four women were enrolled, and 16 %were found to have Trichomonas (46 / 294). Trichomonas infection was more common in parous non-Hispanic, black women, who reported low rates of contraceptive use (33 % versus 17 %; P 0. 02) and a STI history (85 % versus 55 %; P 0. 002).

40|$|Background: Vaginitis is a {{commonly}} encountered complaint {{and one of}} the most frequent reasons for patient visit to obstetrician-gynaecologists. Three vaginal infections are frequent causes of a vaginal discharge: (1) bacterial vaginosis, (2) vulvovaginal candidiasis and (3) <b>trichomonas</b> <b>vaginitis.</b> Differences in the clinical presentation are helpful in diagnosis. Characteristic signs and symptoms for these three vaginal infections are distinct, but on many occasions, they are overlapping. The aim of the present study was to find the prevalence and correlation between the clinical spectrum and laboratory evidence of Trichomonas vaginalis infection by simple, reliable, confirmatory and specific method, i. e. microscopic examination of wet mount preparation and acridine stain of vaginal fluid. Materials and Methods: Irrespective of HIV status, a total of 156 women with vaginal discharge were studied for establishing diagnosis of genital tract infection. The cases of bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis were excluded from the study. Vaginal speculum assisted high vaginal swabs were collected from women with discharge, during collection vagina was inspected for obvious signs. Results: Of the 156 women with vaginal discharge, 19 (12. 06 %) showed T. vaginalis infection. All the women belonged to active reproductive age group, i. e. 20 - 40 years. Itching dysuria, and offensive, malodorous, thin, yellowish vaginal discharge were the main and consistent complaints. Only in 2 (1. 52 %) cases, vaginal speculum examination revealed erythema and punctuate haemorrhage, the so-called "strawberry′ vagina. The pH was recorded to be > 4. 5.

The average total doses used was 7155 mg in the cases cured, and 423 mg in the cases who had recurrence. As for the side effect 30. 5 per cent showed the side effects mainly consisting of the gastro-intestinal disturbances. However, the side effect was most noticeable in those given a daily dosage of 6 CCmg, but those given the daily dosage of 300 mg or 400 mg showed only a slight side effect, and those receiving the drug in tablet form showed no side effect at all. Those treated continuously for a quite length of time hardly revealed any ill effect either. As for the treatment of the vaginitis by combination of oral and suppository administration, one tablet containing 50 mg of trichothothiazole inserted into the vagina at the first call to the hospital has much more germicidal effect than the oral adminstration alone, and in addition, there is no side effect in evidence. In comparing the cured cases and recurrent cases and studying the amount and the method of administration of the drug in the treatment of recurrent cases, we consider that the daily dosage of 300 mg or 400 mg given continuously until the total amount reaches about 7, 000 mg will yield the result and that the spouse should also be treated concurrently in order to obtain a better result...|$|E
