25|$|As a <b>tactical</b> <b>weapon</b> for {{military}} use, {{a significant problem}} with a BW attack {{is that it would}} take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents (smallpox, pneumonic plague) have the capability of person-to-person transmission via aerosolized respiratory droplets. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW is less of a concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.|$|E
25|$|Although {{innovative}} {{and capable of}} good ballistic performance, the Reffye mitrailleuse failed as a <b>tactical</b> <b>weapon</b> because its basic concept and operational usage were flawed. Furthermore, only 210 Reffye mitrailleuses were in existence {{at the beginning of}} the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Their field use was discontinued by the French Army after 1871. After the Gatling gun was replaced in service by newer recoil- or gas-operated weapons, the approach of using multiple barrels fell into disuse for many decades. However, some examples were developed during the interwar years, but only existed as prototypes, or were rarely used. The word mitrailleuse nonetheless became the generic term for a machine gun in the French language because of its early appearance in the field of weapons, although the mitrailleuse itself was manually operated.|$|E

500|$|From {{his early}} days, Auerbach was {{convinced}} that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent <b>tactical</b> <b>weapon.</b> This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man, stating: [...] "Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone {{out of his way to}} achieve them. We have never had the league's top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Operation Pop Eye / Motorpool / Intermediary-Compatriot was {{a highly}} {{classified}} weather modification program in Southeast Asia during 1967–1972 that was developed from research conducted on Okinawa and other locations. [...] A report titled Rainmaking in SEASIA outlines use of lead iodide and silver iodide deployed by aircraft in a program that was developed in California at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and tested in Okinawa, Guam, Philippines, Texas, and Florida in a hurricane study program called Project Stormfury. [...] The chemical weather modification program conducted from Thailand over Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam was allegedly sponsored by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and CIA without the authorization of Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird who had categorically denied to Congress that a program for modification of the weather {{for use as a}} <b>tactical</b> <b>weapon</b> even existed.

50|$|The pod is {{equipped}} with a laser designator for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions. A laser rangefinder provides information for various avionics systems, for example, navigation updates, weapon deliveries and target updates. The targeting pod includes an automatic target tracker to provide fully automatic stabilized target tracking at altitudes, airspeeds and slant ranges consistent with <b>tactical</b> <b>weapon</b> delivery maneuvers. These features simplify the functions of target detection and recognition, and permit attack of targets with precision-guided weapons on a single pass.|$|E
50|$|A neutron bomb, officially {{defined as}} a type of {{enhanced}} radiation weapon (ERW), is a low yield thermonuclear weapon designed to maximize lethal neutron radiation in the immediate vicinity of the blast while minimizing the physical power of the blast itself. The neutron release generated by a nuclear fusion reaction is intentionally allowed to escape the weapon, rather than being absorbed by its other components. The neutron burst, which is used as the primary destructive action of the warhead, is able to penetrate enemy armor more effectively than a conventional warhead, thus making it more lethal as a <b>tactical</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hitler {{had noticed}} one {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} defences. The roofs were flat and unprotected; he demanded to know if a glider, such as the DFS 230, could land on them. Student replied {{that it could be}} done, but only by 12 aircraft and in daylight; this would deliver 80-90 paratroopers onto the target.Hitler then revealed the <b>tactical</b> <b>weapon</b> that would make this strategic operation work, introducing the Hohlladungwaffe (hollow-charge) - a 50 kg explosive weapon which would destroy the Belgian gun emplacements. It was this tactical unit that would spearhead the first strategic airborne operation in history.|$|E
25|$|Shifting gears, Livermore {{settled for}} taking ideas Los Alamos had shelved and {{developing}} {{them for the}} Army and Navy. This led Livermore to specialize in small-diameter <b>tactical</b> <b>weapons,</b> particularly ones using two-point implosion systems, such as the Swan. Small-diameter <b>tactical</b> <b>weapons</b> became primaries for small-diameter secondaries. Around 1960, when the superpower arms race became a ballistic missile race, Livermore warheads were more useful than the large, heavy Los Alamos warheads. Los Alamos warheads were used on the first intermediate-range ballistic missiles, IRBMs, but smaller Livermore warheads were used on the first intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, SLBMs, {{as well as on}} the first multiple warhead systems on such missiles.|$|R

The mobile launch platform will carry six missiles, which can have different kind of warheads meant for different targets and can be fired in salvo mode in all directions covering the entire azimuth plane.|$|E
