5000|$|A {{new version}} of <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> appears in <b>the</b> Flashpoint reality. Michael Desai was born in Chandigarh, India, an infant meta-human with {{alabaster}} skin and superhuman durability. When his mother died during his birth (for which Desai's father blamed him), Desai created a sinkhole with a three-mile radius which killed thousands of people and left him the only survivor. How Desai accomplished this feat (and the extent of this power) is currently unknown. Years later, Michael adopted the alias of [...] "The Outsider" [...] (as he is both [...] "outside" [...] {{the law and the}} human race) and accumulates considerable wealth through (implied) illegal activities. This allows Desai to elevate India's status as a world power, turning the country into a multinational criminal operation completely under his control. <b>The</b> <b>Outsider</b> has also made many enemies; Rising Sun and Mister and Misses Terrific tried to assassinate him after Desai framed them when they revealed some of his illegal activities. <b>The</b> <b>Outsider</b> then killed all three would-be assassins and set out for the man who hired them. Desai is also engaged in a manhunt to find (and capture) a teenage electricity-based meta-human named Blackout, whom he believes can efficiently power mainland India with his abilities. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> was invited by the heroes of Earth to a meeting (arranged by Cyborg) about creating a group of heroes to deal with the Amazon-Atlantean War. <b>The</b> <b>Outsider's</b> reasons for supporting the heroes revolve around maintaining his empire; he responds to the threat of war by saying, [...] "War is bad for business. My business." [...] When Batman refuses to join <b>the</b> team <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> declines as well, stating [...] "the Outsider is out". Desai is revealed to have longevity, since he is shown to be active in Indian criminal and political affairs since the late 1970s. In 1979 <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> quelled <b>the</b> Bombay Riots by manipulating and subsequently killing the crime leaders responsible for the violence, uniting their organizations under his leadership. In 1996 <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> captured Isis in his Siberian Express on Novaya Zemlya in a bid to blackmail Black Adam into selling Desai his home country, Khandaq. However, when negotiating terms for Isis' release <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> attacked and defeated Black Adam with Durlan technology. <b>The</b> <b>Outsider</b> then shot Adam and threw him off the Siberian Express to join Isis as his trophy-prisoner. In the present day, <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> is shown interrogating the warden at the prison from which the assassins escaped. Although the warden claimed to know nothing about the prisoners' breakout, <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> shoots him and has his family sold into slavery in retribution for his incompetence. <b>The</b> <b>Outsider's</b> investigation then leads him to Khandaq, where he uncovers an encryption key which links Blackout to the assassination attempt. Later, Desai apparently confronts Blackout; however, he realizes that the man he is fighting is not Blackout but J'onn J'onzz in disguise. In 1985, <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> is revealed to have kept J'onn J'onzz captive in a secret research facility after stealing Doctor Erdel's teleportation device. After studying him and learning his weaknesses, <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> sold J'onn to Russia; he subsequently escaped, and seized the country. In the present day, after <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> talks with J'onn about the past J'onn admits to seeking revenge against Desai for torturing him and tries to kill him. During <b>the</b> battle, <b>Outsider</b> uses a salvaged teleportation device to trap J'onn within the Multiverse. After unsuccessfully questioning J'onn about future assassination attempts <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> closed <b>the</b> device with J'onn trapped inside, cutting him in half. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Outsider</b> returns to his base and contacts the heroes to join the assault on New Themyscira. and arrives on the scene to attack in the Atlantean-Amazon war.|$|R
