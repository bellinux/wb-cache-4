Apoptosis is {{essential}} for the maintenance of homeostasis and apoptotic dysregulation has been implicated numerous human diseases. Apoptotic events are mediated through a unique family of aspartyl proteases, caspases. Our study tested the effectiveness of nontoxic, O-phenoxy-conjugates caspase inhibitors to prevent cell death. Human leukemia cells were treated with Boc-D(OMe) -OPh, Cbz-D(OMe) -OPh, Q-D(OMe) -OPh, Boc-VD(OMe) -OPh, Cbz-VD(OMe) -OPh, Q-VD(OMe) -OPh, and Q-VE(OMe) -OPh. The cells were induced to undergo apoptosis and the inhibitory effectiveness of the compounds was evaluated. Our results indicate the drugs that contained the dipeptide VD were more effective at inhibiting cell death than those that contained aspartic acid (D) alone.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} pelvic arch interference and the depth of the pelvic cavity, as shown on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), on the performance of extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (ELRP). Materials and Methods: In 115 patients, pelvic bone images were obtained at the time of prostate MRI before ELRP. In the reconstructed sagittal plane, we measured the <b>true</b> <b>conjugate</b> diameter, the obstetric conjugate diameter, the difference between the true and obstetric diameters, and the distance between the <b>true</b> <b>conjugate</b> and the prostate apex (pelvic depth). We analyzed which factors were associated with operative time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), and positive surgical margins (PSMs). Results: The difference between the true and obstetric conjugate diameters was 12. 7 ± 3. 7 mm, and the pelvic depth was 59. 9 ± 6. 0 mm. The OT, EBL, and the rate of PSMs were 260. 1 ± 91. 1 minutes, 633. 3 ± 524. 7 ml, and 19 % (22 / 115), respectively. According to multiple linear regression analysis, predictors of a higher EBL included pelvic depth (3. 0 % higher per 1 mm increase in diameter difference, p= 0. 01) and prostate volume (1. 5 % higher per 1 cc increase in prostate volume, p= 0. 002). Factors associated with a longer OT were pelvic depth (p= 0. 04), serum prostate-specific antigen (p= 0. 04), prostate volume (p= 0. 02), and Gleason score (p= 0. 001). For PSMs, only pT 2 was an independent factor. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the depth of the pelvic cavity and prostate volume may increase surgical difficulty in patients undergoing ELRP.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a robust timing offset {{estimation}} method using sub-autocorrelation functions for uni- and bi-directional chirp signals. The presented timing offset estimator {{is designed to be}} applied with a generalized chirp signal sequence, which use uni- or bi-directional chirp symbols. Using the conjugate property of the chirp signal, the sub-autocorrelation functions are generated to be applied with the received chirp signals and the resulting performance is improved. Conventional timing offset estimators are difficult to apply to IEEE 802. 15. 4 a and ISO/IEC 24730 - 5 systems because spurious peaks are generated near the arrival time of the <b>true</b> signal. The <b>conjugate</b> and symmetric properties between uni- and bi-directional chirp signals are exploited to improve the performance of the timing offset estimator. The performance analysis of the proposed scheme is presented in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulation results indicate that the proposed estimator has a smaller RMSE than other conventional estimators.

40|$|In {{this note}} we prove a new ϵ-regularity theorem for the Ricci flow. Let (M^n,g(t)) with t∈ [-T, 0] be a Ricci flow and H_x the {{conjugate}} heat kernel centered {{at a point}} (x, 0) in the final time slice. Substituting H_x into Perelman's W-functional produces a monotone function W_x(s) of s ∈ [-T, 0], the pointed entropy, with W_x(s) 0, depending only on T and on lower scalar curvature and μ-entropy bounds for (M,g(-T)), such that W_x_ 0 (s) > -ϵ implies |Rm|< r^- 2 on P_ϵ r(x, 0), where r^ 2 = |s| and P_r(x,t) ≡ B_r(x,t) × (t-r^ 2,t] is the parabolic ball. The main technical challenge of the theorem is to prove an effective Lipschitz bound in x for the s-average of W_x(s). To accomplish this, we require a new log-Sobolev inequality. It is well known by Perelman that the metric measure spaces (M,g(t),dv_g(t)) satisfy a log-Sobolev; however we prove that this is also <b>true</b> for the <b>conjugate</b> heat kernel weighted spaces (M,g(t),H_x(-,t) dv_g(t)). Our log-Sobolev constants for these weighted spaces are in fact universal and sharp. The weighted log-Sobolev has other consequences as well, including an average Gaussian upper bound on the conjugate heat kernel that only depends on a two-sided scalar curvature bound...|$|R

Analyzing caesarean sections can help to identify factors associated with variations in CSR and help to assess the quality of clinical care. Methods In a retrospective observational study, during a two year period, indications of 576 caesarean sections were analyzed using intra-operative internal pelvimetry and a record keeping system in a semi-rural hospital in Northern Namibia. Results Most caesarean sections were done for dystocia (34 %) followed by repeat caesarean section (31 %). The <b>true</b> <b>conjugate</b> (distance between the promontorium to mid pubic bone) was significantly smaller in these recurrent indication groups when compared to non recurrent indications. Conclusion In this rural hospital the introduction of Delee Pelvimetry and a caesarean section record keeping system {{was found to be}} a simple and cheap method to analyse indications for caesarean sections, which may help in reducing unnecessary caesarean sections. </p...|$|E

40|$|Ubiquitylation is an {{indispensable}} post-translational modification system in eukaryotic cells {{that leads to}} the covalent attachment of a small ubiquitin (Ub) protein onto a target. The traditional and best-characterized role for ubiquitylation is a fundamental regulatory mechanism whereby target proteins are tagged with a characteristic Lys 48 -linked Ub chain that signals for their elimination through proteasomal degradation. Challenging this conventional wisdom is the finding that some ubiquitylated proteins are modified by Ub chains linked through Lys 63, providing a molecular signal that is thought to be structurally and functionally distinct from Lys 48 -linked Ub chains. Of further interest and significance is that the Lys 63 -linked Ub chains are apparently synthesized through a novel biochemical mechanism employing a unique complex formed between a <b>true</b> Ub <b>conjugating</b> enzyme (E 2), Ubc 13, and an E 2 -variant (Uev), Mms 2 (or Uev 1 A). The goal of this thesis was to employ structural and functional approaches in order to better characterize the Ubc 13 -Mms 2 Lys 63 -linked Ub conjugation complex. Error-free DNA damage tolerance (DDT) in the budding yeast is dependent on Lys 63 -linked Ub chains synthesized by Ubc 13 -Mms 2 and thus provided the opportunity to experimentally test the function of the human UBC 13 and MMS 2 genes in a simple model organism. Human UBC 13 and MMS 2 were each shown to function in place of their yeast counterparts and in accordance, human Ubc 13 was shown to physically interact with yeast Mms 2, and vice versa. Two human MMS 2 homologs were also tested and it was determined that UEV 1 A but not UEV 1 B can function in place of mms 2 in yeast DDT. Physical interactions were observed between Ubc 13 and Uev 1 A, but not between Ubc 13 and Uev 1 B, suggesting that Ubc 13 -Uev complex formation is required for function. In collaboration with a research group at the University of Alberta, crystal structure and NMR data were used to develop a mechanistic model for the conjugation of Lys 63 -linked Ub chains by the Ubc 13 -Mms 2 heterodimer, whereby the special orientation of two Ub molecules facilitates a specific Ub-Ub linkage via Lys 63. In order to help support the in vitro model and to determine how the Ubc 13 -Mms 2 structure relates to biological function, I used a structure-based approach to direct the creation of point mutations within four key regions of the Ubc 13 -Mms 2 heterodimer; the Ubc 13 active-site, the Ubc 13 -E 3 (Ub ligating enzyme) interface, the Mms 2 -Ub interface, and the Ubc 13 -Mms 2 interface. Underscoring the importance of the Ub conjugation by Ubc 13 -Mms 2, a Ubc 13 -C 87 S active-site mutation was created that could bind to Mms 2 but was unable to function in DDT. Regarding the Ubc 13 -E 3 interface, a single Ubc 13 -M 64 A point mutation had a potent effect on disrupting Ubc 13 function in DDT, as well as its physical interaction with Rad 5, TRAF 6, and CHFR. The results suggest that different RING finger E 3 s use the same Ubc 13 surface to sequester the Ub conjugation activity of Ubc 13 -Mms 2. Two human Mms 2 mutations at Ser 32 and Ile 62, which are contained within the Mms 2 -Ub interface, were found to reduce the ability of Mms 2 to bind Ub. When the corresponding yeast mutations are combined, a synergistic loss in DDT function is observed. The relative orientation of Ser 32 and Ile 62 suggests that the Mms 2 and Tsg 101 Uev families use different Uev surfaces to physically interact with Ub. A 200 ìM dissociation constant for the wild-type Mms 2 -Ub interaction was also determined. The systematic mutagenesis and testing of 14 Ubc 13 -Mms 2 interface residues led to mutants with partial or complete disruption of binding and function. Using this data, a model involving the insertion of a specific Mms 2 -Phe residue into a unique Ubc 13 hydrophobic pocket was created to explain the specificity of Mms 2 for Ubc 13, and not other E 2 s. In addition, the dissociation constant for the wild-type Ubc 13 -Mms 2 heterodimer was determined to be approximately 50 nM. The structural and functional studies strongly support the notion that Ubc 13 -Mms 2 complex has the unique ability to conjugate Lys 63 -linked Ub chains. However, several reported instances of Lys 63 -linked Ub chains in vivo have not yet been attributed to Ubc 13 or Mms 2. To address the disparity I was able to demonstrate and map a physical interaction between Mms 2 and Rsp 5, an E 3 implicated in Lys 63 -linked Ub conjugation. Surprisingly, it was found that MMS 2 is not responsible for the RSP 5 -dependent Lys 63 -linked Ub conjugation of a plasma membrane protein. A possible explanation for the apparent paradox is presented...|$|R
