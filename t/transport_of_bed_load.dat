40|$|From {{the group}} {{movement}} of the bed load within the bottom layer, details of the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of bed load movement are discussed in this paper. Whether the sediment is initiated into motion corresponds to whether the constant term in the equation is equal to zero. If constant term is zero and no dispersive force is considered, the equation represents the traditional Shields initiation curve, and if constant term is zero without the dispersive force being considered, then a new Shields curve which is {{much lower than the}} traditional one is got. The fixed point of the equation corresponds to the equilibrium sediment <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> In the mutation analysis, we have found that the inflection point is the demarcation point of breaking. In theory, the breaking point corresponds to the dividing boundary line, across which the bed form changes from flat bed to sand ripple or sand dune.

40|$|Abundant river {{sediment}} {{supply and}} an open-water central bay area characterize the geomorphology {{of the large}} Columbia River estuary (~ 100 km in length). Lateral floodplains and marsh islands do constrict the uppermost reaches of the estuary, but the central axes of the lower estuary are dominated by shallow sand shoals (0 – 4 m water depth). A total of 58 vibracores are used to document the grain size and age (0 – 2, 500 14 CyrBP) of late Holocene deposits in the estuary. Sedimentation rates in stable floodplains (1. 1 m ka- 1) reflect rates of relative sea level rise (0. 75 m ka- 1). Sedimentation rates of muddy sand accretionary banks and prehistoric sand shoals (1. 5 – 7 m ka- 1) greatly exceed coeval rates of sea level rise, so they must represent short–term rates of vertical accretion resulting from channel lateral migration and associated cut and fill processes. The apparent paradox of unfilled accommodation space in the estuary is resolved by 1) winter wind–wave erosion of sand shoals to- 3 m NAVD 88 elevation and 2) asymmetric fluvial-tidal advection that results in net seaward <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> in shallow tidal channels (> – 10 m NAVD 88) and shallow subtidal shoals (> – 4 m NAVD 88) during spring river flooding...|$|E

The data acquired were the distribution of flow speed and the spread <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> along the estuary during dry season. Seventeen locations along the river estuary were selected started from about 1500 m upstream the coastline. The speed measurements were carried out in two points at each location, at 0. 6 of the river depth and on riverbed. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> measurements were done at points close to the riverbed (0. 4 to 0. 6 cm approaching the riverbed). The modeling of the river flow speed at the points near the riverbed {{as well as at}} the points 0. 6 of the depth during low tides showed a decrease in the speed distribution pattern with increasing distance up to the coastline. At the times <b>of</b> low tide, <b>transports</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> takes place in the estuary region of Ranoyapo River. The increase of flow speed due to the increase of flow debit will result in the increase of flow velocity that may exceed the critical value.

The sediment volume trapped in the seven sediment traps before (reference date August 2005 AD) and after the flood event (March 2006 AD) was compared, and the sedimentological composition of each trap was analyzed. The amounts of sediment deposited in the sediment traps were also analyzed and conclusions regarding the stability of the different river reaches between two sediment traps were drawn.

In the present study, a physics-based two-dimensional model has been developed to simulate the braiding processes and morphodynamic changes in braided rivers.

Comparisons between the experimental river and predicted river are analysed, including their pattern evolution processes, important braiding phenomena, and statistical characteristics. Avulsion activities have been found in the braiding evolution process, representing the primary ways in which channels form and disappear in braided rivers.

40|$|Alluvial rivers {{transport}} {{much more}} sediment annually through {{a cross section}} than might {{be accounted for by}} localized scour and fill <b>of</b> the channel <b>bed</b> and banks. In gravel-bed rivers in Colorado, for example, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sediment yields are typically on the order of a few tons/km 2 /yr, thus streams draining areas of ~ 100 km 2 might <b>transport</b> the equivalent <b>of</b> ~ 100 m 3 <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> each year. These loads are not high in comparison to rivers in some other regions; however, even under these conditions, the processes <b>of</b> flow and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>transport</b> must be very tightly coupled, otherwise the balance between sediment input and output would quickly shift and the channel would become unstable. Through a series of studies conducted over the last 10 -plus years we have tired {{to take advantage of the}} fact that channel properties are not nearly as variable in space or time as is the process <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>transport,</b> and in so doing have developed a clearer understanding of the interactions between sediment transport and the morphology of alluvial channels. We have investigated trends in <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport intensity and frequency in relation to flow and channel properties at hundreds of sites on gravel-bed streams and rivers in Colorado and Utah. In addition we have conducted extensive analyses <b>of</b> flow and <b>transport</b> measurements from streams and rivers throughout the West to develop new relations for transport in steep streams with high relative roughness.

Strambed structures are arrangements of boulders and cobbles deposited during extreme floods, in a stable configuration exhibiting high dissipation of flow. Field experiments were carried out in a mountain stream in Yunnan, southwestern China, studying <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> movement on three typical streambeds, i. e., with well developed, partially developed, and no structures. An underwater observation and video-capturing system was designed to observe and measure the movement <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> particles.

Results showed that the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> movement was highly associated with streambed condition. With well-developed structures, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> particles moved intermittently through saltation and the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate was very low.

In July 1990, six seismometers were placed along the alluvial channel for up to about 150 m upstream of the flow gauging station. Continuous microseismic recordings of seven flood flows were analysed, five being associated with coarse sediment delivery. The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>transport</b> was inferred from two or three microseismic impulse peaks occurring before and after the discharge peak shown in the hydrograph.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{foundation to}} maintain the Holland Coast shoreward of the - 20 m depth contour is limited. It is assumed that profile perturbations shoreward of the - 20 m depth contour influence the coast within a time scale of 50 to 200 years. Hence, seaward of - 20 m NAP dredging companies are allowed to dredge sand. The dredged material is amongst others applied in nourishments near the beach. In order to naturally preserve the shoreface of the Dutch Coast, coastal policy in The Netherlands prescribes that the sediment volume of Holland Coast should be preserved shoreward of the - 20 m depth contour. The volume required to accomplish this can be significantly reduced in case a shallower depth contour can be assumed. In order to investigate the influence of perturbations shoreward of - 20 m NAP and to validate the scientific foundation of the - 20 m depth contour, cross-shore sediment transport on various depth contours will be analysed. The emphasis of this research will lie on sediment transport on the lower shoreface (deeper than - 10 m NAP). Sediment transport will be evaluated with the model Unibest-TC. First, sediment transport sensitivity on a straight slope due to varying parameters (wave height, wave period, grain size, slope steepness, water depth and magnitude of Longuet-Higgins streaming) is analysed. Besides, non-dimensional numbers and transport equations were considered to extend the analysis. In the analysis the dominance, direction and magnitude of the wave related and current related <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> both the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> and suspended load is investigated. Subsequently, sediment transport due to variable wave conditions on various depth contours is examined from the shoreface profile of Noordwijk. Also the situations with a variable wave angle and a tidal current was considered. Finally, morphological simulations, including a 100 -year profile evolution and profile perturbations (e. g. sand pits) located on the lower shoreface, were performed. Shoreface sediment transport depends on the wave steepness {{in combination with the}} slope steepness for every depth contour. This was concluded by analysing sediment transport sensitivity for a range of parameter settings. Sediment transport due to wave action is particular present on the upper shoreface. Although, the onshore directed <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport is dominant on the lower shoreface (provided that the orbital velocity induced shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress), its relative contributions is negligible in case a tidal current is included. It was found that low amplitude waves are responsible for the largest profile changes. On the lower shoreface, the tidal current induced offshore sediment transport is dominant. Onshore transport on the upper shoreface and offshore transport on the lower shoreface induce a lower shoreface flattening and an upper shoreface steepening. Perturbations located at the - 15 m, - 20 m and - 25 m NAP depth contours propagate shoreward caused by tidal current induced concentration gradients. Sediment transport induced by waves result in diffusion of profile perturbations and a limited shoreward shifting. Only at - 15 m NAP a clearly visible propagation is visible. A situation including a tidal current, results in a larger shoreward propagation of the sand pits/artificial ridges at - 25 m NAP than at - 15 m NAP. A larger depth dependent tidal velocity induced sediment transport gradient at - 25 m NAP is responsible for this phenomenon. So, the interaction of waves and tidal currents is of great importance on the entire shoreface profile and may have a large impact on cross-shore sediment transport.

40|$|Bed load <b>transport,</b> the {{movement}} <b>of</b> sediment by water or air {{in close proximity}} to the river bed or ground surface, is governed by complex interactions among fluid, particles, and evolving bed topography. Recognizing the limitations of deterministic, equilibrium approaches in capturing these interactions and accurately predicting <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> flux, recent studies have shown the advantages of adopting a stochastic approach, i. e., one that treats system components as random variables. One hallmark <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> is the presence of unpredictable and often extreme temporal fluctuations in transport rates. The goal of this dissertation is to understand these transient processes, both as generated by the internal dynamics <b>of</b> a steadily-driven <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> system and in response to changes in external forcing. Field and experimental observations have been obtained to study the ensemble statistics <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>transport</b> over time scales ranging from milliseconds to hours and to consider how statistical metrics <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> change with observational time scale. Flume experiments and field observations show how sand bed forms (ripples and dunes) respond in a lagged manner to changes in water discharge, and how this lagged response produces hysteresis in bed form dimensions through flood waves. Field observations of wind-blown sand demonstrate how turbulent fluctuations in wind stress drive lagged variations in sand flux that produce systematically time-scale biased estimates of the stress-flux relationship. Flume experiments that track gravel particle trajectories reveal the role of ballistic particle motion, intermittent transport, and heavy-tailed particle waiting times in producing particle dispersion that deviates from normal diffusion expectations; these experiments also indicate the potential for the statistical mechanical formalism to describe <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> dispersion. Idealized two-dimensional flume experiments demonstrate the importance of particle collisions for incipient motion and collective transport, and they show how the distribution of particle waiting times is related to the stochastic but mean-reverting tendencies <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> evolution.

The study reach is straight and includes a small, low-relief mid-channel bar which represents the divide between two zones <b>of</b> markedly different <b>bed</b> structure and stability. he <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the left channel and bar tail is loose with an open framework, while that of the bar head and right channel is tightly interlocking and well imbricated. Bed surface grain size is similar throughout the reach. The two zones <b>of</b> contrasting <b>bed</b> structure have a strong influence {{on the threshold of}} sediment movement (τ c) and consequently the spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>transport.</b> Entrainment thresholds for the tightly structured bed are up to seven times higher than those for the loosely structured bed. Sediment transport is therefore most frequent in the left channel and over the bar tail, where flows with excess shear stresses (τ > τc) peaking at 8 τc constitute 19 % of the flow record. This is in marked contrast to the right channel and bar head, where excess shear stresses of maximum 1. 4 τc total only 1. 3 % of the flow record. However, despite the marked difference in the magnitude and duration of competent flows between the two contrasting bed areas, little difference in <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> yield is observed between the nine traps when averaged over the 14 -month study period. This study shows that different zones <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> structure and stability in a channel will control the incidence and spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>transport</b> but not necessarily the medium and long-term <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> yield.

To elucidate this point, we investigated the motion of coarse spherical glass beads entrained by a shallow turbulent water flow down a steep two-dimensional channel with a mobile bed.

Bed load equilibrium flows were achieved (i. e. neither erosion nor deposition of particles occurred on average, over sufficiently long time intervals). Flows were filmed from the side by a high-speed camera. Using an image processing software made it possible to determine the flow characteristics such as particle trajectories, their state of motion (rest, rolling or saltating motion), and flow depth.

Water Resources Research, 42 We assess how {{the size of}} the Helley-Smith (HS) <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sampler nozzle affects the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sampling. Semitheoretical considerations show that the larger grains resident on the streambed can influence the sample either by blocking the sampler entrance or by causing the sampler to rest in a ??perched?? position. Probabilities for interference can be derived from the distribution of grain sizes but they do not capture the actual complexity of the influence <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> on sampler performance. We therefore make an empirical comparison of sediment trapped by HS samplers with 76 - and 152 -mm intakes during floods in the gravel bed lower Ebro River. Most <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> rates appeared higher when sampled with the HS 152. The largest clasts collected by the HS 76 also tend to be smaller than those obtained with the HS 152 at the same flow. Analyzing paired <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> samples, we find the probability <b>of</b> a <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sample collected with the HS 152 to be biased is around 43 % in the conditions of the present study, whereas 65 % of samples were biased when obtained with the HS 76.

40|$|The {{grain size}} {{distributions}} <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> collected during flows {{that range from}} the threshold of motion to near bankfull in Nahal Eshtemoa, a coarse-grained ephemeral stream of southern Israel, give an unequivocal quantification of the change from unequal to near-equal mobility of grains of all available sizes. This second threshold occurs at ∼ 4. 5 times the shear stress associated with initial motion (4. 5 тc). The level determined in Eshtemoa {{is much higher than}} previously defined by laboratory flume studies. The difference probably reflects the tighter packing and the greater interlock of natural streambeds and carries implications for a number of issues, including the modeling <b>of</b> sediment <b>transport,</b> especially in the context of dryland reservoir sedimentation. The proportion of time that flow exceeds 4. 5 тc determines the size distribution <b>of</b> cumulative <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> Using a flow duration/sediment transport approach, in which fractional transport rates by grain size class are predicted with Parker's [1979] <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> function, it can be shown that the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> coarsens as the flow duration curve of individual flash floods incorporates progressively higher flows of variable duration. The method has utility because simple flood parameters such as peak discharge are imperfect predictors of sediment flux, particularly in desert streams where the shape of the flood hydrograph varies considerably from event to event. It is also shown that over a longer period (annual or decadal) the caliber <b>of</b> cumulative <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> depends upon the spectrum of flows in incident floods.
