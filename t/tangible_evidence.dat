The strength of an argument is not located in an underlying social struggle or in a pure logical space. It depends on the links it produces between three types of constraints: the set of <b>tangible</b> <b>evidences</b> which are used by actors; the compatibility of different representations and interests in a common computational space; at last, new ways of thinking the relationships between past, present and future.

A classical model of infection-driven lymphoprolipherative disorder is Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric MALT lymphoma, where antibiotic therapy allows eradication of both the infectious agent and the clonal B-cell expansion;  following the footsteps of these example, several retrospective studies have found a correlation with other pathogens and B-cell Lymphomas, adding new important informations about pathogenesis and {{laying the groundwork for}} chemotherapy-free treatments. Although no clear association with infectious agents has yet been identified for Follicular Lymphoma (FL), a growing number of biological and clinical observations suggests that interaction with physiological and pathological microbial populations might play a role also in this subtype of lymphoma: in the last years epidemiological studies investigating the association of known risk factors and FL found a potential correlation with viral or bacterial infections; moreover recent findings about the stimulation of FL clones support the importance of microbial exposure to lymphomagenesis and disease progression. In the following review we make an attempt to find <b>tangible</b> <b>evidences</b> in favor of a role of either physiological and pathological exogenous microbial species in the pathogenesis of FL, and try to integrate the findings coming from epidemiological, biological and interventional studies to define future  novel treatment and prevention strategies for FL...|$|R
