500|$|The episode shared themes with {{previous}} episodes {{from the first}} season such as [...] "Ice" [...] and [...] "Darkness Falls", which both featured the agents finding new lifeforms in remote locations. James Wong was somewhat negative concerning the episode's similarities to [...] "Ice", saying, [...] "If the show starts to cannibalize itself, there's going to be trouble". Gordon stated, however, [...] "I know there are some similarities with 'Ice', but I <b>think</b> <b>once</b> you get beyond the similarities {{of a group of}} people in a confined space going up against a creature, there are enough differences to separate the two".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the season}} was much more violent than {{previous}} MCU works, DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be [...] "too far", saying that [...] "Daredevil wasn’t asking {{for a lot of}} sexual situations, especially since Matt Murdock is not really in the position to get into a relationship, and it just didn’t fit the story for that season. I think that’ll change moving forward, but I never pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show. I <b>think</b> <b>once</b> Daredevil was a hit and people were really responding positively, you can see the progression into more of an adult world in Jessica Jones." ...|$|E

He was the fifth quarterback taken in the draft, behind Sam Bradford (1st overall), Tim Tebow (25th overall), Jimmy Clausen (48th overall) and Colt McCoy (85th overall). Kafka {{was expected to be}} the team's third-string quarterback behind Kevin Kolb and Michael Vick. Eagles head coach Andy Reid said of Kafka, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>once</b> you meet him, I think you'll see he's a smart guy. He has some of the intangible things – the leadership, he's a tough kid. Inner city, Chicago kid. He's got a little grit to him. I think that's important. You have to be wired right to handle you guys and play in the city of Philadelphia. I think he's wired right. He likes to compete." [...] Kafka was signed to a four-year contract worth $2.256 million with $467,000 guaranteed on June 15, 2010.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{marks the}} return of American actress Megan Dodds, who first {{appeared}} {{in a handful of}} scenes in the first episode of the first series. The producers enjoyed the actress' company, and wanted her to return where the character would appear more often and developed throughout the second series. Jenny Agutter returns as Tessa Philips; it allows the audience to see what happens to her since her sacking in the first series finale. The episode introduces new regular character Ruth Evershed, played by Nicola Walker. The producers needed another [...] "interesting, strong" [...] member of the team following Tessa's departure. The character also came from GCHQ in the series; the producers were aware that the organisation employs 70,000 people, and the producers did not want to ignore this aspect of British intelligence gathering. Describing Walker's casting, producer Jane Featherstone recalled [...] "Nicola is extraordinary in it. I think she's completely brilliant. And she's developed that and I <b>think</b> <b>once</b> Nicola became that role that writers had just loved writing for that part, and she's really made it her own." [...] The character was created by Brenton. Her introduction depicted her as clumsy, mirroring the writer.|$|E

And I think these sorts of stories will make the final stretch of episodes {{towards the end of the}} season all the more resonant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Finkelstein {{has said}} of the period leading up to Cameron's {{election}} {{as leader of the}} Conservative party that [...] "a small group of us (myself, David Cameron, George Osborne, Michael Gove, Nick Boles, Nick Herbert I <b>think,</b> <b>once</b> or twice) used to meet up in the offices of Policy Exchange, eat pizza, and consider the future of the Conservative Party". Cameron's relationship with Osborne is regarded as particularly close; Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi suggested the closeness of Osborne's relationship with Cameron meant the two effectively shared power during Cameron's time as Prime Minister.|$|E

2500|$|Bazlen {{returned}} to acting {{briefly in the}} early 1970s in Chicago dinner theater plays which included Nobody Loves An Albatross as Jean Hart playing opposite Gig Young, Under The Yum Yum Tree and Once More With Feeling. Then, in 1972, she took up the role of Mary Anderson in the NBC daytime TV drama Days of Our Lives. After that, however, she completely retired from acting. Her mother later stated that Bazlen lost interest in acting as she grew older. Moreover, Bazlen's daughter, Marguerite, stated in a 2007 interview that Bazlen was a very private person who spoke very little about her past and that [...] "She was very kind-hearted, very fair, emotional. [...] Not affectionate, as kind-hearted as she was, {{she was not a}} touchy feely kind of person." [...] Bazlen's daughter also recalled that Bazlen was a very witty person with a dry sense of humor and that her reluctance to talk openly about her acting career was related to her shyness because [...] "Whenever one of her movies would air, she made sure we all went out for dinner so we couldn't stay home and watch! [...] It wasn't that she was embarrassed by it, but I <b>think</b> <b>once</b> she left that world she was shy about it. [...] She was very proud of her work on The Blue Fairy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Komondor's coat is long, thick, and strikingly corded white coat, about 20 – 27cm long (the {{heaviest}} {{amount of}} fur in the canine world), which resembles dreadlocks or a mop. The puppy coat {{is soft and}} fluffy. However, the coat is wavy and tends to curl as the puppy matures. A fully mature coat is formed naturally from the soft undercoat and the coarser outer coat combining to form tassels, or cords and will take around two years to form. Some help is needed in separating the cords so the dog does not turn into one large matted mess. The length of the cords increases with time as the coat grows. Moulting is minimal with this breed, contrary to what one might <b>think</b> (<b>once</b> cords are fully formed). The only substantial shedding occurs as a puppy before the dreadlocks fully form. The Komondor is born with only a white coat, unlike the similar-looking Puli, which can be white, black, or sometimes grayish. However, a working Komondor's coat may be discolored by the elements, and may appear off-white if not washed regularly. Traditionally the coat protected the Komondor from wolves' bites, as the bites {{were not able to}} penetrate the thick coat. [...] The coat of the Komondor takes {{about two and a half}} days to dry after a bath.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I got all these great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I <b>think</b> <b>once</b> it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Cameron first {{appeared}} in the pilot episode, she behaved with more human mannerisms, but these faded in subsequent episodes. It has been confirmed by Friedman that this behavioral change {{was the result of a}} conscious decision; however the explanations he has given of the logistics behind this decision have varied. At the Television Critics Association press tour, he stated that within the story, Cameron had been prepared for the events of the pilot. Once the characters [...] "jumped forward in time though, she was as adrift as everyone else". In an interview with IGN, Friedman stated that as he wrote the second episode, he became interested in exploring the [...] "calmer, odder part of" [...] Cameron, reflected in a scene in the pilot in which Cameron asks questions of John [...] "in a very programmed way". He continued to say that Cameron's behavior may appear inconsistent to a viewer, but that this inconsistency may be operative in the completion of her tasks. In any case, the character's robotic interactions with humans were manipulated for humor, but Friedman did express a wish to avoid [...] "cheap jokes" [...] in favor of more seriously exploring Cameron's existence as a cyborg. Summer Glau in an interview said about Cameron's changing behavior: [...] "We were experimenting with Cameron quite a bit, and we wanted her to be able to seem human. We wanted especially John to be fooled by her, so that he would let her into his life. And so in the pilot, I do act very human. And then as I go through the series, it appears that I’ve taken steps back and that I am acting more like a Terminator would. We did that for several different reasons, but I know for me it's fun because I get to take more time for her development, her human development. I think that it also is funny and I <b>think</b> <b>once</b> her cover was blown with the Connors, she kind of was able to drop that persona and become who she really is around them, if that answers the question." ...|$|E
