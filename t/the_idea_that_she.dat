5|$|Taylor {{was named}} to the Aussie Belles that was going to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. That the team {{qualified}} for the Games came as a surprise, as the Australian Paralympic Committee had been working on player development with an idea of the team qualifying for the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and an Australian team had not participated since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, when they earned an automatic selection as hosts, and the team finished last in the competition. Going into the Paralympics, her team was ranked eighth in the world. The Australian Paralympic Committee had chosen to work on her development as a goalball player with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might be able to qualify for and win a medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Taylor debuted the national team's Paralympic uniform on 1 May 2012 at the Sydney Overseas Passenger Terminal on day two of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia Spring/Summer 2012/13. In the 2012 Summer Paralympics tournament, the Belles played games against Japan, Canada, the United States and Sweden. They lost every game, and did not advance to the finals.|$|E
25|$|The Piraeus Athena {{is often}} {{mentioned}} to seem approachable by the scholar, Neer. This {{serves as a}} stark contrast from the Archaic style, where gods were often depicted as stern according to Neer One reason Athena here is perceived approachable is due to her stance. The Piraeus Athena, here is in contrapposto stance, meaning that her left leg is more relaxed, while she is putting her weight on the right leg. This position portrays <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is almost stooping towards the mortal viewer. The passive and gentle {{expression on her face}} is also denoted with an air of approachability according.|$|E
25|$|Although Helen {{was never}} tried during the McCarthy era, her works {{suffered}} from <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a Chinese Communist sympathizer. She often had issues getting new books published {{and many of}} her books went out of print. Helen returned to China twice more in her lifetime. The first visit was from 1972 to 1973, following President Richard Nixon's trip in 1972 which eased relations between China and the United States. The second visit was in 1978 when Helen returned to China for six weeks with a camera crew. There she was interviewed and asked to recount her adventures of the 1930s with Edgar. Helen {{spent the rest of}} her life in Connecticut, developing an interest in family genealogy, drafting a novel, and writing short pieces on her experiences in China. She published her autobiography in 1984.|$|E

25|$|Correspondence {{published}} in The Women's Gazette {{also led to}} {{the founding of the}} Teachers' Guild in 1884. She also supported the Gentlewomen's Employment Club in London, donating a significant sum of money in 1889. In The Women's Gazette and Work and Leisure Hubbard also promoted the idea of Friendly societies for women. In 1889 Hubbard served as the provisional president of a new group known as the Court of the United Sisters' Friendly Society. Several other organizations were formed by readers of Hubbard's publications. She often sought to unify and coordinate philanthropic activities by different women's groups. Many of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> advanced were dramatically opposed to the prevailing views in society at the time she began her activism, but became commonplace by the end of her life. She also promoted midwifery as a career and argued that better training was needed for women in the field. She also helped establish the Trained Midwives Registration Society with Zepherina Veitch, initially serving as the organising secretary.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{evidence}} of Zenobia's birth as a Jew; the names of her and her husband's families belonged to the Aramaic [...] (collection of names). The queen's alleged patronage of Paul of Samosata (who was accused of [...] "Judaizing"), may have given rise to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a proselyte.

500|$|In Japan, Alice has a {{significant}} influence on pop culture. Tenniel's artwork and Disney's film adaptation have been credited as factors in the continuing favorable reception of the two novels. Within youth culture in Japan, she has been adopted as [...] "a rebellion figure {{in much the same}} way as the American and British 1960s 'hippies' did." [...] She has also been a source of inspiration for Japanese fashion, in particular Lolita fashion. Her popularity has been attributed to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> performs the shōjo ideal, a Japanese understanding of girlhood that is [...] "sweet and innocent on the outside, and considerably autonomous on the inside." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} covered by American country singer Reba McEntire on the {{television}} program Unplugged on Country Music Television. The cover {{was accompanied by a}} music video that premiered on June 18, 2010, which depicted McEntire performing the song live. In late 2010, she recorded a studio version, and it was added to country radio on January 24, 2011, by Starstruck Entertainment and Valory Music Group as the second single from her studio album All the Women I Am (2010). McEntire revealed that she originally wanted to only cover her own hits. However, her husband and manager, Narvel Blackstock wanted her to do a cover song. Blackstock finally came up with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should record her own version of Beyoncé's [...] "If I Were a Boy".

500|$|Named after Russian {{composer}} Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Rimsky-Korsakoffee {{was one of}} Portland's first coffeehouses. The classical music-themed business, {{located in}} Portland's Buckman neighborhood, serves coffee and desserts. It operates from the former living room of a reportedly haunted Craftsman-style house, built in 1902 and [...] "nearly hidden from view" [...] by the surrounding foliage. In 2006, The Oregonian Vivian McInerny suggested that writer Louise Bryant once lived in the house. Bryant and her second husband, John Reed, documented parts of the Russian Revolution in works such as her Six Months in Red Russia. However, evidence analyzed by Michael Munk for publication in Oregon Historical Quarterly and elsewhere lends no support {{to the idea that}} Bryant ever lived at 707 Southeast 12th Avenue (Rimsky-Korsakoffee House's street address) and casts strong doubt on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> met Reed there.|$|E
5000|$|After {{splitting}} from Mother Meera, {{the writer}} and former follower Andrew Harvey wrote The Sun at Midnight. In it, Harvey accused Meera of homophobia, saying that Mother Meera disapproved of Harvey's marriage to another man. In his first book about her, Hidden Journey, Harvey had originally praised her as an avatar, attributing his own claimed enlightenment to her. Harvey's accusation of homophobia is disputed. One of Harvey's former lovers, the writer Mark Matousek (1997), said that: [...] "I do know <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> homophobic is completely ridiculous. For God's sake, we were served breakfast in bed together in her house." ...|$|R

[...] Wilkerson spent the last 20 years teaching mathematics in high schools and adult education programs. In August 2003, she gave the first telephone interview after not talking to reporters in about 20 years. Although Wilkerson agreed that mistakes were made, she maintained many of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> supported in <b>the</b> 1960s.

500|$|Heroes creator Tim Kring and {{the writers}} {{had created the}} {{character}} of Elle with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a [...] "cautionary tale" [...] of what could happen if the other characters had known of their abilities {{for the duration of}} their lives as Elle did. Kring pitched Bell the idea for the character [...] "which she loved" [...] and soon they were [...] "off and running." [...] The casting of Bell, as Kring explains, [...] "was not easy to pull off," [...] but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, [...] "we found a way to jump into a small window in [...] schedule." [...] Originally, Elle was only meant to be Bob's stepdaughter and Meredith Gordon's daughter, making her Claire Bennet's sister, however this idea was dropped due to [...] "lack of storyline and plot holes".|$|E
500|$|In Odd Girl Out, Laura Landon's {{resistance}} to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may be homosexual lies {{in her own}} concept of femininity rather than any repugnance for loving women. In I Am a Woman, the second book in the series, Beebo's butch appearance [...] "seems to alternately terrify and attract Laura", leading to a very erotic physical relationship. However, when Laura lashes out at Beebo {{in a moment of}} self-pity, it is her masculinity that Laura attacks, invalidating Beebo's uniqueness and the core of her desirability violently. In the book that exhibits the most self-destruction in the series, Women in the Shadows, Laura expresses shame when accompanying Beebo outside of Greenwich Village, fearing Beebo will be arrested and jailed. Facing the end of their relationship, Beebo expresses the desire to be a man, if only to be able to marry Laura to give her a normal life.|$|E

Following her graduation from high school and entering university, she felt that she had made many sacrifices for her career. The title of the album came from <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had become a new person after her concert during her 20th birthday, as she wanted to [...] "lead everyone" [...] through her songs. The song [...] "My Shining Ray" [...] was written to represent a big star that would that would lead people; she also described her experience singing the song as feeling like she was spreading wings. While singing the song [...] "Redo" [...] for Re:Zero, she considered it fun to sing as it [...] "was completely different from herself".

500|$|Ferrier met Albert Wilson in 1933, {{probably}} through dancing, {{which they}} both loved. When she {{announced that they}} were to marry, her family and friends had strong reservations, on the grounds that she was young and inexperienced, and that she and Wilson shared few serious interests. Nevertheless, the marriage took place on 19 November 1935. Shortly afterwards the couple moved to Silloth, a small port town in Cumberland, where Wilson had been appointed as manager of his bank's branch. The marriage was not successful; the honeymoon had revealed problems of physical incompatibility, and the union remained unconsummated. In a tribute article written for the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death, the journalist Rupert Christiansen wrote of Ferrier's sexuality that [...] "there is absolutely no justification for <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a lesbian, but she may have been sexually frigid". Outward appearances were maintained for a few years, until Wilson's departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage. The couple divorced in 1947, though they remained on good terms. Wilson subsequently married a friend of Ferrier's, Wyn Hetherington; he died in 1969.|$|E
500|$|... "Mash Off" [...] {{was written}} by Michael Hitchcock and {{directed}} by Eric Stoltz.

This episode marked the 300th musical number Glee has filmed, which was a mash-up of two Adele songs: [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] and [...] "Someone Like You", with lead vocals by Amber Riley and Naya Rivera. The performance was filmed with great fanfare [...] "in {{front of an audience}} of press and crew members" [...] on October 26, 2011, and included a press briefing afterward. Riley revealed during the briefing that she suggested <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> perform Adele to co-creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy after finding out that Adele was hoping Riley would sing her music on the show: [...] "Someone actually e-mailed me a video of Adele saying that she wanted me to sing her song, so I e-mailed it to Brad and Ryan." ...|$|E

500|$|Apart from Lana, Clark had {{a growing}} {{relationship}} with Lois. Season five saw the melting {{of the ice}} between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, {{and the fact that}} both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true. In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life. His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time.|$|E
500|$|Director Jeunet {{wanted to}} display Ripley's new powers, {{including}} {{a scene in}} which Ripley throws a basketball through a hoop while facing the opposite direction. Weaver trained for ten days and averaged one out of six baskets, although the distance required for filming was farther than she had practiced. Jeunet was concerned about the time being spent on the shot and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Weaver, however, was determined to make the shot authentic, and insisted on doing it herself. The shot required many dozens of takes, during which none of the balls went in. The crew were going to give up, but gave Weaver one last shot, and in this take, she got the ball in perfectly; <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did it in one take is a myth. The ball was out of frame for a moment during the shot, and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was on-screen for the entire scene, but Weaver refused. Ron Perlman broke character when she made the basket, and turned to the camera to say [...] "Oh my god!" [...] There was enough of a pause between Weaver's basket and Perlman's statement for the film's editors to cut the scene accordingly during post-production.|$|E

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
