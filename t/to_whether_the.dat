5|$|Integer {{powers of}} nonzero complex numbers {{are defined by}} {{repeated}} multiplication or division as above.

5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection {{only has a}} minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which}} the decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E

The four games {{that were not}} played were the series scheduled between the Brisbane Bandits and the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for the ninth round.

Initially the ABL postponed the series, leaving a decision as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> games would be rescheduled to a later time. Just prior to {{the final round of}} scheduled games, it was announced that the games would go ahead in the form of two doubleheaders, but that only games that would affect the playoffs would be played. When Brisbane lost the final game of their series against the Adelaide Bite, both they and Canberra were eliminated from contention for the playoffs; hence, the makeup games were not played.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{policy was}} put forward in 1923 by the Australian Labor Party, {{which was in}} opposition for all but {{two years of the}} 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence to be a powerful air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited critics like Rear Admiral William Freeland Fullam, who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, naval mines and submarines. The Labor Party's Albert Green noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost £7,000,000 while an aircraft cost £2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships. The Labor Party's policy became indistinguishable from the Army's position.|$|E

5|$|At Hell, there arose a {{disagreement}} {{about where the}} Hell–Sunnan Line should branch from the Meråker Line. Initial proposals were to place the branch from a location before Hell Station, thus forcing trains to back up from Hell Station before continuing northwards. The station building at Hell was also {{too small for the}} increased traffic, so it was moved to Sunnan Station and a new station building, with capacity for 25 employees, was built at Hell. In Skatval, there was a controversy as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> station should be built at Mæhre or Alstad. Mæhre (later Skatval) had support from the municipal council and was closer to the larger share of the area's population. However, the military wanted Alstad, as it was a rally point for the military in case of a Swedish invasion, and gave easy waterway access from Frosta. The station was placed at Mæhre, while a passing loop was built at Alstad.|$|E
5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
5|$|Before {{establishing}} the party, Mike Nattrass {{had long been}} involved with Britain's Eurosceptic movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the New Britain Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike most New Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in Solihull for the single-issue Referendum Party at the 1997 general election. Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> British population {{wanted to be part}} of a federal European state or whether they wanted the EU to revert to being a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009.|$|E
