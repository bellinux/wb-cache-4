5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. Baclofen or <b>tizanidine</b> are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. <b>Tizanidine</b> has been found to have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|E
5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and <b>tizanidine.</b> In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
25|$|Muscle relaxants such as <b>tizanidine</b> are {{prescribed}} in {{the treatment}} of tension headaches.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tizanidine</b> may {{lower blood}} pressure. This {{effect can be}} {{controlled}} by administering a low dose {{at the beginning and}} increasing it gradually.|$|E
25|$|Clonidine {{and other}} {{imidazoline}} compounds {{have also been}} shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. <b>Tizanidine</b> is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog, and is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine. Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing spasticity. Furthermore, several clinical trials indicate that <b>tizanidine</b> has a similar efficacy to other spasmolytic agents, such as diazepam and baclofen, with a different spectrum of adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{muscle relaxants}} cyclobenzaprine, {{carisoprodol}} with acetaminophen and caffeine and <b>tizanidine</b> are sometimes {{used to treat}} fibromyalgia; however as of 2015 they are not approved for this use in the United States. The use of NSAIDs is not recommended as first line therapy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{quinolones}} exert an {{inhibitory effect}} on the cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, methylxanthines, <b>tizanidine)</b> results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side effects of the coadministered drug. Additionally other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, {{and to a lesser}} extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam is {{used for}} the {{emergency}} treatment of eclampsia, when IV magnesium sulfate and blood-pressure control measures have failed. Benzodiazepines do not have any pain-relieving properties themselves, and are generally recommended to avoid in individuals with pain. However, benzodiazepines such as diazepam can be used for their muscle-relaxant properties to alleviate pain caused by muscle spasms and various dystonias, including blepharospasm. Tolerance often develops to the muscle relaxant effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam. Baclofen or <b>tizanidine</b> is sometimes used as an alternative to diazepam.|$|E

Concomitant use with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., caffeine, clozapine, ropinirole, tacrine, theophylline, <b>tizanidine)</b> may result in increased substrate drug concentrations when given in usual doses. Patients taking any of these drugs concomitantly with norfloxacin should be carefully monitored." ...|$|E
2500|$|Preventative {{medicines}} include gabapentin (Neurontin), <b>tizanidine</b> (Zanaflex), fluoxetine (Prozac), amitriptyline (Elavil), and topiramate (Topamax). In testing, gabapentin {{was found}} {{to reduce the number}} of headache days a month by 9.1%. <b>Tizanidine</b> {{was found to}} decrease the average frequency of headaches per week, the headache intensity, and the mean headache duration. Through studies, Fluoxetine resulted in better mood ratings and [...] "significant increases in headache-free days". Despite being associated with depression, antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been found to effectively treat [...] "near-daily headaches" [...] and numerous chronic pain conditions as well as improving mood and sleep—two possible triggers for chronic headache sufferers. One study found that the headache frequency over a 28-day period lowered for chronic headache patients on topiramate. Another medication to prevent headaches is botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA or BOTOX), which is given by injection instead of being taken orally. In a clinical study of botulinum toxin type A, patients participating in the 9-month treatment period with three treatments experienced headache frequency decreases up to 50%. As with all medications, the preventative medications may have side effects. Since different people respond to drugs differently, chronic headache sufferers may have to go through a [...] "trial-and-error" [...] period to find the right medications. The previously mentioned medicines can improve headaches, but physicians recommend multiple forms of treatments.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{skeletal}} muscle relaxants {{of that type}} used around the world come {{from a number of}} drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, <b>tizanidine</b> (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen, [...] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax {{skeletal muscle}}s include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some ketobemidone, piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic.|$|E
5000|$|Concomitant use of <b>tizanidine</b> and {{moderate}} or potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (such as zileuton, certain antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, aciclovir, ticlopidine and oral contraceptives) is contraindicated. Concomitant use of <b>tizanidine</b> with fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor in man, {{resulted in a}} 33-fold increase in the <b>tizanidine</b> AUC (plasma drug concentration-time curve). [...] Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin should also be avoided due to an increased serum concentration of <b>tizanidine</b> when administered concomitantly. <b>Tizanidine</b> {{has the potential to}} interact with other CNS depressants. Alcohol should be avoided, particularly as it can upset the stomach. The CNS-depressant effects of <b>tizanidine</b> and alcohol are additive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tizanidine</b> can {{occasionally}} cause liver damage, {{generally the}} hepatocellular type. Clinical trials show {{that up to}} 5% of patients treated with <b>tizanidine</b> had elevated liver function test values, though symptoms disappeared upon withdrawal of the drug. Care should be used when first beginning treatment with <b>tizanidine</b> with regular liver tests for the first 6 months of treatment. As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is 100 to 200 USD.|$|E
50|$|Ciprofloxacin {{inhibits}} the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2 {{and thereby}} {{can reduce the}} clearance of drugs metabolized by that enzyme. CYP1A2 substrates that exhibit increased serum levels in ciprofloxacin-treated patients include <b>tizanidine,</b> theophylline, caffeine, methylxanthines, clozapine, olanzapine, and ropinirole. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with the CYP1A2 substrate <b>tizanidine</b> (Zanaflex) is contraindicated due to a 583% increase in the peak serum concentrations of <b>tizanidine</b> when administered with ciprofloxacin as compared to administration of <b>tizanidine</b> alone. Use of ciprofloxacin is cautioned in patients on theophylline due to its narrow therapeutic index. The authors of one review recommended that patients being treated with ciprofloxacin reduce their caffeine intake. Evidence for significant interactions with several other CYP1A2 substrates such as cyclosporine is equivocal or conflicting.|$|E

50|$|Pharmacotherapy may be {{used for}} acute {{musculoskeletal}} conditions when physical therapy is unavailable or has not been fully successful. Another class of antispasmodics for such treatment includes cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, diazepam, orphenadrine, and <b>tizanidine.</b> Effectiveness has not been clearly shown for metaxalone, methocarbamol, chlorzoxazone, baclofen, or dantrolene. Applicable conditions include acute back or neck pain, or pain after an injury.|$|E
50|$|Like metaxalone, no {{specific}} {{mechanism of action}} has been identified for chlorzoxazone, with general central nervous system depression being the only currently accepted aspect to its medical benefits. Search for the exact mechanism of action is ongoing but limited due {{to the existence of}} more-effective safe muscle relaxers (ex. diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, <b>tizanidine)</b> greatly limiting the potential benefit of identifying novel compounds which share chlozoxazone's mechanism of action.|$|E
50|$|Treatment for {{individuals}} with PLS is symptomatic. Baclofen and <b>tizanidine</b> may reduce spasticity. Quinine or phenytoin may decrease cramps. Some patients who do not receive adequate relief from oral treatment may consider intrathecal baclofen (i.e., infusion of medication directly into the cerebrospinal fluid via a surgically placed continuous infusion pump). However, patients are carefully selected {{for this type of}} procedure to ensure that they will likely benefit from this invasive procedure.|$|E
50|$|Spasm {{may also}} be seen in {{movement}} disorders featuring spasticity in neurologic conditions such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord disease. Medications are commonly used for spastic movement disorders, but research has not shown functional benefit for some drugs.

50|$|Cyclobenzaprine {{has been}} found to be not {{inferior}} to <b>tizanidine,</b> orphenadrine, and carisoprodol in the treatment of acute lower back pain, although none has been proven to be effective for long-term use (beyond two weeks of treatment). No differences in pain or spasm scores were noted among these agents, nor when compared to benzodiazepines. However, nonbenzodiazepine (including cyclobenzaprine) treatment was found to have a lower risk of medication abuse and continuation of use against medical advice. Side effects such as sedation and ataxia are also less pronounced with nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodics.|$|E
50|$|Oral {{medications}} {{used for}} the treatment of spasticity include: diazepam (Valium), dantrolene sodium, baclofen, <b>tizanidine,</b> clonidine, gabapentin, and even cannabinoid-like compounds.³ The exact mechanism of these medications is not fully understood, but they are thought to act on neurotransmitters or neuromodulators within the central nervous system (CNS) or muscle itself, or to decrease the stretch reflexes. The problem with these medications is their potential side effects and the fact that, other than lessening painful or disruptive spasms and dystonic postures, drugs in general have not been shown to decrease impairments or lessen disabilities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tizanidine</b> (trade names Zanaflex (Acorda Therapeutics), Sirdalud (Novartis), Relentus (Beximco Pharma)) is a {{drug that}} {{is used as a}} muscle relaxant. It is a {{centrally}} acting α2 adrenergic agonist. It is used to treat the spasms, cramping, and tightness of muscles caused by medical problems such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, spastic diplegia, back pain, or certain other injuries to the spine or central nervous system. It is also prescribed off-label for migraine headaches, as a sleep aid, and as an anticonvulsant. It is also prescribed for some symptoms of fibromyalgia.|$|E

50|$|Baclofen, {{diazepam}} and dantrolene {{remain the}} three most commonly used pharmacologic agents {{in the treatment of}} spastic hypertonia. Baclofen is generally the drug of choice for spinal cord types of spasticity, while sodium dantrolene is the only agent which acts directly on muscle tissue. <b>Tizanidine</b> is also available. Phenytoin with chlorpromazine may be potentially useful if sedation does not limit their use. Ketazolam, not yet available in the United States, may be a significant addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium. Intrathecal administration of antispastic medications allows for high concentrations of drug near the site of action, which limits side effects.|$|E
