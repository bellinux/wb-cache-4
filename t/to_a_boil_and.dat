25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>and</b> then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of}} the soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E

5000|$|The game {{received}} [...] "mixed" [...] reviews on all platforms {{according to}} the review aggregation website Metacritic. Some areas of complaints were weak A.I., lackluster graphics, overly bizarre character models, and simplistic gameplay. However, the game was praised for its multiplayer and arcade mode, which contains over a dozen maps and several playable characters and modes, {{similar to that of}} TimeSplitters 2. The arcade mode was also noted as being superior compared to the campaign (IGN said it [...] "adds some spice <b>to</b> <b>an</b> otherwise <b>boiled</b> <b>and</b> blanched game"). IGN concluded, [...] "Fans of the fiction will finally appreciate a style that keeps its faith, but will wonder how this game could have done its source material the same sort of disservice the decade old movie did", negatively comparing it to the 1995 film Judge Dredd. GameSpot were more ambivalent about the game, calling it a [...] "short, simplistic shooter that's not worth even its budget price," [...] and concluding that [...] "It's not embarrassingly bad, but you're better off waiting for your next paycheck and then sinking in the extra cash into any of the much better full-priced shooters readily available on all four platforms." [...] Many game magazine publishers gave early reviews on the game about a year before it was released in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Simmering is a food {{preparation}} technique in which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept {{just below the}} boiling point of water (which is 100 °C or 212 °F at average sea level air pressure), but higher than poaching temperature.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this {{invention}} <b>to</b> provide <b>a</b> continuous optimum process for the dissolution of aluminum, without the use of a mercury catalyst. Ile invention generally stated is: a process for dissolution of aluminum comprising: preparing a mixture of nitric acid`and fluoboric acid in a makeup vessel or individual reagents in separate vessels; placing an aluminum element in a dissolver vessel having an overflow; transferring a portion of the mixture of nitric acid and fluoboric acid to the dissolver vessel from the makeup vessel; heating the dissolver vessel <b>and</b> mixture <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boiling</b> temperature <b>and</b> holding that temperature until a desired concentration of dissolved aluminum is achieved; adding a constant flow influent of the mixture of nitric acid and fluoboric acid to the dissolver vessel; and collecting an effluent from the dissolver vessel overflow, said effluent containing a mixture of aluminum nitrate, nitric acid, fluoboric acid, water, and dissolved fuel components. The variables in the above process can be temperature, effluent flow rate, and concentration of the acids as will be discussed later. For corrosion control, {{it may be necessary to}} initiate reaction at a decreased HNO{sub 3 } concentration and to increase it after a sufficient concentration of aluminum nitrate has accrued. The process may be adapted to batch processing, as well. Again, acid concentrations may be initially relatively small and, then, gradually increased as reaction proceeds until the desired excess of HNO{sub 3 } above stoichiometric quantity has been added. Other objects, advantages, and capabilities of the present invention will become more apparent as the description proceeds...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} three cooking methods on the chemical, physical, and sensory prop-erties of hard-cooked eggs were investigated. Freshly laid eggs were stored at 23 C for 48 hr and then hard cooked {{by one of}} three methods: {{steaming}} (S) for 20 min; severe boiling (B) procedure (water brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> full <b>boil</b> <b>and</b> maintained for 20 min); and a standard hard cook (SHC) pro-cedure (water brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slow <b>boil</b> followed by 20 min simmer). The eggs were peeled, separated into yolk and white, and evaluated for pH, moisture, color, texture by an Instron Texturometer and texture profile panel, and flavor by a trained profile panel, experienced panel, and headspace gas chromatography. Eggs subjected to the B procedure had the highest endpoint temperature (98. 7 C) followed by SHC (95. 6 C) and S eggs (89. 4 C). The cooking rate for S eggs was approximately three times faster than SHC or B eggs. Both egg white moisture and pH values were significantly influenced by cooking method. Severely boiled egg whites had significantly lower pH moisture values than SHC or S eggs. Small but perceivable texture differences due to cooking were found by the texture profile panel in addition to significant egg white and yolk texture differences as measured using the Instron. Severely boiled egg whites had the firmest texture followed by SHC and S egg whites. All treatments had a typical egg aroma and flavor, yet several detectable sensory {{differences were found between}} the treatments. There were little qualitative differences in headspace volatiles between treatments, although significant quantitative differences were noted between treatments for eggs yolks and whites.

50|$|The milk must be {{obtained}} from an animal that has a spacious outdoor environment, an abundance of pasture to feed on, water to drink, is treated with love and care, and is not pregnant. The milk may only be collected once the mother's calf has its share. Dairy products like yogurt and cheese (paneer) must be made that day, from milk obtained that day. Butter must be fresh daily as well, and raw; but ghee (clarified butter) can be aged forever, and is great for cooking. Freshness is key with dairy. Milk that is freshly milked from a happy cow, still warm, is nectar to man and woman. Milk that is not consumed fresh can be refrigerated for one to two weeks in its raw state, but must be brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> before drinking, <b>and</b> drunk while still hot/warm. Pasteurization, homogenization, {{and the use of}} GMOs and pesticides are all considered poisonous to humans—as is the consumption of milk from cows that are treated poorly, and consuming cold milk. As finding milk that surpasses these standards is extremely rare, people in western countries often choose <b>to</b> follow <b>a</b> vegan Sattvic diet.|$|R
