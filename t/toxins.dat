5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{well-known}} drugs and <b>toxins</b> that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation.

NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.|$|E

Methods A retrospective case-control study was conducted including 211 NDO patients treated in three consecutives eras with onabotulinum <b>toxin</b> 300 [*]U (2004 – 2006; 80 patients), abobotulinum <b>toxin</b> 750 [*]U (2007 – 2011; 78 patients) or onabotulinum <b>toxin</b> 200 [*]U (2011 – 2014; 53 patients). Urodynamic and clinical parameters were compared between groups. The primary endpoint was the rates of success defined as the combination of urgency, urinary incontinence, and detrusor overactivity resolution. Results When comparing abobotulinum <b>toxin</b> to onabotulinum <b>toxin</b> any doses (200 or 300 [*]U; n[*]=[*] 133), success rates were similar (65. 4 % vs. 55. 6 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 16). Patients treated with abobotulinum <b>toxin</b> 750 [*]U had higher success rate (65. 4 % vs. 41. 5 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 007) {{compared to those who}} received onabotulinum <b>toxin</b> 200 [*]U. In contrast, there were similar success rates in abobotulinum <b>toxin</b> 750 [*]U and onabotulinum <b>toxin</b> 300 [*]U groups (65. 4 % vs. 65 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 91) but with a trend towards longer interval between the first and the second injection in the onabotulinum <b>toxin</b> 300 [*]U group (12. 4 vs. 9. 3 months; P[*]=[*] 0. 09). Conclusions Intradetrusor injections of abobotulinum <b>toxin</b> 750 [*]U for NDO provided better outcomes than injections of onabotulinum <b>toxin</b> 200 [*]U.

40|$|ABSTRACT Lysosomotropic amines, such as {{ammonium}} chloride, {{are known}} to protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of diphtheria <b>toxin.</b> These drugs are believed to inhibit the transport of the <b>toxin</b> from a receptor at the cell exterior into the cytoplasm where a fragment of the <b>toxin</b> arrests protein synthesis. We studied the effects of lysosomotropic agents on the cytotoxic process to better understand how the <b>toxin</b> enters the cytoplasm. The cytotoxic effects of diphtheria <b>toxin</b> were not inhibited by antitoxin when cells were preincubated at 37 °C with <b>toxin</b> and ammonium chloride, exposed to antitoxin at 4 ° C, washed to relieve the ammonium chloride inhibition, and finally warmed to 37 °C. The antigenic determinants of the <b>toxin</b> were, therefore, either altered or sheltered. It {{is likely that the}} combination of ammonium chloride and a low temperature trapped the <b>toxin</b> in an intracellular vesicle from which the <b>toxin</b> could proceed to the cytoplasm. Because lysosomotropic amines raise the pH within acidic intracellular vesicles, such as lysosomes, they could trap the <b>toxin</b> within such a vesicle if an acidic environment were necessary for the <b>toxin</b> to penetrate into the cytoplasm. We simulated acidic conditions which the <b>toxin</b> might encounter by exposing cells with <b>toxin</b> bound to their surface to acidic medium.

40|$|Bacillus anthracis secretes a harmful {{exotoxin}} called anthrax <b>toxin.</b> Anthrax <b>toxin</b> has {{deleterious effects}} on several host cell types {{and is a}} significant contributor to anthrax pathogenesis. Toxin-deleted strains of B. anthracis are highly attenuated {{and many of the}} symptoms of anthrax can be replicated with anthrax <b>toxin</b> alone. Anthrax <b>toxin</b> is an AB-type <b>toxin</b> with two catalytic A moieties. PA, the B moiety, is responsible for receptor binding, pore formation and translocation of the catalytic moieties, EF and LF. PA binds one of two identified cellular receptors, ANTXR 1 or ANTXR 2. Previously, it was thought that pore formation and <b>toxin</b> translocation were both low-pH dependent processes and that the requirements for <b>toxin</b> entry mediated by either receptor were the same. Here, I report that while <b>toxin</b> entry mediated by ANTXR 2 does require low-pH, when bound to ANTXR 1 <b>toxin</b> can form pores in host membranes and translocate under near-neutral pH conditions. Additionally, I report that LRP 6, a putative anthrax <b>toxin</b> co-receptor, is not absolutely required for <b>toxin</b> entry into cells.

5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{occurs in}} the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain <b>toxins</b> that deter herbivorous animals. However, some Heliconius {{butterfly}} larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these <b>toxins,</b> allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under selection pressure from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps as a further defence.|$|E
