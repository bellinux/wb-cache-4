40|$|In {{this work}} {{mechanical}} {{behavior of a}} thermal micromirror based on a bimetallic cantilever microbeam was studied. The main target is to control the reflection of an incident ray in order <b>to</b> <b>strick</b> to a specific point. Tip slope of the bimetallic beam that is deflected due to temperature changes acts as an intermediary to relate {{the angle of the}} reflected ray and temperature changes. Governing equations to indicate the relation were derived and analytically solved. Required time of the system to the temperature changes was calculated. Detecting the position of the reflected ray is possible whereas deflection and consequently slope of the beam vary linearly with temperature. The proposed micromirror {{can be used as a}} thermal sensor whereas deflection varies linearly with temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} {{consists of}} official papers, documenting {{the life of}} Eva Lesser Stricks, of her parents and her husband from Berlin via Shanghai to Cincinnati. The collection spans approximately 130 years, from the birth of Fritz Lesser’s father to Edith Lesser’s death in 1983. The oldest document is a certificate of birth of Leo Lesser (born Dec. 18, 1851), Fritz Lesser’s father. Eva Lesser Stricks, 1997 Eva Lesser was born on May 7, 1923, in Berlin. In April of 1939 she immigrated with her parents (Dr. Fritz and Edith Lesser) to Shanghai, where she got married <b>to</b> Wilhelm <b>Stricks</b> (originally from Vienna, Austria) on January 12, 1947.

5000|$|After Kevin Smith {{had been}} hired to write a new Superman film, he {{suggested}} Burton to direct. Burton came on and Warner Bros. set a theatrical release date for the summer of 1998, the 60th anniversary of the character's debut in Action Comics. Nicolas Cage was signed on to play Superman, Burton hired Wesley <b>Strick</b> <b>to</b> rewrite Smith's script and the film entered pre-production in June 1997. For budgetary reasons, Warner Bros. ordered another rewrite from Dan Gilroy, delayed the film and ultimately put it on hold in April 1998. Burton then left to direct Sleepy Hollow. Burton has depicted the experience as a difficult one, citing differences with producer Jon Peters and the studio, stating, [...] "I basically wasted a year. A year {{is a long time}} to be working with somebody that you don't really want to be working with." ...|$|R
2500|$|At this {{height of}} the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland the Emperor's envoy <b>to</b> Edinburgh, Mathieu <b>Strick,</b> {{reported}} that d'Oisel wielded almost sovereign authority in matters of state and justice. Unlike other French administrators employed by the Scottish court, such as Yves de Rubarye, contemporary sources point to his popularity amongst the Scottish nobility. Even an English observer, Sir Thomas Wharton observed of Guise and d'Oisel, 'all in Scotland obey and lyketh them.' Later Scottish Protestant chronicle writers George Buchanan and Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie agree on his ability and singular good judgment. Buchanan describes him as, [...] "hasty and passionate, otherwise a good man, skilled in the arts both of peace and war." [...] James Maitland of Lauderdale, a writer of a later generation, mentions some imperfections of his nature, such as, his [...] "sudden and vehement choler." [...] Cleutin, Yves de Rubarye, and Bartholomew de Villemore, the Regent's financial controller were criticised for their {{lack of understanding of}} the Scots language, class distinctions, and regional jurisdictions.|$|R
500|$|Burton hired Wesley <b>Strick</b> <b>to</b> do an uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, [...] "When I {{was hired}} to write Batman Returns (Batman II at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'." [...] Warner Bros. {{presented}} Strick with warming, or freezing Gotham City, a plot point they would later use in Batman & Robin. Strick gained inspiration from a Moses parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby. Robin appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin [...] "the most worthless character in the world, especially with [...] the loner of loners." [...] Robin {{started out as a}} juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic. Waters explained, [...] "He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the Batmobile, which I notice they used in the third film!" [...] Marlon Wayans was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.|$|R
5000|$|The Parliament of Scotland at Stirling on 11 June 1546 {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} that none should sell the Castilians {{any kind of}} supplies. The lairds were summoned to plead their case in Edinburgh; they refused and Norman Leslie was declared a traitor. For {{the time of his}} captivity, Regent Arran's son was excluded from the Scottish royal succession. [...] William Kirkcaldy of Grange negotiated with Henry VIII in England, offering James Hamilton to become a hostage in England. In September, Henry VIII ordered some supplies to be sent in six ships commanded by William Tyrrell with the military engineer Richard Lee, and that the Lairds should hand over Hamilton to be brought to England (but this was not done). English intervention was hampered by Scottish diplomacy in peace negotiations. England and France were now at peace. A mission to St Andrews would be a new cause for war between Scotland and England, preventing the 'comprehension' of Scotland in this new treaty. Mary of Hungary believed the Scottish diplomats's chief purpose was delaying English action at St Andrews. Scotland remained at war with the Empire, meaning that there was no redress for piracy, and she sent her envoy, Matthew <b>Strick,</b> <b>to</b> Scotland to clarify the situation.|$|R
500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley <b>Strick</b> <b>to</b> rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, <b>Strick</b> was able <b>to</b> understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|R
50|$|The {{organization}} of the Fehme was elaborate. The centre of each jurisdiction {{was referred to as}} a “free seat” (Freistuhl), and its head or chairman (Stuhlherr) was often a secular or spiritual prince, sometimes a civic community, the archbishop of Cologne being supreme over all (Oberststuhlherren). The actual president of the court was the “free count” (Freigraf, chosen for life by the Stuhlherr from among the Freischöffen, who formed the great body of the initiated. Of these the lowest rank were the Fronboten or Freifronen, charged with the maintenance of order in the courts and the duty of carrying out the commands of the Freigraf. The immense development of the Fehme is explained by the privileges of the Freischöffen; for they were subject to no jurisdiction but those of the Westphalian courts: whether as accused or accuser they had access to the secret sessions, and they shared in the discussions of the general chapter as to the policy of the society. At their initiation these swore to support the Fehme with all their powers, to guard its secrets, and to bring before its tribunal anything within its competence that they might discover. They were then initiated into the secret signs by which members recognized each other, and were presented with a rope and with a knife on which were engraved the mystic letters S.S.G.G., supposed <b>to</b> mean Stein, <b>Strick,</b> Gras, grün (stone, rope, grass, green).|$|R
