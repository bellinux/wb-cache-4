25|$|Physical {{evidence}} and CCTV {{footage of the}} fire showed that it probably started towards {{the stern of the}} ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off {{at the end of each}} day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no <b>thermal</b> <b>cutout</b> devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.|$|E
50|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>cutout</b> {{safety device}} is {{required}} to prevent overheating of the heating element.|$|E
50|$|Some PSUs use a <b>thermal</b> <b>cutout</b> {{buried in}} the {{transformer}} rather than a fuse. The advantage is it allows greater current to be drawn for limited time than the unit can supply continuously. Some such cutouts are self resetting, some are single use only.|$|E
50|$|Some thermal {{switches}} must be reset manually {{after they have}} been tripped. This design is used when an automatic and unattended restart would create a hazardous condition, such as sudden startup of a powerful motor without warning. These types of <b>thermal</b> <b>cutouts</b> are usually reset by pressing a push-button by hand or with a special tool.|$|R
5000|$|A {{thermal switch}} (sometimes thermal reset or <b>thermal</b> <b>cutout</b> (TCO)) is a device which {{normally}} opens {{at a high}} temperature (often with a faint [...] "plink" [...] sound) and re-closes when the temperature drops. The thermal switch may be a bimetallic strip, often encased in a tubular glass bulb {{to protect it from}} dust or short circuit. Another common design uses a bimetallic shallow dome-shaped cap which [...] "clicks" [...] to an inside-out inverted cap shape when heated, such as the [...] "Klixon" [...] brand of thermal cutouts.|$|E
