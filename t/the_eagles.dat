5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Eagles</b> {{opened the}} season by {{traveling}} to Kent State, whom <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> defeated, 21–0. The Eagles' home opener was their second {{game of the season}} and was also their first conference game of the year. Against Georgia Tech, <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> eked out a 9–7 halftime lead, but fell behind in the second half, eventually losing, 19–16, on a Georgia Tech touchdown that came with 8:26 remaining in the game. Despite the loss, <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> recovered quickly, beating Central Florida, 34–7, two weeks after the Georgia Tech game. The victory was the first in an eventual four-game win streak that culminated with a 28–23 defeat of then-No. 17 Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|After the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense again {{failed to}} advance the ball. After a three-and-out, the Hokies again punted. The ball {{traveled}} 44yards, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> to start at their own 21-yard line. As the quarter came to a close, <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> drove the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, Boston College led 70.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began to stiffen. Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against <b>the</b> <b>Eagles,</b> Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard pass on 4th-and-9 to earn a first down and keep the drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> again settled for a field goal attempt. This time, the 37-yard kick sailed through the uprights, giving Boston College a 100 lead with 11:20 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Back, leg, {{and neck}} {{injuries}} {{began to take}} a toll on Van Buren in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke his toe in the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team's four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title {{for the first time}} in four years and had career-lows in touchdowns and yards per carry. <b>The</b> <b>Eagles</b> finished with a 6–6 regular season record. Greasy Neale was fired by <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, Van Buren played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> selected in that year's draft out of LSU. The elder Van Buren continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> finished with a losing record for the first time since 1942.|$|E
5|$|Chicago entered week sixteen with {{a chance}} to clinch the NFC North in the event that the Packers and Lions lost. The Packers and Lions {{eventually}} lost to the Steelers and Giants, respectively, putting the Bears in position to win the division by defeating <b>the</b> <b>Eagles.</b> The last game between the Bears and Eagles was in 2011, when the Bears won 30–24; the Bears also lead the all-time series 30–12–1, though <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> had won six of the last ten meetings. However, the Bears had won four of five meetings between the two teams in the last six years, but all by less than six points. One of the Bears' keys to victory is to prevent LeSean McCoy from dominating; the Bears had the worst run defense in the league, while McCoy leads the league in rushing. Chicago's defense also must contain the Eagles' fast-scoring offense: <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> had the lowest average time of possession per drive at 2:24, while the league average is 3:27. Philadelphia also is the only team in the league to score in fewer than seven plays per drive. In the passing game, Chicago had the fourth-best passing offense, while <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> were 26th in pass defense. However, <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> are ranked sixth in rushing defense.|$|E

5|$|In week six, the Giants hosted <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> at the Meadowlands. Linebacker Harry Carson scored {{his first}} career {{touchdown}} by catching {{a pass on}} a fake field goal in the third quarter, and the Giants defense sacked Eagles' quarterbacks Ron Jaworski and Randall Cunningham three times each. The Giants won 35–3; their largest margin of victory since they defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 32–0, in 1981. The Giants defense held <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> to 58 total yards, and Lawrence Taylor had four sacks and seven tackles. The sack total was Taylor's highest single game total since the 1984 season. The Giants dominated in time of possession; they held the ball for 39 minutes and 33 seconds to <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> 20 minutes and 27 seconds. Simms completed 20 of 29 passes for 214yards and two touchdowns and ran for another touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{was drafted}} by <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> with the 25th {{selection}} {{in the first round}} of the 2001 NFL Draft. He began the 2001 season as the fourth wide receiver, but surpassed Na Brown to become the team's slot receiver in week eight. Mitchell became the fourth receiver again after <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> signed Antonio Freeman before the 2002 season and caught only twelve passes the entire year. Mitchell became the slot receiver once again during the 2003 season, after Freeman left. In the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, with <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> facing a 4th and 26 situation, he caught a 28-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to help led the team to a win in overtime. He finished the 2003 season with a career-high 35 catches for 498yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Notre Dame was {{the last}} out-of-conference {{opponent}} on Boston College's schedule, as <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> finished the season with three consecutive ACC games. The first of these was against Florida State which led the Atlantic Division at the time, but had had five players suspended {{the day before the}} game. <b>The</b> <b>Eagles</b> secured a victory, 27–17. The second of Boston College's final opponents was Wake Forest, which had played in the 2006 ACC Championship Game. While Boston College won, 24–21, starting quarterback Chris Crane suffered a season-ending injury, leaving backup Dominique Davis in charge of the Eagles' offense. Boston College's final game of the regular season was against Maryland and a victory against the Terrapins would push <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> to a tie with Florida State atop the Atlantic Division. Since Boston College had won the head-to-head game against Florida State, according to the ACC's tie-breaking rules, <b>the</b> <b>Eagles</b> would win the division. A 28–21 victory over Maryland brought Boston College to a 5–3 ACC record, giving it a co-division championship with Florida State and a trip to the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> {{goes back}} to eat his Jerry sandwich. But before he can do so, Jerry slips away, puts mustard on himself, and gets back in between the slices of bread. As <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> {{attempts}} to eat the sandwich again, Jerry opens <b>the</b> <b>eagle's</b> mouth and kicks away <b>the</b> bread. <b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> then closes its mouth on Jerry, who proceeds to escape through eagle's nostril and kick him in <b>the</b> eye. <b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> grabs Jerry and a whistle is heard from Tom, who is wearing lipstick and a party horn on his face (accompanied by Scott Bradley's [...] "hot" [...] rendition of St. Louis Blues), beckoning <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> from behind <b>the</b> house's chimney. In addition to the lipstick and party horn, Tom has taken a skirt and stuck feathers onto himself, giving himself the rather unconvincing appearance of a female bird. <b>The</b> <b>eagle,</b> unaware of Tom's disguise, becomes lovestruck and tries to kiss him. Jerry, not fooled by Tom's persona, uses the distraction to untie Tom’s dress, but Tom fastens it. <b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> tries to kiss Tom, again, and Jerry grabs the elastic band of the horn and it brings them together for a kiss. <b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> goes wild and he ends up dropping Jerry. Tom then puts Jerry down his dress. Jerry grabs a pin and sticks it in Tom's rear causing Tom to yowl and jump into <b>the</b> <b>eagle's</b> arms. Tom then runs away with <b>the</b> lovestruck <b>eagle</b> behind him. <b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> tries to kiss Tom but he ends up denting a stovepipe and pecking the bricks out of the chimney. Tom then gives a flirtatious smile and struts away. This really makes <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> wild and with Tom hiding around the chimney with a brick in his hand, Tom hits <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> with <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> responding [...] "She loves me!". But <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> is still head over heels in love. Tom makes another quick escape by jumping off the roof of <b>the</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> saves him from hitting the ground and continues to try to kiss him. Tom tries to hide and escape in various means, but <b>the</b> lovesick <b>eagle</b> somehow keeps finding him, and Tom keeps losing Jerry in the process.|$|R

5000|$|Tom {{is later}} {{standing}} behind a makeshift kissing booth that advertises, [...] "Kisses - One Mouse Each!". <b>The</b> <b>eagle</b> goes to <b>the</b> kissing booth, hands over Jerry and puckers up. Tom grabs Jerry and then [...] "smooches" [...] <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> with a plunger, simulating a giant kiss. But Jerry escapes again. Tom then runs into <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> who {{holds out his}} hands. Tom picks one and <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> produces a ring box with Jerry sitting in it. Jerry’s tail has been tied in a loop and <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> places Jerry on Tom’s finger as a marriage proposal. Tom [...] "accepts", then slams the window shutter into <b>the</b> <b>eagle’s</b> face and runs away, but he crashes into the other window shutter. Jerry then grabs a rope and ties it around Tom’s foot. Tom gets up and runs away. Jerry hands {{the other end of}} the rope to <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> and <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> drags Tom back to him, preventing Tom's escape. As Tom is being dragged to <b>the</b> <b>eagle,</b> Jerry hands Tom a bouquet of flowers and waves goodbye to the happy couple. Soon <b>the</b> <b>eagle</b> is sitting in a tree while Tom is sitting on a nest of eggs and knitting a tiny sweater, preparing for motherhood with no choice but to endure a relationship with <b>the</b> <b>eagle.</b>|$|R

After a Foles injury in week 16, Vick was named the starter for the season finale against the Giants in New York. Vick went 19 of 35 for 197 yards with a touchdown and interception, and also ran five times for 25 yards. <b>The</b> <b>Eagles,</b> however, lost the game 42–7, to end the season with a 1–5 division record and 4–12 overall record.|$|E
5|$|The Eagles' {{defense was}} ranked {{eighth in the}} nation in terms of total defense, {{allowing}} an average of 277 yards per game. <b>The</b> <b>Eagles</b> led the country in interceptions, recording 25 {{during the course of the}} regular season. <b>The</b> <b>Eagles</b> also were ranked among the top 10 in run defense, pass-efficiency defense, and No. 14 in scoring defense.
