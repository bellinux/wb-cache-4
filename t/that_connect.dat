5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and emotional attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts <b>that</b> <b>connect</b> easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders. These beliefs are also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as attachment therapy (not based on attachment theory), which purport to bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths <b>that</b> <b>connect</b> all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E

5|$|In practice, {{different}} {{data collection}} mechanisms {{are used by}} different transport operators, depending {{on the nature of}} their business. The MTR equips its stations with local area networks <b>that</b> <b>connect</b> the components that deal with Octopus cards—turnstiles, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's Kowloon Bay headquarters through a frame relay wide area network, and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing. Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as 7-Eleven. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.|$|E
5|$|In the {{prevailing}} Standard Model of physics, the photon {{is one of}} four gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W− and Z0 and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the photon, these gauge bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU(2) gauge symmetry. The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories <b>that</b> <b>connect</b> these four gauge bosons with the eight gluon gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.|$|E
5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small settlement that later grew, but rather a new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes <b>that</b> <b>connect</b> the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from the Euphrates river {{to protect it from}} floods, and was connected to the river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be attached with, which is hard to identify today.|$|E

5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords <b>that</b> <b>connect</b> to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E
