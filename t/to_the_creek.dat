5|$|Historically, the Great Warrior Path of the Native Americans crossed Harveys Creek {{near its}} mouth. The path ran from Sunbury to Athens. In December 1775, a battle known as Plunkett's Battle was fought along the Susquehanna River very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek.</b> This battle {{was one of}} the major battles in the Yankee-Pennamite Wars.|$|E

5|$|An October 2001 {{survey of}} Mahanoy Creek {{identified}} {{two species of}} fish each at Ashland and Girardville. There were 20 individuals at the latter location and 22 at the former. There were also 13 species and 134 individuals at Gowen City, and 14 species and 545 individuals at the creek's mouth. Additionally, 1003 individuals and 20 species of fish were observed {{at the mouth of}} the tributary Schwaben Creek. White Suckers were found at each of the aforementioned sites. Other fish species found on Mahanoy Creek and Schwaben Creek include the swallowtail shiner, the rosyface shiner, the river chub, the banded darter, and the shield darter. Brown trout, longnose dace, and eastern blacknose dace have also been observed in the watershed. Historically, deer came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> to consume salt.|$|E
5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, {{about a half a}} mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense. Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when {{darkness}} would prevent the British from attacking his defenses {{on the south side of}} Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek,</b> the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E
5|$|East of Bronte Creek, Highway407 enters an {{agricultural}} area, interspersed with woodlots. It enters Oakville at the Tremaine Road (Halton Regional Road22) overpass, then gradually swerves {{to the north}} as it encounters an interchange with Bronte Road (Halton Regional Road25 and former Highway25). The route crosses Sixteen Mile Creek just north of Glenarchy Conservation Area, then travels parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> for several kilometres. It swerves north after an interchange with Neyagawa Boulevard, near the hamlet of Glenarchy. After diverging from the creek, it curves northeast, parallel to and north of Burnhamthorpe Road, where it interchanges with Trafalgar Road (Halton Regional Road3). Highway407 then encounters Highway403 at a large interchange where curves sharply to the northwest; Highway403, meanwhile, curves from the southeast to the northeast.|$|E

5|$|In 1776, Father Junípero Serra founded Mission San Juan Capistrano {{on a site}} close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> (possibly {{near the}} Cañada Gobernadora confluence), and the creek was named after the mission. The first site was {{abandoned}} {{due to lack of}} water, although some historical accounts suggest the creek once had a perennial flow. The mission was moved to a second site in present-day San Juan Capistrano, where it still stands. The Spanish referred to the Acjachemem as the Juañeno. The Spanish made the first recorded anthropogenic changes to hydrology in the San Juan watershed, which included excavating irrigation channels, diverting water from streams, and channelizing and changing course of streams. Grazing animals introduced by Europeans, mainly cattle (and later sheep, after a drought decimated the local cattle ranching industry), consumed native grasses and left hillsides exposed and prone to erosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> by Spanish explorers in the 18th century, {{although}} there are now many places in California that use the name. Historically, the creek served as {{the boundary between the}} Juaneño (Acjachemem) and Gabrieleño (Tongva) Indians. The creek's watershed then became a major portion of the 1842 Rancho Niguel Mexican Land Grant to Juan Avila, later purchased by two American ranchers. Although attempts to use the creek and its watershed as a municipal water source date to the early 20thcentury, the water it provided was of poor quality and erratic occurrence. As a result, the creek became neglected throughout the late part of the century, eventually becoming little more than an open wastewater drain. Despite this general decline, the Aliso Creek watershed still supports some biodiversity, and it remains a popular recreational area.|$|E

25|$|Most of Cranberry Creek's {{water was}} {{redirected}} to the Jeddo Tunnel until the creek was restored by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation {{and moved to}} its original location.

25|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, there were {{tensions}} among the Creek, with {{young men of}} the Upper Creek promoting a revival of religion and traditional culture, and the Lower Creek, more influenced by settlement and trade with European Americans in Georgia, becoming more assimilated. In addition, in 1811, the Shawnee chief Tecumseh of the upper Northwest appealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creek</b> to join his Western Confederacy to try to drive out and exterminate the European settlers west of the Appalachians.|$|E
25|$|After {{defeating}} the Confederacy, the United States required new peace treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes. The Treaty of 1866 required the Creek to abolish slavery within their territory and to grant tribal citizenship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creek</b> Freedmen {{who chose to}} stay in the territory; this citizenship included voting rights and shares of annuities and land allotments. If the Creek Freedmen moved out to United States territory, they would be granted United States citizenship, as were other emancipated slaves.|$|E
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of open war between Spain and England in 1702, slaving raids by Uchise Creek and Yamasee Indians allied with the English Province of Carolina began reaching far down the Florida peninsula. The English supplied firearms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Creek</b> and Yemasee, but the Calusa, who had isolated themselves from Europeans, had none. Ravaged by new infectious diseases introduced to the Americas by European contact and by the slaving raids, the surviving Calusa retreated south and east.|$|E

40|$|Mangrove {{forests in}} meso-tidal areas are {{completely}} drained during low tides, forming only temporary habitats for fish. We hypothesised that in such temporary habitats, where stranding risks are high, distance from tidal creeks that provided access to inundated areas during receding tides {{would be the}} primary determinant of fish distribution. Factors such as depth, root density and shade were hypothesised to have secondary effects. We tested these hypotheses in a tidally drained mangrove patch in the Andaman Islands, India. Using stake nets, we measured fish abundance and species richness relative to distance from creeks, root density/m(2), shade, water depth and size (total length) of fish. We also predicted that larger fish (including potential predators) would be closer to creeks, as they faced a greater chance of mortality if stranded. Thus we conducted tethering trials to examine if predation would be greater close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creeks.</b> Generalised linear mixed effects models showed that fish abundance was negatively influenced by increasing creek distance interacting with fish size and positively influenced by depth. Quantile regression analysis showed that species richness was limited by increasing creek distance. Proportion of predation was greatest close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creeks</b> (0 - 25 m) and declined with increasing distance. Abundance was also low very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creeks,</b> suggesting that close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>creeks</b> predation pressure {{may be an important}} determinant of fish abundance. The overall pattern however indicates that access to permanently inundated areas, may be an important determinant of fish distribution in tidally drained mangrove forests...|$|R
