5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 <b>to</b> <b>Dye</b> Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E

5|$|While no {{official}} service uniform {{was developed for}} the tropics, during the Mutiny in India in 1857, many of the regiments fought in their undress uniform (white drill), rather than the standard uniform. The 52nd were the first regiment <b>to</b> <b>dye</b> their white uniforms khaki {{for use in the}} field. This early khaki was a grey colour. For most purposes, they discarded their coats and, adopting the Indian traditions, wore their shirts out, rather than tucked in; shirts were also dyed. The 52nd also developed turbans to wear over their standard-issue forage caps. Following the mutiny, regiments returned to the standard red clothing.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Some {{patients}} with occupational asthma resulting from exposure <b>to</b> reactive <b>dyes</b> have skin reactivity <b>to</b> the causative <b>dyes</b> and specific IgE <b>to</b> reactive <b>dyes</b> {{have been found}} in these patients. However, the usefulness of skin prick tests (SPTs) and serological measurement of specific IgE in screening, diagnosis, and monitoring the occupational asthma resulting from exposure <b>to</b> reactive <b>dyes</b> have not yet been assessed. In this study, the clinical validation of SPTs and measurement of specific IgE to vinyl sulphone reactive dyes by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was evaluated.  METHODS— 42  Patients with occupational asthma from reactive dyes (true positive group) were enrolled. In these the causative reactive dye was confirmed by bronchial challenge test. 93  Asymptomatic factory workers with negative challenge <b>to</b> the reactive <b>dye</b> (true negative group) and 16  unexposed controls with negative challenge <b>to</b> the reactive <b>dye</b> were also enrolled. Skin prick tests were done with 10  mg/ml reactive dye in 0. 4 % phenol/ 0. 9 % saline. IgE specific <b>to</b> reactive <b>dye</b> conjugated <b>to</b> human serum albumin (HSA) was measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).  RESULTS—None of the unexposed controls had a positive response to SPTs. The sensitivity (76. 2 % v 53. 7 %), specificity (91. 4 % v 86. 0 %), positive predictive value (80. 0 % v 62. 9 %), and negative predictive value (89. 5 % v 80. 8 %) of SPTs were higher than those of ELISAs. The mean weal size of reaction <b>to</b> reactive <b>dye</b> was weakly correlated with the ELISA optical density of IgE <b>to</b> reactive <b>dye</b> conjugate in {{patients with}} occupational asthma from reactive dyes (n= 41, r= 0. 337, p< 0. 05). In four patients with occupational asthma from reactive dyes and eight control subjects exposed <b>to</b> reactive <b>dye,</b> IgE specific <b>to</b> reactive <b>dye</b> conjugated <b>to</b> HSA was detected with ELISA even though they showed negative skin reactivity. Six patients completely avoided the reactive dye for a mean (SD) 27. 8  (10. 3) months, IgE specific <b>to</b> reactive <b>dyes</b> decreased in all six patients (p< 0. 05) during this time.  CONCLUSIONS—Both SPTs and detection of IgE specific <b>to</b> reactive <b>dye</b> in serum samples could be valuable for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring occupational asthma resulting from exposure <b>to</b> reactive <b>dyes.</b> These two tests would complement each other.    Keywords: reactive dye; occupational asthma; skin prick tes...|$|R
5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth <b>to</b> <b>dye</b> black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
