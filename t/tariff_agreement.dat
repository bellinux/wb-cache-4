Cushing arrived in Macao in February 1844. On June 18th, the Qing imperial envoy, viceroy Qiying (Tsiyeng), and Cushing negotiated in Macao near the village of Wanghia. Qiying largely accepted the treaty as drafted by the United States.

5000|$|The 1932 Democratic {{campaign}} platform {{pledged to}} lower tariffs. After winning the election, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the now-Democratic Congress passed Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. This act allowed the President to negotiate tariff reductions on a bilateral basis, and also treated such a <b>tariff</b> <b>agreement</b> as regular legislation, requiring a majority, {{rather than as}} a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote. This was one of the core components of the trade negotiating framework that developed after World War II. The tit-for-tat responses of other countries were understood to have contributed to a sharp reduction of trade in the 1930s. After World War II this understanding supported a push towards multi-lateral trading agreements that would prevent similar situations in the future. While the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 focused on foreign exchange and did not directly address tariffs, those involved wanted a similar framework for international trade. President Harry S. Truman launched this process in December 1945 with negotiations {{for the creation of a}} proposed International Trade Organization (ITO). As it happened, separate negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) moved more quickly, with an agreement signed in October 1947; in the end, the US never signed the ITO agreement. Adding a multilateral [...] "most-favored-nation" [...] component to that of reciprocity, the GATT served as a framework for the gradual reduction of tariffs over the subsequent half century.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the scope of}} Bergstrom’s (1982) results is studied. Moreover, his {{analysis}} is extended assuming that extraction cost {{is directly related to}} accumulated extractions. For the case of a competitive market it is found that the optimal policy is a constant tariff if extraction is costless. However, with depletion effects, the optimal tariff must ultimately be decreasing. For the case of a monopolistic market the results depend crucially on the kind of strategies the importing country governments can play and on whether the monopolist chooses the price or extraction rate. For a price-setting monopolist it is shown that the importing countries cannot use a tariff to capture monopoly rents if they are constrained to use open-loop strategies, even if the governments sign a <b>tariff</b> <b>agreement.</b> This result is drastically modified if the importing countries in the <b>tariff</b> <b>agreement</b> use Markov (feedback) strategies.

Based on the RE-LY study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin prescribed in “real-world” settings from a Russian payer perspective. Material and methods. Markov model simulated AF patients at moderate to high risk of stroke while tracking clinical events and resulting functional disability. Acute event costs and resulting long-term follow-up costs incurred by disabled stroke survivors were calculated using general <b>tariff</b> <b>agreement</b> of Russian obligatory health insurance system and official national statistics. Clinical events, summarized as events per 100 patient-years, expected life years, total costs, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. Results. Over a lifetime, dabigatran etexilate treated patients experienced fewer intracranial haemorrhages and fewer ischaemic strokes. ICER of dabigatran etexilate was 461, 602 roubles per one additional life year versus “real-world” warfarin. Conclusion.

Material and methods. AF prevalence rate was calculated according to the large population studies data. The study was performed based on methodology for Cost of Illness evaluation. Expenses associated with INR monitoring within the obligatory medical insurance program were calculated based on the general <b>tariff</b> <b>agreement</b> for 2011 year {{for one of the}} territorial subject of Russia. Expenses associated with INR monitoring in outpatient departments of university clinics and commercial laboratories were calculated based on price list of respective institutes. Expenses associated with INR monitoring in case of self-monitoring were calculated based on expenses for portable coagulometer and test strips purchasing.  Results. Around 539 000 people in Russia are needed warfarin therapy and associated continuous INR monitoring. In the obligatory medical insurance program the cost of warfarin is less than 1 % of total costs and the direct costs of treatment and control of nearly 4 058. 12 RUR/person per year, in university clinics, respectively, 0. 03 %, and 13 019. 05 RUR, in case of self-monitoring - 0. 01 - 0. 05 % and from 40 405. 00 (in the first year) to 7 404. 98 RUR (in the consequent years), respectively.

40|$|M. B. A. According to du Plessis et al., (1994 : 67), {{the history}} of {{protectionism}} in trade goes almost {{as far back as}} that of trade itself. There are various arguments for the numerous benefits, which can be gained from free trade such as, efficiency and welfare gains. But, despite these benefits, governments have had counter arguments as to why protectionism is justified. Examples of these traditional arguments for protection are, the infant industry argument, the terms of trade argument, protection to increase employment in an industry, a tariff to offset foreign dumping and a tariff to improve the balance of payments. All of these arguments have important gains for the protected economy but could be considered beggar-thyneighbour policies since they are {{at the expense of the}} unprotected economy. Various trade instruments are used by governments to intervene in its countries trading activities. These trade instruments are categorised into, tariff, non-tariff barriers and export taxes and subsidies. Both tariff and non-tariff barriers are used to interfere on the import side of trade, whereas export subsidies and taxes are used to interfere with the free flow of exports. Tariff barriers include specific tariffs, ad valorem tariffs, import subsidies, preferential duties, most-favoured nation treatment and offshore assembly provisions. Nontariff barriers include import quotas, "voluntary" export restraints, government procurement provisions, local content provisions, administrative classification and restriction on service trade (du Plessis et al., 1994 : 67 - 70). An example of a protected industry in South Africa is the motor industry. The initial protectionist programmes used by the motor industry were characterised by local content policies. These programmes resulted in a heavily protected motor and component industry. In recent years, policymakers have attempted to reduce the level of protection in the industry through the Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP), in line with the General Trade and <b>Tariff</b> <b>Agreement</b> (GATT). This programme is not only attempting to reduce the use of trade instruments but, also to become globally competitive.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of health {{development}} in lndonesia is providing {{quality health care}} and assuring community access to equal health services for all citizen (universal coverage). In assuring the access to health services for the poor. Ministry of Health has launched special health insurance program for the poor (Askeskin). PT Askes was assigned by MOH to manage this program. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to improve facilities and management capabilities of health insurance administering bodies and health care providers. These include, improvement in case management, hospital accounting system, medical record, etc. This will be very useful for verification process and reducing the fraud and abuse. This study was conducted in order to provide valuable input for the Improvement of financing mechanism and payment system of referral providers in health insurance program for the poor (Askeskin). The objectives of this study are to calculate hospital claim on case management of Askeskin members and its real payment by PT Askes and to calculate the differences between claim and reimbursement (real payment) based on hospital components. The study design is cross-sectional. A Stratified Random Sampling method was conducted to select the study sites based on Human Development Index (HOI) and Fiscal Capacity (refers to Ministry of Finance Data) of district and city. Districts and cities were then classified into high, middle, or low level. The 3 selected study sites were: Kampar District (HPI 34, 1) in Riau Province which represent high HOI; North Bengkulu District (HPI: 30. 4) in Bengkulu province which represent middle HOI, and Pontianak City (HPI: 27. 7) in West Kalimantan Province which represent low HOI. The results show that <b>tariff</b> <b>agreement</b> of case management for Askeskin members was not in accordance with local real condition. Therefore, clear operational and technical Askeskin guidelines are needed to gain similar perception between PT Askes and health care providers· beside Improvement of socialization activities to the community. The amount of differences between claim and reimbursement varied among study sites. The difference was influenced by following factors: (1) existed guidelines that were not suitable with local specific real demand and (2) disparity among hospital facilities. Hospital with limited facility has difficulty to refer patient to another closed hospital which doesn 2 ̆ 7 t have contract with PT Askes. Furthermore, in some cases hospital with good facility cannot optimalize using their advanced equipment for treatment, because not stated in the contract with PT Askes.

We find that <b>tariff</b> <b>agreements</b> cannot achieve free trade in the presence of the dispute settlement procedure, although the cost of this limitation becomes small for high discount factors. Quota agreements can achieve free trade under the dispute settlement procedure; however, countries would always prefer to settle disputes with tariff sanctions, if given a choice.
