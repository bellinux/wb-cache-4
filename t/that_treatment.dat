5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so <b>that</b> <b>treatment</b> efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so <b>that</b> <b>treatment</b> efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E

5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends <b>that</b> <b>treatment</b> last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} Fischbach {{conducted at}} Columbia University stemmed from his previous work at Harvard University, Washington University {{and with the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health. The specialized focus of his research was on the influence trophic factors could have on the survival of nerve cells and the efficiency of synapses. After his arrival to Columbia, Fischbach {{was focused on the}} expression of neuregulin in regards to neuromuscular synapses, signaling pathways in the brain, transcription factors, as well as work on autism. His research on Neuregulin-1 revealed a possible function in CNS neurogenesis since the neuregulins were labeled throughout proliferation with an anti-MAP2 antibody and an anti-nestin antibody were suggested to have become neuron-restricted progenitors. Some of his other research examined the relationship between neuregulin and expression of myosin heavy chain and transcription factors in human muscle. The research found <b>that</b> <b>treatment</b> including neuregulin increased the number of acetylcholine receptors {{on the surface of the}} myotube as well as an increase in the early growth response family for transcription factors. These findings impact the available knowledge regarding muscle spindle fiber formation, myosin heavy chains development, and the feasibility of mimicking muscle development processes in vitro.|$|E

40|$|Triptolide, a major {{bioactive}} {{ingredient of}} a widely used herbal medicine, {{has been shown}} to possess multiple pharmacological functions, including potential neuroprotective effects pertinent to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in vitro. However, the therapeutic potential of triptolide for AD in vivo has not been thoroughly evaluated. In the present study, we investigated the impact of peripherally administered triptolide on AD-related behavior and neuropathology in APPswe/ PS 1 DE 9 (APP/PS 1) mice, an established model of AD. Our results showed <b>that</b> two-month <b>treatment</b> with triptolide rescued cognitive function in APP/PS 1 mice.
