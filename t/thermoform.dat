50|$|<b>Thermoform</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods of {{producing}} tactile maps. This process is also known as vacuum forming. <b>Thermoform</b> maps or plans are created from a process where a sheet of plastic is heated and vacuumed on top of a model or master. The master can be made from many substances, although certain materials are more durable than others. Since this process involves creating a mold, it is somewhat time consuming.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of the material rheology on the quality and the prediction and optimisation of the wall thickness distribution of <b>thermoformed</b> parts. In particular, the technique of the Membrane-Inflation Rheometer was improved. In this rheological test thermoplastic samples are deformed in an equibiaxial strain mode under process relevant conditions for temperature and strain rate. The rheological properties of <b>thermoforming</b> sheets were correlated with the quality of <b>thermoformed</b> parts. The rheological data was additionally used to calibrate a viscoelastic material model. The material constants are used as input for Finite-Element-Analysis of the deformation step in the <b>thermoforming</b> process. Based on the simulation of deformation in the <b>thermoforming</b> process, an optimisation algorithm is presented, which is used to calculate the temperature distribution in the <b>thermoforming</b> sheet to obtain the most even final wall thickness distribution. For different <b>thermoforming</b> parts an improvement of the final wallt hickness distribution could be achieved...|$|R

40|$|<b>Thermoforming</b> is {{commonly}} used to produce shaped plastic sheets for packaging consumer products. The conventional method of designing and making <b>thermoforming</b> moulds is laborious and time consuming. A method based on a reverse engineering approach and <b>thermoforming</b> feature concept is proposed. The method {{involves the use of}} a self-developed device to digitise the surface of a product. A CAD model that corresponds to the <b>thermoforming</b> mould of the product is then constructed by using the digitised data. The construction of the mould surface is based on the concept of a defined set of <b>thermoforming</b> mould features. A modified Laplacian smoothing technique is applied to process the digitised data for generating the <b>thermoforming</b> mould surfaces. Several examples are used to explain the working principle and demonstrate the viability of the proposed method. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|<b>Thermoformed</b> {{plastic parts}} are {{pervasive}} in modern products. Decorating these <b>thermoformed</b> parts {{is a critical}} step in their manufacture. For parts with significant relief, decorating the part after it is formed can be prohibitively expensive. Prior to <b>thermoforming,</b> the plastic which is in flat sheets or rolls can easily be fed through a printer. However, during <b>thermoforming</b> the plastic flows and stretches {{to conform to the}} shape of the mold distorting the original decoration. This paper describes a device called the Image-Based Three-Dimensional Digitizer (IB 3 D) which measures the plastic deformation using vision techniques. Knowing the deformation allows us to pre-distort the graphic printed on the flat sheets such that as the plastic flows into the <b>thermoforming</b> mold the decoration undistorts. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{thermoplastic}} {{nature of}} Parylene C is leveraged {{to enable the}} formation of three-dimensional structures using a thermal forming (<b>thermoforming)</b> technique. <b>Thermoforming</b> involves the heating of Parylene films above its glass transition temperature while they are physically confined in the final desired conformation. Micro and macro scale three-dimensional structures composed of Parylene thin films were developed using the <b>thermoforming</b> process, and the resulting chemical and mechanical changes to the films were characterized. No large changes {{to the surface and}} bulk chemistries of the polymer were observed following the <b>thermoforming</b> process conducted in vacuum. Heat treated structures exhibited increased stiffness by a maximum of 37 % depending on the treatment temperature, due to an increase in crystallinity of the Parylene polymer. This study revealed important property changes resulting from the process, namely (1) the development of high strains in <b>thermoformed</b> areas of small radii of curvature (30 – 90 µm) and (2) ∼ 1. 5 % bulk material shrinkage in <b>thermoformed</b> multilayered Parylene–Parylene and Parylene–metal–Parylene films. <b>Thermoforming</b> is a simple process whereby three-dimensional structures can be achieved from Parylene C-based thin film structures with tunable mechanical properties as a function of treatment temperature...|$|R

50|$|Polystyrene {{generally}} has stiffness, transparency, processibility, and dielectric qualities {{that make it}} useful. However, its low impact resistance at low temperatures makes catastrophic fracture failure when cold more likely. The most widely used version of toughened polystyrene is called high impact polystyrene or HIPS. Being cheap and easy to <b>thermoform</b> (see thermoforming), it is utilized for many everyday uses. HIPS is made by polymerizing styrene in a polybutadiene rubber solution. After the polymerization reaction begins, the polystyrene and rubber phases separate. When  phase separation begins, the two phases compete for volume until phase inversion occurs and the rubber can distribute throughout the matrix. The alternative emulsion polymerization with styrene-butadiene-styrene or styrene-butadiene copolymers allows fine-tuned manipulation of particle size distribution. This method makes use of the core-shell architecture.|$|E
40|$|AIM: Despite a very {{significant}} increase in the use of <b>thermoform</b> retainers, within orthodontics, to date, there is no evidence regarding the quality of fit between the dental cast and retainer. The current study aims to compare the fit of different <b>thermoform</b> retainer materials, under laboratory standardized conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, laboratory-based study design was adopted to compare the fit of four different commercially available <b>thermoform</b> retainer materials. A master dental cast was fabricated in dental stone, to which three and five specific reference points were located on the central incisors and upper first molars, respectively. The master cast was then duplicated to produce a total of 40 such dental casts. The performance of the following four test materials was investigated: ACE, C+ (Raintree Essix Glenroe), True Tain (True Tain Inc.), and Iconic Clear (DB Orthodontics). For each material, 10 <b>thermoform</b> retainers were fabricated within the dental laboratory. Subsequent scanning and analysing of the casts and <b>thermoform</b> retainers was performed in a dedicated area, using the co-ordinate measuring machine, in order to calculate their respective fit at the incisor and first molar regions. RESULTS: At all eight recorded landmark points, the mean values for the following <b>thermoform</b> materials: ACE, True Tain, and Iconic Clear, a similar trend was observed. At all eight points, {{there was a significant difference}} between the performance of the four different materials (P < 0. 001), with the greatest difference observed in the mean values in relation to material C+. CONCLUSION: Statistically significant differences were observed in the fit behaviour of all four <b>thermoform</b> materials being tested...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two general}} <b>thermoforming</b> process categories. Sheet {{thickness}} less than 1.5 mm (0.060 inches) is usually {{delivered to the}} <b>thermoforming</b> machine from rolls or from a sheet extruder. Thin-gauge roll-fed or inline extruded <b>thermoforming</b> applications are dominated by rigid or semi-rigid disposable packaging. Sheet thicknesses greater than 3 mm (0.120 inches) are usually delivered to the forming machine by hand or an auto-feed method already cut to final dimensions. Heavy, or thick-gauge, cut sheet <b>thermoforming</b> applications are primarily used as permanent structural components.

This thesis has three aspects: 1) to understand stiffness properties of a <b>thermoformed</b> stiffened ultra-lightweight panel, 2) to develop finite element models using a phasedverification approach and 3) to verify panel response to dynamic loading. This thesis demonstrates that conventional static and dynamic testing principles can be applied to test ultra-lightweight <b>thermoformed</b> stiffened structures. Another contribution of this thesis is by evaluating the stiffness properties of different stiffener configurations. Finally, the procedure used in this thesis could be adapted in the study of similar ultra-lightweight <b>thermoformed</b> stiffened spacecraft structures...|$|R

We demonstrate <b>thermoforming</b> of Parylene-Parylene and Parylene-metal-Parylene (PMP) structures for increased structural and mechanical functionality such as strain relief, formation of open-lumen sheath structures, and conformation-matching of curved surfaces that broaden applications for Parylene MEMS.

40|$|The {{following}} work {{details the}} design and fabrication of a tabletop <b>thermoform</b> machine {{with the goal of}} making this machine cheaper than the ones on the market, yet able to fulfill specific requirements. These functional requirements include creating parts that have dimensions within. 05 " of the original part; thermoforming plastics that range between a 3 " x 3 " and 12 " x 12 " size; and having the ability to heat the plastic to at least 150 °C in order to <b>thermoform</b> plastics such as polycarbonate. In addition, this machine had to be simple to manufacture and use. In order to achieve these requirements, a top to bottom drape forming architecture with a four bar linear slider and carriage, was constructed. In order to constrain the plastics of different sizes, two similar, modular wooden plates were used such that the plastic was held in between them via t-nuts and screws. When the user clamps the plastic onto the carriage, he or she slides the carriage upwards to an oven that radiates heat via nichrome wire on a mica sheet. Once the desired temperature is reached, the user then slides the carriage down onto a vacuum box platform, where a mold is present, and forms the plastic over the mold. While that happens, a negative pressure is applied inside the box via a standard commercial vacuum, so that the plastic adheres more closely to the mold. For the testing process, this work focuses on two manufacturing strategies for thermoforming parts: heating the air to the glass transition temperature before thermoforming, and heating the plastic to the glass transition temperature before thermoforming. Once this test was performed, the dimension of each plastic part was examined in order to see if the tolerance levels were reached. In addition, this test determined {{whether or not there was}} a statistical significance between the qualities of parts made by either of these processes. In the end, the <b>thermoform</b> machine was only able to reach an average tolerance of. 07 " for the created parts. In addition, there was no statistical significance between the part qualities of either one of the tested manufacturing processes. Some of the main reasons behind this include having an ineffective vacuum box and clamp design issues, which will be focused on in the future iteration of this project. by Akwasi Owusu-Akyaw.

Acknowledging common <b>thermoforming</b> machinery in Europe and China is valuable in describing <b>thermoformed</b> industrial process. This thesis focuses on presenting and comparing <b>thermoforming</b> machinery in Europe and China about production capacity, final product quality and components by the way of literature review. Moreover, fossil-based <b>thermoformed</b> plastics lead to environmental issues and waste disposal problems. Replacing it by some environment-friendly plastics is unavoidable and meritorious.

50|$|An {{integral}} part of the <b>thermoforming</b> process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge <b>thermoforming</b> as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge <b>thermoforming</b> also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated <b>thermoforming</b> machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large <b>thermoforming</b> manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|R
