The bonding at room temperature is mostly based on van-der-Waals forces between those hydrogen and fluorine atoms. Compared <b>to</b> <b>bonding</b> with hydrophilic surfaces, the interface energy is lower directly after contacting. This fact builds up {{the need for a}} higher surface quality and cleanliness to prevent unbonded areas and thereby to achieve a full-surface contact between the wafers (compare infrared photograph of a <b>bond</b> wave). Similar <b>to</b> <b>bonding</b> of hydrophilic surfaces, the pre-bond is followed by an annealing process.|$|R

5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> to extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.|$|E

40|$|Using novel data on investors' bond portfolios, {{we study}} the {{contagion}} {{of the crisis}} from securitized <b>bonds</b> <b>to</b> corporate <b>bonds.</b> When securitized bonds became “toxic” in August 2007, mutual funds retained the now illiquid securitized bonds and sold corporate bonds. Funds with negative flows or high liquidity needs liquidated more than others. Yield spreads increased more for corporate bonds whose pre-crisis bondholders were more heavily exposed <b>to</b> securitized <b>bonds,</b> compared <b>to</b> same-issuer <b>bonds</b> held by unexposed investors. The findings suggest that liquidity-constrained investors with exposure <b>to</b> securitized <b>bonds</b> {{played a role in}} propagating the crisis from securitized <b>to</b> corporate <b>bonds...</b>|$|R

5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and it tends to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E

5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E

5|$|The element has two {{crystalline}} forms under 1 {{standard atmosphere}} of pressure: a double-hexagonal close-packed form dubbed alpha (α) and a face-centered cubic form designated beta (β). The α form exists below 600–800°C with a density of 15.10 g/cm3 and the β form exists above 600–800°C with a density of 8.74 g/cm3. At 48GPa of pressure the β form changes into an orthorhombic crystal system due to delocalization of the atom's 5f electrons, which frees them <b>to</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} {{normally}} found {{in association with}} other base metals such as copper and lead in ores. Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> with sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc.|$|E
