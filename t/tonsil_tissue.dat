25|$|The {{historical}} {{treatment of}} OPC was surgical, with an approach through {{the neck and}} splitting of the jaw bone, {{which resulted in a}} considerable risk of death. Later, radiotherapy with or without the addition of chemotherapy, provided a less invasive alternative, and the results in terms of treating the cancer, were comparable. Newer minimally invasive surgical techniques through the mouth have improved outcomes, and surgery is often followed by radiation and or chemotherapy in high risk cases. In the absence of high quality evidence, management decisions are often based on technical factors, likely functional loss and the persons preferences. Some HPV+OPC may first appear in lymph nodes in the neck, without an obvious source (cancer of unknown primary origin) but removal of <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> from the oropharynx will often show hidden disease. The presence of HPV in the tumour is associated with a better response to treatment and a better outcome, independent of the treatment methods used and a nearly 60% reduced risk of dying from the cancer. Most recurrence occurs locally and within the first year after treatment. The use of tobacco decreases the chances of survival.

In the United States and other countries, the number of cases of oropharyngeal cancer has been increasing steadily, with the incidence of HPV+OPC increasing faster than the decline in HPV-OPC.

Study design: Prospective randomized study. Methods: We recruited 18 atopic children who had rhinitis symptoms and were sensitized to more than one common aeroallergen, and 22 nonatopic chil-dren undergoing adenotonsillectomy. Immunoassays were performed using adenoid tissue homogenate to quantify the levels of three staphylococcal SAg-spe-cific IgE (SEA, SEB, and TSST- 1), total IgE, eosino-phil cationic protein (ECP), mast cell tryptase, and soluble CD 23. Results: Three kinds of SAg-specific IgE were detected in the adenoid and <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissues</b> of atopic patients, but not in those of nonatopic patients. In atopic children, the prevalence of SEA-, SEB-, and TSST- 1 -specific IgE in adenoid tissues (61. 1 %, 27. 8 %, 33. 3 %, respectively) were higher than those in <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissues</b> (38. 9 %, 5. 6 %, 11. 1 %, respectively) and in sera (11. 1 %, 27. 8 %, 16. 7 %, respectively).

In this study, we aimed to find the relationships between pepsin and tonsillar hypertrophy. We explored the notion whether tonsillar hypertrophy was due to pepsin-mediated gastric reflux in tonsil hypertrophy. Fifty-four children with tonsil hypertrophy and 30 adults with tonsillitis were recruited before surgical treatment. Blood and <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissues</b> from each patient were harvested for analysis of changes in lymphocyte and macrophage numbers coupled with histological and biochemical analysis. Pepsin was expressed at different levels in <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissues</b> from each tonsillar hypertrophy. Pepsin-positive cells {{were found in the}} crypt epithelium, surrounding the lymphoid follicle with developing fibrosis, and also surrounding the lymphoid follicle that faced the crypt. And also, pepsin staining was well correlated with damaged tonsillar squamous epithelium and TGF-β 1 and iNOS expression in the tonsil section. In addition, pepsin and TGF-β 1 -positive cells were co-localized with CD 68 -positive cells in the crypt and surrounding germinal centers. In comparison of macrophage responsiveness to pepsin, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were noticeably larger in the presence of activated pepsin in the child group. Furthermore, CD 11 c and CD 163 -positive cells were significantly increased by activated pepsin. However, this was not seen for the culture of PBMNCs from the adult group.

40|$|A utilização de métodos moleculares baseados em PCR é {{fundamental}} na detecção do Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, sendo capaz de identificar a infecção antes do estabelecimento da doença no rebanho. Estes métodos apresentam maior sensibilidade quando comparados com métodos tradicionais de isolamento bacteriano, mas podem sofrer influência de substâncias que reduzem a especificidade do teste e proporcionam o aparecimento de amplificações inespecíficas. No intuito de reduzir as amplificações inespecíficas, observadas quando aplicada a PCR para o gene cpx em amostras de tecido tonsilar, procedeu-se a otimização da técnica, na qual foram analisados o efeito do pré-cultivo bacteriano e as diferentes temperaturas de anelamento dos iniciadores e foi introduzido, no protocolo, um anticorpo que se liga na enzima Taq DNA Polimerase, aumentando a especificidade do teste. Paralelamente, foi realizado um experimento para verificar o efeito inibidor do tecido tonsilar sobre os resultados da PCR. Para isso, porções de tonsila de animais negativos para A. pleuropneumoniae foram contaminadas artificialmente com a amostra referência do sorotipo 5 B. A adição do anticorpo para a enzima Taq DNA Polimerase e o aumento da temperatura de anelamento dos iniciadores para 57 °C diminuiu o aparecimento de amplificações inespecíficas. Os resultados obtidos no experimento demonstraram que o tecido tonsilar possui efeito inibidor nas amplificações da PCR. Além disso, a amplificação depende de, no mínimo, 675 UFC presentes na alíquota da amostra usada na PCR (equivalente a 1, 35 x 10 (5) UFC mL- 1), assim, amostras de fragmentos de tecido de infecções iniciais e/ou com poucas células podem apresentar resultados falsos negativos.

These methods have larger sensitivity when compared with traditional methods of bacteriological isolation, but they can suffer influence of substances that reduce the specificity of the test and resulting in inespecific amplifications. In order to reduce inespecific amplifications, observed when applied the PCR technique for the gene cpx in <b>tonsil's</b> <b>tissue</b> samples, the optimization was performed, in which different annealing temperatures were analyzed and introduced, in the technique, an antibody that binds to the enzyme Taq DNA Polimerase, increasing its specificity.

The results obtained in the experiment demonstrated a possible inhibiting effect of the <b>tonsil's</b> <b>tissue</b> in the PCR amplifications. Besides, amplifications depend on at least 675 UFC present in the aliquot of samples that will be used in PCR (equivalent to 1. 35 x 10 (5) UFC mL- 1), therefore, samples tissue's fragments in initial infections and/or with few cells can result in false-negative...|$|R

In addition, the location of W 5 C 5 + cells expressed in the <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissues</b> is examined. Methods: T-MSCs were isolated from the tonsillar tissues of 12 patients undergoing tonsillectomy. The colony-forming ability, surface markers, proliferation potential, and differentiation capacities of purified W 5 C 5 + MSCs, W 5 C 5 - MSCs, and unselected T-MSCs were evaluated. The location of the W 5 C 5 + cells in the tonsillar tissues was also investigated by immunohistochemistry. Results: W 5 C 5 was expressed in 2. 5 ± 0. 4 % of fresh human tonsil stromal cells. W 5 C 5 + cells formed many colonies, but W 5 C 5 - cells did not form any colonies. The colony-forming number of W 5 C 5 + cells (74. 4 ± 9. 8) was significantly higher than that of unselected tonsil stromal cells (23. 6 ± 3. 7). However, the differences in proliferation potential, surface marker expression, and differentiation potential between W 5 C 5 + T-MSCs and unselected T-MSCs were not significant. W 5 C 5 + cells were identified in the perivascular area around the blood vessels. Conclusion: W 5 C 5 + T-MSCs possessed typical MSC properties with high colony-forming efficiency, and niches of W 5 C 5 + T-MSCs were located in the perivascular area of <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissues.</b> These findings suggest that W 5 C 5 is a useful single marker for the isolation of purified T-MSCs...|$|R

40|$|Infection of calves with bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BHV- 1) {{results in}} transient immunosuppression {{that may lead}} to bacterium-induced pneumonia and, occasionally, death. Although sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) are the primary site of BHV- 1 latency, viral genomes are detected in the tonsils of latently infected calves. Dexamethasone (DEX) consistently induces reactivation from latency, and viral gene expression is detected in TG and tonsils. In sensory neurons of latently infected calves, the latency-related (LR) gene is abundantly expressed and is required for reactivation from latency. In the present study, we compared the abilities of wild-type (wt) BHV- 1 and a strain with a mutation in the LR gene (the LR mutant strain) to grow in the tonsils of infected calves and reactivate from latency. Lower levels of the LR mutant virus were detected in the tonsils of acutely infected calves. LR mutant viral DNA was consistently detected by PCR in the tonsils of latently infected calves, suggesting that the establishment of a latent or persistent infection occurred. Although the LR mutant did not reactivate from latency in vivo after DEX treatment, explanation of <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> from calves latently infected with the LR mutant yielded infectious virus. Relative to wt BHV- 1, the LR mutant did not induce explant-induced reactivation as efficiently. These studies indicate that the LR gene promotes virus shedding from <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> during acute infection and reactivation from latency in <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> in vivo. We suggest that incorporation of the LR gene mutation into existing modified live vaccines would prevent reactivation from latency in neural and nonneural sites and would thus prevent transmission to other animals...|$|E

We aimed to assess prevalence of HPV infection in nonmalignant tonsillar crypt epithelia and to histopathologically characterise positive samples. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> specimens were obtained from an age- and sex-stratified random sample of patients aged 0 – 69 years whose paired tonsils were archived following elective tonsillectomy at hospitals throughout England and Southern Scotland from 2004 to 2008. Homogenised fresh-frozen <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> was also obtained from archive for two random subsets of males aged 25 – 34 and over 44. HPV status was assessed in all samples for 20 mucosal HPV types by GP 5 +/ 6 + polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enzyme immunoassay and by HPV 16 type-specific PCR targeting the E 6 gene. In the homogenised material, HPV status was also assessed for 44 HPV types by SPF 10 -PCR enzyme immunoassay. Of 4, 095 randomly sampled FFPE specimens, amplifiable DNA was extracted from 3, 377 (82. 5 %) and from 511 of 524 (97. 5 %) homogenised tonsils. HPV DNA was identified in 0 of 3, 377 (0 %, 95 % CI 0 – 0. 089 %) fixed samples and 0 of 511 (0 %, 95 % CI 0 – 0. 58 %) homogenised samples. This suggests HPV infection may be rare in tonsil reticulated crypt epithelia. Furthermore, we {{found no evidence of}} HPV-associated premalignant neoplasia.

40|$|Progressive {{multifocal}} leukoencephalopathy is a {{demyelinating disease}} of the human central nervous system that results from lytic infection of oligodendrocytes by the polyomavirus JC (JCV). Originally, JCV was thought to replicate exclusively in human glial cells, specifically oligodendrocytes. However, we have recently shown that JCV can replicate in cells of lymphoid origin such as hematopoietic precursor cells, B lymphocytes, and tonsillar stromal cells. To determine whether tonsils harbor JCV, we tested a total of 54 tonsils, 38 from children and 16 from adult donors. Nested PCRs with primer sets specific for the viral T protein and regulatory regions {{were used for the}} detection of JCV DNA. JCV DNA was detected in 21 of 54 tonsil tissues, or 39 % (15 of 38 children and 6 of 16 adults) by using regulatory-region primers and in 19 of 54 tonsil tissues, or 35 % (13 of 38 children and 6 of 16 adults) by using the T-protein primers. The DNA extracted from children’s nondissected <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue,</b> isolated tonsillar lymphocytes, and isolated stromal cells that demonstrated PCR amplification of the JCV regulatory region underwent cloning and nucleotide sequencing. Of the regulatory-region sequences obtained, nearly all contained tandem repeat arrangements.

Methods A paraffin-embedded <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> cylinder was sampled from a donor block using an automated sampler and included as an ‘internal control ’ together with a bone marrow biopsy in a recipient block, avoiding the use of external <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> control. To validate this technique, the authors compared the quality of immunohistochemistry, the workload and costs with routine external control in 50 consecutive bone marrow biopsies. Results Processing simultaneously the sample and the tissue control in the same block, 60 external positive control tests were spared. Only a few minutes were taken for the preparation of the recipient blocks, and no particular technical skill was required. Considering that the volume of antibodies used for the analysis of each sample was not increased, a considerable amount of the disposable material was saved. The workload of technicians was decreased and some potential technical bias was avoided. The time required for pathologists to interpret the slides was also reduced.

METHODS [...] The expression of p 53, Rb and bcl- 2 proteins in paraffin wax embedded <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> sections was detected by immunohistochemistry using an (APAAP) technique following microwave irradiation. Flow cytometric analysis as performed on phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated PBLs, with simultaneous S fraction determination. RESULTS [...] Expression of p 53 protein was detected in reactive tonsil germinal centre cells, in some suprabasal cells in the surface and cryptic epithelium, and in some endothelial cells. Analysis of p 53 in PHA stimulated PBLs revealed expression of p 53 by non-tumoral activated lymphocytes. Rb protein expression was increased in PHA stimulated PBLs and was usually detected in most germinal centre B cells, in isolated paracortical cells, in a fraction of endothelial cells, and in most epithelial suprabasal cells. Expression of bcl- 2 in stimulated lymphocytes was inversely correlated with proliferation. This confirms findings in reactive <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> samples, where proliferating cells located in the germinal centres and paracortical area are mostly bcl- 2 negative.

Due to frequent antibiotic exposure, swine is now recognized as potential risk in disseminating drug-resistant Salmonella enterica strains. This study thus subjected 20 randomly selected S. enterica isolates from tonsil and jejunum with lymph node (JLN) tissues of swine slaughtered in Metro Manila, Philippines, to VITEK 2 {{antimicrobial susceptibility testing}} (AST). The test revealed all 20 isolates had resistance {{to at least one}} antimicrobial agent, in which highest occurrence of resistance was to amikacin (100 %), cefazolin (100 %), cefuroxime (100 %), cefuroxime axetil (100 %), cefoxitin (100 %), and gentamicin (100 %), followed by ampicillin (50 %), and then by sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim (30 %). Three multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates were detected. The sole S. enterica serotype Enteritidis isolate showed resistance to 12 different antibiotics including ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, amikacin, gentamicin, and tigecycline. This study is the first to report worldwide on the novel resistance to tigecycline of MDR S. enterica serotype Enteritidis isolated from swine <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissues.</b> This finding poses huge therapeutic challenge since MDR S. enterica infections are associated with increased rate of hospitalization or death. Thus, continual regulation of antimicrobial use in food animals and prediction of resistant serotypes are crucial to limit the spread of MDR S. enterica isolates among hogs and humans...|$|R
40|$|Background The 21 st century {{opened with}} a {{revolution}} due to nanotechnology as special emerging technology. We have heard about nanobiotechnology, nanomedicine, nanomaterials, nanoparticles, etc. Applications of nanotechnologies {{in the field of}} medicine are growing rapidly. Areas such as disease diagnosis, drug delivery and molecular imaging are being investigated intensively. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify nano-sized particles in human <b>tonsils</b> <b>tissues</b> as an entering filter of air breathed. Methods Three main groups of tonsil samples were chosen for evaluation of the fine-particles presence. First group of samples were randomly selected tonsils of children undergoing “cold” tonsillectomy, second group tonsil samples of dead born children, and third group were tonsils with histologically proved spinocellular carcinoma. Dehydrated tissue samples were analyzed using scanning electron microscope with X-ray microanalysis (SEMEDX), which enabled analysis of particles morphology and elemental composition. Results Presence of various nanostructured metallic agglomerates in all groups assessed was confirmed. Dominant metals found almost in all tissues analyzed were iron and zinc. Differences were found between groups of various age, lifestyle, living environment affected by industrial processes and last but not least diagnose. Conclusion(s) The study allowed to ascertain that environmental pollution may strongly affect human health. Through SEM-EDX analysis it was possible to verify character and composition of particles, unintentionally released into the environment by industrial processes and road traffic, which were present in pathological tissues...|$|R

The competitive layer model is used to provide a binding of features to convex groups, corresponding to uorescent cell bodies. Although the images contain noise, and the cells' shapes show considerable variation, the uorescent cell contours are extracted with sucient accuracy, according to the biomedical expert. The method achieves at the same time grouping and gure-ground segmentation, and does not require to manually x the number of groups. ...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{invasive}} pneumococcal disease {{caused by}} Streptococcus pneumoniae is {{most common in}} young children. In adults, disease rates decline following intermittent colonization and the acquisition of naturally acquired immunity. We characterized mucosal and systemic pneumococcal-specific T-cell responses in African children and adults who contend with intense rates of colonization, up to 100 % and 60 % respectively. We find most Malawian children have high pneumococcal-specific T-cell responses in <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue</b> and peripheral blood. In addition, frequent commensalism generates CD 25 (hi) (Tregs) which modulate mucosal pneumococcal-specific T-cell responses in some children and ≥ 50 % of adults. We propose that immune regulation may prolong pneumococcal colonization and predispose vulnerable individuals to disease...|$|E
40|$|Immunomodulators, {{including}} toll-like receptors (TLRs) and defensins, {{produced in}} response to pathogenic stimuli, can direct the developing immune system toward a TH 1 nonallergic phenotype. Increased human -defensin (HBD) 4 expression is associated with infection. Objective: To determine whether reduced mucosal levels of TLRs and defensins contribute to the inflammation seen in chronic allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction {{was used to determine}} gene expression levels of HBDs 1 through 4 and TLRs 2 and 4. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to study the localization and distribution of protein for a-defensins 1 through 3, HBD 2, neutrophil elastase, and TLR 2 in sections of nasal turbinate tissue from adults with persistent allergic and idiopathic rhinitis, healthy nasal mucosa, and <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue.</b> Results: Allergic mucosa showed a significant (P = 3 D. 02) reduction in TLR 2 messenger RNA expression compared with control mucosa and generally reduced expression for TLR 4 and HBDs. Although not significant, the nonallergic group also showed reduced expression for TLRs and HBDs. With the exception of HBD 4, increased target gene levels were seen in <b>tonsil</b> <b>tissue.</b> Protein expression of HBD 2 and TLR 2 was localized in lining and submucosal glandular epithelium but insignificant differences were seen for HBDs, TLRs, neutrophils, and a-defensin between the rhinitic and control patient groups. Conclusions: Subjects with allergic and nonallergic rhinitis show reduced TLR and HBD gene expression. The significant reduction in TLR 2 gene expression in allergic adults supports the concept that increased TLR 2 protects against the development of allergy. The low levels of HBD 4 detected in both rhinitis groups suggest lack of an underlying infection pathophysiological featur...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{evaluate}} the existence of a link between biofilm assembly on pharyngeal tonsil and the incidence of recurrent infections within a paediatric population. Methods: Nasal and pharyngeal tonsils scrubs as well as a biopsies of pharyngeal <b>tonsils</b> <b>tissue</b> were collected (n= 70) and processed for bacterial identification using standard microbiologic methods. Bacteria were identified at the species level using a VITEC apparatus. Another pharyngeal tonsil biopsies were processed for electron microscopy. Initially, a screening for the presence of biofilms was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) being the positive samples further processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Biofilm assembly assay ability in vitro was evaluated by the microtiter-plate test. The assay was performed at 37 ºC in Muller-Hinton broth for different periods of time. Results: As expected a vast number of bacterial species were identified in the samples. The majority were aerobic and a balance between Gram negative and positive bacteria was observed. A good correlation between the floras of the three samples from the same patient was found. The presence of biofilms pharyngeal tonsils was assessed by SEM. The data collected so far suggest that in at least 30 % of the samples biofilms were present. In vitro all the microorganisms evaluated were able to assemble biofilms. Conclusion: Biofilm formation can be part of the mechanism involved both in onset and propagation of infections. Further studies must be performed to validate the thesis that pharyngeal tonsils function as a reservoir for microorganisms...|$|R
