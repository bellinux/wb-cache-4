5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of Corpus Christi {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded Corpus Christi and occupied <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> <b>and</b> port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was established on <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> <b>and</b> by 1944 had transformed into a major base with one main air station and six additional stations. Notably, during a March 1960 practice run from the base, future Senator John McCain lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. He squeezed out of the cockpit, swam ten feet to the surface, and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter, therefore escaping without major injuries.|$|E

5|$|A small naval squadron, {{consisting}} of HMS Aeolus, HMS Cleopatra and the brig HMS Recruit, advanced into Fort-de-France Bay on 5 February. This advance spread panic among the French militia defending <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> <b>and</b> Amphitrite {{and the other}} shipping anchored there were set on fire and destroyed, while the forts {{in the southern part}} of the island were abandoned. On 8 February, Maitland's force, which had not yet fired a shot, arrived on the western side of Fort Desaix and laid siege to it. Minor detachments spread across the remainder of the island: Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Barnes captured Saint-Pierre and another force occupied Fort-de-France and seized the corvette Diligente in the harbour. By 10 February, when Prevost's force linked up with Maitland's, Fort Desaix was the only remaining point of resistance.|$|E
5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> <b>and</b> its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E

5|$|On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City.

In 1816 the pirate Louis-Michel Aury established a settlement on Galveston Island but was soon succeeded by the pirate Jean Lafitte.

5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> <b>and</b> are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E
