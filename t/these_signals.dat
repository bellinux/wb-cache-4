5|$|Human {{behaviour}} {{may also}} provide examples of costly signals. In general, <b>these</b> <b>signals</b> {{provide information about}} a person’s phenotypic quality or cooperative tendencies.

5|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates {{to respond to}} changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. <b>These</b> <b>signals</b> are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. <b>These</b> <b>signals</b> are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{the work}} of many {{researchers}} enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of <b>these</b> <b>signals</b> via radio waves over very long distances.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1982season (with Debby), the Hurricane Hunter Aircraft (also {{known as}} P-3s) began running a new mission for NOAA's Hurricane Research Division. The {{mission was to}} drop dropwindsondes that {{deployed}} very-low Omega frequency signals. <b>These</b> <b>signals</b> were to estimate the sonde's motion compared to the aircraft in certain areas in a storm.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of <b>these</b> <b>signals</b> can {{be considered in the}} analysis with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore <b>these</b> <b>signals</b> and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E

5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. <b>These</b> <b>signals</b> were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E
5|$|Most {{termites}} are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, {{mechanical and}} pheromonal cues. These {{methods of communication}} are used {{in a variety of}} activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the sternal and tergal glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also communicate through mechanical cues, vibrations, and physical contact. <b>These</b> <b>signals</b> are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 June Cornwallis {{returned}} to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on {{the morning of}} 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard. Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship HMS Mars, until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect Mars, Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship HMS Royal Sovereign between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back. At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate HMS Phaeton to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. <b>These</b> <b>signals,</b> in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as Cornwallis's Retreat.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance <b>these</b> <b>signals</b> would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send <b>these</b> <b>signals</b> {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that <b>these</b> <b>signals</b> could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E
