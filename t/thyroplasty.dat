5000|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} types of <b>thyroplasty</b> procedures described by Isshiki: ...|$|E
5000|$|Type 3 <b>thyroplasty</b> - Shortening of {{the vocal}} folds (done {{to lower the}} vocal pitch).|$|E
5000|$|Type 4 <b>thyroplasty</b> - Lengthening of {{the vocal}} folds (done {{to raise the}} vocal pitch).|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there are}} four types of implant {{procedures}} which are used to perform type 1 <b>thyroplasty.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Type 1 <b>thyroplasty</b> - Medialization of {{the vocal}} folds (most common surgery for {{unilateral}} vocal cord paralysis).|$|E
5000|$|Type 2 <b>thyroplasty</b> - Lateralization of {{the vocal}} folds (in case of airway {{insufficiency}} after Laryngeal trauma).|$|E
50|$|In this <b>thyroplasty,</b> the {{relaxation}} of the vocal cords {{is done by}} antero-posterior shortening of the thyroid ala.|$|E
5000|$|The {{patient is}} asked to phonate to {{evaluate}} voice quality and the potential need for a concurrent <b>thyroplasty.</b>|$|E
50|$|Options for {{surgical}} treatment of vocal cord paralysis include vocal cord injection, medialization <b>thyroplasty,</b> and arytenoid adduction. Each {{of these techniques}} results in medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord. However, arytenoid adduction is preferred in cases {{where there is a}} large posterior glottal gap or vertical misalignment between the vocal folds. Arytenoid adduction is often performed {{at the same time as}} a medialization <b>thyroplasty.</b> Animal model studies suggest that combining the two procedures produces better outcomes than when performing either alone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{only known}} {{indication}} for type 2 <b>thyroplasty</b> is adductor spasmodic dysphonia, a condition characterized by involuntary movements of {{muscles of the}} larynx during speech.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thyroplasty</b> is a phonosurgical {{technique}} {{designed to}} improve the voice by altering the thyroid cartilage of the larynx (the voice box), which houses the vocal cords in order to change the position or {{the length of the}} vocal cords.|$|E
50|$|For {{patients}} with significant paralysis at 12 months post-onset, medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> may be suggested. This surgical procedure introduces a shim between the inner {{wall of the}} larynx and the soft tissue supporting the vocal fold. As a result, the paralyzed vocal fold is supported in a position closer to the midline of the glottis, and retains its ability to vibrate and phonate efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Arytenoid {{adduction}} is {{a surgical}} procedure {{used to treat}} vocal cord paralysis. A suture is used to emulate {{the action of the}} lateral cricoarytenoid muscle and position the paralyzed vocal cord closer to the midline. This allows the two vocal cords to meet and can improve speaking and swallowing ability for affected patients. Arytenoid adduction is often performed in conjunction with medialization <b>thyroplasty.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{this type}} of <b>thyroplasty,</b> a {{rectangular}} portion of the thyroid cartilage is mobilized and pushed towards the medial side using a piece of silastic block of proper shape under local anesthesia.Earlier, the piece of the thyroid cartilage was kept along with implant and the stitches were taken, but nowadays, the piece of the thyroid cartilage is cut and removed to avoid complications.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{surgical}} procedure used in conditions like adductor spasmodic dysphonia (a {{condition in which}} there is distortion of the voice due to excessively tight closure of the glottis on phonation).Generally, lateralization <b>thyroplasty</b> is intended to prevent this tight closure of the glottis at the terminal stage of phonation by lateralizing the position of the vocal cord.This is a completely mechanical process.|$|E
50|$|Arytenoid {{adduction}} with {{or without}} medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> significantly improves {{quality of life for}} patients with vocal cord paralysis. Subjective outcome measures of voice quality include the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain (GBRAS) voice scale, Voice Handicap Index, and closure of the glottic gap. Objective outcome measures include mean and maximum phonation time, phonotory airflow, and signal-to-noise ratio. Arytenoid adduction produces improvements in all of these parameters.|$|E
50|$|The paralyzed vocal cord may rest {{close to}} or {{far from the}} midline. An {{extremely}} laterally positioned vocal cord {{can result in a}} large posterior glottal gap - an opening between the two vocal cords even when the functioning vocal cord is fully medialized. Vocal cord injection is ineffective for closing a large glottal gap. Arytenoid adduction is more effective than medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> for closing a posterior gap. It has been suggested that this is because arytenoid adduction directly rotates the arytenoid cartilage and thus more actively medializes the posterior aspect of the vocal cord.|$|E
40|$|Voice {{rehabilitation}} after transoral {{laser microsurgery}} to the larynx is challenging. We wait at least 6  months before surgical intervention. Only a few patients after total or extended cordectomy requested voice restoration. Subjective perception of voice using the Voice Handicap Index in medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> was significantly better. Medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> with {{elevation of the}} fibrous tissue from the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage is critical in achieving success.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionType I <b>thyroplasty</b> is the {{treatment}} of choice for unilateral vocal cord palsy with no spontaneous recovery. ObjectivesTo compare the use of silastic implant with titanium vocal fold medializing implant (TVFMI®) in type I <b>thyroplasty</b> for unilateral vocal cord palsy with respect to subjective and objective improvement in voice, endoscopic changes in vocal cords, surgical time, and cost effectiveness. MethodologyThis was a prospective study conducted on 40 patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis who underwent type I <b>thyroplasty</b> with either silastic implant or TVFMI®. Pre-operative and four-week post-operative assessment and statistical comparison were performed by videolaryngoscopy, stroboscopy, perceptual assessment (GRBAS), subjective (voice handicap index) analysis of voice, and computer-assisted acoustic and electroglottographic assessment. The duration of surgery and cost of implant were also recorded. ResultsAlthough both implants showed improvement in quality of voice following <b>thyroplasty,</b> TVFMI® presents slightly better results in objective voice analysis. The surgery time for TVFMI® insertion was shorter, but the costs were higher. ConclusionTVFMI® may be preferred for medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> as it presents better voice results and demands less surgical time; however, it is costlier than silastic implant. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cérvico-Facial.

40|$|Objective: To {{justify the}} {{application}} of medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> in Chinese patients with symptomatic cancer-related unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). Study design and setting: Retrospective chart review from February 2000 to March 2006. Results: Eighty-seven Chinese patients undergoing medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> for UVFP were included; {{there were no significant}} differences between the cancer-related and benign groups in terms of the speech and swallowing rehabilitation outcome and the perioperative complication rate (P > 0. 05). The median survival time of cancer-related UVFP patients from the date of medialization to death was 129 days. Age more than 65 years was identified as the only factor for a shorter survival period after medialization (P = 0. 040). Conclusion: Medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> restores satisfactory speech and swallowing and has a low perioperative complication rate in Chinese patients with cancer-related UVFP. Postmedialization survival period was also reasonable. Significance: Medialization <b>thyroplasty</b> is a justifiable treatment option for cancer-related UVFP. © 2007 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: An {{analysis}} of <b>thyroplasty</b> with Montgomery implant under local anesthesia for unilateral laryngeal nerve paralysis. PATIENTS AND METHOD: An inception cohort of 21 patients was operated {{on with a}} minimum follow-up of 9 months. All patients had severe dysphonia and breathlessness. Seven patients had aspiration with a non efficient cough. RESULTS: The only adverse side effect was a subcutaneous cervical hematoma in one patient. Aspiration disappeared immediately after completion of the <b>thyroplasty.</b> Immediate improvement of speech, cough, and breathlessness was achieved in all patients. Over time, speech and voice remained stable in all patients. Recurrence of aspiration was not encountered. CONCLUSION: Such data supported {{the notion that the}} <b>thyroplasty</b> with Montgomery implant under local anesthesia is an extremely valuable option in patients with unilateral laryngeal nerve paralysis...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} a new porous titanium <b>thyroplasty</b> implant that can be adjusted with a screw. Material and methodsRetrospective study of 15 patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis undergoing type I <b>thyroplasty</b> under local anaesthesia. Each patient's dysphonia and swallowing disorders were evaluated both objectively and subjectively before and 3  months after <b>thyroplasty.</b> ResultsSpeech and swallowing disorders were improved in all the cases, except when the patients were suffering from severe associated neurological disorders (n= 3). The postoperative complications were minor including a laryngeal edema treated by corticotherapy per os (n= 1) and a superficial cervical haematoma (n= 1). ConclusionsThis implant is easy to insert and the results show high tolerance of the biomaterial and above all the improvement of functions comparable to other laryngeal implants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thyroplasty</b> has {{virtually}} replaced Teflon injection as the procedure {{of choice for}} treatment of the unilateral paralyzed vocal cord. Previous {{studies have shown that}} Teflon injection, by stiffening the vocal cord, decreases the extrathoracic airway obstruction occasionally measured by pulmonary function testing in patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis. We became interested in the effect of <b>thyroplasty</b> on extrathoracic airflow. In this prospective study, patients underwent prethyroplasty and postthyroplasty pul-monary function testing. Flow volume loops combined with traditional spirometry were used. Postoperative pulmonary function tests were performed at least 2 months after surgery to allow resolution of surgical edema. Our study results support the previous finding that vocal cord paralysis alone causes some degree of extrathoracic obstruction. However, in contrast to Teflon injection, <b>thyroplasty</b> decreased extrathoracic airflow in all but 1 patient, and by criteria based on the ratio of the midexpiratory flow to the midinspiratory flow, caused new postoperative extrathoracic obstruction in 27 % of patients. Symptomatic evidence of this obstruc-tion may be more evident in those active patients with more ventilatory demand.

40|$|Mutational falsetto {{voice is}} {{considered}} to be a psychogenic disorder associated with the rejection of adulthood. The initial treatment must include speech therapy and psychotherapy. However, delayed treatment and denial of the problem can cause the disorder to become recalcitrant to behavioral treatment. Modified relaxation (type III) <b>thyroplasty</b> was proposed by Isshiki to shorten the vocal folds and release tension by incising and depressing the anterior segment of the thyroid cartilage. This procedure is called relaxation <b>thyroplasty</b> by a medial approach (anterior commissure retrusion) in the European Laryngological Society classification system. It results in a lowering of the vocal pitch. The surgery can be performed under local or general anesthesia. It should only be considered for cases not improved by speech therapy and psychological counseling. Our series included 7 male patients with a mean age of 21 years who underwent modified relaxation <b>thyroplasty</b> after failure of behavioral management. The assessment of outcomes was based on changes in the fundamental frequency of the voice and the Voice Handicap Index. The mean fundamental frequency was lowered from 187 Hz to 104 Hz (p < 0. 001), and the mean Voice Handicap Index was improved from 70 to 21. There were no postoperative complications. The voice results were consistent over a mean follow-up of 17 months.
