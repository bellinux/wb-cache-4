5|$|The EC, {{is located}} in the parahippocampal gyrus, a {{cortical}} region adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus.</b> This gyrus conceals <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus.</b> The parahippocampal gyrus also includes the perirhinal cortex which {{plays an important role in}} the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus.</b> It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> and the parahippocampus are damaged.|$|E
5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E
5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus,</b> it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> and has often been studied in this structure.

40|$|In recent studies, {{inactivation}} of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> before <b>the</b> {{retrieval of}} extinguished fear memories disrupted the context-dependent expression of these memories. In the present experiments, {{we examined the}} role of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> in <b>the</b> acquisition of extinction. After pairing an auditory conditional stimulus (CS) with an aversive footshock [unconditional stimulus (US) ], rats received an extinction session in which the CS was presented without the US. In experiment 1, infusion of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, into <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> before <b>the</b> extinction training session decreased the rate of extinction. Moreover, when later tested for fear to the extinguished CS, all rats that had received hippocampal inactivation before extinction training demonstrated renewed fear regardless of {{the context in which}} testing took place. This suggests a role for <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> in both acquiring the extinction memory and encoding the CS-context relationship that yields the context dependence of extinction. In experiment 2, inactivation of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> before testing also disrupted the context dependence of fear to the extinguished CS. In experiment 3, quantitative autoradiography revealed the boundaries of muscimol diffusion after infusion into <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus.</b> Together, these results reveal that <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> is involved in the acquisition, contextual encoding, and context-dependent retrieval of fear extinction.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hippocampus</b> {{contains}} {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hippocampus</b> {{has been}} seen as central to the {{pathology}} of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{input to}} <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> (from varying {{cortical}} and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Large {{differences}} in spatial impairment are {{found among the}} dorsal and ventral <b>hippocampus.</b> Lesions to <b>the</b> ventral <b>hippocampus</b> {{have no effect on}} spatial memory, while <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> is required for retrieval, processing short-term memory and transferring memory from the short term to longer delay periods. Infusion of amphetamine into <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> has also been shown to enhance memory for spatial locations learned previously. These findings indicate that there is a functional dissociation between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCREB is {{critical}} for long-lasting synaptic and behavioral plasticity in invertebrates. Its role in <b>the</b> mammalian <b>hippocampus</b> is less clear.

The deficit is specific to long-term memory, as shown in an object recognition task. Several forms of late-phase LTP are normal, but forskolin-induced and dopamine-regulated potentiation are disrupted.

25|$|There {{has been}} much debate as to whether hippocampal place cells {{function}} based upon landmarks in the environment or on environmental boundaries or an interaction between the two. There has also been much study as to whether hippocampal pyramidal cells (mostly in rats) signal non-spatial information as well as spatial information. According to the cognitive map theory, <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus's</b> primary role in the rat is to store spatial information through place cells and <b>the</b> rat <b>hippocampus</b> was biologically designed to provide the rat with spatial information.|$|R
5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> proper and its related parts. However, there is no consensus as to what parts are included. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> is said to include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.|$|E
5|$|The term {{limbic system}} was {{introduced}} in 1952 by Paul MacLean to describe the set of structures that line {{the edge of the}} cortex (Latin limbus meaning border): These include <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus,</b> cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala. Paul MacLean later suggested that the limbic structures comprise the neural basis of emotion. <b>The</b> <b>hippocampus</b> is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior—the septum, the hypothalamic mammillary body, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus, and is generally accepted {{to be part of the}} limbic system.|$|E
5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} studies that show the involvement of <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> in conflict tasks.

40|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} and <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> {{have been studied}} {{extensively}} for their significant roles in spatial working memory. A possible time-dependent functional relationship between the prefrontal cortex and <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> in spatial working memory was tested. A combined lesion and pharmacological inactivation technique targeting both <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> and <b>the</b> medial prefrontal cortex was used (i. e., axon-sparing lesions of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> combined with reversible inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex, or vice versa, within a subject). A delayed nonmatching-to-place task on a radial eight-arm maze with short-term (i. e., 10 sec) versus intermediate-term (i. e., 5 min) delays {{was used as a}} behavioral paradigm. Here we report that <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> and <b>the</b> medial prefrontal cortex process short-term spatial memory in parallel, serving as a compensatory mechanism for each other. The role of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus,</b> however, becomes highlighted as the time-window for memory (i. e., delay) shifts from short-term to a delay period (i. e., intermediate-term) exceeding the short-term range.

Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of <b>the</b> <b>hippocampus</b> was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported.

The changes noted have largely been accepted {{to be the result of}} abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E

In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in neuronal proliferation and migration through the RMS.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Unilateral {{blockade}} of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>hippocampus</b> by tetrodo-toxin {{makes it possible}} to form lateralized spatial memories, which rapidly transfer to <b>the</b> naive <b>hippocampus</b> when training continues with intact brain. Unilateral X-ray irradiation of newborn rats causes irreversible destruction of granule cells in the ipsilateral fascia dentata (FD). Possible compensation of poor learning in the lesioned hemisphere by commissural transfer of memories from <b>the</b> intact <b>hippocampus</b> was examined in seven rats with unilateral FD lesion, which were first trained in the Morris water maze to asymptotic performance (mean escape latency 6 6 1 s). Subsequent testing during functional ablation either of the intact or of <b>the</b> lesioned <b>hippocampus</b> by tetrodotoxin revealed escape latencies 35 6 8 s or 8 6 1 s, respectively. Probe trial tests during inactivation of the intact and lesioned hippocampus showed target quadrant preference of 32 6 2 % or 54 63 %, respectively. The results indicate: (a) that one intact hippocam-pus alone can support the water maze task, (b) that no, or only a very weak, memory trace is available in <b>the</b> lesioned <b>hippocampus.</b> It is concluded that the above results are due to the inability of <b>the</b> FD lesioned <b>hippocampus</b> to process <b>the</b> information received from the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex.
