50|$|If the firearm is {{attached}} in a fixed mount and {{aimed at a}} target, the shot grouping measures the firearms mechanical precision and the uniformity of the ammunition. When the firearm also is held by a shooter, the shot grouping partly measures the precision of the firearm and ammunition, and partly the shooter's consistency and skill. Often the shooters' skill {{is the most important}} element towards achieving a <b>tight</b> <b>shot</b> grouping, especially when competitors are using the same match grade firearms and ammunition.|$|E

5000|$|A teaser of {{the music}} video was {{released}} on June 13, 2011. The video was filmed the video in the appropriately sunny Playa Del Rey beachside community of Los Angeles. The production is inspired on the nature scenes, such as flowers, fruits and a bed full of green gram. The video premiered on June 30, 2011. In the video, Colbie appears surrounded by her circle of friends. Next, a green fern gets a 10-second close-up, followed by a <b>tight</b> <b>shot</b> of Colbie's hands planting sheets of grass.

5000|$|That Winter, the Wind Blows, a 2013 {{remake of}} the Japanese {{television}} drama Ai Nante Irane Yo, Natsu ("I Don't Need Love, Summer") in which a con man pretends to be the long-lost brother of a blind heiress, was Kim's third collaboration with Noh and his first time to work for SBS. Kim said, [...] "To help viewers better understand the characters' emotions, I used ultra close-up shots," [...] a visual technique that accentuates even the smallest movement in actors' faces or the twinkle in their eyes. He went on, [...] "The reason {{we are able to}} create beautiful shots is because both Jo In-sung and Song Hye-kyo are beautiful people whether we do a full shot or a <b>tight</b> <b>shot.</b> ... The tone of the drama itself is very heavy that viewers may get frustrated. So I thought the only way to soften up and relax the drama is to capture beautiful scenes. ... I'm just able to film beautiful things as much as I want." [...] He then used post-production editing to bring out the colors and textures he wanted. Kim was praised for the drama's cinematography, and later won Best Television Director at the 49th Baeksang Arts Awards.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, each show {{opened with}} the same 45-second visual. Over a slow four-note-repeat backbeat score, a <b>tight</b> <b>shot</b> of Paladin's chess knight emblem {{centered}} in a black background is seen, before the view widens to show the emblem affixed to Paladin's holster, with Paladin in his trademark costume seen from waist level in profile. Then as he draws his revolver from the holster, the four-note-repeat backbeat fades to a light, almost harp-like strumming. He cocks the hammer, and then rotates the gun to point the barrel at the viewer for 10 seconds, while delivering a line of dialogue from the coming episode, after which the pistol is uncocked and holstered briskly. As the weapon is reholstered and the view tightens to show only the chess knight, again, the four-note-repeat backbeat returns. As only the chess knight emblem in a black background is back, the name [...] "RICHARD BOONE" [...] appears across the screen for about 5 seconds. The name fades out and immediately the words [...] "in HAVE GUN - WILL TRAVEL" [...] fade in, again for about 5 seconds. Boone's name and the show's title {{is accompanied by a}} four-note [...] "stinger" [...] that overshadows the four-note-repeat. The [...] "stinger" [...] is roughly the same as that heard when Paladin's business card is flashed on screen (in almost every episode). The words fade away after those 5 seconds leaving only the chess knight emblem against the black background, and the four-note-repeat fades out. This opening then fades out and the show fades in on its opening scene.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Lotterby {{returned}} to the show {{at the insistence of}} Brian Wilde, who preferred Lotterby's use of <b>tight</b> <b>shots</b> focused on the trio as they talked rather than Bell's wide-angle scenes.

50|$|Automatics {{typically}} have much shorter barrels than pump-action shotguns (especially hunting shotguns). Barrel length contributes to <b>tighter</b> <b>shot</b> spread, so automatics have relatively wide spread.

Long-barreled pump action shotguns are more accurate and have increased range, which is ideal for hunting and sporting purposes.|$|R

There were only 100 of these cars, so it was way too expensive to destroy. We {{had a number of}} replicas made. They were pretty good, but for the <b>tight</b> <b>shots</b> I needed a real one, so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it." ...|$|R

50|$|Putters {{are similar}} to the discs used in simple games of catch, such as the Wham-o brand Frisbee. They are {{designed}} to fly straight, predictably, and very slowly compared to mid-range discs and drivers. They are typically used for <b>tight,</b> controlled <b>shots</b> that are close to the basket, although some players use them for short drives where trees or other obstacles come into play.

500|$|The {{opening scene}} in the subway was {{initially}} {{going to be on}} top of a building so that the episode would begin and end the same, but co-creator J.J. Abrams thought {{it would be better to}} start it underground and [...] "move up throughout the episode". The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many <b>tight</b> <b>shots</b> that were meant to give a [...] "sense of unease". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the [...] "hardest set to shoot at on the planet" [...] because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving back and forth on the 59th Street Bridge.|$|R

40|$|A {{short film}} / music video {{performed}} by the Band Manflu. Treatment/Synopsis: In an old London cinema an array of characters watch the obscure art-film Tek, but as the projector starts malfunctioning images of audience members appear on screen and the audience becomes agitated. Meanwhile, in the squalid back room the projectionist grows increasingly mad and eventually kills himself, and the infuriated ticket girl unleashes havoc on the complacent audience. The film was partly shot in an actual cinema, Rio cinema in Dalston, as well as private owned cinema at NFTS. The cinematography is naturalistic and poetic. Made up of mainly <b>tight</b> <b>shots</b> of isolated characters, the camera will be in fluid motion, semi-handheld following the characters and their interactions. Shot in colour but the film projected in the cinema is black & white, naturalistic lighting and costumes, minimalist set up with few characters. Visual and music are juxtaposing between the slow, paced editing and fast, hypnotic music. Shots of the screen when the audience members see themselves were done in post-production, as were gun firing visuals. The special effects – blood – are subtle and realistic. Costume is naturalistic and modern {{with a range of}} smart and casual clothing. Music is a ten minute one chord hypnotic modern psychedelic with the dynamic changing with the intensity of the drum beat. Acting is naturalistic but when dialogue is spoken their gestures and facial expressions are slightly exaggerated. No speaking sound will be heard in final film...|$|R
5000|$|For the filmed inserts in The Wheel in Space, Martin Baugh {{supervised}} {{the creation of}} the costumes, made from a thinner one-piece material. Junction boxes, linked by steel rods, were used at the joints and near the neck to give the impression of something more technological and functional than was seen in The Moonbase and The Tomb of the Cybermen. The same chest units from before were used, with the lamp {{at the bottom of the}} unit. New helmets were cast with simpler handles that extended out further from the head. These introduced a [...] "teardrop" [...] shape to the Cybermen's eyes. An unmodified Tomb of the Cybermen suit was also used to swell the Cybermen's numbers during the spacewalk scene, and was positioned at the back to hide the difference from the other two costumes. Mid-production, the suits were redesigned again for the more extensive recordings of The Wheel in Space in the studio. Baugh's solution was to spray-paint two padded wet suits to make them look bulkier, with the helmets, junction boxes and rods from the filmed inserts modified or removed to make the actors move more freely. The hands from the earlier Wheel in Space costumes were cut off and used as gloves for the new costumes. The chest units were turned upside down so the lamps, mounted beneath the Cybermen's chins, could be fired as a weapon in a <b>tighter</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|R
