But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while ago." [...] This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred to him as a man who [...] "helped educate a whole generation of Americans". Perhaps seen in light of Tunis' distrust of professional athletics, it can be understood. Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored, there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally.|$|E

[...] As the song progresses, she also wonders: [...] "What about my body, body?/You don’t want my body, body."

Elysa Gardner of USA Today commented that the lyrics of the song include raw feelings for an unfaithful lover which are sung with [...] "sass".|$|E

In some scenes of the music video, Spears wore a purple satin dress from American designer Marina Toybina. Spears reportedly arrived twelve hours late to the set, after spending the day with her sons Sean Preston and Jayden James. Isham talked about the situation, saying, [...] "She was late. People made a big thing about it, [...] how could she not be late, when you have 50, 65, 75 people running down the street chasing her car? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> day for the crew.

In 1490, Johannes Trithemius preferred the older methods, because [...] "handwriting placed on parchment {{will be able to}} endure a thousand years.
