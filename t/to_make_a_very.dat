5|$|Although a ferry {{had almost}} {{certainly}} {{existed at the}} site of the present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small skiff for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts; the Twickenham Ferry, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore-line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge.|$|E

25|$|Local {{oscillators}} typically {{generate a}} single frequency signal that has negligible amplitude modulation but some random phase modulation. Either of these impurities spreads {{some of the}} signal's energy into sideband frequencies. That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response, which would defeat the aim <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> narrow bandwidth receiver such as to receive low-rate digital signals. Care {{needs to be taken}} to minimize oscillator phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear mode.|$|E

A Nightmare on Elm Street was met with rave critical reviews and went on <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{significant impact on the}} horror genre, spawning a franchise consisting of a line of sequels, a television series, a crossover with Friday the 13th, beyond various other works of imitation; a remake of the same name was released in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Inserts: Table saws have a {{changeable}} insert in {{the table}} through which the blade projects. Purchasable inserts are usually made out of metal. Zero-Clearance inserts can be made of a sawable material such as plastic or wood. When a Zero-Clearance insert is initially inserted, the blade is raised through the insert creating the slot. This creates a slot with no gaps around the blade. The zero clearance insert helps prevent tearout by providing support for wood fibers {{right next to the}} blade thus helping <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clean cut. Other inserts can be bought or created in the same manner, such as a dado insert.|$|E

Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 {{when he reached the}} top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to grab it before it hit the ground.

Irish stated that developing the music {{was one of the}} hardest aspects of Exile: [...] "We had to match or exceed the surrealistic style of music that Robyn [...] had pioneered. It had to be recognizable as Myst, but unique and distinctive." [...] Wall looked at the increasing complexity of games as an opportunity to give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score. Wall also echoed Irish's opinion that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different score from the [...] "wonderful sonic pastiche" [...] of Myst and Riven, yet still recognizable as a sequel to the earlier games; Wall considered copying Miller's style as the [...] "safe" [...] yet unappealing route that was expected of him.|$|E

500|$|First {{hinted at}} in early December 1999, Devil May Cry {{started out as}} the {{earliest}} incarnation of Resident Evil 4. Initially developed for the PlayStation 2, the game was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him {{to create a new}} entry in the Resident Evil series. Around the turn of the millennium, regular series writer Noboru Sugimura created a scenario for the title, based on Kamiya's idea <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> cool and stylized action game. The story was based on unraveling the mystery surrounding the body of protagonist Tony, an invincible man with skills and an intellect exceeding that of normal people, his superhuman abilities explained with biotechnology. As Kamiya felt the playable character did not look brave and heroic enough in battles from a fixed angle, he decided to drop the prerendered backgrounds from previous Resident Evil installments and instead opted for a dynamic camera system. This new direction required the team to make a trip to Europe where they spent eleven days in the United Kingdom and Spain photographing things like Gothic statues, bricks, and stone pavements for use in textures. Though the developers tried to make the [...] "coolness" [...] theme fit into the world of Resident Evil, Mikami felt it strayed too far from the series' survival horror roots and gradually convinced all of the staff members to make the game independent from it. Kamiya eventually rewrote the story to be set in a world full of demons and changed the hero's name to [...] "Dante". The cast of characters remained largely identical to that in Sugimura's scenario, although appearances of the hero's mother and father were written out of the story. The game's new title was revealed as Devil May Cry in November 2000. Hideki Kamiya, director of the hit video game, Devil May Cry in 2005 revealed that he chose John Taylor from the very popular English rock band, Duran Duran as the model for the game's main character, Dante. He modeled the character's looks, style, charisma and attitude after John Taylor's.|$|E

50|$|To {{obtain an}} IR {{spectrum}} of a solid, a sample {{is combined with}} Nujol in {{a mortar and pestle}} or some other device <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> mull (<b>a</b> <b>very</b> thick suspension), and is usually sandwiched between potassium- or sodium chloride plates before being placed in the spectrometer. For very reactive samples, the layer of Nujol can provide a protective coating, preventing sample decomposition during acquisition of the IR spectrum. When preparing the sample {{it is important to keep}} the sample from being saturated with Nujol, this will result in erroneous spectra since the Nujol peaks will dominate, silencing the actual sample's peaks.|$|R

2500|$|Drexler and {{coworkers}} responded {{to these two}} issues in a 2001 publication. [...] Drexler and colleagues noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in Nanosystems. [...] Drexler maintained that both were straw man arguments, {{and in the case}} of enzymes, Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, [...] "...using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles..." [...] Drexler also addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be. [...] Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, Chemical & Engineering News carried a 4-part debate.|$|E
2500|$|A {{winemaking}} {{technique called}} [...] "reducing" [...] or [...] "technology" [...] has been developed. Very fashionable in Australia and New Zealand, this technique seeks highly aromatic white wines {{and is very}} interesting on aromatic varieties such as Sauvignon B, Colombard B, and Riesling B, although less so for varieties such as Chardonnay B. It works by limiting Premature oxidation in the must or the wine at all stages of development. The use of inert gases such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2) isolates the grapes from oxygen from the air and cold partially inhibits the action of oxidative enzymes in the must. Tyrosinase, a natural enzyme in the grape, and laccase, an enzyme coming from the gray mold are very active in oxidation. Laccase can be eliminated by sorting the grapes. Strong limitation {{on the amount of}} polyphenols in the wine by reducing the time between harvest and pressing is another technique that aims <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> light wine, protected from yellowing.|$|E
2500|$|The Nottinghamshire Guardian {{suggested}} Small Heath would [...] "have {{to greatly}} improve their present team {{if they are}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> prominent display even in [...] division next season."

Wheldon scored 116 goals from 175 matches in league and FA Cup for Small Heath, and the only match he missed in six seasons was when his sister died {{on the morning of}} the game. He joined League champions Aston Villa for a fee which, after much speculation, was confirmed at Small Heath's Annual General Meeting as £350 guaranteed, plus the proceeds of a match to be played between the two clubs.
