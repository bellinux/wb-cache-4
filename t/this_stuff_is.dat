500|$|Knight and his wife, {{many years}} later, {{are taking their}} granddaughter Rhoda to the American Museum of Natural History. Knight, {{well-known}} to the staff, is visiting the closed-off areas {{to have a look}} at the new mammoth specimens: the girl, however, is eager to see more of her grandfather's paintings. During this, the staff are finally getting round to sorting out Marsh's long-neglected collection of fossils. Two of the workers discover Knight's Leaping Laelaps has been accidentally left in the storeroom yesterday. The painting is taken back downstairs while the workmen unknowingly leave Cope's skeleton and Marsh's parts behind: [...] "The rest of <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> stayin' put for who knows how long, but we don't want that to get buried." ...|$|E
500|$|Concept artist Tully Summers {{commented on}} Nolan's style of {{cinematography}} {{when asked about}} the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: [...] "The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One {{of the things that makes}} his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. <b>This</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> made to work, not impress shoppers. The Dark Knight Rises is a war film." [...] Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that [...] "it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} soundtrack {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that [...] "some of <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> quite good". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{provided}} a mixed review, writing that the soundtrack [...] "seems to indicate her efforts are coming from a similarly era-straddling psychological place". Jim Farber from New York Daily News criticized Aguilera for her [...] "vocals offer the same distracting loop-de-loops and showy tics", but complimented Cher that she [...] "balances both aspects ideally". A reviewer from Blogcritics labelled the album a [...] "grab bag of tracks that don't really add up to cohesive album". Leah Greanblatt from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] score, naming it a [...] "shamelessly diva-fied mix of balladry, Broadway cabaret, and backroom boogie-woogie" [...] and complimented on its musical departure from Aguilera's previous studio album Bionic. In a positive review, Billboard editor Kerri Mason praised Burlesque as [...] "a campy celebration of diva-dom and an over-the-top, triple-threat performance". James Wigney of The Advertiser praised Aguilera's [...] "vocal gymnastics", but was mixed towards Cher's numbers on the soundtrack. Maura Johnston from The Village Voice named [...] "The Beautiful People (from Burlesque)" [...] as the thirteenth worst song of 2010, calling it [...] "an interesting failure." ...|$|E

500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's trying hard to keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's full up like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kath {{reportedly}} had a self-admitted {{history of}} drug abuse, including alcohol. Seraphine knew that Kath {{had a high}} tolerance for drugs, but later recalled Kath telling him, [...] "I'm going to get things under control... if I don't, <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> going to kill me." [...] Chicago bandmates have indicated that he was also increasingly unhappy. However, Guercio has said that Kath {{was working on a}} solo album before he died, and Pankow adamantly denies that Kath was suicidal.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{scientists}} have expressed similar sentiments. [...] Richard Dawkins, {{in a review}} of this book, said regarding the discussion of Lacan: [...] "We do not need the mathematical expertise of Sokal and Bricmont to assure us that the author of <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> a fake. Perhaps he is genuine when he speaks of non-scientific subjects? But a philosopher who is caught equating the erectile organ to the square root of minus one has, for my money, blown his credentials when it comes to things that I don't know anything about." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{movie was}} remastered from the {{original}} 16mm film negative by Apple Corps in 1992, {{with a few of}} those scenes used in The Beatles Anthology documentary. After additional remastering, a DVD release was planned to accompany the 2003 release of Let It Be... Naked, including a second DVD of bonus material, but it never materialised. In February 2007, Apple Corps' Neil Aspinall said, [...] "The film was so controversial when it first came out. When we got halfway through restoring it, we looked at the outtakes and realised: <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> still controversial. It raised a lot of old issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|My only clue – {{and here}} I'm {{cheating}} massively – is that I saw them in concert a month ago, and these songs were invariably accompanied by hazy images of children, of childhood ... {{but even if}} <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> {{about the end of}} childhood or innocence or any of those trotted-out tropes, I wouldn't know, and it probably tells you more about me than the opening section of this record.A book on the album was released in the 33⅓ series on 28 August 2014. The series are short books inspired by or focused on albums and are generally written as longform essays. The book, written by composer Ethan Hayden, was cited by Pitchfork as one of the [...] "33 Best 33⅓ Books." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How anybody {{of common}} sense can take any {{interest}} in <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> beyond my comprehension," [...] said Mr. Tolman, as he closed the book {{and put it on}} a little shelf behind the counter.|$|E

50|$|On first {{examination}} {{there appeared}} {{to be some kind of}} stuffing extruding between the lid and the bottom of the youth coffin labeled 'G'. When the coffin <b>was</b> opened <b>this</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>was</b> revealed to be five pillows. As textile remnants from ancient Egypt are relatively rare, and pillows extremely so, the materials used for these will be of great interest. On May 26, 2006, a 42 cm. pink gold leaf anthropoid coffinette was discovered inside the youth coffin, under the pillows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing; {{and even}} that won't really satisfy me. <b>This</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> good enough, when rolled up, for cigars, and it does well enough in hookahs; but I would give all this pound {{for a couple of}} pipes of pigtail, which is the tobacco we smoked at sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Leland, drily, [...] "I almost {{think it}} is. A {{good deal of}} <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> tinder-dry, and you can't plough through the bluff.

6000|$|... "On {{that point}} at least, my dear mademoiselle, {{there can be}} no mistake. And yet cousin Jack insists that <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> will <b>be</b> given to his readers, as views of Europe worthy of their attention." ...|$|R
50|$|Stuff {{appears in}} the 1947 15-chapter serial The Vigilante: Fighting Hero of the Old West. He is played by George Offerman, Jr. In <b>this</b> appearance, <b>Stuff</b> <b>is</b> a thirty-something Caucasian, rather than an Asian teenager.|$|R
5000|$|Can I {{clear the}} air on that? They {{producers}} just caught me on a bad day. It was a bad moment—I {{was going through a}} divorce, my mom had just passed away, all <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> going on—and they sit me down in a chair and wanna start grilling me with questions, and I didn't wanna be there, so ... You know, push that interview to the side, I'm happy as a clam to have written a song that is still being played and still dug by so many people. It's hard enough to write a song, let alone one that sticks around.|$|R
6000|$|... "Joan, you've got to {{take long}} rides with me. At night sometimes. Wild rides to elude pursuers sometimes. You'll go into camps with me. You'll have to wear strong, easy, free clothes. You'll have to be masked. Here the outfit is--as if made for you. Why, you're dead lucky. For <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> good and strong. It'll stand the wear, yet it's fit for a girl.... You put the outfit on, right now." ...|$|E
6000|$|She shrugged her shoulders. [...] "Yes, as I {{have heard}} that some people count wealth. These are the offerings brought to our gods from the beginning; also all the gold found in the {{mountains}} belongs to the gods, and there is much of it there. The gift I sent to you was taken from this heap, but in truth it is but a poor gift, seeing that although <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> bright and serves for cups and other things, it has no use at all and is only offered to the gods because {{it is harder to}} come by than other metals. Look, these are prettier than the gold," [...] and from a stone table she picked up at hazard a long necklace of large, uncut stones, red and white in colour and set alternatively, that Alan judged to be crystals and spinels.|$|E
60|$|July 14: Quebec. Lost race Toronto to Quebec. Had {{fair chance}} to win but motor kept misfiring, couldn't seem to get plugs that would work, and smashed hell out of {{elevator}} coming down on tail when landing here. Glad Hank Odell won, since I lost. Hank has designed new rocker-arm for Severn motor valves. All of us invited to usual big dinner, never did see so many uniforms, also members of Canadian parliament. I don't like to lose a race, but thunder it doesn't bother me long. Good filet of sole at dinner. Sat near a young lieutenant, leftenant I suppose it is, who {{made me think of}} Forrest Haviland. I miss Forrest a lot. He's doing some good flying for the army, flying Curtiss hydro now, and trying out muffler for military scouting. What I like as much as anything about him is his ease, I hope I'm learning a little of it anyway. <b>This</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> all confused but must hustle off to reception at summer school of Royal College for Females. Must send all this to old Forrest to read some day--if you ever see this, Forrest, hello, dear old man, I thought about you when I flew over military post.|$|E

5000|$|The band's 2004 album, The Luddite Spy was {{reviewed}} by the Boston rock magazine The Noise: [...] "The Luddite Spy achieves what few bands {{are able to do}} successfully; the skillful use of music, lyrics, and the nuances of the vocals and instrumentation work comprehensively to convey specific thoughts or feelings. <b>This</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> unexpectedly addictive." ...|$|E
