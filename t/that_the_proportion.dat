She noted that in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% {{of the adult population}} under 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion}} of barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E

5|$|As regards numbers, the mid-2nd-century army {{contained}} c. 80,000 cavalry out of c. 385,000 total effectives i.e. cavalry constituted c. 21% of {{the total}} forces. For the late army, about {{one third of the}} army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units. For example, in the comitatus, cavalry vexillationes were probably half the size of infantry legiones. Overall, the available evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of cavalry was much the same as in the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men contained 8,000 cavalry (21%). In 357, the comitatus of Gaul, 13–15,000 strong, contained an estimated 3,000 cavalry (20–23%).|$|E
5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of minority MPs per GRC has decreased {{with the advent of}} five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce fell steadily, the mining boom {{of the first half}} of the 19thcentury took the total number to between 4,000 and 14,400 by the 1840s. The 1841 Census (the first full census of England) shows 3,250 women working in the mines, but the mine returns of the same year show over 5,000 women in the tin, lead and copper mines of Cornwall and West Devon. Increased mechanisation of the ore dressing process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to the harsh working conditions of the mines meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of bal maidens in the workforce continued to fall, and it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20% of mine workers were female. By the 1861 census, coinciding with the peak of the Cornish mining industry, a minimum of 6,000 women were working in mining in Cornwall, at least 2,500 of whom worked within a five-mile radius of Camborne. Although employed primarily in copper and tin mines, bal maidens also worked in lead, zinc, manganese, iron, antimony, wolfram, and uranium mines, and in slate and china clay quarries.|$|E

5|$|Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: uranium–thorium dating, {{involving}} {{the decay of}} 234U to 230Th, and ionium–thorium dating, which measures the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. (The name ionium for 230Th is a remnant from a period when different isotopes were not recognised {{to be the same}} element and were given different names.) These rely on the fact that 232Th is a primordial radioisotope, but 230Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238U. Uranium–thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234U and 230Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process {{involving the}} alpha decay of 235U into 231Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium–thorium dating. Uranium–thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral, because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ionium–thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both 232Th and 230Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. Both of these dating methods assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> of 230Th to 232Th is a constant during the period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer.|$|E
