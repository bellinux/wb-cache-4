5|$|The clash {{began after}} rebel Serbs seized the town's {{police station and}} {{municipal}} building and harassed Croatian government officials. The Croatian government carried out a counterstrike against the rebels, sending Interior Ministry special police to re-establish control. Fighting broke out between the two sides. Despite an attempted intervention by the Yugoslav National Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA), the Croatian government reasserted its control over the town. After a standoff with the JNA, an agreement <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> special police and the JNA was reached, restoring the town to conditions before the Serb attempt to seize control of the police there.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|February {{began with}} another SEC match-up, this time against unranked Alabama. Starter Kyra Elzy tore her ACL {{during the game}} ending her season, during this game, while going up for a rebound. Meanwhile, Alabama was keeping close to the Lady Vols, by slowing the game down. At half time, Tennessee only had a 13-point lead. The team never did shake off the Crimson Tide, but did manage <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> win, 73–66. A trip to Ole Miss was next, and the team started off much better, score the first ten points {{of the game and}} having a 54–17 lead at halftime. Summitt let the bench play the rest of the game, {{ultimately}} winning 91–45. This game was followed up by a non-conference match against longtime rival Old Dominion, whom Tennessee had beaten in the previous year's national championship. The game was even for fifteen minutes, but in the last five minutes of the half, Tennessee was able to build a twelve-point lead. Holdsclaw took over the second half for the Lady Vols, scoring 24 points for an 85–61 victory, ODU's biggest loss in four years. This match was followed up with another conference game, this time against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. UT started out sloppily, and ended the half with only a nine-point lead. However, once again the team came out strong to open the second half, raising their lead and eventually had double State's points, with ten minutes remaining. The Bulldogs cut the lead to eleven, but then Summitt put Holdsclaw back in, scoring eight in a row, giving Tennessee another victory, 74–52.|$|E

25|$|First to {{the scene}} were 116 cadets under the {{direction}} of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from USS Nantucket, a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (which is now the Massachusetts Maritime Academy), that was docked nearby at the playground pier. They ran several blocks toward the accident. They worked to keep the curious from {{getting in the way of}} the rescuers, while others entered into the knee-deep, sticky mess <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> survivors. Soon, the Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and other Navy personnel arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross dove into the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and keeping the exhausted workers fed. Many of these people worked through the night. The injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims. Four days elapsed before they stopped searching for victims; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses, they were hard to recognize.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers began a roadtrip at PNC Park on June 14 but the woes {{continued}} as Jeff Locke tossed seven shutout innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates won 3-0.

This time the Dodgers managed <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> win 5-3 in 11 innings. A three-run home run by Pedro Álvarez off Greinke {{was the key}} to the Pirates' 6-3 win in the series finale. The Dodgers were scheduled to begin a two-game series against the New York Yankees on June 18, but a rain out forced the two teams to play a day-night doubleheader on June 19. Hanley Ramírez had four hits, including a two-run homer in the first game, but the Dodgers committed four errors in the game and lost 6-4. Chris Capuano came off the disabled list to pitch six shutout innings and Puig hit a home run to lead the Dodgers to a split of the doubleheader with a 6-0 win. Puig had 27 hits in his first 15 games, second most all-time. After the game, they took a cross-country plane ride and opened a series against the Padres in San Diego. They lost 6-3 as the Padres defenders made several highlight reel plays and Pedro Ciriaco had an RBI triple and a two-run home run in the game. The Dodgers committed two more errors the next day, tying the Houston Astros for the league lead. They lost 5-2. Zack Greinke had his best start as a Dodger on June 22, holding the Padres to one run and four hits, while striking out eight in eight innings.

500|$|So Mondino came up {{with the}} concept of boxes and had Madonna and the dancers perform choreography inside it. The {{director}} was satisfied since the small space of the boxes meant there was not much movement, and he could create the desired graphic S imagery and choreography. According to Dustin Robertson, editor of the video, Mondino and Madonna both had opposite work ethics. While Mondino was [...] "cool and laid-back", Madonna was a [...] "stickler for details" [...] and the former had [...] "a wonderful way of handling her, while she demanded a strong handler <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best she's got to give".|$|E

However, Warner initially {{did not want the}} song to be released as a single, since the release of Vision Quest coincided with the release of Madonna's second studio album Like a Virgin and releasing [...] "Crazy for You" [...] would have distracted attention from the album. Warner Bros. Records chief Mo Ostin went to Robert A. Daly, chairman of Warner, and requested him <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Madonna tracks from the Vision Quest soundtrack. Daly summoned Peters and Guber to his office and informed them that they had to let-go of the Madonna tracks. Peters protested and shouted at Daly, resulting him escaping in fright and Warner allowing [...] "Crazy for You" [...] to be released as a single.|$|E

Detroit was {{expected}} to win the series, and took a commanding two games to none lead with two wins at the Palace of Auburn Hills. James and the Cavaliers would not be intimidated however, and won their two games at home to tie the series 2–2. Coming into game 5, both teams were confident, but the Pistons were expected <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> win easily. The game was low scoring throughout as usual in this series, with Cleveland holding a 68 to 66 lead throughout 3 quarters. With the game tied at 84 with 26 seconds left in regulation, Drew Gooden came through and hit a layup to give Cleveland the lead that they would never squander. James led the Cavs with 32 and this brought the series to Cleveland up 3–2, quite shockingly. Detroit held on to a 2-point win to win game 6, and won game 7 at home to seal the deal, but this was the coming out party for the Cavaliers in the playoffs, scaring the 2004 champs.|$|E
