Sometimes it's like seeing {{exactly what was going}} <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> when I first had that spark in my head as a kid. Jon Favreau's {{bringing}} his own talent and vision with the adaptation, {{but at the same time}} it remains true to what I was really trying to get at in the original story." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{appointment}} in 1835 as principal {{conductor of the}} Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Mendelssohn named his childhood friend Ferdinand David as the orchestra's concertmaster. The work's origins derive from this professional collaboration. In a letter dated 30 July 1838, Mendelssohn wrote to David: [...] "I should like to write a violin concerto for you next winter. One in E minor runs <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> the beginning of which gives me no peace." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E

60|$|It went <b>through</b> <b>my</b> country <b>head</b> {{she might}} be {{wondering}} at my new clothes; with that I blushed to my hair, and {{at the sight of}} my colouring it is to be supposed she drew her own conclusions, for she moved her gillies farther down the close, and they fell again to this dispute where I could hear no more of it.|$|R

An arrow went <b>through</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>head,</b> and she died. I was entangled in the blanket on her shoulders, and {{was taken by the}} pursuers. A priest begged me from the Provost's archers, and trained me up in Frankish learning for two or three years." ...|$|R
2500|$|Since May 2005 Forster {{has had a}} {{parallel}} career as a music critic, he began writing for the Australian magazine, The Monthly and its sister publication The Saturday Paper in 2014. Previously he had virtually no print experience, with only a column on hair care for a fanzine in the 1980s to his credit. He was asked by then-editor of The Monthly, Christian Ryan, to write a regular column. Forster later recalled [...] "usic journalism was something that always interested me but only as a reader. I thought about music and I would almost run ideas <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> when I listened to a record or saw a concert, but I never put any of thoughts to paper". On 25 October 2006 Forster won the Pascall Prize for Critical Writing for his columns. In 2009 he collated some of his critiques, written from 2005 to 2009, on international artists The Rolling Stones, Nana Mouskouri, Neil Diamond and Cat Power as well as Australian acts Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Mark Seymour and Paul Kelly. It was published as The 10 Rules of Rock and Roll: Collected Music Writings 2005–09 on Black Inc books.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Do {{you call}} THAT a whisper?' cried the poor King, {{jumping up and}} shaking himself. 'If you {{do such a thing}} again, I'll have you buttered! It went through and <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> like an earthquake!' ...|$|E
60|$|As Caddy gave me {{a glance}} of entreaty, and as Mrs. Jellyby was looking far away into Africa {{straight}} <b>through</b> <b>my</b> bonnet and <b>head,</b> I thought it {{a good opportunity to}} come to the subject of my visit and to attract Mrs. Jellyby's attention.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} {{was the first of}} March, and when I awoke, rose, and opened my curtain, I saw the risen sun {{struggling}} <b>through</b> fog. Above <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> above the house-tops, co-elevate almost with the clouds, I saw a solemn, orbed mass, dark blue and dim--THE DOME. While I looked, my inner self moved; my spirit shook its always-fettered wings half loose; I had a sudden feeling as if I, who never yet truly lived, were at last about to taste life. In that morning my soul grew as fast as Jonah's gourd.|$|R
6000|$|What evenings, {{when the}} candles came, and I was {{expected}} to employ myself, but, not daring to read an entertaining book, pored over some hard-headed, harder-hearted treatise on arithmetic; when the tables of weights and measures set themselves to tunes, as 'Rule Britannia', or 'Away with Melancholy'; when they wouldn't stand still to be learnt, but would go threading <b>my</b> grandmother's needle <b>through</b> <b>my</b> unfortunate <b>head,</b> in at one ear and out at the other! What yawns and dozes I lapsed into, {{in spite of all}} my care; what starts I came out of concealed sleeps with; what answers I never got, to little observations that I rarely made; what a blank space I seemed, which everybody overlooked, and yet was in everybody's way; what a heavy relief it was to hear Miss Murdstone hail the first stroke of nine at night, and order me to bed! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you there. I know I should drown myself or put a bullet <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> if I could not show {{ordinary}} courage {{with a lot of}} ladies going on working quietly round me." ...|$|E
60|$|I am reverent by nature; {{and when}} such {{thoughts}} swept <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{they made me}} cold with fear, {{and if there was}} a storm and thunder at the time, I was so ill that I could but with difficulty abide at my post and do my work.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't get it <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> yet, Barbara," [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "why {{in the world}} you broke with Billy Mallory. He's one of the finest young men in New York City today--just my ideal of the sort of man I'd like my only {{daughter}} to marry." ...|$|E
60|$|As for me, {{the strangest}} {{sensation}} that I have ever experienced claimed me for an instant. A peculiar, tingling thrill ran <b>through</b> <b>my</b> veins, and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> swam. I could {{not account for}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I am hurt gravely enough, {{though not}} {{so as to}} imperil my life. I have a wound {{on the side of}} <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and the same blow, as the doctor says, cleft <b>through</b> <b>my</b> shoulder-bone." ...|$|R
6000|$|Howkan smirked with self-appreciation. His {{hair was}} parted in the middle. [...] "Nay, {{from the paper}} it comes, O Imber. Never have my ears heard.

60|$|Then it {{occurred}} to me that none of these salvation-notions that were whirl-winding <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> could be examined or made available unless at least a month's time could be secured. So I cabled you, and said to myself that I would take the French steamer tomorrow (which will be Sunday).|$|E
6000|$|I'll tell thee ev'rything I can; [...] There's {{little to}} relate. [...] I saw an aged, aged man, [...] A-sitting on a gate. [...] "Who are you, aged man?" [...] I said. [...] "And {{how is it}} you live?" [...] And his answer trickled <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> [...] Like water through a sieve.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The body hasn't been found; but I {{heard the}} manager of the Davis Boat Company's exhibit say that he should keep men at the work of draggin' the creek till the work was finished. I can't get <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> how he {{happened}} to capsize the craft, for she didn't seem to be cranky." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is better," [...] he murmured. [...] "I {{can feel}} it going <b>through</b> <b>my</b> veins. I shall be able to wield an axe yet again. This comes of {{fighting}} with a weapon you don't know. The shaft broke as I was guarding <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and I don't remember anything after." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{eyes seemed}} to be {{bursting}} from <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>through</b> <b>my</b> closed lids I could see the fierce light. We were nearly opposite now; it roared like all the fires of hell, and the water boiled furiously around it. Five seconds more. We were past; I heard the roar behind me.|$|R
6000|$|And oh--ho-o! how {{my spirit}} seemed to gush out <b>through</b> <b>my</b> mouth and nose, or {{out at the}} top of <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> when the cold water encircled my neck as I lost my footing altogether, and struck out with my right hand, endeavouring the while to support my rod in the left! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't {{so certain}} 'bout that. The biggest {{part of it}} is gettin' 'em, an' if they're willin' to put up I'd say let 'em buy anythin' they wanted. Look here, I can't quite get it <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> that things is the way you tell, 'cause it don't seem likely a boy could get in at headquarters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only in my calf. Luckily {{this gentleman}} who is {{carrying}} me stumbled {{just as he}} fired, and I got the ball there instead of <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It serves me right for not having thought before {{that some of them}} might cross somewhere else and take us in rear. Well, it can't be helped; {{it might have been a}} good deal worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|Finally, {{after much}} questioning, I got the thing <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It {{appears that the}} line of descent is through the women. A man is merely head of his wife's family--that is all. If she chances to be the oldest female member of the [...] "royal" [...] house, he is king. Very naively the girl {{explained}} that there was seldom any doubt as to whom a child's mother was.|$|E
40|$|An email comes <b>through</b> from <b>my</b> <b>Head</b> of Department: "Simon, are {{you getting}} {{involved}} in the Exploring Our Ocean MOOC this year? You don't want to miss out!" I {{try to figure out}} whether this is a typo and also what it is that I don't want to miss out on. Has her cap-lock key got stuck? What letters are close to M, O, and C that she actually meant to type? Another email grabs my attention, and I decide I have too much to do to worry about decoding an email, which is either mistyped or in a hitherto unseen language. A week later as I walk down the corridor, there it is again. A bright and engaging poster with images of the deep ocean proclaims: "The University of Southampton MOOC on Exploring Our Ocean goes live in October 2014, register today—don't miss out!" As I study the poster, a passing student asks if I am starring in the MOOC this time around—he was surprised I wasn't involved in last year's. Last year's? I suddenly feel like someone who fell asleep in the 1980 s comfortable with the fax, VHS tapes, and a mobile phone that occasionally made phone calls, and woke up 20 years later to discover emails, online movies, and the iPhone...|$|R

6000|$|All winter <b>through</b> I bow <b>my</b> <b>head</b> [...] Beneath {{the driving}} rain; The North Wind powders me with snow [...] And blows me back again; At midnight 'neath {{a maze of}} stars [...] I flame with {{glittering}} rime, And stand, above the stubble, stiff [...] As mail at morning-prime.

6000|$|... "Splendid," [...] I said, {{forgetting the}} storm. We took our seats {{in an empty}} compartment. Was she glad to see me? She had {{come all the way}} from Paris to meet me!

6000|$|... "Well, when I catched that {{glimpse of}} that boot heel, {{the idea that}} went smashing <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> was, I know where he's hid the di'monds! You look at this boot heel, now. See, it's {{bottomed}} with a steel plate, and the plate is fastened on with little screws. Now there wasn't a screw about that feller anywhere but in his boot heels; so, if he needed a screwdriver, I reckoned I knowed why." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There wasn't any process. A thought {{like this}} {{happened}} to slip <b>through</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> by accident: How much would make you or me comfortable? A hundred thousand. Yet you are expecting two or three of--these inventions of yours to turn out some billions of money--and you are wanting them to do that. If you wanted ten millions, I could understand that--it's inside the human limits. But billions! That's clear outside the limits. There must be a definite project back of that somewhere." ...|$|E
50|$|With my growing {{knowledge}} of the language America itself grew before my vision, etched itself out more clearly, and captivated my soul more enduringly.

I longed, like a youth in love, to lay <b>my</b> <b>head</b> on the breast of America.|$|R
50|$|The piano concerto is {{dedicated}} to Friedrich Kalkbrenner. While writing it, Chopin wrote to Tytus Woyciechowski, saying, “Here you doubtless observe my tendency to do wrong against my will.

40|$|I {{pulled my}} left arm from beneath the warm pile of {{blankets}} and coverlets. With small forefinger I touched the crystalline sheet of ice that covered the small window above my bed.
