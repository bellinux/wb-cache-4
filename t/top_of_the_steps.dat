5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{construction}} workers and counter-protesters moved across City Hall Park toward city hall. They mounted the steps, planted their flags at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> then attempted to gain entrance. Police on duty at city hall initially barred them, but soon the mob pushed past. A few workers entered the building. A postal worker rushed onto the roof of city hall and raised the U.S. flag there to full mast. When city workers lowered the flag back down to half-mast, {{a large number of}} construction workers stormed past the police. Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio, fearing the building would be overrun by the mob, ordered city workers to raise the flag back to full mast.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted to}} have a gathering place outside of home and work where the characters could meet. After a trip to Seattle, and seeing the many burgeoning coffee shops, the production designer suggested to producers that they use a coffee shop. Unlike many of the relatively modern coffee shop designs prevalent in Seattle, the production designer opted for a more warm and inviting style which would appear more established and traditional. Stools were specifically omitted to avoid any similarity to the bar on Cheers. Several Los Angeles coffee shops were used for reference. A bookcase was added on the back wall, suggesting patrons could grab a book and read while they enjoyed their coffee. The show used three versions of the interior set depending on how much space other sets for each episode required. If there was not space for the full set, a smaller version that omitted the tables closest to the audience could be used. If there wasn't space for that set, a small back section {{of the back of the}} cafe at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> could be set up under the audience bleachers. A set was also used on occasion for the exterior patio.|$|E

500|$|The {{other boys}} carry out equally barbaric acts: {{the two boys}} at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; {{the boys in the}} {{foreground}} are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat; and {{in the rear of the}} picture another cat tied to two [...] is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.|$|E

Kinderman. They talk briefly about Regan and the events that just took place there; Kinderman then invites Dyer to the movies to see Wuthering Heights and quotes Casablanca, telling Dyer [...] "I {{think this is the}} beginning of a beautiful friendship".|$|E
40|$|Ethyl iodide {{decomposition}} on the Cu(1 1 1) and Cu(2 2 1) surfaces {{has been}} studied using thermal desorption spectroscopy and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. On both surfaces ethyl iodide decomposes to produce ethyl groups and adsorbed iodine atoms. The ethyl groups decompose by β-hydride elimination to desorb as ethylene leaving adsorbed iodine atoms. <b>The</b> kinetics <b>of</b> β-hydride elimination on the Cu(2 2 1) surface {{are similar to those}} on the Cu(1 1 0) surface suggesting that the ethyl groups are reacting at the (1 1 0) step edges rather than on the (1 1 1) terraces. Vibrational spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iodine atoms remaining on the surfaces after decomposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ethyl groups have been used to probe the iodine binding sites and to corroborate predictions based on density functional theory that the iodine atoms bind to <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> edges. Iodine atoms on Cu(1 1 1) exhibit vibrational modes at 130 and 235 cm− 1 that we assign empirically to in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations, respectively, of iodine atoms adsorbed at fcc sites on the (1 1 1) plane. On <b>the</b> <b>stepped</b> Cu(2 2 1) surface an additional peak appears at 80 cm− 1 arising from iodine adsorbed at <b>the</b> <b>step</b> edges. <b>The</b> fact that this mode is at a lower frequency than the in-plane mode on the Cu(1 1 1) surface suggests that the iodine atom is adsorbed at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> edge where its motion is unconstrained. These experimental results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that iodine atoms adsorb at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> edges on <b>the</b> Cu(2 2 1) surface...|$|R

40|$|The mean {{flow and}} {{fluctuations}} were {{measured in the}} undistributed turbulent boundary layer, the separated flow region and on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>step.</b> <b>The</b> freestream Mach number was 4. 0 and the boundary layer Reynolds number based on momentum thickness was 4, 100. The model was large enough to allow reversed flow profile measurements and to insure two-dimensionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> separated flow. For an aspect ratio (span between fences/step height) <b>of</b> 9. 4, <b>the</b> back flow profiles show three-dimensionality effects. The mean flowfield is described in detail. In the “separation region” large normal and axial pressure gradients exist. <b>The</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inviscid flow after separation is 12 1 / 2 ° In the nearly constant pressure separated flow region the forward velocity profiles up to 2 H <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> are similar and nearly similar closer to <b>the</b> <b>step.</b> <b>The</b> entrainment rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward flow λ_e = ρ_ 0 v_ 0 / ρ_eu_e =. 010.

[...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's trying very hard to be somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting as he runs, and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E
