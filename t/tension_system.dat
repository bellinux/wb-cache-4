30|$|In 2003, Sakamoto et al. [67], {{from the}} University of Colorado, {{proposed}} the double <b>tensioning</b> <b>system,</b> {{as shown in}} Figure  8 (c). It is equivalent {{to a combination of}} the single and Miura–Natori <b>tensioning</b> <b>systems.</b> Tie cables are connected with both the inner cables in the pockets and the outer cables tightened to the frame. After comparing the single and double <b>tensioning</b> <b>systems,</b> Sakamoto et al.

In this paper, the relationships between pocket parameters and membrane anti-wrinkle ability were not analyzed. In 2008, Guan et al.

5000|$|Conga drums are tunable to {{different}} notes. The original drums were tuned by adjusting knots and tension ropes on the drumhead, or, where the drum-heads were tacked or {{nailed to the}} top of the shell, by careful heating of the head. Modern congas use a screw-and-lug tension head system, which makes them easier to tune (or detune). This modern type of <b>tension</b> <b>system</b> is attributed to Carlos [...] "Patato" [...] Valdes, a popular Cuban Conguero. As was discussed above, terminology for the drums varies.

[69], {{put forward}} the {{multi-layer}} <b>tensioning</b> <b>system,</b> {{which is a}} combination of the double <b>tensioning</b> <b>system</b> and a layer of tie cables, as shown in Figure  8 (d). The two layers of tie cables are connected by some cables. Adding a layer of tie cables reduces the impact of frame vibrations on the membrane, but the cable mass and risk of deployment failure caused by cable windings will increase. Sakamoto et al. [69], performed response analysis of membrane structures to external low frequency disturbances. The results show that the multi-layer <b>tensioning</b> <b>system</b> enhanced the passive vibration isolation effect in the boundary layers. However, the optimal balance between the vibration isolation effect and cable mass was not considered in this paper.|$|R

5000|$|Singer {{had seen}} a rotary sewing machine being {{repaired}} in a Boston shop. As an engineer, {{he thought it was}} clumsy and decided to design a better one. The machine he devised used a falling shuttle instead of a rotary one; the needle was mounted vertically and included a presser foot to hold the cloth in place. It had a fixed arm to hold the needle and included a basic <b>tension</b> <b>system.</b> This machine combined elements of Thimonnier, Hunt and Howe's machines. Singer was granted an American patent in 1851, and it was suggested [...] he patent the foot pedal or treadle, used to power some of his machines; unfortunately, the foot pedal had been in use too long for a patent to be issued. When Howe learned of Singer's machine he took him to court, where Howe won and Singer was forced to pay a lump sum for all machines already produced. Singer then took out a license under Howe's patent and paid him $1.15 per machine before entering into a joint partnership with a lawyer named Edward Clark. They created the first hire-purchase arrangement to allow people to buy their machines through payments over time.|$|E

5000|$|Battles are {{randomly}} occurring and turn-based. When encountering an enemy, {{the game}} switches to a battle {{scene with the}} enemies facing the party where characters from both sides take turns attacking each other. These battle scenes have visually changed dramatically from earlier games in the series, yet retain a similar text based menu system for battles. In the earlier games, battles were shown from a first-person perspective. For this installment, the battles are shown in a first-person perspective while choosing what to do, but the view then shifts to a third-person perspective {{with all of the}} members of the Hero's party shown on the screen along with the enemies. During battle, each character in the party has the ability to attack, use items, or use magic and skills. New to Dragon Quest VIII is the <b>tension</b> <b>system,</b> which allows the player to choose the [...] "Psyche Up" [...] command for a character during battle. This command allows the player to skip a character's turn in order to build [...] "tension", making that character's next attack stronger. By using it multiple times in succession, the character's attack will do more damage. Another new feature, the Alchemy Pot allows players to mix items in order to create new, stronger items. This can be done while walking on the world map. There is also a monster capturing feature, but it is not as fundamental to the gameplay as it was in Dragon Quest V. The player may find enemies visible on the world map and can be recruited if defeated and used during the Monster Arena mini-game and during battle.|$|E

30|$|The {{demand for}} large antennas in future space {{missions}} has increasingly stimulated {{the development of}} deployable membrane antenna structures owing to their light weight and small stowage volume. However, there is little literature providing a comprehensive review and comparison of different membrane antenna structures. Space-borne membrane antenna structures are mainly classified as either parabolic or planar membrane antenna structures. For parabolic membrane antenna structures, there are five deploying and forming methods, including inflation, inflation-rigidization, elastic ribs driven, Shape Memory Polymer (SMP)-inflation, and electrostatic forming. The development and detailed comparison of these five methods are presented. Then, properties of membrane materials (including polyester film and polyimide film) for parabolic membrane antennas are compared. Additionally, for planar membrane antenna structures, frame shapes have changed from circular to rectangular, and different <b>tensioning</b> <b>systems</b> have emerged successively, including single Miura–Natori, double, and multi-layer <b>tensioning</b> <b>systems.</b> Recent advances in structural configurations, <b>tensioning</b> <b>system</b> design, and dynamic analysis for planar membrane antenna structures are investigated. Finally, future trends for large space membrane antenna structures are pointed out and technical problems are proposed, including design and analysis of membrane structures, materials and processes, membrane packing, surface accuracy stability, and test and verification technology. Through a review of large deployable membrane antenna structures, guidance for space membrane-antenna research and applications is provided.|$|R
40|$|When {{simulating}} {{a molecular}} system, a cutoff distance for interactions {{is often used}} to speed up the simulations. This is made at the cost of neglecting some interactions which will lead to inaccurate results for energy, pressure components and surface tension (for systems with surfaces). To compensate for the neglected long-range interactions, continuum corrections can be added to the surface <b>tension,</b> <b>system</b> energies and pressures. For a homogenous isotropic system this is straight-forward but for a system with a surface it is more complicated. In this work we have derived expressions for the corrections to the surface <b>tension,</b> <b>system</b> energies and pressures that are more general than previous results. When these corrections are added to multi-component systems with a surface (or single-component systems with vacuum) they compensate for the change in surface <b>tension,</b> <b>system</b> energy and pressures due to the finite cutoff. When simulating systems with no Coulomb-interactions, the structure of the system may change significantly if the cutoffs are too short. If this is the case then these corrections alone will not be enough. The solution is to add corrections to the force acting on each molecule added during the simulation, which we derive in this work. This solves the structural problem at low cutoffs and makes it possible to calculate an accurate surface tension independent of cutoff. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In tension systems, {{the main}} concern is to {{decouple}} the tension and velocity in spite of radius variations and other perturbations. To solve this control problem and design the optimal controller, this paper develops a mixed-sensitivity robust H ∞ control based on self-optimizing algorithm. First, the modeling of the <b>tension</b> <b>system</b> is presented with relative theorems. Second, a mixed-sensitivity robust H ∞ control which reduces the coupling between tension and velocity is compared to PID controller. But the H ∞ controller is conservative, the H ∞ controller method with parameter fuzzification is introduced. At low velocity, the H∞ control method with parameter fuzzification gets fine results. However, for the high velocity and real time requirements of <b>tension</b> <b>system,</b> the H ∞ control method with parameter fuzzification cannot keep the controller optimal always. Therefore the tension robust control strategy based on self-optimizing algorithm is proposed. The controller is optimized by hyper generation GA (HGGA) which reduces computing time. Furthermore, the current error and the change of the error are turned to compensate time delay. In order to test {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms, the tension experiment platform analog system is developed based on DSP (TMS 320 LF 2407 A) board. Finally the algorithms in this paper are tested in <b>tension</b> <b>system</b> platform, and the feasibility has been verified.
