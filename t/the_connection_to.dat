After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40.|$|E
5|$|Before being {{upgraded}} to a freeway between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road, SR905 {{had a direct}} connection with SR 125 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. When that segment of the SR905 freeway was opened in 2010, the interchange with SR125 had initially been omitted, forcing traffic on SR905 and SR125 to exit their respective freeways and use Otay Mesa Road (which continues to parallel SR905) to make <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b> <b>To</b> help fix this problem, ramps from SR905 in both directions and SR11 westbound to SR125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, {{at a cost of}} over $21 million. Southbound traffic on SR125 must currently still exit to Otay Mesa Road at that toll road's south end in order to connect to SR905, but the southbound ramps are scheduled to begin construction in 2018.|$|E

This time M-47 was realigned to a former section of US Highway 10 (US10), and <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the state park was assigned the M-247 designation.

5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> the River Tone was not made until 2 January.

5|$|Due to cost increases, several {{features}} of the subway were cut back soon after construction started.

This design change was done before the actual construction started. The MTA also pushed back its completion date to 2014.

5|$|Ford Australia's {{performance}} vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles {{produced a}} range of models based on the Falcon BA and marketed under the FPV name. The 2003 BA range included the GT, GT-P, and the Pursuit. The GT was the entry-level vehicle that started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the upmarket version of the GT, with a price tag of A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. FPV specific body-kits were applied to all cars, using the lights from the XR-range.
