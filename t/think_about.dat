5|$|The DVD {{release of}} The Haunting Hour: Don't <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> It was {{reported}} as the fourth top children's DVD rental on a chart from the Orlando Sentinel, published on September 28, 2007.|$|E
5|$|I find {{it quite}} nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you write}} songs, you don't really <b>think</b> <b>about</b> performing in a video. I think it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{this story}} was simply content to show {{absolute}} power corrupting absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what they're doing or why, {{and the story of}} Malik is content to blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E

She learns that Xander {{constantly}} <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> sex, Cordelia says almost exactly what she thinks, Oz thinks extremely deep thoughts, Willow <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> how she is left out of things, and Wesley <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> Cordelia.|$|R
50|$|The song's narrator asks {{a former}} lover if she still <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> him, {{and she says}} {{every once in a}} while. In reality she {{constantly}} <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> their old relationship and wants to return to the way things were.|$|R

5|$|Reubens {{approached}} Pee-wee's Big Adventure director Tim Burton {{with one}} of the scripts and talked to Johnny Depp about the possibility of having him portray Pee-wee, but Burton was too busy, and Depp said he would have to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
5|$|The film {{discusses}} {{why some}} people enjoy underground horror films involving fetishes. Although the film is classified as a documentary, there is a fictional subplot which helps advance the film's theme by showing what some people really <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the genre.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I {{do the same things}} that I did before … I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E

5|$|After Belushi's {{sudden death}} by drug {{overdose}} in 1982, Judith Jacklin Belushi, the actor's widow, began to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{putting together a}} video to commemorate him. The sketch was included on the 1985 Saturday Night Live release of 16 sketches featuring Belushi called The Best of John Belushi, produced by Lorne Michaels and Judith Jacklin Belushi, sold by Warner Home Video in VHS format.|$|E
5|$|Bryars {{began to}} <b>think</b> <b>about</b> his next opera in 1984, {{when he was}} in France for the {{production}} of Medea, his first work in the genre. The three subjects he came up with were Flaubert's Bouvard et Pécuchet, De Quincey's The Last Days of Immanuel Kant and Verne's Dr. Ox's Experiment. Unknown to Bryars, this last had already been the subject of two other operas, the opéra-bouffe Le docteur Ox by Jacques Offenbach and il Dottor Oss by Annibale Bizzelli.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a new idea, you necessarily <b>think</b> <b>about</b> shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

5|$|Henderson and JPL {{director}} Bruce Ng {{prepare a}} space probe to deliver {{enough food to}} last Watney until Ares IV's arrival. When the Hab's airlock malfunctions due to a small puncture, it destroys Watney's crops. Sanders orders the team {{to speed up the}} supply mission with the Iris probe by skipping the safety inspections. However, an oversight causes the destabilization and subsequent explosion of the rocket 40 seconds after liftoff, causing Watney to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> his seemingly inevitable death.|$|E
5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E
5|$|In bed, Marge gives Homer a {{magazine}} quiz about his drinking. Hearing Homer's answers, Marge asks {{him to give}} up beer for a month, to which he agrees. Homer tries not to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> beer while he rides a bike to work. After a series of severe temptations, Homer crashes his bike as hundreds of bottles of Duff parachuted down on him from a blimp.|$|E

5|$|It {{had a big}} impact. He was a {{founding}} member and really created the vocal style we are known for. Just felt like part of the band died too. Like when he died, it was just weird to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> doing shows or recording without him around, {{even if he was}} no longer in the band. He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|I’d {{like them}} to walk away {{thinking}} it’s a film that can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way. I’m happy when I hear from people who’ve seen the short that it makes them <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the kind of strangeness where we find inspiration for art and where we find love, and the kind of miraculousness of just being alive and having a life. I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E
5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E

5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E
5|$|Schuyler and {{original}} Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began {{developing a new}} television drama in 1999. As the months progressed, they began to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{what had happened to}} the characters of Degrassi High to develop a school-reunion theme. However, they decided that a series would not work effectively if based around adults instead of children. Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school, and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences.|$|E
