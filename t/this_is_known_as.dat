5|$|Renal {{disease may}} lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost, there is a {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
5|$|The Moon orbits the Earth in {{approximately}} 27.3 days, {{relative to a}} fixed frame of reference. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the sidereal month. However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the synodic month and corresponds to what is commonly called the lunar month.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen {{have rarely}} {{played in the}} same {{division}} as their geographically closest rivals: Peterhead, Brechin City, Montrose, Arbroath, Elgin City, and Forfar Athletic, so rivalries have tended to come from further afield. Currently, Aberdeen have a minor rivalry with Inverness Caley Thistle, {{due to the fact}} both Aberdeen and Inverness are the two largest settlements in the north of Scotland. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the North derby and has arisen since Inverness were first promoted to the SPL in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Euler {{linked the}} nature of prime {{distribution}} with ideas in analysis. He proved that {{the sum of the}} reciprocals of the primes diverges.

5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Newton's theory of colour.|$|E

5|$|If k is close, but not equal, to one, {{the second}} orbit resembles the first, but {{revolves}} gradually about {{the center of}} force; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> orbital precession (Figure3). If k is greater than one, the orbit precesses {{in the same direction}} as the orbit (Figure3); if k is less than one, the orbit precesses in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E

5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into {{more and more}} threads, those threads spend an {{ever-increasing}} portion of their time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent solving the problem, and further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases {{the amount of time}} required to finish. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> parallel slowdown.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Second, the longitudes of {{ascending}} nodes {{of the two}} bodies—the points {{where they}} cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the 1:1 superresonance. All the Jovian planets, particularly Jupiter, {{play a role in}} the creation of the superresonance.|$|E

5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} {{is added to}} steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of cementite, keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.|$|E
5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E

5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
