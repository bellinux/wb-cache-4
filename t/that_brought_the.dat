5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 6th century AD Calakmul was {{assembling}} a far-reaching political alliance, activity <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> city into conflict with the great city of Tikal. The influence of Calakmul extended deep into the Petén; king Tuun K'ab' Hix of Calakmul oversaw the enthronement of Aj Wosal to the rulership of Naranjo in 546. Another vassal of Tuun K'ab' Hix was taken captive by Yaxchilan {{on the banks of the}} Usumacinta River in 537.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer.

5|$|Late on October 26, a broad area of low {{pressure}} in the southwestern Caribbean developed and became Tropical Depression Twenty-six. Six hours later, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beta.

However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted.

5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isidore was {{the ninth}} named storm {{and the second}} {{hurricane}} in the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Isidore was the fifth of eight named storms to occur in September. The tropical cyclone peaked as a Category 3 hurricane, causing damage as well as four fatalities in Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, and the United States. Isidore is noted for threatening to strike the northern Gulf Coast as a Category4 hurricane, but instead striking as a moderate tropical storm due to a track change <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> storm over the Yucatán Peninsula for over a day, which significantly weakened the cyclone. Its primary impact was the heavy rainfall which fell across southeast Mexico and from the central United States Gulf coast into the Ohio Valley.|$|E

She also participated in five game test series against the Netherlands, the United States and Japan where her team won all games in those series.

5|$|James IV's (r. 1488–1513) {{creation}} of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets. These court poets, or makars, who were mainly clerics included Robert Henryson (c. 1450-c. 1505), who re-worked Medieval and Classical sources, such as Chaucer and Aesop in works such as his Testament of Cresseid and The Morall Fabillis. William Dunbar (1460–1513) produced satires, lyrics, invectives and dream visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind. Gavin Douglas (1475–1522), who became Bishop of Dunkeld, injected humanist concerns and classical sources into his poetry. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados. It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> reign to an end.|$|E
5|$|On special teams, the Hokies {{had several}} highs and lows. Justin Harper's 84-yard punt-return {{touchdown}} sparked a Virginia Tech rally <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Hokies within striking distance, but failures {{on special teams}} also ended the rally and turned {{the momentum of the}} game against Virginia Tech. Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He only needed two field goals to break Tech's record for most field goals in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998. Though Dunlevy had two chances for field goals, one fell short and the other was blocked.|$|E

Arthur H. Compton from the University of Chicago was appointed head of research and development. Against Szilard's wishes, Compton concentrated all the groups working on reactors and plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. Compton laid out an ambitious plan to achieve a chain reaction by January 1943, start manufacturing plutonium in nuclear reactors by January 1944, and produce an atomic bomb by January 1945.|$|E

While successful in winning the election, the coalition started to fray soon after taking office. By 1954, however, Democrat James Hugh Joseph Tate and others in Council attempted to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees to be active in party politics. Dallas stood with the reform wing of the party, and the amendment effort fell {{just short of the}} two-thirds vote in Council to put the proposed charter amendment on the ballot. In doing so, Dallas worked against the wishes of Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green, Jr., siding instead with the reform-minded mayor, Joseph S. Clark, Jr.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{has been}} reopened for other {{purposes}} since it closed its doors as a planetarium in 1995. On March 5, 1998, an initial three-year agreement was signed <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> Children's Own Museum {{to the second floor}} of the planetarium, where the Astrocentre used to be. Due to impending construction at the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum, the contract was not renewed in late 2002, and the Children's Own Museum has been looking for a new location ever since. During its three-year tenure in that building, it hosted nearly a half-million visitors. The institution still exists, though it currently (as of 2009) has no physical home. It is currently seeking suitable space to use in future endeavours. In the meantime the organization has participated in various children's events around the city.|$|E

5|$|DOS (Disk Operating System) was the {{operating}} system <b>that</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> company its real success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E
