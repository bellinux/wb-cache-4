One of the friends who briefly hid Roof's gun from him said, [...] "I don't think the church was his primary target because he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> was going for the school. But I think he couldn't get into the school because of the security ... so I think he just settled for the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Gresham {{began his}} long career in outdoor journalism, {{he signed a}} {{baseball}} contract with the Chicago Cubs organization {{and was on the}} roster of the Cubs' Shelby, North Carolina farm team but never played. His son, Tom Gresham, learned of the baseball offer from the Cubs several years after his father's death while looking through old family records. [...] "He went to work {{to take care of his}} young family ... I wonder how much it hurt him to make that decision. So much that he never, ever <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> was signed by the Cubs." ...|$|E

The {{secretary}} of the Young Communist League, Jim White, who went to university with Reid, recalls: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> was a Leninist and Stalinist.

2500|$|On 11 July 2015, Ronaldinho {{announced}} {{his return to}} Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense, but on 28 September, Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal. He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans. Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, [...] "Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting. He respectfully <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> didn't feel {{he was able to}} perform as good as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him. He made a great gesture in saying he wasn't being the player he felt he could be right now. I'll never speak about whether or not he is retiring. That's not something you say about a player of his calibre. He was always spectacular, as player and person." ...|$|E
2500|$|According {{to press}} accounts, Cheney told {{investigators}} that he had learned of Mrs. Wilson's employment by the CIA and her potential role in her husband being sent to Niger by then-CIA director George Tenet, though it's unclear whether Cheney was made aware of her classified status. Tenet has {{told investigators that}} he had no specific recollection of discussing Plame or her role in her husband's trip with Cheney. Tenet did recall, however, that he made inquiries regarding the veracity of the Niger intelligence information as a result of inquires from both Cheney and Libby. According to press accounts, Libby told investigators that on July 12, 2003, while aboard Air Force Two, he and Cheney may have discussed leaking information about Plame to reporters. Libby told investigators he believed {{at the time that the}} information about Plame had come from Russert. After arriving back in Washington, according to Cooper's and Miller's testimony at Libby's trial, Libby spoke to both of them by telephone and confirmed to them that Plame worked for the CIA and may have played a role in sending her husband to Niger. FBI agent Deborah Bond testified at Libby's trial that during Libby's second FBI interview in his office on November 23, 2003, Libby was asked about the July 12 flight. Bond testified Libby told the FBI [...] "there was a discussion whether to report to the press that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA." [...] She added that Mr. Libby expressed some doubt, however, adding [...] "Mr. Libby <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> believed they may have talked about it, but he wasn't sure." [...] She testified that Libby did say he had discussed Wilson's wife with Cheney sometime after allegedly discussing her with Russert. Libby reportedly told investigators that neither the president nor the vice president specifically directed him or other administration officials to disclose Plame's CIA employment to the press.|$|E
