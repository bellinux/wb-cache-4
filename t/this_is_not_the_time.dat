25|$|In 1901, Boyce {{successfully}} led {{a campaign}} to have the WFM adopt socialism as its official economic policy. An ardent socialist, Boyce famously declared:There can be no harmony between organized capitalists and organized labor. Our present wage system is slavery in its worst form. â€¦ Advise strikes as the weapon {{to be used by}} labor to obtain its rights, and you will be branded as criminals who aim to ruin the business interests of the country. Change from the policy of simple trades unionism that is fast waning, and you will be told that your action is premature, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Pursue the methods adopted by capitalists and you will be sent to prison for robbery or executed for murder. Demand, and your demands will be construed into threats of violence against the rights of private property calculated to scare capital. Avail yourself of your constitutional rights and propose to take political action, and you will be charged with selling out the organization to some political party. Counsel arbitration, and you will be told that there is nothing to arbitrate. Be conservative, and your tameness will be construed as an appreciation of the conditions thrust upon you by trusts and syndicates. Take what action you will in the interests of labor, the trained beagles in the employ of capital from behind their loathsome fortress of disguised patriotism will howl their tirade of condemnation.|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me {{to the end of the}} week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|After an eleven-month hiatus, Faith No More played four {{shows in}} South America in November 2011. On {{the first date}} (November 8, 2011), the band played a [...] "mystery song," [...] which led to {{speculation}} of new material. They played Sonisphere France on July 7, 2012. Following several more shows in Europe during 2012, Faith No More [...] became temporarily inactive again. Mike Patton spent 2013 touring with his reformed rock supergroup Tomahawk, while the band's other members also pursued their own side projects. In July 2013, Billy Gould confirmed that the band's hiatus would not be permanent, saying [...] "We will do something again only when all members are with the focus on that, and ready for the challenge. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time...</b> yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|The focused {{lesson is}} the first phase in a gradual release of {{responsibility}} model. [...] Other names for this are modeling, direct instruction, explicit instruction, or teacher instructed mini-lessons. [...] This is a powerful, but brief, segment of instruction time as it is when the teacher demonstrates, models, and shares what the teacher, is thinking. [...] The teacher verbalizes their internal thought processes to explain and explicitly show {{the focus of the}} lesson, skills, or concepts. [...] Or the teacher invites the students into their mind to witness their thought process, how it is done and how decisions are made during the task. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to simply tell the students things, but to let them know how to do them and why.|$|E
2500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home to play the Reds, dropping the opener 6-4 when Dee Gordon committed a costly error {{in the seventh inning}} with the game tied, leading to four runs scoring. The Dodgers wasted a fine start by Kershaw on June 15 as the Scott Elbert allowed a go-ahead eighth-inning single to Joey Votto and the Reds won 3-2. Scott Rolen got three hits and drove in three runs as the Reds finished off their sweep of the Dodgers 7-2. The slumping Dodgers were subsequently handled by Houston starter Brett Myers, who retired 17 consecutive batters at one point and made only 98 pitches in a 7-3 Astros win. The Dodgers home losing streak hit five when they were shut out by the Astros 7-0 on June 18. The game was doubly frustrating because starting catcher Rod Barajas suffered an ankle strain in the second inning and joined the multitude of Dodgers already on the disabled list. Manager Don Mattingly said after the game, [...] "We're frustrated, that's for sure, but you know what? We don't have time to be frustrated... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to feel sorry for ourselves." [...] The Dodgers avoided being swept by the last place Astros with a 1-0 victory on June 19, that ended the five-game losing streak. A solo homer by Dioner Navarro {{in the bottom of the}} 8th inning was all the Dodgers offense could muster, but it was enough as Hiroki Kuroda and two relievers pitched a shutout. In the next game, Clayton Kershaw was dominant, striking out 11 in a two-hit shutout of the Detroit Tigers. He also hit a two-run eighth-inning single to extended the Dodgers lead in the 4-0 win. Chad Billingsley's turn was next and he also pitched effectively, allowing just one run in 5 1/3 innings as the Dodgers won their third straight, 6-1, over the Tigers. Matt Kemp reached base all five times he came up to bat in the series finale, with three hits (including a triple) and two walks but the Dodgers were done in by four home runs hit by the Tigers off of Ted Lilly in the 7-5 loss. The Los Angeles Angels came to town next for the next installment of the Freeway Series. In the opener, the Angels won a sloppy game with baserunning and fielding errors 8-3. [...] "I don't like the way it's going, thats for sure." [...] Manager Don Mattingly said after the Dodgers lost 6-1 in game 2. The Dodgers bounced back to take the series finale 3-2. Clayton Kershaw struck out eleven in the game and pitched his second straight complete game, the first Dodger to do so in 11 years. Tony Gwynn, Jr.'s RBI single in the bottom of the ninth won it for the Dodgers.|$|E
