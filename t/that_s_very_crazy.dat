40|$|We analyze {{here for}} the first time the {{swimming}} behavior of a thermophilic, strictly anaerobic Spirochete, namely Spirochaeta thermophila using high temperature light microscopy. Our data show <b>that</b> <b>S.</b> thermophila <b>very</b> rapidly can change its morphology during swimming, resulting in cells appearing nearly linear, in cells possessing three different spiral forms, and in cells being linear at one end and spiral at the other end. In addition cells can rapidly bend by up to 180 °, with their ends coming into close contact. We combine electron with light microscopy to explain these various cell morphologies. Swimming speeds for cells with the various morphologies did not differ significantly: the average speed was 33 (+/- 8) µm/s, with minimal and maximal speeds of 19 µm/s and 59 µm/s, respectively. Addition of gelling agents like polyvinylpyrrolidone or methyl cellulose to the growth medium resulted in lower and not higher swimming speeds, arguing against the idea that the highly unusual cell body plan of S. thermophila enables cells to swim more efficiently in gel-like habitats...|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "key plank of TerraNova's argument" [...] was the {{principle}} that the Court should select the interpretation that is most [...] "practical and sensible". TerraNova claimed that individual employers {{should not have to}} “shoulder the burden of rectifying society-wide structural discrimination” or “undertake assessments that are simply beyond their expertise and resources”. They argued that Parliament would have been clearer if it intended to impose such a significant burden on employers, and that the absence of guidelines was indicative of a lack of intention. TerraNova also relied heavily on s 9, which provides that the court “shall have power from time to time … to state … the general principles to be observed for the implementation of equal pay”. The Court felt, however, <b>that</b> <b>s</b> 9 was <b>very</b> open-ended. They considered its legislative history, which did not serve to clarify the section’s meaning, and consequently found that “it is simply not possible to read the Pay Act as a carefully drafted and well thought-out piece of legislation”.|$|R
5000|$|Some authorities, such as Thorington (1976), posit <b>that</b> <b>S.</b> leucopus is <b>very</b> {{closely related}} to the {{cotton-top}} tamarin, Saguinus oedipus. [...] Other analyses made by Hernandez-Camacho & Cooper (1976), and later Mittermeier and Coimbra-Filho in 1981, and finally Grooves (2001) This view is supported by Hanihara & Natoria’s multivariate analysis of toothcomb dental morphology (1987) and by Skinner’s work in 1991, which found high similarity between S. oedipus and S. leucopus in 16 out of 17 morphological traits considered. This is further supported by the transition from child to adult, during which the fur coloration changes take place and are similar between the two species. Philip Hershkovitz proposed that the divergence of the two species occurred in the Pleistocene {{at the height of the}} Atrato River, where it intersected the Cauca-Magdalena. At this time, the area was covered by a sea, which created a geographic barrier which caused this ancestral species to diverge from S. oedipus through the process of allopatric speciation. Today, the two species are principally separated by the Atrato river.|$|R
