5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue.

The variations in <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes.

5|$|Edziza's rounded, steep-sided lava domes {{were built}} by eruptions of very thick light-coloured magma, {{including}} trachyte. Such magmas are typically too thick to move {{far from the}} vent it extrudes from, causing it to solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic extrusions, creating a characteristic dome-like shape. <b>The</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magma is attributed {{to high levels of}} silica, a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms. Edziza's domes reach heights of several hundred metres, and grew slowly and steadily for months to years. The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the possibility of the building of gas pressure, the dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time. When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases, it can produce a pyroclastic flow, a super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice.|$|E
