But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going {{all over the world}} at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the need}} to gain popular support for a new monarch by making the {{ceremony}} a spectacle for ordinary people, started with the coronation in 1377 of RichardII who was a 10-year-old boy, thought unlikely to command respect simply by his physical appearance. On the day before the coronation, the boy king and his retinue were met outside the City of London by the lord mayor, aldermen and the livery companies, and he was conducted to the Tower of London where he spent the night in vigil. The following morning, the king travelled on horseback in a great procession through the decorated city streets to Westminster. Bands played along the route, the public conduits flowed with red and white wine, and an imitation castle had been built in Cheapside, probably to represent the New Jerusalem, where a girl blew gold leaf over the king and offered him wine. Similar, or even more elaborate pageants continued until the coronation of CharlesII in 1661. Charles's pageant was watched by Samuel Pepys who wrote: [...] "So glorious was the show with gold and silver <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to look at it". James II abandoned the tradition of the pageant to pay for jewels for his queen and thereafter there was only a short procession on foot from Westminster Hall to the abbey. For the coronation of GeorgeIV in 1831, a state procession from StJames's Palace to the abbey was instituted, and this pageantry is an important feature of the modern event.|$|E

[...] Bruce Hafenfeld, of the California Cattlemen’s Association, operates a family ranch raising commercial calves and cows on both private property and public lands on a federal grazing allotment. Hafenfeld has entered into a perpetual conservation easement with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly Soil Conservation Service) to ensure the property is maintained as a working ranch. [...] “We developed a management plan for 1.3 acres along the Kern River Preserve, went after a wetland reserve grant, and developed habitat that increased opportunities for species to come onto my land. We were trying to show <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> a liability, but an asset.” Hafenfeld said, speaking at the 2007 Conference of the Riparian Habitat Joint Venture. The Riparian Habitat Joint Venture is a cooperative conservation agreement between federal, state and private entities modeled after the Joint Venture projects of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. It was started in 1994 by Partners in flight.|$|E

2500|$|Star Trek went to {{series on}} the basis of the second pilot, but still fearing {{blacklash}} against Spock's ears, and issues with selling the show to stations in the Bible Belt, NBC airbrushed out the pointed tips in an advertising brochure about the series. Spock's role was used as audition material for new cast members. Nichelle Nichols was intrigued by the role when she read his lines, and asked why the character could not be female. The producers response was that Nimoy would not like it. It was during the filming of the first non-pilot episode to be shot, [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", that under the direction of Joseph Sargent, Nimoy was directed to remain aloof during a tense moment and said the catchphrase [...] "fascinating" [...] for the first time. This moment was subsequently given by the writing staff as an example of how the character should act. Nimoy liked Spock's newly logical nature, observing that the character is [...] "struggling to maintain a Vulcan attitude, a Vulcan philosophical posture and a Vulcan logic, opposing what was fighting him internally, which was human emotion". Nimoy stated that after [...] "The Naked Time", in which a disease causes Spock to cry, [...] "I knew <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> playing a man with no emotions, but a man who had great pride, who had learned to control his emotions and who would deny that he knew what emotions were. In a way, he was more human than anyone else on the ship." ...|$|E
