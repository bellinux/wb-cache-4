5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway {{passes through}} Banff National Park, {{from the eastern}} {{boundary}} near Canmore, through the towns of Banff and Lake Louise, and into Yoho National Park in British Columbia. The Banff <b>townsite</b> is the main commercial centre in the national park. The village of Lake Louise {{is located at the}} junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, which extends north to the Jasper <b>townsite.</b>|$|E
5|$|The panel issued {{over 500}} recommendations, {{including}} limiting {{the growth of}} the Banff <b>townsite,</b> capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the <b>townsite</b> to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the <b>townsite.</b> Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} workers (who reached {{a peak of}} 44,900 in June 1944) lived in a construction camp near the old Hanford <b>townsite.</b> The administrators and engineers lived in the government town established at Richland Village, which eventually had accommodation in 4,300 family units and 25 dormitories.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff <b>townsite</b> proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff <b>townsite,</b> Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|In November 1883, the Oregon and California Railroad {{was built}} {{through the center}} of the Rogue Valley, {{bypassing}} Jacksonville, the county seat. The railroad company also constructed a train depot halfway between Central Point and Phoenix, and platted 82 city blocks around it. The <b>townsite</b> was named Medford in December. In 1884, residents celebrated the town's first Independence Day by firing 38 cannon blasts—one for each U.S. state—from Roxy Ann Peak's summit. Medford grew quickly, and was incorporated on February 24, 1885.|$|E
5|$|The pending {{completion}} of the again-rebuilt US-6, with properly laid asphalt and stable rock cuts, was announced in November 1984, 18months after {{the closure of the}} original alignment. Starting in 1993, the Utah Department of Transportation began discussions with former Thistle residents to build a memorial to the town. The department maintains a view area overlooking the <b>townsite</b> along US-6.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Rockies are {{composed}} of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff {{range in age from}} Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600–145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145–66 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff <b>townsite.</b> These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east and over top younger rocks during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiments}} were {{performed in the}} Bayo Canyon in a location designated TA-10 ("Technical Area 10") (but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Bayo Canyon Site) in Los Alamos County and close to the border with Santa Fe County, northeast from the Los Alamos <b>townsite.</b> The site had several fixed structures. The lanthanum-140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building, TA-10-1. There were four firing sites. The instruments for firing the explosives and recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings (TA-10-13 and TA-10-15).|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the Government of Canada {{enacted the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which {{provided}} {{public works projects}} in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff <b>townsite</b> and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included {{construction of a new}} registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, two rival <b>townsites</b> {{were built}} and promoted. One {{was on the}} Fraser River and was called South Fort George, while the other was on the Nechako River and was called Central Fort George. Both of these <b>townsites</b> {{believed}} that the railway would build a station in their community, but in May 1912, the railway chose to purchase the First Nation's village instead.|$|R
50|$|The {{contiguous}} test {{sites and}} wildlife regions have perimeter roads that allow access. Various perimeter <b>townsites</b> support the regions.|$|R

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to {{systematic}} predator control hunting {{which began in}} 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff <b>townsite</b> has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve {{the balance of the}} ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project – the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60–70 animals.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the <b>townsite</b> would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff <b>townsite,</b> while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E

5|$|The town of Hamilton was {{conceived}} by George Hamilton (a {{son of a}} Queenston entrepreneur and founder, Robert Hamilton), when he purchased farm holdings of James Durand, the local Member of the British Legislative Assembly, shortly after the War of 1812. Nathaniel Hughson, a property owner to the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare {{a proposal for a}} courthouse and jail on Hamilton's property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at York during a session of the Legislative Assembly, which established a new Gore District, of which the Hamilton <b>townsite</b> was a member.|$|E

50|$|The railway which {{finally did}} reach the Peace River Country in 1915 was the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway, owned by John Duncan MacArthur. As the initial file {{plan called for}} the line to cross the Peace River at Dunvegan, several {{entrepreneurs}} acquired land around the old fur trade site, and even into the surrounding hills and beyond, {{in order to establish}} <b>townsites.</b> Certain that the railway would pass through, many investors purchased lots in the <b>townsites,</b> convinced that Dunvegan would become a metropolis.|$|R

50|$|Following the fires, {{access to}} {{unallocated}} crown land (UCL) and reserves to perform bushfire mitigation {{emerged as a}} key issue for local landholders, who sought the ability to prepare and maintain permanent firebreaks in bushland bordering farming properties. At {{the time of the}} fires, the DoL had administrative responsibility for UCL and Unmanaged Reserves in Western Australia, however fire mitigation, such as hazard reduction burning, was performed by the DFES within <b>townsites</b> and performed by the DPAW outside <b>townsites,</b> excluding locals from access to assist and manage fuel loads.|$|R
25|$|Fernie is {{the only}} city-class {{municipality}} in Canada that is fully encircled by the Rocky Mountains. The <b>townsite</b> was {{laid out in the}} crook of a doglegged glacial valley that today is drained by the Elk River. Three tributaries of the Elk—Coal, Lizard, and Fairy Creeks—rise in its side valleys and join the Elk either within or in close proximity to the <b>townsite.</b>|$|E

50|$|As in Settlers, roads may be {{built to}} extend a player's territory. However, unlike Settlers, new towns may be built on <b>townsites</b> (there are 28 total) that are not claimed by other players, and players may not expand their road network past {{unclaimed}} <b>townsites</b> or a series of landmark intersections unless said landmark has previously been built. Any player may choose to build a landmark that is connected to their road network: when the landmark is built, the player is rewarded (the reward depending on the landmark that has been built.|$|R
