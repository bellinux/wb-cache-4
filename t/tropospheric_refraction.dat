The resulting vertical velocity field determined from GPS campaigns in 1995 and 1997 shows that the average uplift rate in ITRF 97 frame is about 7.8 ± 7.6 mm/yr for all 14 repeated surveying stations in Tibet, and the average uplift rate is 16.2 ± 7.9 mm/yr in southern Tibet, which are compared with the results from the gravity measurements, leveling data and fission-track dating (FT).|$|E

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Research Council (NRC), and the U. S. Naval Observatory (USNO) have been cooperating in a three-corner common-view two-way time transfer experiment. Some systematic effects are known to depend on the position of the satellite (Sagnac effect and the cross-correlation pulling of the pseudo-random codes). A method is presented for deriving accurate satellite ranges from each of three stations doing common-view two-way satellite time transfer measurements, when one (and only one) station also takes ranging measurements on its 'unwanted return signal' for a brief period. The method is applied to determine the variations in position of the satellite used {{over the course of the}} NIST/NRC/USNO SBS- 3 experiment, with ranging data taken at NRC, where no additional hardware was required to automate the process. The fit and extrapolation which are employed in this method have an estimated precision of 2 m. If the delays of SBS- 3 satellite KU band transponder and earth station equipment were measured accurately as well as the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>refractions</b> were well modeled and corrected, we would expect a ranging accuracy of 2. 5 m and satellite positioning accuracy would be 200 m (latitude) 50 m (longitude) and 20 m (height above ellipsoid) ...|$|R

Data analysis and propagation modeling show that the noise level at the stations and the stratospheric circumpolar vortex were different in 2016 compared to 2013. As the seismic magnitude of the 2013 and 2016 nuclear test explosions was comparable, we hypothesize that the 2016 test occurred at least 1. 5 times deeper. In such a case, less seismic energy would couple through the lithosphere-atmosphere interface, leading to less observable infrasound.

40|$|The Orbital and Geodetic Parameter Estimation Error Analysis program, ORAN, was {{developed}} as a Bayesian least squares simulation program for orbital trajectories. ORAN does not process data, but is intended to compute {{the accuracy of the}} results of a data reduction, if measurements of a given accuracy are available and are processed by a minimum variance data reduction program. Actual data may be used to provide the time when a given measurement was available and the estimated noise on that measurement. ORAN is designed to consider a data reduction process in which a number of satellite data periods are reduced simultaneously. If {{there is more than one}} satellite in a data period, satellite-to-satellite tracking may be analyzed. The least squares estimator in most orbital determination programs assumes that measurements can be modeled by a nonlinear regression equation containing a function of parameters to be estimated and parameters which are assumed to be constant. The partitioning of parameters into those to be estimated (adjusted) and those assumed to be known (unadjusted) is somewhat arbitrary. For any particular problem, the data will be insufficient to adjust all parameters subject to uncertainty, and some reasonable subset of these parameters is selected for estimation. The final errors in the adjusted parameters may be decomposed into a component due to measurement noise and a component due to errors in the assumed values of the unadjusted parameters. Error statistics associated with the first component are generally evaluated in an orbital determination program. ORAN is used to simulate the orbital determination processing and to compute error statistics associated with the second component. Satellite observations may be simulated with desired noise levels given in many forms including range and range rate, altimeter height, right ascension and declination, direction cosines, X and Y angles, azimuth and elevation, and satellite-to-satellite range and range rate. The observation errors considered are bias, timing, transit time, tracking station location, polar motion, solid earth tidal displacement, ocean loading displacement, <b>tropospheric</b> and ionospheric <b>refraction,</b> and space plasma. The force model elements considered are the earth's potential, the gravitational constant, solid earth tides, polar radiation pressure, earth reflected radiation, atmospheric drag, and thrust errors.

Unfortunately, remaining atmospheric propagation errors become increasingly problematic for long inter-station distances.

30|$|It {{is widely}} {{known that the}} {{positioning}} precision determined by global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations is affected by different sources of bias because of structural and nonstructural issues. One of the main biases is due to ionospheric and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>refraction</b> during the crossing of the atmosphere by the electromagnetic GNSS signal. The ionospheric effect can be eliminated by combination of the L 1 and L 2 phases for double-frequency receivers; it can be modeled for single-frequency receivers. In contrast, tropospheric bias is frequency-independent and cannot be reduced by means of any combination. The tropospheric effect produces a bias in each satellite receiver observation that {{can be related to}} the so-called zenith total delay (ZTD). The ZTD can be computed in the zenith direction above the GNSS station using an appropriate mapping function. The estimation of the ZTD helps to enhance the positioning precision and interpret severe meteorological events, as demonstrated in previous studies (Bouma and Stoew 2001; De Pondeca and Zou 2001; Basili et al. 2003; Bock et al. 2008; Boniface et al. 2009; Bennitt and Jupp 2012; Sguerso et al. 2013, 2015; Tsuda et al. 2013).|$|E

In order to use fast static or {{real-time}} kinematic (RTK) cmaccurate positioning over larger distances, active GPS reference receiver networks have been established in parts of Germany with station distances of 30 to 50 km.

40|$|Global {{satellite}} navigation systems (GNSS) are a standard measurement device for deformation monitoring. In many applications, double-differences {{are used to}} reduce distance dependent systematic effects, {{as well as to}} eliminate the receiver and satellites clock errors. However, due to the navigation principle of one way ranging used in GPS, the geometry of the subsequent adjustment is weakened. As a result, the height component is generally determined three times less precisely than the horizontal coordinates. In addition, large correlations between the height and elevation dependent effects exist such as <b>tropospheric</b> <b>refraction,</b> mismodelled phase center variations, or multipath which restricts the attainable accuracy. However, for a kinematic analysis, i. e. for estimating high rate coordinate time series, the situation can be significantly improved if a common clock is connected to different GNSS receivers in a network or on a baseline. Consequently, between-station single-differences are sufficient to solve for the baseline coordinates. The positioning geometry is significantly improved which is reflected by a reduction of the standard deviation of kinematic heights by about a factor 3 underlining the benefits of this new approach.
