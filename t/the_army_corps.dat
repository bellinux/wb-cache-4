5|$|In 1996, the Department of Energy, {{which had}} succeeded the Atomic Energy Commission, decided {{that since the}} Dayton sites already had been decontaminated, they did not warrant {{inclusion}} in <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). However, the local community in Dayton were concerned that the cleanup did not meet 21st century environmental standards. Therefore, the state of Ohio asked the United States Congress to have <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers conduct a review. This {{was carried out in}} 2004 and 2005. The review concluded that no radioactive contaminants were found that would warrant inclusion in FUSRAP.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} the Gouldsboro was {{discovered}} when a section of riverbank collapsed in 2003 and <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers surveyed the area in 2004 to determine how best to stabilize the riverbank. There are no plans to raise the wreck, but the Corps of Engineers will preserve it in place.|$|E
5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study also {{discovered}} that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E
50|$|In 1993 <b>the</b> 7th Tank <b>Army</b> was reorganised as <b>the</b> 7th <b>Army</b> <b>Corps.</b> In 1994 <b>the</b> 7th <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> was redesignated as <b>the</b> 65th <b>Army</b> <b>Corps,</b> still {{located at}} Borisov.|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 20thcentury, major river-control {{projects}} {{had begun to}} take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. <b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40percent of the basin. Most {{of them do not}} have fish ladders.|$|E
5|$|Enlisting in the U.S. Army on May 28, 1941, Uanna was {{assigned}} to the Corps of Intelligence Police (CIP), later renamed the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC). He attended the Officer Candidate School at Fort Belvoir, and in 1942 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers. He {{was assigned}} to the CIC as Director of Operations of I Service Command, responsible for five field offices and between 300 and 400 Special Agents, who dealt with subversion, espionage, plant security, sabotage, water front security and personnel investigations.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which could go up to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for {{the thought that the}} environmental impact statement (EIS) would back up their beliefs. Four months later, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers held a meeting to decide what to take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E

5|$|In {{his youth}} in San Francisco, Savage studied {{engineering}} and law, {{and graduated from}} the United States Military Academy. After {{a few years of}} surveying work with <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers, Savage went to Rome as an envoy following which he sailed to Egypt to serve a stint with the Egyptian Army. Returning home, Savage was assigned to assess border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico, and he performed railroad survey work in Texas. In Washington D.C., he courted and married a widowed noblewoman from Germany.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1953, Curtis E. Lemay, Commander of SAC, {{visited the}} base {{to review the}} construction's progress. During this visit, he {{indicated}} that Limestone was operationally ready. Later that month, command capabilities were formally transferred to SAC, ending an almost six-year command by <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers. Furthermore, personnel of the 4215th Base Service Squadron were reassigned to the 42d Bombardment Wing, which was reactivated and assigned to the 8th Air Force. On 23 February, Limestone Air Force Base officially became operational.|$|E
5|$|River {{development}} {{occurred within}} {{the structure of}} the 1909 International Boundary Waters Treaty between the US and Canada. The United States Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925, which directed <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers and the Federal Power Commission to explore the development of the nation's rivers. This prompted agencies to conduct the first formal financial analysis of hydroelectric development; the reports produced by various agencies were presented in House Document308. Those reports, and subsequent related reports, are referred to as 308 Reports.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the 51st Combined Arms Army was re-formed on {{the basis}} of the staff of <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> in <b>the</b> Far East Military District. <b>The</b> <b>army</b> was {{stationed}} on Sakhalin and in the Kuril Islands. The 79th Motor Rifle Division was disbanded in 1994. On 11 October 1993 <b>the</b> <b>army</b> was reorganized as <b>the</b> 68th <b>Army</b> <b>Corps.</b> Its 33rd Motor Rifle Division and 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division became part of <b>the</b> 68th <b>Army</b> <b>Corps.</b> <b>The</b> 68th <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> disbanded in 2010, but was later reformed in 2014.|$|R

50|$|The IISS {{estimated}} in 2007 that <b>the</b> Azeri regular <b>army</b> was 56,840 strong, probably basing this figure on Conventional Forces in Europe treaty data. It attributes to <b>the</b> <b>army</b> five <b>corps</b> headquarters, 23 motor rifle brigades, one artillery brigade, one {{multiple rocket launcher}} brigade, and one anti-tank regiment. Of <b>the</b> five <b>army</b> <b>corps,</b> <b>the</b> 1st, 2nd, and 3rd <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> are concentrated against NK; part of 2nd <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> is deployed on the Azerbaijan-Iranian border; <b>the</b> 4th (Bakinskiy) <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> covers <b>the</b> capital and the coast and <b>the</b> 5th <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> is deployed in Nakhichevan.|$|R
5|$|Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, at Pierce's request, led surveys {{with the}} Corps of Topographical Engineers of {{possible}} transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country. The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements, but Davis felt {{that such a}} project could be justified as a Constitutional national security objective. Davis also deployed <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers to supervise construction projects in the District of Columbia, including {{the expansion of the}} United States Capitol and building of the Washington Monument.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers {{commenced}} work on The Dalles Dam in 1952 {{and completed}} it five years later. On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as a rising Lake Celilo rapidly silenced the falls, submerged fishing platforms, and consumed {{the village of}} Celilo, ending an age-old existence for those who lived there. A small Native American community exists today at nearby Celilo Village, on a bluff overlooking the former location of the falls.|$|E
5|$|The James F. Byrnes Bridge {{was built}} in 1956. It was a two-lane toll swing bridge {{constructed}} {{at a cost of}} $1.5 million that opened the island to automobile traffic from the mainland. The swing bridge was hit by a barge in 1974 which shut down all vehicle traffic to the island until <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers built and manned a pontoon bridge while the bridge was being repaired. The swing bridge was replaced by the current four-lane bridge in 1982.|$|E

5|$|The New England Division of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers {{managed the}} {{construction}} of these sites. The sites were manned by men from the 3rd Missile Battalion, 61st Air Defense Artillery Regiment, and provided defense for Loring and the northeastern approaches to the United States. In 1960, sites L-13 and L-58 underwent conversion from Ajax missiles to the MIM-14 Nike-Hercules missiles. These sites remained operational until 1966, although the site at Limestone was closed in September 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} {{had major}} implications {{for a large}} segment of the population, economy, and politics of the entire United States. It has prompted a Congressional review of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers and the failure of portions of the federally built flood protection system which experts agree should have protected the city's inhabitants from Katrina's surge. Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.|$|E
5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Morocco <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> was {{positioned}} {{on the right}} bank of the Ebro. Later, <b>the</b> Maestrazgo <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> was sent as reinforcements, led by General Rafael García Valiño.|$|R

5|$|Alexander {{continued}} {{in this role}} during the Engineering Brigade's deployment with the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign, several times performing ably under hostile fire. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel for his service at the Siege of Yorktown, as of May 4, 1862. Following the abandonment of the campaign {{and the return of}} the Army of the Potomac to northern Virginia, General Barnard, now chief engineer of defenses of Washington, D.C., requested Alexander serve as his aide-de-camp. Alexander accepted and served in that capacity throughout 1862. When the Topographical Engineers and <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers were merged on March 3, 1863, Alexander (whose permanent U.S. Army rank was captain until this time) was promoted to major, while retaining his brevet (honorary) rank of lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, Matthias {{was called}} to active duty by the United States Army as a first lieutenant, and joined the Construction Division of <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers, where he {{received}} rapid promotion. On 14 December 1942, as a 34-year-old lieutenant colonel, he accompanied Colonel Kenneth Nichols to Wilmington, Delaware, to discuss {{the location of a}} proposed plutonium production plant with representatives of DuPont. At this point, Matthias had not yet been assigned to the Manhattan Project, whose mission was to build an atomic bomb, but he had worked on some special studies for it, and had worked with its director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., on the construction of The Pentagon. He was already Groves's choice for area engineer for the plutonium project.|$|E
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> <b>Corps</b> of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E
