5|$|Another one of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to carry out the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>TAB.</b>|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{flow field}} {{measurements}} {{have been carried}} out for a turbulent circular jet perturbed by tabs and artificial excitation. Two "delta tabs" were placed at the nozzle exit at diametrically opposite locations. The excitation condition involved subharmonic resonance that manifested in a periodic vortex pairing in the near flow field. While the excitation and <b>the</b> <b>tabs</b> independently increased jet spreading, {{a combination of the two}} diminished the effect. The jet spreading was most pronounced with <b>the</b> <b>tabs</b> but was reduced when excitation was applied to <b>the</b> <b>tabbed</b> jet. <b>The</b> <b>tabs</b> generated streamwise vortex pairs that caused a lateral spreading of the jet in a direction perpendicular to the plane containing <b>the</b> <b>tabs.</b> <b>The</b> excitation, on the other band, organized the azimuthal vorticity into coherent ring structures whose evolution and pairing also increased entrainment by the jet. In <b>the</b> <b>tabbed</b> case, <b>the</b> excitation produced coherent azimuthal structures that were distorted and asymmetric in shape. The self-induction of these structures produced an effect that opposed the tendency for the lateral spreading of the streamwise vortex pairs. The passage of the distorted vortices, and their pairing, also had a cancellation effect on the time-averaged streamwise vorticity field. These led to the reduction in jet spreading...|$|R

25|$|The {{origins of}} Dald√∏s are unknown, {{but it is}} strikingly similar to some games in <b>the</b> <b>t√¢b</b> group from Northern Africa and Western Asia, widely {{distributed}} during the Muslim expansion. One may conjecture that some sea-going trade contact has carried a t√¢b game to Scandinavia, either directly from the Arab world, or possibly via England, where a codex from Cerne Abbey, Dorset, from {{the second half of}} the thirteenth century (Folio 2v, MS 0.2.45, Trinity College Library, Cambridge) possibly shows a Dald√∏s board with 12+12+12 holes, after both players have made their first move. The game must have arrived in Scandinavia not much later than 1800, and quite possibly a few centuries before that. A connection involving the Swedish Vikings known as Varangians, mercenaries for the Byzantine Empire before 1100, has been suggested.|$|E
