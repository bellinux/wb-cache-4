I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on <b>this</b> <b>Earth</b> are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{literature on the}} subject of deserts. An early historical account is that of Marco Polo (c. 1254–1324), who travelled through Central Asia to China, crossing a number of deserts in his twenty four year trek. Some accounts give vivid descriptions of desert conditions, though often accounts of journeys across deserts are interwoven with reflection, {{as is the case in}} Charles Montagu Doughty's major work, Travels in Arabia Deserta (1888). Antoine de Saint-Exupéry described both his flying and the desert in Wind, Sand and Stars and Gertrude Bell travelled extensively in the Arabian desert in the early part of the 20th century, becoming an expert on the subject, writing books and advising the British government on dealing with the Arabs. Another woman explorer was Freya Stark who travelled alone in the Middle East, visiting Turkey, Arabia, Yemen, Syria, Persia and Afghanistan, writing over twenty books on her experiences. The German naturalist Uwe George spent several years living in deserts, recording his experiences and research in his book, In the Deserts of <b>this</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} many of the fathers, Irenaeus did not {{distinguish}} between the new earth re-created in its eternal state—the thousand years of Revelation 20—when the saints are with Christ after His second advent, and the Jewish traditions of the Messianic kingdom. Hence, he applies Biblical and traditional ideas to his descriptions of <b>this</b> <b>earth</b> during the millennium, throughout the closing chapters of Book 5. This conception of the reign of resurrected and translated saints with Christ on <b>this</b> <b>earth</b> during the millennium-popularly known as chiliasm—was the increasingly prevailing belief of this time. Incipient distortions due to the admixture of current traditions, which figure in the extreme forms of chiliasm, caused a reaction against the earlier interpretations of Bible prophecies.|$|E

25|$|In Sikh thought, Hell and Heaven are not {{places for}} living hereafter, {{they are part}} of spiritual {{topography}} of man and do not exist otherwise.

25|$|The {{account is}} also an eschatology: the divine revelation {{concerns}} {{the end of the}} present age, a moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom. The Book of Daniel gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on <b>this</b> <b>earth,</b> that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and on those Jews who cooperated with them.|$|E
25|$|The School of the Prophets {{spoken of}} in the book Under the Banner of Heaven claims revelation showing that Young was {{inaccurate}} in some points of his Adam–God teachings, but otherwise he was correct. The understanding from these revelations is that Jesus was the Only Begotten Son in {{the flesh of the}} Savior of the previous Earth where the father of all Spirits, Michael/Adam, had his mortal probation. The lineage of Michael/Adam, which includes all but Jesus on <b>this</b> <b>Earth,</b> will never become saviors of worlds. Thus the Adam–God doctrine of Young is simply a fuller understanding of the New Testament doctrine of joint-heirs with Christ.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{several months}} in therapy, Lords decided to concentrate on acting. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, where she studied method acting for three months. After leaving the school, Lords placed an advertisement in The Hollywood Reporter looking for representation. She was contacted by Fred Westheimer and although the agency refused to represent her, he decided to send her out on a few auditions. As a result, she was offered a guest role in an episode of the television series Wiseguy. Shortly afterwards, she met the director Jim Wynorski, who was directing the remake of Roger Corman's 1957 sci-fi classic Not of <b>This</b> <b>Earth.</b> He immediately cast Lords into the lead role of Nadine Story, and Not of <b>This</b> <b>Earth</b> (1988) became her first mainstream film debut since her departure from the adult film industry. Although the film failed at the box office, it did well in video sales, and, based on that success, Lords was offered to appear in Wynorski's next film, The Haunting of Morella (1989). However, Lords turned down the offer due to the requirement of having a nude scene, since {{she was trying to}} establish herself as a serious actress. She also signed with a modeling agency under her birth name Nora Kuzma and appeared on two covers of Joe Weider's magazine Muscle & Fitness. Around that time, Lords became a spokesperson for Children of the Night, an organization for runaways and abused children, and was planning to release a book titled Out of the Blue: The Traci Lords Story.|$|E
