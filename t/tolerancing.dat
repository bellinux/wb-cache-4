[...] If the distance measure is perceptually uniform, then the answer is simply [...] "the set of points whose distance to the reference is less than the just-noticeable-difference (JND) threshold." [...] This requires a perceptually uniform metric in order for the threshold to be constant throughout the gamut (range of colors). Otherwise, the threshold will be a function of the reference color—cumbersome as a practical guide.|$|E

40|$|Inflammatory <b>tolerance</b> is {{a crucial}} {{mechanism}} that limits inflammatory responses {{in order to avoid}} prolonged inflammation that may damage the host. Evidence that chronic inflammation contributes to the neuropathology of prevalent neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases suggests that inflammatory <b>tolerance</b> mechanisms are often inadequate to control detrimental inflammation in the central nervous system. Thus, identifying mechanisms that regulate neuroinflammatory <b>tolerance</b> may reveal opportunities for bolstering <b>tolerance</b> to reduce chronic inflammation in these diseases. Examination of <b>tolerance</b> after repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mouse primary astrocytes demonstrated that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity promoted <b>tolerance,</b> opposite to the action of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK 3), which counteracts <b>tolerance.</b> HDAC 6 in particular was found to be critical for <b>tolerance</b> induction, as its deacetylation of acetyl-tubulin was increased during LPS <b>tolerance,</b> this was enhanced by inhibition of GSK 3, and the HDAC 6 inhibitor tubacin completely blocked <b>tolerance</b> and the promotion of <b>tolerance</b> by inhibition of GSK 3. These results reveal opposing interactions between HDAC 6 and GSK 3 in regulating <b>tolerance,</b> and indicate that shifting the balance between these two opposing forces on inflammatory <b>tolerance</b> can obliterate or enhance <b>tolerance</b> to LPS in astrocytes...|$|R
40|$|Journal {{compilation}} © 2009 Blackwell Publishing LtdSalinity {{stress is}} a major factor inhibiting cereal yield throughout the world. <b>Tolerance</b> to salinity stress can be considered to contain three main components: Na+ exclusion, <b>tolerance</b> to Na+ in the tissues and osmotic <b>tolerance.</b> To date, most experimental work on salinity <b>tolerance</b> in cereals has focused on Na+ exclusion due in part to its ease of measurement. It has become apparent, however, that Na+ exclusion is not the sole mechanism for salinity <b>tolerance</b> in cereals, and research needs to expand to study osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and tissue <b>tolerance.</b> Here, we develop assays for high throughput quantification of Na+ exclusion, Na+ tissue <b>tolerance</b> and osmotic <b>tolerance</b> in 12 Triticum monococcum accessions, mainly using commercially available image capture and analysis equipment. We show that different lines use different combinations of the three <b>tolerance</b> mechanisms to increase their total salinity <b>tolerance,</b> with a positive correlation observed between a plant's total salinity <b>tolerance</b> and the sum of its proficiency in Na+ exclusion, osmotic <b>tolerance</b> and tissue <b>tolerance.</b> The assays developed in this study can be easily adapted for other cereals and used in high throughput, forward genetic experiments to elucidate the molecular basis of these components of salinity <b>tolerance.</b> Rajendran Karthika, Tester Mark and J.

40|$|Recent {{work on the}} {{specificity}} of metal <b>tolerance</b> in higher plants has suggested a multiple <b>tolerance</b> syndrome that is governed by common genes for <b>tolerance</b> to many metals. Previous work on metal <b>tolerance</b> in Mimulus guttatus Fischer ex DC reported <b>tolerance</b> to copper, lead, nickel, and zinc and suggested {{that this could be}} due to a multiple <b>tolerance</b> syndrome. To test whether nickel confers <b>tolerance</b> to other metals in this species, we used segregating nickel-tolerant and non-tolerant genetic lines and screened them for <b>tolerance</b> to 12 other metals (Co, CrIII and VI, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Mo, Pb, Se, Sn, Zn and Zr). The genetic lines were derived from crosses between individuals from an uncontaminated pasture, a copper mine (Copperopolis) and a serpentine region in California, U. S. A. The populations were initially screened for <b>tolerance</b> to Co, Cr, Hg, Ni and Zn. The serpentine population exhibited the highest <b>tolerance</b> to nickel and the Copperopolis population showed the highest chromium <b>tolerance.</b> Individuals from the Copperopolis mine and serpentine populations that showed high <b>tolerance</b> to nickel were crossed to a non-tolerant (CL 40) and between each other to obtain the F 1 generation and the progeny were screened for <b>tolerance</b> to the 12 metals. The copper mine's F 1 generation exhibited <b>tolerance</b> to Cu and Zn, and those derived from the serpentine to Mo and Zn. High nickel tolerants from the F 1 population were then backcrossed to segregate the nickel <b>tolerance</b> character. Segregating tolerant and non-tolerant lines were re-tested for <b>tolerance</b> to 12 metals to analyse for co-tolerance to nickel. The results showed that nickel <b>tolerance</b> does not confer pleiotropic <b>tolerance</b> to any of the metals tested. The <b>tolerance</b> to other metals observed in the F 1 generation is therefore the result of independent gene(s). The data suggest that <b>tolerance</b> to many metals in M. guttatus is due to multiple metal <b>tolerance</b> which is caused by independent genetic mechanisms for specific metals.

40|$|AbstractMachine {{tool spindle}} {{is among the}} most precise {{components}} which require both high accuracy and high repeatability. It has been an issue how to distribute components’ <b>tolerances</b> in order to reduce production cost while keep the <b>tolerance</b> target under control. This paper investigates the method for <b>tolerance</b> re-distribution of a spindle in order to keep its high assembly <b>tolerance.</b> The dimensional chain of the spindle is first constructed to analyze the assembly <b>tolerance.</b> While the assembly <b>tolerance</b> is out of the target, the reverse process that re-distributes the target <b>tolerance</b> to each component is investigated such that the target can be satisfied and controlled. Tightening <b>tolerances</b> of spindle parts is the most straightforward approach to reduce the assembly <b>tolerance</b> that, however, increases manufacturing cost. An approach to re-distribute the components’ <b>tolerance</b> based on the IT precision grade is then assigned and analyzed. This approach, however, still fails to achieve the required <b>tolerance</b> target. The “negative tolerancing” approach is then employed. The retaining ring of the spindle severs as the adjusting component which carries “negative tolerance” to compensate the assembly <b>tolerance.</b> The result shows that the <b>tolerance</b> target can be achieved using this approach without paying high manufacturing cost...|$|R

50|$|Almost all {{engineering}} drawings (except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches) communicate {{not only}} geometry (shape and location) but also {{dimensions and tolerances}} for those characteristics. Several systems of dimensioning and <b>tolerancing</b> have evolved. The simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points (such as an object's length or width, or hole center locations). Since the advent of well-developed interchangeable manufacture, these distances have been accompanied by tolerances of the plus-or-minus or min-and-max-limit types. Coordinate dimensioning involves defining all points, lines, planes, and profiles in terms of Cartesian coordinates, with a common origin. Coordinate dimensioning was the sole best option until the post-World War II era saw the development of geometric dimensioning and <b>tolerancing</b> (GD&T), which departs from the limitations of coordinate dimensioning (e.g., rectangular-only tolerance zones, tolerance stacking) to allow the most logical <b>tolerancing</b> of both geometry and dimensions (that is, both form shapes/locations and sizes).|$|E
