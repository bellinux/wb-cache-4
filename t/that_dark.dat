5|$|Pioneer 11 {{made the}} first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet {{and a few of}} its moons, {{although}} their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, Pioneer 11 measured the temperature of Titan.|$|E
5|$|The PC and Macintosh {{versions}} of Star Wars: Dark Forces were well received, with the MS-DOS version holding an aggregate score on GameRankings of 77%. Publications compared Dark Forces to Doom, a significant video {{game in the}} first-person shooter genre at the time, but also indicated <b>that</b> <b>Dark</b> Forces improved upon Dooms features. Criticisms {{tended to focus on}} the game being too short, as well as lacking a multiplayer feature.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Samus awakens {{aboard a}} Galactic Federation starship, where she learns <b>that</b> <b>Dark</b> Samus's Phazon-based attacks have {{corrupted}} her. The Federation equips her {{suit with a}} Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine {{what happened to her}} missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the Leviathan Seeds; and that she must destroy the seeds to reverse this.|$|E

5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E

25|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{standard}} model of cosmology is correct, the best current measurements indicate <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> energy contributes 68.3% of the total energy in the present-day observable universe. The mass–energy of dark matter and ordinary (baryonic) matter contribute 26.8% and 4.9%, respectively, and other components such as neutrinos and photons contribute a very small amount.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in places where}} there is {{relatively}} little matter, as in the voids between galactic superclusters, this theory predicts <b>that</b> the <b>dark</b> fluid relaxes and acquires a negative pressure. Thus dark fluid becomes a repulsive force, with an effect similar to <b>that</b> of <b>dark</b> energy.|$|R

25|$|In October, EB Games and GameStop {{websites}} {{changed the}} release dates {{for the game}} to January 2004. Interplay initially denied the delay, stating it was still aiming for a fourth quarter release, and would distribute the game themselves if need be. On November 6, Interplay announced it had resolved its legal dispute with Vivendi, and had returned to their prior distribution agreement. On November 12, they officially confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Dark</b> Alliance II would be delayed until early 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{resistance}} to cold injury hypothesis claimed <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> skin was selected against in cold climates far from the equator and in higher altitudes as dark skin was more affected by frostbite. It {{has been found that}} reaction of the skin to extreme cold climates has actually more to do with other aspects, such as the distribution of connective tissue and distribution of fat, and with the responsiveness of peripheral capillaries to differences in temperature, and not with pigmentation.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{surviving}} {{records of}} Tutankhamun's final days. What caused Tutankhamun's death {{has been the}} subject of considerable debate. Major studies have been conducted in an effort to establish the cause of death. There is some evidence, advanced by Harvard microbiologist Ralph Mitchell, that his burial may have been hurried. Mitchell reported <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> brown splotches on the decorated walls of Tutankhamun's burial chamber suggested that he had been entombed even before the paint had a chance to dry.|$|E

25|$|All {{modern humans}} {{share a common}} {{ancestor}} who lived around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Comparisons between known skin pigmentation genes in chimpanzees and modern Africans show <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> skin evolved along {{with the loss of}} body hair about 1.2 million years ago and that this common ancestor had dark skin. Investigations into dark skinned populations in South Asia and Melanesia indicate that skin pigmentation in these populations is due to the preservation of this ancestral state and not due to new variations on a previously lightened population.|$|E
25|$|Lambda (λ), {{commonly}} known as the cosmological constant, describes the ratio of the density of dark energy to the critical energy density of the universe, given certain reasonable assumptions such as positing <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> energy density is a constant. In terms of Planck units, and as a natural dimensionless value, the cosmological constant, λ, is on the order of 10−122. This is so small that it has no significant effect on cosmic structures that are smaller than a billion light-years across. If the cosmological constant were not extremely small, stars and other astronomical structures {{would not be able to}} form.|$|E
25|$|The name 'spiders' {{was coined}} by Malin Space Science Systems personnel, the {{developers}} of the camera. One {{of the first}} and most interesting spider photos was found by Greg Orme in October 2000. The unusual shape and appearance of these 'spider webs' and spots caused a lot of speculation about their origin. The first years' surveillance showed that during the following Martian years, 70% of the spots appear at exactly the same place, and a preliminary statistical study obtained between September 1999 and March 2005, indicated <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> dune spots and spiders are related phenomena as functions of the cycle of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice condensation and sublimation.|$|E

25|$|Another {{group of}} {{hypotheses}} contended <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> skin pigmentation developed as antibacterial protection against tropical infectious diseases and parasites. Although {{it is true}} that eumelanin has antibacterial properties, its importance is secondary as a physical absorbed to protect against UVR induced damage. This hypothesis is not consistent with the evidence that most of the hominid evolution took place in savanna environment and not in tropical rainforests. Humans living in hot and sunny environments have darker skin than humans who live in wet and cloudy environments. The antimicrobial hypothesis also does not explain why some populations (like the Inuit or Tibetans) who live far from the tropics and are exposed to high UVR have darker skin pigmentation than their surrounding populations.|$|E

Nako {{is also a very}} skilled cellist, and may prove to one day be famous. The day she found Kurumi was the day she gave her first kiss, and from then on was the new master of Steel Angel Kurumi. Now being the receiver of the same affection that was given to her great ancestor Nakahito, Nako is constantly chased and protected by Kurumi.|$|E
25|$|An {{abundance}} of clinical and epidemiological evidence supports that light skin pigmentation developed {{due to the}} importance of maintaining vitamin D3 production in the skin. Dark skin pigmentation was the original condition for the genus Homo and has been maintained for populations in areas of high UV radiation through human evolutionary history. As a consequence, {{there must have been a}} strong selective pressure for the evolution of light skin in areas of low UV radiation. The evidence <b>that</b> <b>dark</b> skin evolved as a protection against the effect of UV radiation is overwhelming, and research shows that eumelanin protects against both folate depletion and direct damage to DNA. This accounts for the development of dark skin pigmentation of people living near the equator but does not account for the increasingly lighter-skinned people living outside the tropics.|$|E
