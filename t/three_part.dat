5|$|Lessons {{depicts a}} mother {{teaching}} her son. Presumably, {{many of the}} events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth. Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: Lessons for Children of two to three (1778); Lessons for Children of <b>three,</b> <b>part</b> I (1778); Lessons for Children of <b>three,</b> <b>part</b> II (1778); and Lessons for Children of three to four (1779). After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.|$|E
5|$|This list {{is drawn}} from {{graduates}} of the Naval Academy who became astronauts. The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The first alumnus to fly as an astronaut was Alan Shepard, class of 1945. As of June 2017, the most recent alumni to complete astronaut training was Nicole Mann, class of 1999. Kayla Barron, class of 2010 was selected as an astronaut candidate in June 2017, but has not yet completed her training. Two alumni were part of Project Mercury, <b>three</b> <b>part</b> of Project Gemini, seven part of the Apollo program, three have walked on the moon, one {{was part of the}} Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and forty-two were part of the Space Shuttle program.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} element {{in the emergence of}} a Scottish national history was an interest in antiquarianism, with figures like John Pinkerton (1758–1826) collecting sources such as ballads, coins, medals, songs and artefacts. Enlightenment historians had tended to react with embarrassment to Scottish history, particularly the feudalism of the Middle Ages and the religious intolerance of the Reformation. In contrast many historians of the early nineteenth century rehabilitated these areas as suitable for serious study. Lawyer and antiquarian Cosmo Innes, who produced works on Scotland in the Middle Ages (1860), and Sketches of Early Scottish History (1861), has been likened to the pioneering history of Georg Heinrich Pertz, one of the first writers to collate the major historical accounts of German history. Patrick Fraser Tytler's nine-volume history of Scotland (1828–43), particularity his sympathetic view of Mary, Queen of Scots, have led to comparisons with Leopold von Ranke, considered the father of modern scientific historical writing. Tytler was co-founder with Scott of the Bannatyne Society in 1823, which helped further the course of historical research in Scotland. Thomas M'Crie's (1797–1875) biographies of John Knox and Andrew Melville, figures generally savaged in the Enlightenment, helped rehabilitate their reputations. W. F. Skene's (1809–92) <b>three</b> <b>part</b> study of Celtic Scotland (1886–91) was the first serious investigation of the region and helped spawn the Scottish Celtic Revival. Issues of race became important, with Pinkerton, James Sibbald (1745–1803) and John Jamieson (1758–1839) subscribing to a theory of Picto-Gothicism, which postulated a Germanic origin for the Picts and the Scots language.|$|E

The <b>three</b> <b>part</b> Lemon test had its basis in the jurisprudence of Abington v.

Its {{two rows of}} seats were enclosed under a <b>three</b> <b>part</b> canopy which merged at the rear into the raised fuselage. There was a wide door on either side for cabin access and a separate baggage space behind the seats. It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage with the mainwheels, fitted with brakes, behind the engines. The nosewheel was steerable. The undercarriage, like the flaps and airbrakes, were hydraulically powered.|$|E
25|$|Open {{clusters}} {{are often}} classified {{according to a}} scheme developed by Robert Trumpler in 1930. The Trumpler scheme gives a cluster a <b>three</b> <b>part</b> designation, with a Roman numeral from I-IV indicating its concentration and detachment from the surrounding star field (from strongly to weakly concentrated), an Arabic numeral from 1 to 3 indicating the range in brightness of members (from small to large range), and p, m or r to indication whether the cluster is poor, medium or rich in stars. An 'n' is appended if the cluster lies within nebulosity.|$|E

25|$|Mimicry is {{a unique}} form of defense and {{describes}} when a species resembles another recognized by natural enemies, giving it protection against predators. The superficial resemblance among mimics does not necessarily denote common ancestry. Mimicry works {{if and only if}} predators are able to learn from eating distasteful species. It is a <b>three</b> <b>part</b> system that involves a model species, a mimic of that species, and a predatory observer that acts as a selective agent. If learning is to be successful, then all models, mimics, and predators must co-exist, a notion feasible within the context of geographic sympatry.|$|E
25|$|The oldest, the Regius poem, {{is unique}} in being set in verse. The rest, of which over a hundred survive, usually have a <b>three</b> <b>part</b> construction. They start with a prayer, {{invocation}} of God, or a general declaration, followed by {{a description of the}} Seven Liberal Arts (logic, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), extolling Geometry above the others. There follows a history of the craft, and how it came to the British Isles, usually culminating in a general assembly of masons during the reign of King Athelstan. The last part consists of the charges or regulations of the lodge, and the craft of masonry in general, which the members are bound to maintain.|$|E
25|$|This pattern goes on {{for some}} time, until the Super Bowl comes up and Tender's agent plans him an {{elaborate}} wedding to take place at half-time, following which, Tender will issue another miraculous prediction. Tender goes wandering around, trying {{to meet up with}} Fertility, which he finally does in a men's bathroom where they've taken adjacent stalls. Adam appears then with a gun, and reveals that he's already laid a trap to kill Tender's agent the same way he killed the caseworker, so that Tender would be suspect for both murders. Fertility confirms that the agent will die the next day at the Super Bowl, and comes up with a plan for Tender to make a prediction big enough to distract the police long enough for him to escape. Adam, intending this all along, plans to escape with Tender and Fertility. Agreed on their course of action, the <b>three</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
