5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson showed that <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> facet {{patterns on the}} teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} line opened on 22 July 1847, <b>the</b> <b>Wear</b> Valley Railway absorbed the Shildon Tunnel, Bishop Auckland & Weardale Railway, Weardale Extension Railway and Wear & Derwent Railway {{and then the}} S leased <b>the</b> <b>Wear</b> Valley Railway and Middlesbrough & Redcar Railways for 999 years.

No dividend was paid in 1848 and the next few years; lease payments were made out of reserves. The S announced a bill in November 1848 to permit a lease by and amalgamation with the YN, but this was withdrawn after the YN share price crashed and its chairman Hudson resigned after questions were raised about his share dealings. In 1850 the S had share capital of £250,000 but owed £650,000, most of this without the authority of Parliament until 1849; the debt was converted into shares in 1851.|$|E

5|$|The high-crowned sudamericids were {{probably}} herbivores, but the lower-crowned Ferugliotherium was more probably an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which {{is thought to}} have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard plant parts, such as seeds. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> patterns on Ferugliotherium teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.|$|E
5|$|With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium {{may have}} been an {{insectivore}} or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> on Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are thought to have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are thought to have evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 because of <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> on the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger {{angle of elevation}} for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E

5|$|Cognizant of his {{increasing}} age and <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping {{to keep him}} fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded {{the question of}} whether or not, and to what degree, Heterodontosaurus showed the continuous tooth replacement that is typical for other dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known at that time lacked any indications of continuous tooth replacement: The cheek teeth of the known skulls are worn uniformly, indicating that they formed simultaneously. Newly erupted teeth are absent. Further evidence was derived from <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> facets of the teeth, which were formed by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> facets were merged into one another, forming a continuous surface along the complete tooth row. This surface indicates that food procession was achieved by back and forth movements of the jaws, not by simple vertical movements which was the case in related dinosaurs such as Fabrosaurus. Back and forth movements are only possible if the teeth are worn uniformly, again strengthening the case for the lack of a continuous tooth replacement. Simultaneously, Thulborn stressed that a regular tooth replacement was essential for these animals, as the supposed diet consisting of tough plant material would have led to quick abrasion of the teeth. These observations led Thulborn to conclude that Heterodontosaurus must have replaced its entire set of teeth at once on a regular basis. Such a complete replacement could only have been possible within phases of aestivation, when the animal did not fed. Aestivation also complies with the supposed habitat of the animals, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when food was scarce.|$|E

5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper incisors (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors {{because they have a}} less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.|$|E
5|$|S. validum {{is known}} from the late Late Cretaceous Belly River Group (the Canadian {{equivalent}} to the Judith River Group in the US), and specimens have been recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation (late Campanian, 76.5 to 75 mya) in Dinosaur Provincial Park (including the lectotype specimen), and the Oldman Formation (middle Campanian, 77.5 to 76.5 mya) of Alberta, Canada. The pachycephalosaurs Hanssuesia and Foraminacephale are also known from both formations. S. novomexicanum is {{known from the}} Fruitland (late Campanian, about 75 mya) and lower Kirtland Formation (late Campanian, about 74 mya) of New Mexico, and if this species correctly belongs in Stegoceras, the genus {{would have had a}} broad geographic distribution. The presence of similar pachycephalosaurs in both the west and north of North America during the latest Cretaceous shows that they were {{an important part of the}} dinosaur faunas there. It has traditionally been suggested that pachycehalosaurs inhabited mountain environments; wear of their skulls was supposedly a result of them having been rolled by water from upland areas, and comparisons with bighorn sheep reinforced the theory. In 2014, Jordan C. Mallon and Evans disputed this idea, as <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> and original locations of the skulls is not consistent with having been transported in such a way, and they instead proposed that North American pachycephalosaurs inhabited alluvial (associated with water) and coastal plain environments.|$|E
5|$|The diet of oviraptorids {{has been}} {{interpreted}} in various ways since the time Oviraptor was wrongly {{thought to have been}} a predator of eggs. It has been suggested that oviraptorosaurs as a whole were herbivores, which is supported by the gastroliths (stomach stones) found in Caudipteryx, and <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> facets in the teeth of Incisivosaurus. In 2010 Longrich and colleagues found that oviraptorid jaws had features similar to those seen in herbivorous tetrapods (four-limbed animals), especially those of dicynodonts, an extinct group of synapsid stem-mammals. Oviraptorids and dicynodonts share features such as short, deep, and toothless mandibles; elongated dentary symphyses; elongated mandibular fenestrae; and a downwards-projecting bar in the palate. Modern animals with jaws that resemble those of oviraptorids include parrots and tortoises; the latter group also has tooth-like projections on their premaxillae. Longrich and colleagues concluded that due to the similarities between oviraptorids and herbivorous animals, the bulk of their diet would most likely have been formed by plant matter. Oviraptorids are found at high frequencies in the formations they are known from, similar to the pattern seen in dinosaurs that are known to be herbivorous; these animals were more abundant than carnivorous dinosaurs, as more energy was available at their lower trophic level in the food chain. The jaws of oviraptorids may have been specialised for processing food, such as xerophytic vegetation (adapted for environments with little water), that would have grown in their environment, but this is not possible to demonstrate, as {{little is known about the}} flora of the area at the time. A 2013 study by Lü and colleagues found that oviraptorids appear to have retained their hind limb proportions throughout ontogeny (growth), which is also a pattern mainly seen in herbivorous animals.|$|E

25|$|The coal {{export trade}} from <b>the</b> <b>Wear</b> {{was slow to}} develop, but by the seventeenth century there was a {{thriving}} trade in exporting coal from the Durham coalfield via the River Wear.
