40|$|The {{relationship}} between UK SMEs and their bankers {{has been the}} subject of considerable debate over the years. The literature suggests that one area of concern is UK banks adopting a security-based approach <b>to</b> <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> SMEs. The literature also suggests that European banks ‘do it differently’. Given the considerable number of overseas financial institutions operating in the UK, the research reported here aimed to find out whether European banks in the UK were <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> UK SMEs and, if they were, what approach they adopted <b>to</b> <b>lending</b> practice. The data for the research study was collected via interviews with the bankers concerned using the methodology previously adopted by Berry et al. (1993 b). The study found that only 10 European banks were active in <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> UK SMEs and that these European banks adopted a mixture of approaches <b>to</b> SME <b>lending.</b> The implications of this are that the European banks are unlikely to provide the sort of influence that was apparent from the US banks in the 1970 s and 1980 s in the large corporate lending sector, either by way of any real competition to the UK banks in the SME sector of lending or through indirect influence via different approaches <b>to</b> <b>lending</b> practice...|$|R

5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth {{has argued}} that the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case {{primarily}} on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary.

A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet.

The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 am on 30 August the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.|$|E
