50|$|Several other {{vertical}} boilers, {{such as the}} Straker, {{had similar}} arrangements for lifting their shells off the <b>tube</b> <b>nest.</b> The Sentinel though left the outer shell in place and instead dropped the <b>tube</b> <b>nest</b> downwards (having first removed the ashpan). This had the advantages that it required simpler lifting gear: the waggon would be raised on ramps or over a pit, the bolts removed and then the tube bank lowered with a block and tackle from a fixed beam, without requiring a mobile crane that could lift it and then move it sideways. Secondly the many pipe connections to the outer shell were left undisturbed, making the operation quicker.|$|E

In total, 60 red foxes and coyotes from three different locations were tested with both molecular methods and the sedimentation and counting technique (SCT) or intestinal scraping technique (IST). Though {{based on a}} limited number of samples, it could be established that the magnetic capture based DNA extraction followed by qPCR showed similar sensitivity and specificity as the currently used phenol-chloroform DNA extraction followed by single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> PCR. All methods have a high specificity as shown by Bayesian latent class analysis. Both molecular assays have higher sensitivities than the combined SCT and IST, though the uncertainties in sensitivity estimates were wide for all assays tested. The magnetic capture based DNA extraction followed by qPCR has the advantage of not requiring hazardous chemicals like the phenol-chloroform DNA extraction followed by single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> PCR.

Although tuberculosis can be treated by a six-month course of antibiotics, the prevalence of extensively drug-resistance TB (XDR-TB) made the disease becomes a global health problem. In addition to the conventional MTB detection methods, molecular methods become significant in drug resistant MTB detection which can enhance effective drug treatment. In this study, 200 MTB respiratory specimens were collected from patients with suspected tuberculosis in Tuen Mun Hospital in Hong Kong. Based on the culture method as a gold standard for MTB detection, the presence of MTB in clinical samples was determined by IS 6110 single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> real-time PCR. In addition, by using High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis, the presence of mutant type KatG 315 gene for detecting isoniazid resistant MTB was determined. Among 66 MTB culture positive samples, 10 samples had positive acid fast bacilli (AFB) smears giving the diagnostic sensitivity 15. 1 %. IS 6110 single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> PCR was amplified in 51 specimens giving 77. 2 % MTB detection sensitivity and 97. 8 % specificity. Among 51 samples positive for IS 6110 PCR, 66. 7 % showed successful amplification in subsequent KatG-HRM assay. Two samples were confirmed to be isoniazid (INH) resistance in Public Health Laboratory Centre (PHLC). However, {{there was only one}} sample showing detectable KatG 315 mutation in clinical specimen by using HRM while the other was only detected in the corresponding culture isolate.

40|$|The red {{mason bee}} Osmia rufa is a solitary bee {{belonging}} to the family Megachilidae, and is prone to nest in aggregations. Each female builds a nest separately in pre-existing cavities such as holes in wood and walls or empty plant stems. This is done by successively setting the cells in a linear series. In this study, we elucidate the nesting behavior and the reproductive potential of a single O. rufa female. The reproductive potential of nesting females was evaluated after the offspring finished development. We observed that an individual female may colonize up to five <b>nest</b> <b>tubes</b> and build 5 - 34 cells in them (16 on an average). During the nesting time the number of cells decreased with the sequence of <b>nest</b> <b>tubes</b> colonized by one female, which built a maximum of 11 cells in the first occupied nest and 5 cells in the last (fifth nest).

The key advance in this paper is that calculations were conducted with a representative condenser pressure gradient caused by the temperature variation inside the condenser <b>tube</b> <b>nest.</b> It is shown that accurately modelling the exit boundary calculation has a large influence on the flow structure and a smaller influence on the pressure recovery inside the exhaust diffuser.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB), {{a severe}} disease caused by Mycobacteria {{tuberculosis}} (MTb), remains a globally severe health problem. In modern days, emergence of drug resistant TB {{is a new}} threat to public health since {{it can lead to}} treatment failure, increased transmission of TB to other hosts and further development of drug resistant complications. The traditional diagnostic method for TB by Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear and Löwenstein–Jensen medium (LJ) culture are poor in sensitivity and time consuming respectively. There is a need for rapid diagnosis and identification of MTb. Nucleic acid amplification like PCR and real-time PCR are options for rapid diagnosis. However, such techniques require sophisticated technique and complex equipment. The high cost would constitute a barrier for countries with a high demand but only limited resources. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is a novel technique, proven by many studies as to its high sensitivity and highly specificity to MTb. Most importantly, LAMP assay is economical and affordable by developing countries. The first objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of LAMP assay. The specificity of LAMP assay was determined by performing LAMP assay on 19 clinical isolates, which had already been identified previously. The clinical isolates included 14 mycobacteria tuberculosis complex (MTb), and five mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) strains that were positive for AFB smear and LJ culture but negative for IS 6110 single-tube nested real time PCR. The specificity was 100 %. The analytical sensitivity as well as the limit of detection (LOD) were determined by testing on a duplicate set of serial DNA dilution, where each duplicate consisted of dilution of 100, 000, 10, 000, 1000, 300, 100, 10 and 1 colony forming unit/milliliter (CFU/ml). The LOD of LAMP assay was about 3 CFU per reaction. The second objective of this study evaluated the diagnostic performance of LAMP assay against AFB culture and IS 6110 single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> real time PCR for identification of MTb in 200 respiratory specimens from 123 patients. All the specimens have already been tested for IS 6110 single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> real time PCR, and culture results and AFB smears results have been obtained for all the specimens. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of three diagnostic methods (AFB smear microscopy, LAMP assay amplification and IS 6110 single-tube nested real time PCR) were calculated with 95 % confidence interval using LJ culture as gold standard. The LAMP assay had a sensitivity of 80 %, specificity of 92. 6 %, PPV of 60 % and NPV of 97. 1 %. However, MTb might fail to grow on the LJ culture medium for various reasons, for instance, MTb might already be dead after antibiotic treatment of the patient, or there might be poor laboratory practices during the processing of the specimens. Since the LJ culture method could produce false negatives in the situations described above, an alternative to the LJ culture method, ‘Hybrid Method’ was used as the gold standard. Under this method, a specimen was regarded as positive if the LJ culture result was positive. On the other hand, if a specimen generated a negative result using the LJ culture method, the results from the LAMP assay and IS 6110 nested real time PCR would be considered, i. e., if both the LAMP assay and IS 6110 nested real time PCR gave positive results while the results of LJ culture were negative, the specimen was referred to be positive in this case. In other words, a specimen would be regarded as negative if and only if the LJ culture result was negative and at least one of the LAMP assay or IS 6110 was negative at the same time. Along the same line, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the three diagnostic methods (AFB smear microscopy, LAMP assay amplification and IS 6110 single-tube nested real time PCR) were calculated with 95 % confidence interval against the Hybrid Method. After resolution, the LAMP assay had a sensitivity of 87. 0 %, specificity of 100 %, PPV of 100 % and NPV of 97. 1 %. Our results showed that the LAMP assay has a great potential to be a new TB diagnostic test, especially in developing countries, with its lot of advantages like ease of use, cheap and fast. The LAMP assay in the study showed a high specificity, however, the sensitivity has to be improved before application in clinical use. For comparison of clinical performance, IS 6110 single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> real time PCR had a higher sensitivity than that of LAMP assay (100 % vs 80 % using culture as gold standard; 100 % vs 87 % using ‘Hybrid Method’ as gold standard). However, LAMP assay had a higher specificity than that of IS 6110 single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> real time PCR (92. 6 % vs 90. 7 % using culture as gold standard; 100 % vs 98 % using ‘Hybrid Method’ as gold standard). LAMP had been proven to be a potential and powerful tool in clinical diagnosis of MTb. Further improvement on its sensitivity is required to enable its extensive use in the clinic in the future. published_or_final_versionMedical SciencesMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R
50|$|In a {{stationary}} vortex, the typical streamline (a line that is everywhere tangent to the flow velocity vector) is a closed loop surrounding the axis; and each vortex line (a line that is everywhere tangent to the vorticity vector) is roughly {{parallel to the}} axis. A surface that is everywhere tangent to both flow velocity and vorticity is called a vortex tube. In general, vortex <b>tubes</b> are <b>nested</b> around the axis of rotation. The axis itself {{is one of the}} vortex lines, a limiting case of a vortex tube with zero diameter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pathogenic Leptospira spp. {{present in}} the blood of {{patients}} with leptospirosis {{during the first week of}} symptoms can be detected using culture or PCR. A proportion of patients who are positive by PCR are negative by culture. Leptospira spp. are fastidious bacteria, and we hypothesized that a false-negative culture result may represent infection with a distinct bacterial subset that fail to grow in standard culture medium. Methods We evaluated our hypothesis during a prospective study of 418 consecutive patients presenting to a hospital in northeast Thailand with an acute febrile illness. Admission blood samples were taken for Leptospira culture and PCR. A single <b>tube</b> <b>nested</b> PCR that amplified a region of the rrs gene was developed and applied, amplicons sequenced and a phylogenetic tree reconstructed. Results 39 / 418 (9 %) patients were culture-positive for Leptospira spp., and 81 / 418 (19 %) patients were culture-negative but rrs PCR-positive. The species associated with culture-positive leptospirosis (37 L. interrogans and 2 L. borgpetersenii) were comparable to those associated with culture-negative, PCR-positive leptospirosis (76 L. interrogans, 4 L. borgpetersenii, 1 unidentified, possibly new species). Conclusion Molecular speciation failed to identify a unique bacterial subset in patients with culture-negative, PCR-positive leptospirosis. The rate of false-negative culture was high, and we speculate that antibiotic pre-treatment is the most likely explanation for this. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{high-resolution}} transmission {{electron microscopy}} (HREM) studies of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) reveal a class of defects analogous to edge dislocations in a crystal. These defects are believed to mark the transition from scrolls on one side to <b>nested</b> <b>tubes</b> on the other. On the tube side, layer spacing becomes irregular. Analysis of the helicity of the tubes shows {{a strong correlation between}} diameter and helicity. This suggests that the organizing principle for the tubes is not Van der Waals forces, {{as in the case of}} graphite or turbostratic carbon, but preservation of helicity. Based on these observations and total energy calculations, the authors speculate that graphene monolayers initially form scrolls and subsequently transform into multiwall nanotubes through the progression of defects. Scrolls and <b>nested</b> <b>tubes</b> thus coexist within a single MWNT. 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
