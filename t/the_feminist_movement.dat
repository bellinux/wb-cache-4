5|$|<b>The</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> has {{effected}} {{change in}} Western society, including women's suffrage; {{greater access to}} education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); {{and the right to}} own property.|$|E

Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E
5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movement.</b> The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between the Brazilian Women's Policy Agency (WPA), the Secretaria Especial de Politicas para as Mulheres- SPM (the Special Secretariat for Public Policies for Women), and <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> in two policy debates in 2003 - 2006. This study analyses the level of policy impact <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> had through <b>the</b> SPM in two contrasting case studies, abortion and Violence against Women (VA W). These cases were selected because they were both considered high priority for <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movements,</b> and they both received government attention prior to, and during 2003 - 2006. However, they differed substantially in the level of contentiousness, which indicated different probabilities for movements' success. Loosely informed by the Research Network on Gender and the State (RNGS) framework, this study explores <b>the</b> interaction between <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> and, <b>the</b> SPM through focussing on the policy environment, the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movements,</b> and <b>the</b> activities and characteristics of the SPM. My findings are based upon primary and secondary source material, including elite interviews, participant observations and the analysis of academic and activist material. In <b>the</b> abortion debate, <b>feminists</b> gained access to, and impacted upon the policy debates about decriminalization, though the partnership between the SPM and the movements did not result in a change of policy. In the case of VAW however, the SPM facilitated the creation of Brazil's first law regulating V A W. I conclude that although the SPM was less able to enable <b>feminist</b> impact in <b>the</b> abortion debate than in V A W, I nevertheless argue that the SPM secured a high level of feminist impact on policy debates in both cases...|$|R

5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Murray had no {{experience}} in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos. Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues {{with some of the}} male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movement)</b> led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.|$|E

5|$|On {{returning}} to London, Murray took {{an active role}} in <b>the</b> <b>feminist</b> <b>movement,</b> volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations, protests, and marches. Joining the Women's Social and Political Union, she was present at large marches like the Mud March of 1907 and the Women's Coronation Procession of June 1911. She concealed the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia. Murray also pushed the professional boundaries for women throughout her own career, and mentored other women in archaeology and throughout academia. As women could not use the men's common room, she successfully campaigned for UCL to open a common room for women, and later ensured that a larger, better-equipped room was converted for the purpose; it was later renamed the Margaret Murray Room. At UCL, she became a friend of fellow female lecturer Winifred Smith, and together they campaigned to improve the status and recognition of women in the university, with Murray becoming particularly annoyed at female staff who were afraid of upsetting or offending the male university establishment with their demands. Feeling that students should get nutritious yet affordable lunches, for many years she sat on the UCL Refectory Committee.|$|E
