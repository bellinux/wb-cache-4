40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an investigation of}} radar penetration imaging using ultra wideband (UWB) <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> waveforms from both theoretical and signal processing points of view. The principles governing the operation of a UWB <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar are discussed, including the analytical description of a UWB Gaussian process, the mathematical model and {{the implementation of a}} correlation receiver, and the range-Doppler resolution in <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar imaging. To address the problem of foliage penetration (FOPEN) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, a statistical-physical model for foliage transmission is developed and validated. Foliage obscuration impact on SAR images is analyzed by means of the paired-echo method. A comparative study between step-frequency and <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> SAR imaging is made to demonstrate the suitability of a <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar to be deployed as a FOPEN SAR. An experimental UWB <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar system is developed and field tested. In the signal processing aspect; a range sidelobe suppression technique called apodization filtering is developed to adopt the uncharacteristic point spread function (PSF) of a UWB <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar. The unique features for UWB radar penetration imaging are discussed and a 2 -D FOPEN <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> SAR imaging model is established. Based on this model, FOPEN <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> SAR image formation and processing techniques are developed. The impact of frequency and aspect dependent target signatures on the SAR images are studied. More dedicated image processing techniques in terms of better target detection, discrimination and identification, are also investigated. These include three-dimensional (3 -D) interferometric inverse SAR (ISAR) imaging technique and image resolution enhancement deploying spatially variant apodization (SVA) with various applications. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} use of <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar techniques to detect, localize and identify shallow buried subsurface objects, especially mines and mine-like targets. A novel polarimetric <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) system has been designed, fabricated and tested at UNL. Stokes vector-based polarimetric techniques are applied for data processing. This dissertation presents {{a review of the}} existing GPR systems, their salient features and limitations, fundamentals of electromagnetic theory for GPR applications, the <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar technique and its theoretical considerations, and the system test results using <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> polarimetry. ^ This novel polarimetric <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar system transmits the wide bandwidth <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> signal in the 1 - 2 GHz frequency range. Detection and localization of buried objects is accomplished by correlating the reflected waveform with a time-delayed replica of the transmitted waveform. Broadband dual-polarized log-periodic antennas are used for transmission and reception. A unique signal processing scheme is used to inject coherence into the system by frequency translation of the ultra-wideband signal by a coherent 160 MHz phase-locked source prior to performing heterodyne correlation. System coherence allows the extraction of the polarimetric amplitude and phase characteristics of a target. The raw data images and Stokes matrix and polarimetric factor images are presented to demonstrate results of the experimental study. ...|$|R

A datacube acquired using a Short Wave Infrared Full Spectrum Imager II for target detection application of hyperspectral data was tested. The impact was evaluated using both the statistical based measures and a remote sensing application. The evaluation results show that compression on radiance data after removal of <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> produces better reconstruction fidelity and much higher evaluation scores for the remote sensing application than compression on radiance data without removal of <b>random</b> <b>noise.</b> The evaluation results indicate that <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> of radiance data should be removed before compression, if data compression is applied on radiance data onboard.

This study analyzed existing denoising methods used in seismic exploration {{from the perspective of}} <b>random</b> <b>noise.</b> Wavelet thresholding offers a new approach to reducing <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> in simulation results, synthetic data, and real data. A modified wavelet threshold function was developed by considering the merits and demerits of conventional soft and hard thresholding schemes. A MATLAB (matrix laboratory) simulation model was used to compare the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and mean square errors (MSEs) of the soft, hard, and modified threshold functions. The results demonstrated that the modified threshold function can avoid the pseudo-Gibbs phenomenon and produce a higher SNR than the soft and hard threshold functions. A seismic convolution model was built using seismic wavelets to verify the effectiveness of different denoising methods. The model was used to demonstrate that the modified thresholding scheme can effectively reduce <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> in seismic data and retain the desired signal. The application of the proposed tool to a real raw seismogram recorded during a land seismic exploration experiment located in north China clearly demonstrated its efficiency for <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> attenuation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Large {{biological}} data sets, such as expression profiles, {{benefit from}} reduction of <b>random</b> <b>noise.</b> Principal component (PC) analysis {{has been used}} for this purpose, but it tends to remove small features as well as <b>random</b> <b>noise.</b> Results We interpreted the PCs as a mere signal-rich coordinate system and sorted the squared PC-coordinates of each row in descending order. The sorted squared PC-coordinates were compared with the distribution of the ordered squared <b>random</b> <b>noise,</b> and PC-coordinates for insignificant contributions were treated as <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> and nullified. The processed data were transformed back to the initial coordinates as noise-reduced data. To increase the sensitivity of signal capture and reduce the effects of stochastic noise, this procedure was applied to multiple small subsets of rows randomly sampled from a large data set, and the results corresponding to each row of the data set from multiple subsets were averaged. We call this procedure Row-specific, Sorted PRincipal component-guided Noise Reduction (RSPR-NR). Robust performance of RSPR-NR, measured by noise reduction and retention of small features, was demonstrated using simulated data sets. Furthermore, when applied to an actual expression profile data set, RSPR-NR preferentially increased the correlations between genes that share the same Gene Ontology terms, strongly suggesting reduction of <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> in the data set. Conclusion RSPR-NR is a robust <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> reduction method that retains small features well. It should be useful in improving the quality of large biological data sets. </p...|$|R
