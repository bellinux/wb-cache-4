40|$|A {{synthetic}} biology workflow {{is composed of}} data repositories that provide information about genetic parts, sequence-level design <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> compose these parts into circuits, visualization <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> depict these designs, genetic design <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> select parts to create systems, and modeling and simulation <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> evaluate alternative design choices. Data standards enable the ready exchange of information within such a workflow, allowing repositories and <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> be connected from a diversity of sources. The present paper describes one such workflow that utilizes, among others, the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) to describe genetic designs, the Systems Biology Markup Language to model these designs, and SBOL Visual to visualize these designs. We describe how a standard-enabled workflow {{can be used to}} produce types of design information, including multiple repositories and software tools exchanging information using a variety of data standards. Recently, the ACS Synthetic Biology journal has recommended the use of SBOL in their publications...|$|R

30|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{developed}} and used dynamical system <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> investigate the dynamic mechanisms of generation of subthreshold and phase resonance in two-dimensional linear and linearized (conductance-based) models, and we have extended these <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> include the effect of simple, but not necessarily weak, types of nonlinearities. The mechanistic analysis and the envelope-plane diagrams we developed in this paper {{provide a framework for}} the investigation of the preferred frequency responses in three-dimensional and nonlinear models. They can also be used as <b>tools</b> complementary <b>to</b> both the numerically computed and the experimentally measured impedance and phase profiles. More research is needed <b>to</b> adapt these <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> small neuronal networks.|$|R

The regime frequently used violence as a <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> hamper reform, justifying its actions as anti-RPF security measures.|$|E
5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea.

5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil {{nationalism}} is {{the conviction of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil people, a minority ethnic group in the South Asian island country of Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon), {{that they have the}} right to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea has not always existed. Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule during the nineteenth century, as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity. The revivalists, led by Arumuga Navalar, used literacy as a <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> spread Hinduism and its principles.|$|E
5|$|The Pioneer Zephyr is a {{diesel-powered}} railroad train formed {{of railroad}} cars permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies, {{built by the}} Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB), {{commonly known as the}} Burlington. The train featured extensive use of stainless steel, was originally named the Zephyr, and was meant as a promotional <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> advertise passenger rail service in the United States. The construction included innovations such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.|$|E

40|$|The {{tools and}} {{features}} of Web-based course-management systems vary (see [URL] callandonlinel, for an analysis and comparison of several commercially available systems) but typically include <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> support {{the organization of}} the course, <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> support communication, <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> support student activities such as submission of assignments and collaborative work, and 'back-office' <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> handle user registration, maintenance of user data, and, in some systems, <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> tailor the view of a course site made available to a registered user (Robson, 1999). Although many tools and features are available in such Web-based learning environments, it is not the case that instructors necessarily make use of all these tools and features. Rankin (2000) for example, notes that 'most instructors have failed {{to take full advantage of}} the growing resources available to them online'. Rankin suggests that the creation and incorporation of templates into course Web sites could be a strategy to provide instructors with a simple and effective way of developing their Web-accessible materials.

5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
