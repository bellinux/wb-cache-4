5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started <b>to</b> <b>flake</b> off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and <b>to</b> <b>flake</b> off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.|$|E

25|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{can fail}} due to inadequate strength, leading to mechanical failure, or {{due to a}} reduction in its durability. Corrosion and freeze/thaw cycles may damage poorly designed or constructed reinforced concrete. When rebar corrodes, the oxidation products (rust) expand and tends <b>to</b> <b>flake,</b> cracking the concrete and unbonding the rebar from the concrete. Typical mechanisms leading to durability problems are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|The first {{shots were}} {{performed}} during test Alpha utilizing 20 tons of HBX explosives detonated 200 feet under water. The {{purpose was to}} determine the effects of underwater shock on equipment in preparation for the larger surface shots. The crew reported the blast sounding like a large hammer hitting the ship that caused the floor to move out from under their feet and paint <b>to</b> <b>flake</b> off of piping and bulkheads.|$|E
25|$|Hand axes {{constitute}} an important group artefacts from the Acheulean. They {{are particularly important}} in open air archaeological sites (Keelley suggested that they are less common in cave sites.) Hand axes, chopping tools and trihedral picks are considered core utensils, which were commonly manufactured out of stones, blocks or rock nodules. However this grouping is problematic as these tools were often also fabricated from (large) flakes. Another common suggestion is to refer <b>to</b> <b>flake</b> tools as micro industry, {{as opposed to the}} more general size referred to as macro industry, which includes hand axes and cleavers. However, some scrapers are as big as hand axes.|$|E

2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, the paint/stain layer {{may suffer}} {{as the result}} of deterioration within the fabric of the glass itself; however, this fragile layer is at risk for other types of damage as well. [...] Painted surfaces that would have been applied to glass cold and fired on, are especially vulnerable to damage from condensation or weathering, if they were fired improperly during the production process (Vogel 2007, 7). [...] This is often the case with the fading or disappearance of fine detail, such as faces, in figural stained glass art (fig. 2). Over time, enamels can begin <b>to</b> <b>flake</b> off of glass panels, and certain types or colours of stains can discolour with continued UV exposure, all of which significantly alters the aesthetic impact of the work as a whole (Brown et al. 2002, 18-19; Vogel et al. 2007, 7).|$|E
2500|$|With a {{majority}} of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents {{under the age of}} 49 supporting legal recognition of same-sex marriages versus the opposition remaining from those over 50, the issue remains a particular divide within the Party. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has remarked that the [...] "Party is going to be torn on this issue" [...] with some constituents [...] "going <b>to</b> <b>flake</b> off". A Reuters/Ipsos survey from April 2015 found that 68% of Americans overall would attend the same-sex wedding of a loved one, with 56% of Republicans agreeing. Reuters journalist Jeff Mason remarked that [...] "Republicans who stake out strong opposition to gay marriage could be on shaky political ground if their ultimate goal is to win the White House" [...] given the divide between the social conservative stalwarts {{and the rest of the}} U.S. that opposes them.|$|E

But the flaking of stone they laughed at, till I shot an elk through and through, the flaked stone standing out and beyond, the feathered shaft sunk in its vitals, the whole tribe applauding.|$|E

Some handgun models, such as the Smith & Wesson Model 60 and the Colt M1911 pistol, can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject <b>to</b> <b>flaking,</b> peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.|$|R

You will observe {{also that}} the {{importance}} of laying the stone in the building as it lay in its bed was from the first recognised by all good northern architects, to such extent that to lay stones 'en delit,' or in a position out of their bedding, is a recognized architectural term in France, where all structural building takes its rise; and in that form of 'delit' the word gets most curiously involved with the Latin delictum and deliquium. It would occupy the time of a whole lecture if I entered into the confused relations of the words derived from lectus, liquidus, delinquo, diliquo, and deliquesco; and of the still more confused, but beautifully confused, (and enriched by confusion,) forms of idea, whether respecting morality or marble, arising out of the meanings of these words: the notions of a bed gathered or strewn for the rest, whether of rocks or men; of the various states of solidity and liquidity connected with strength, or with repose; and of the duty of staying quiet in a place, or under a law, and the mischief of leaving it, being all fastened in the minds of early builders, and of the generations of men for whom they built, by the unescapable bearing of geological laws on their life; by the ease or difficulty of splitting rocks, by the variable consistency of the fragments split, by the innumerable questions occurring practically as to bedding and cleavage in every kind of stone, from tufo to granite, and by the unseemly, or beautiful, destructive, or protective, effects of decomposition. [1] The same processes of time which cause your Oxford oolite <b>to</b> <b>flake</b> away like the leaves of a mouldering book, only warm with a glow of perpetually deepening gold the marbles of Athens and Verona; and the same laws of chemical change which reduce the granites of Dartmoor to porcelain clay, bind the sands of Coventry into stones which can be built up halfway to the sky.|$|E

Although the new paint used came in vibrant primary colors, Snow Babies had less facial detail than previous models; the paint was also less durable and prone <b>to</b> <b>flaking</b> off. Models in more varied poses were made, including children singing Christmas carols, riding polar bears, and building snowmen. New characters were also designed, and included Santa Claus, elves, penguins, and dogs.|$|R
