5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in <b>the</b> <b>damp,</b> muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard.

This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} propose {{a new type}} hybrid damper with effect of {{magnetization}} and demagnetization. <b>The</b> <b>damper</b> consists of a ball screw, electromagnets, rare-earth magnets, and a conductive disk. The core of the electromagnet is combined with the rare-earth magnet. It is called a hybrid electromagnet. <b>The</b> <b>damper</b> has a controllable damping force that is magnetized in case of positive magnetic fields created by the electromagnet, otherwise demagnetized in case of negative one.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{challenging}} to control <b>the</b> <b>damping</b> forces of magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers {{because of the}} strong nonlinearity between <b>the</b> <b>damping</b> force of an MR fluid <b>damper</b> and <b>the</b> velocity across <b>the</b> <b>damper,</b> and <b>the</b> semiactive relationship between <b>the</b> <b>damping</b> force and <b>the</b> applied voltage/current. Hence, <b>the</b> desired <b>damping</b> force ought to be generated by an MR fluid damper cannot be commanded directly, only the command voltage applied to the current driver for <b>the</b> MR <b>damper</b> can be directly controlled. In this article, the configuration of a semiactive control system with MR fluid dampers is discussed and a damper controller based on signum function for MR fluid dampers is proposed. <b>The</b> <b>damper</b> controller is used to generate and adjust the command voltage to track <b>the</b> desired <b>damping</b> force determined by the system controller based on the desired and <b>the</b> actual <b>damping</b> forces. Two key factors for controlling <b>the</b> <b>damping</b> force of an MR fluid damper through a damper controller are considered in this article: (1) tracking ability of <b>the</b> controlled <b>damping</b> force to <b>the</b> desired <b>damping</b> force, and (2) energy requirement for <b>the</b> MR fluid <b>damper.</b> <b>The</b> characteristics of <b>the</b> controlled <b>damping</b> force and its corresponding command voltage are analyzed and compared with <b>the</b> Heaviside function <b>damper</b> controller. <b>The</b> simulation {{results show that the}} signum function controller outperforms the Heaviside function controller for better damping tracking ability while requiring less energy for <b>the</b> MR <b>damper.</b> Key Words: magnetorheological fluid damper, damper controller, semiactive control, signum function...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to <b>the</b> <b>damp</b> climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E

While he was recovering, his friend Bruno Loerzer convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the Luftstreitkräfte ("air combat force") of the German army, but his request was turned down.

5|$|English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant the Test could not start until after midday. Yardley's {{decision}} was regarded as a surprise.

Jack Fingleton, a former Test team-mate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet it should have favoured the batsmen because the ball would bounce slowly from the surface. He further thought the slippery run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. <b>The</b> <b>damp</b> conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy.

5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of <b>the</b> <b>damp</b> sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. <b>The</b> <b>damp</b> climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production {{to be carried out}} without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E

Periodically they were also targeted by machine-gun fire, but it was mostly high and posed little threat.

Yet they soon realised their mistake and heavy small arms fire began again at 22:30 with North Korean activity against A and B Companies increasing significantly, which resulted in B Company suffering two killed and three wounded. The Australian right flank was now exposed and following a request from Thirlwell, Chitts detached 1 Platoon under Lieutenant John Wathen to bolster B Company. At 23:00 further artillery and mortar fire missions were ordered by the Australians against the North Koreans in response to renewed concentrations in preparation for an assault. Around the same time 8 Platoon C Company under Lieutenant Colin Townsend was sent across the bridge in the darkness to further reinforce B Company, and they dug-in on each side of the road leading to the bridge.
