5000|$|Some {{argue that}} the {{closed-off}} nature of the Chinese community and their tendency to keep to their own is actually what is hindering the Spanish society from fully integrating the Chinese—and Asians in general—as their own. As Gladys Nieto writes in “The Chinese in Spain,” the Spanish population regards “the Chinese as a closed and somewhat mysterious community.” [...] It is not a rare occurrence to encounter exaggerated stereotypes of the Chinese and prejudices that makes references to and generalizes their social organization patterns in everyday conversations. While this reasoning—the tendency of the Chinese to stick to themselves—has merit, however, it is not fair to expect immigrants to not form some kind of affiliation, some kind of community, with people from their home country, no matter what country. In a country filled with foreign-everything—foreign language, foreign culture, foreign food, foreign customs, and more—a taste of home, a hint of home, that one can get by associating at times with people and things that remind them of their home country can actually be vital to his/her willingness to integrate themselves into their new society. Feelings of homesickness and missing different aspects about one’s home country isn’t always just something one can fight off and forget about; it is something that, when not satisfied or solved, can sometimes lead to negative feelings that inhibit him/her from wanting to assimilate into the new environment. Homesickness creates feelings of anxiety, sadness, nervousness, and almost an obsession with thoughts about “home,” where “home” doesn’t just mean the physical space provided by your house, but also “what’s normal, what is routine, the larger sense of social space, because <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> help us survive.”Thus by creating an immigrant community of their own, the immigrants are trying to fight off homesickness and coping with being in an entirely new environment; {{they are trying to}} create that sense of “home” that they are undoubtedly missing. Therefore, the creation of an immigrant community and their tendency to stick by each other has to be viewed not as the immigrants’ unwillingness to integrate themselves in the new country, but rather as the immigrants’ attempts to survive in the new environment and create feelings of “home” in Spain. It might actually be their attempt to adopt to the Spanish society—it is not necessarily a refusal or rejection of the new country. In fact, homesickness can result in dejection and isolation of oneself from others; actively dealing with homesickness by interacting with people who can help revive that feeling of “home” during the long, arduous journey of acculturation, however, can help prevent such dejection and isolation, and actually facilitate the process of acceptance and integration.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Ben Hibon, with Stateless Films and Blinkink, {{created an}} {{animation}} for MTV Asia's weekly film show called MTV Screen. After {{a very good}} response, MTV Asia commissioned his company to produce a short film {{on the back of}} it. “As I was creating concepts drawings,” explains Ben Hibon, “MTV Asia was starting to plan their annual Music Awards. They then {{came up with the idea}} of ‘launching’ our project by using it to brand the show; posters, banners, trophy design and intro/bumper animations. So the brief changed from ‘short film’ to ‘branding package’ for the MTV Awards show.” It formed into a seven-minute prologue / intro animation to the world of ‘Codehunters’, an ongoing MTV/BLINKINK project launched around the MTV Asia Awards 2006 in Bangkok.This was obviously a great opportunity for the project to be in front of such a big audience. There was going to be about 400 million people watching the show! There was the challenge of making an animation that would have to work as one film, but also broken into nine scenes to be used throughout the show as a prologue animation, setting the tone, pace and style for a bigger story. Blinkink's Ben Hibon's was contacted with directing and Bart Yates producing an animation for MTV Asia to be show at the MTV Music Awards. Scriptwriting and storyboarding happened simultaneously, as the company had a very short lead time for pre-production. “We started the production based on the boards, creating concepts and artworks on the way,” Ben explains. “Production time was tight, so we had to be creative throughout the whole process, both with creation of assets, techniques and solutions. Although the vision of ‘Codehunters’ was very much defined from the start, the process of making it was very organic, which made it fun and exciting for everyone involved with the project.” European TV was full of cheap programs in the early 80s and Ben Hibon was also a big fan of European graphic-novelists like Bilal, Moebius, Mattoti or Liberatore. “I think that my inspiration lies there”, he begins, “in the middle of two totally different narrative worlds; between the more static illustrative style of the west and the fast-moving stylised techniques of the East. ‘Codehunters’ is an accumulation of those ideas, where characters and worlds are not so culturally defined; it exists in between those genres and styles.‘The main visual ideal for this film was to try to make the CG feel textured and warm, just like an inked illustration on paper,’, says Hibon. ‘We tried to create a different look by reproducing the ink lines and the hand-drawn feel directly onto the CG models. I also wanted to approach the direction/animation style differently, by applying 2D techniques to CG; not use motion capture or realistic animation, but work with stylised motions, key frames and parallaxes. I think the end result has got a definite feel; a combination of all those ideas.”The crew were going for a stylised look in the texturing and the rendering, so the use of 3D with a 2D feel created a very original finish. “It was also important for the sets desert and the city to feel vast and open. Converting to 3D allowed us to create such scale, including camera movements and depth,” explained Hibon. “The original 2D drawings for the characters were intricate and very detailed, from shapes to textures. We tried to retain those details in the modeling process, for the characters to stay truthful to their original concepts. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would have been difficult to achieve in 2D, and almost impossible to that level of detail.”The modeling and the texturing of the characters/elements was the most important and difficult stage in translating the animation. Hibon worked closely with Axis's modeler Sergio Caires, who got the feel for the characters straight away. The texturing/line art style was then meticulously reproduced on each model, matching the original artworks using different drawing/3D packages. “It was a great process to see 2D concepts become ‘real’,” “For the environments, we decided to keep the modeling easy to render, but instead spend a lot of time designing or drawing intricate textures for each specific item, to bring as much detail and richness as possible to the backgrounds and keep that 2D/3D contrast. It was a great process to see the layers of ink, dirt, hand-drawn details and painted textures dress the 3D world and make it come to life.” ...|$|E

40|$|There are {{two aspects}} of Seth Giertzs {{excellent}} chapter that I want to talk about. One is slightly technical; I {{want to try to}} provide some explanation for why estimating elasticity of taxable income (ETI) is so difficult. I think this difficulty is unappreciated by nonspecialists, who are quick to latch onto a favorite estimate without understanding the weaknesses in the estimation. The other aspect is a bit more philosophical and addresses the different func-tions of the partial equilibrium analysis done here and the general equilibri-um work done a few years back in the macro group at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Perhaps surprisingly, I strongly endorse the partial equi-librium approach taken here for the comparison of tax reforms. There is a section of the chapter called "Issues That Complicate Estima-tion, " but the complex solutions offered by the works Giertz cites may be raising standard errors more than they are reducing bias. Figure 6 - 1 below shows the share of adjusted gross income going to the top half percent of taxpayers from 1960 to 2004; the data are from the pub-lic use files of the IRS's Statistics of Income division.

Figure 6 - 2 excludes capital gains-a more legitimate approach, in my opinion, but one that shows much the same thing. We thought the likeliest explanation for change from 1981 to 1987 was the series of Reagan tax cuts; these were sharp for the very well off and led to an increased willingness to realize tax-able income within that class.

40|$|Cue: Rearing {{livestock}} {{for meat}} and milk production, or for sale, is often recommended {{as a way}} for poor families to escape from poverty. This may be true, but profitable livestock production is not free of cost. In fact, if livestock are to be healthy and productive they need investment, investment of time, resources and money. Dominic Minyoi is a Chief Veterinary Officer working for the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives. He recently spoke to Chris Kakunta about the importance of investment, and why the first priority for livestock farmers is to invest in the health of their new born animals, such as calves and lambs. Allowing a new born animal to feed on its mother?s milk is an extremely important first investment, as it helps to protect the animal against prevailing diseases. IN:		?Once a calf is born ? OUT:		?too late for anybody to intervene. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 16 ?? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dominic Minyoi with advice for livestock keepers on the importance of investing in their animals. Transcript Minyoi	Once a calf is born it must be exposed to colostrum. Colostrum is the first milk that comes from the mother. Within 24 hours of birth that calf should be made to suckle with that one. It gives it all the protection because colostrum carries all the necessary antibodies to protect the calf against the prevailing diseases that are in that area. And also apart from that, most farmers you find they don?t really let the calf suckle. So from birth the calf should be let to suckle until they are satisfied, that?s when the farmers can get the milk. We do know that they rely on this milk as well but the calf needs it more for growth. And as the calf grows up they must at least organise the pasture, even from crop residues. They can put those in the kraal, whatever stover, maize stover that is left, whatever from the groundnuts and beans that can be fed to the animals during the dry season when the feed is inadequate. And it is important {{at this point in time}} that they must de-worm at least twice per year. This is before the rains and after the rains so that when the rains have come in and the grass is mushrooming, the calves have got access to grass; they can put on weight because they won?t have a worm burden. Vaccination is very very important in certain age groups. They can do that for anthrax, they can do that for all the other preventable diseases. Kakunta	Your emphasis has been on the calf. Are you saying when you look after a calf properly, you are guaranteeing that the future animals will be healthy? Minyoi	Definitely, once you start looking after a calf very well that calf will grow into a strong adult. And that strong adult can only be strong if it is also exposed to certain interventions like vaccinations, de-worming, good housing, provision of water, all <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> should be made available to the animals. In the village set up they can even use troughs, these dug-out canoes; put water in there. The animals will have access to water whenever they feel like drinking water. Not where as of now, they graze somewhere else, they are taken for water somewhere else, and by the time they come back to the kraal they are really thirsty. So we should make these things available to the livestock for them to be able to live within the surroundings instead of venturing out where they might contract a disease through mixing with other cattle. Kakunta	There are certain situations here in Zambia, Dr Minyoi, for instance in the southern part of the country, where we have East Coast Fever, commonly known as Corridor Disease. We are finding that the small-scale farmers? animals are dying, while in the same area the commercial farmers? animals are still healthy. What practical lessons have you learned from such a scenario? Minyoi	What it is, is that to prevent tick-borne diseases, one must dip the animals. And communal dip tanks are there, they exist, but these people are not co-operating, to be able to come together so that they can have their animals dipped. People should be able to invest a bit in livestock, so that they can buy the dip chemicals. And they can approach our officers, our officers can assist them in prescribing what kind of chemicals to buy. They should be doing that twice a month in the rainy season, and once every month in the dry season. Because if they dip regularly, then Corridor Disease will be something that they will hear about but not really their concern. Kakunta	But why do you think the farmers are so reluctant in terms of preventative measures? Does it mean there is a problem somewhere in terms of attitudes? Minyoi	I can attribute this partly to poor extension services. If the extension was good, farmers would have been taught how to look after animals, and then everybody would be taken on board. But what it is now, is that sometimes our extension is failing to reach the people. But where it is reaching some people don?t want to spend, they won?t invest in livestock. Livestock is a business just like any other business, they have to invest. And above all, they should attend to their regular requirements in as far as their health is concerned. Because these animals are just left to herdsmen, and when herdsmen come there is no request for a report. They should also keep their records so that these herdsmen are held accountable. Because what is happening, farmers don?t even know how the animals are, they are just told ?The animal is dead. ? And you can not run a business like that. They must be part and parcel of that livestock-rearing group. They must be able to monitor the animals and see how they are getting on, so that they can report on time. Reporting condition on time, or reporting a situation on time gets one better results than reporting late, because when you report late it may be too late for anybody to intervene. End of track.

2500|$|.....there surely is {{some common}} ground when both {{those who believe}} in choice and <b>those</b> who <b>are</b> opposed to {{abortion}} can come together and say, 'We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby'. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> all <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we put in the Democratic platform {{for the first time this}} year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances." ...|$|R
25|$|In some people, {{gingivitis}} progresses to periodontitis – {{with the}} destruction of the gingival fibers, the gum tissues separate from the tooth and deepened sulcus, called a periodontal pocket. Subgingival microorganisms (those that exist under the gum line) colonize the periodontal pockets and cause further inflammation in the gum tissues and progressive bone loss. Examples of secondary causes <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that,</b> by definition, cause microbic plaque accumulation, such as restoration overhangs and root proximity.|$|R

Risk factors <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{increase}} the likelihood of having a miscarriage but don't necessarily cause a miscarriage. Up to 70 conditions, infections, medical procedures, lifestyle factors, occupational exposures, chemical exposure, and shift work are associated with increased risk for miscarriage. Some of these risks include endocrine, genetic, uterine, or hormonal abnormalities, reproductive tract infections, and tissue rejection caused by an autoimmune disorder.|$|R

5000|$|The English {{countryside}} {{has been}} described as particularly suitable to ecotourism, if affected by the sad irony [...] "that the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make the landscape of Britain comely and distinctive are almost entirely no longer needed. Hedgerows, country churches, stone barns, verges full of nodding wildflowers and birdsong, sheep roaming over wind-swept fells, village shops and post office and much more can only rarely be justified on economic grounds, and for most people in power <b>those</b> <b>are</b> the only <b>things</b> <b>that</b> matter".|$|R
