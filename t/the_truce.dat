5|$|After signing <b>the</b> <b>truce,</b> Muhammad {{assembled}} {{an expedition}} against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, {{known as the}} Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). He sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on Transjordanian Byzantine soil in the Battle of Mu'tah.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} afternoon, a Boer {{messenger}} bearing a white flag {{arrived at a}} Scots Guard outpost {{to say that the}} British could send ambulances to collect their wounded lying in front of the trenches {{at the foot of the}} hills. Royal Army Medical Corps and Boer medical orderlies treated the wounded until <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> was broken by fire from the British naval gun, Captain (RN) Bearcroft not having been informed of the temporary armistice. A British medical orderly was sent to the Boers with apologies, and <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> was reinstated. When <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> was officially over, G Battery RHA, the 62nd Field Battery, and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were tasked to screen the reorganisation and withdrawal of some of the British troops.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the centenary of <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> (December 2014), English {{composer}} Chris Eaton {{and singer}} Abby Scott produced the song, 1914 – The Carol of Christmas, to benefit British armed forces charities. At 5 December 2014, it had reached {{top of the}} iTunes Christmas chart.|$|E

5|$|As Władysław IV was {{assuming}} the Commonwealth crown, Gustavus Adolphus, {{who had been}} working on organizing an anti-Polish coalition including Sweden, Russia, Transylvania and Turkey, died. The Russians then undertook an action of their own, attempting to recover lands lost in <b>the</b> <b>Truce</b> of Deulino.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Rhine Campaign of 1795 the {{two sides}} had called a truce. Despite <b>the</b> <b>truce,</b> both sides planned for war. In a decree on 6 January 1796, Lazare Carnot gave Germany {{priority}} over Italy as a theater of war. The First French Republic's finances were in poor shape so its armies would be expected to invade new territories and then live off the conquered lands. Knowing that the French planned to invade Germany, on 20 May 1796 the Austrians announced that <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> would end on 31 May, and prepared for invasion.|$|E
5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E
5000|$|Today <b>the</b> Olympic <b>Truce</b> {{has become}} an {{expression}} of mankind's desire to build a world based on the rules of fair competition, peace, humanity and reconciliation.

The vision was to protect the interests of athletes and sport, and to promote peaceful principles in modern day. Each host city was encouraged to embrace the meaning and spirit of <b>the</b> Olympic <b>Truce</b> in <b>the</b> planning and staging of the Games.|$|R
5|$|Despite the disappointment, the Commonwealth {{was able}} to take {{advantage}} of the Russian weakness and through the territorial advances accomplished to reverse the eastern losses suffered in the earlier decades. In <b>the</b> <b>Truce</b> of Deulino of 1619 the Rzeczpospolita was granted the Smolensk, Chernihiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi regions.|$|E
5|$|General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, {{commander}} of the British II Corps, issued orders forbidding friendly communication with the opposing German troops. Adolf Hitler, then a young corporal of the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry, was also an opponent of <b>the</b> <b>truce.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Germans placed {{candles on}} their {{trenches}} and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery {{in the region}} fell silent. <b>The</b> <b>truce</b> also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} the Junta not to proceed to the Viceroyalty of Peru was a de facto truce that would last while Castelli did not attack Goyeneche's army. Castelli tried to turn the {{situation}} into a formal agreement, which would imply recognition of the Junta as a legitimate interlocutor. Goyeneche agreed to sign an armistice for 40 days to allow time for Lima to ratify the agreement, but he actually used the time to reinforce his army. On 19 June, with <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> still in effect, an advanced royalist troop attacked positions at Juraicoragua. Castelli declared <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> broken and declared war on Peru.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>truce</b> of Hudaybiyyah was {{enforced}} for two years. The {{tribe of}} Banu Khuza'a had {{good relations with}} Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans. A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'a, killing a few of them. The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also {{took part in the}} fighting. After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> of Hudaybiyyah null.|$|E
5|$|But in {{addition}} to being militarily exhausted, the Commonwealth was now pressured by several European diplomacies to suspend further military activities, to allow Gustavus Adolphus to intervene in the Holy Roman Empire. <b>The</b> <b>Truce</b> of Altmark left Livonia north of the Daugava and all Prussian and Livonian seaports except for Danzig, Puck, Königsberg, and Libau in hands of the Swedes, who were also allowed to charge duty on trade through Danzig.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>truce,</b> the chronicler Ibn Wadih {{mentions}} Arab raids into Asia Minor for {{the years}} 783, 784 and 785. If true, then these would probably represent only minor affairs, as the main sources agree that <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> was mutually respected until spring 785. In that year, as Irene had strengthened her hold over the army and was preparing to confront the iconoclasts on the domestic front, she decided to cease payment of the tribute, and hostilities recommenced. In early 786, the Byzantines scored a major success, sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids {{had spent the last}} five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions. After the accession of Harun al-Rashid to the caliphal throne in the same year, however, the Abbasids regained the initiative. Arab pressure mounted, and in 798 Irene was forced to ask for a peace treaty that repeated the stipulations of the 782 truce.|$|E
5000|$|The UK {{promoted}} {{the ideals of}} <b>the</b> Olympic <b>Truce</b> both domestically, {{and for the first}} time internationally.

5|$|Early in 548, King Gubazes of Lazica, {{having found}} Persian {{protection}} oppressive, asked Justinian {{to restore the}} Roman protectorate. The emperor seized the chance, and in 548549 combined Roman and Lazic forces won a series of victories against Persian armies, although they failed to take the key garrison of Petra. The city was finally subjugated in 551, {{but in the same}} year a Persian offensive led by Mihr-Mihroe occupied eastern Lazica. <b>The</b> <b>truce</b> that had been established in 545 was renewed outside Lazica for a further five years on condition that the Romans pay 2,000lb of gold each year. In Lazica the war dragged on inconclusively for several years, with neither side able to make any major gains. Khosrau, who now {{had to deal with the}} White Huns, renewed <b>the</b> <b>truce</b> in 557, this time without excluding Lazica; negotiations continued for a definite peace treaty. Finally, in 562, the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau put together the Fifty-Year Peace Treaty. The Persians agreed to evacuate Lazica and received an annual subsidy of 30,000nomismata (solidi). Both sides agreed not to build new fortifications near the frontier and to ease restrictions on diplomacy and trade.|$|E
5|$|In 1581 Stephen {{penetrated}} {{once again}} into Russia and, on 22 August, laid siege {{to the city}} of Pskov. While the city held, on 13 December 1581 Ivan the Terrible began negotiations that concluded with <b>the</b> <b>Truce</b> of Jam Zapolski on 15 January 1582.
