50|$|<b>Trisodium</b> <b>nitrilotriacetate</b> {{is found}} in {{bathroom}} cleaners and possibly some laundry detergents although more actively used in industrial formulations. Small amounts add up in the environment and add to an overall toxic issue. In aquatic ecosystems these chemicals cause heavy metals in sediment to redisolve {{and many of these}} metals are toxic to fish and other wildlife.|$|E

Twenty-one male inbred W rats 6 weeks of age were given drinking water containing 500 ppm of BBN for 4 weeks {{and then put}} on diet containing 10, 000 ppm of Na 3 NT A, H 20 for 28 weeks. Na 3 NT A Â· H 20 promoted the development of urinary bladder tumors in rats treated with BBN. The incidences of papilloma and transitional cell carcinomas in the urinary bladder were 90 % (18 / 20) and 25 % (4 / 20), respectively, in rats treated with BBN and then Na 3 NTA'H 20 and 0 in those treated with BBN or Na 3 NTA'H 20 alone. The incidence of papillary or nodular hyperplasia in week 32 was 100 % (20 / 20) in rats treated with BBN and then Na 3 NT A, H 20 and 61 % (13 / 21) in rats treated with BBN only. -JNCI 1985; 74 : 235 - 239...|$|E
