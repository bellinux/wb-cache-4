40|$|An amphibious {{inspection}} {{robot system}} (hereafter AIROS) {{is being developed}} to visually inspect the in-containment refueling storage water tank (hereafter IRWST) strainer in APR 1400 instead of a human diver. Four IRWST strainers {{are located in the}} IRWST, which is filled with boric acid water. Each strainer has 108 sub-assembly strainer fin modules that should be inspected with the VT- 3 method according to Reg. guide 1. 82 and the operation manual. AIROS has 6 thrusters for submarine voyage and 4 legs for walking {{on the top of the}} strainer. An inverse kinematic algorithm was implemented in the robot controller for exact walking on the top of the IRWST strainer. The IRWST strainer has several <b>top</b> cross <b>braces</b> that are extruded on the top of the strainer, which can be obstacles of walking on the strainer, to maintain the frame of the strainer. Therefore, a robot leg should arrive at the position beside the <b>top</b> cross <b>brace.</b> For this reason, we used an image processing technique to find the <b>top</b> cross <b>brace</b> in the sole camera image. The sole camera image is processed to find the existence of the <b>top</b> cross <b>brace</b> using the cross edge detection algorithm in real time. A 5 -DOF robot arm that has multiple camera modules for simultaneous inspection of both sides can penetrate narrow gaps. For intuitive presentation of inspection results and for management of inspection data, inspection images are stored in the control PC with camera angles and positions to synthesize and merge the images. The synthesized images are then mapped in a 3 D CAD model of the IRWST strainer with the location information. An IRWST strainer mock-up was fabricated to teach the robot arm scanning and gaiting. It is important to arrive at the designated position for inserting the robot arm into all of the gaps. Exact position control without anchor under the water is not easy. Therefore, we designed the multi leg robot for the role of anchoring and positioning. Quadruped robot design of installing sole cameras was a new approach for the exact and stable position control on the IRWST strainer, unlike a traditional robot for underwater facility inspection. The developed robot will be practically used to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the inspection of nuclear power plant components...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in construction and {{materials used in}} steel-string guitars.

Many players and luthiers are convinced that a well-made guitar's tone improves over time.

5000|$|A [...] "reef ready" [...] {{or simply}} [...] "drilled" [...] tank is often used. This style of tank has holes drilled {{into the rear}} pane {{allowing}} water to drain into the sump or refugium. These drains are usually housed in an internal overflow apparatus made of plastic or glass which encloses a drain standpipe and a water return line (See fig 1, a). The surface water pours over the overflow, down the standpipe (See fig 1, b), through PVC piping, into the sump. After transiting the sump, water is pushed by a return water pump through the second hole and into the aquarium (See fig 1, c). Alternatively, standard non-drilled aquariums employ an external [...] "hang-on" [...] overflow that feeds water via continuous siphon to the sump (See fig 1 d). The tanks are usually constructed from either glass or acrylic. Acrylic {{has the advantage of}} optical clarity, lightness, and ease of drilling. Drawbacks include a tendency to scratch easily, bowing, and often limited access from above due to <b>top</b> <b>bracing.</b> Glass aquariums are heavier but harder to scratch. Other materials such as epoxy-coated plywood have been used by industrious DIYers, but these materials are typically reserved for the construction of larger tanks.|$|R

40|$|Steel storage racks, made of cold-formed steel, {{are used}} {{extensively}} in industry for storing goods. Two main racking systems prevail, {{referred to as}} "selective" and "drive-in" racks. International racking design codes mainly deal with selective racks, while limited design guidelines are available for drive-in racks. Drive-in racks require minimum floor space by storing pallets {{one after the other}} with no space between them. The forklift truck drives into the rack to store the pallets on the first-in, last-out principle. To allow forklift passage, drive-in racks can only be braced at the back (spine bracing) and at the <b>top</b> (plan <b>bracing)</b> in the down-aisle direction resulting in a complex slender structure with poorly understood 3 D behavior and increased risk of collapse.

40|$|In steel {{trapezoidal}} {{box girder}} bridge systems, the U-shaped steel girder is designed to act compositely with the concrete deck to form a closed box for live loading. During the construction stage, however, the behavior is not well understood. The usual practice of assuming the system to be non-composite during construction requires substantial <b>top</b> flange <b>bracing</b> to form a quasi-closed box section. Field studies have Composite box girders with live loading, and girders during construction, have to be evaluated during the design of curved steel trapezoidal {{box girder bridge}}s.

5000|$|Seagull Guitars {{have also}} {{released}} a [...] "compound-curve" [...] top design {{on all of}} their lines.

As part of the new design, the top has a slight (30' radius) curve to it which is slightly above the sound hole and then levels out around the bridge of the guitar. This provides stability while maintaining the same sound as a normal acoustic. They have been working on this new shape over the last twenty years.

Full-scale quasi-static cyclic tests were performed on two specimens with hollow tube braces, with one specimen having the braces filled with concrete. Both frames exhibited stable, predictable behavior under cyclic loading. The VSC detail provided free vertical movement of the brace assembly during both tests. However, its flexibility created a moderate reduction in the overall lateral stiffness of the frame. The concrete-filled tube specimen sustained higher peak loads, demonstrated greater residual strength and dissipated more energy than the hollow tube specimen due to the partial inhibition of local buckling by the concrete core.

40|$|An {{aluminium}} beam shear-link {{is developed}} for earthquake-resistant structures. The aluminium beam {{is designed to}} yield in shear mode to limit the maximum lateral force which is transmitted to primary structural members and to provide significant energy dissipation potential. Aluminium was chosen because of its low yield strength, which {{enables the use of}} thicker webs, reducing the problems of web buckling. Cyclic load tests on medium scale (1 : 4) models were conducted to study the hysteretic behaviour and energy dissipation potential of shear-links made of two alloys of aluminium (3003 -O and 6061 -O). The links were also tested at faster rates (cycling frequencies of 5, 10 and 17 Hz) to determine the effect of strain rate. The links exhibited very ductile shear yielding and excellent energy dissipation capacity. Unpinched and full hysteresis loops were observed until 10 per cent shear strain, and a relatively small influence of strain rates was observed on the link's performance. Simple design equations are developed to proportion these shear-links, using data from the cyclic load tests. In chevron-type braced systems, the shear-link is sandwiched between the <b>tops</b> of diagonal <b>braces</b> and a girder from the floor above, resulting in yielding at a lateral force less than that required to buckle the compression brace. A Shear-Link Braced Frame (SLBF) system was designed and its seismic performance was compared to that of an Ordinary Concentric Braced Frame (OCBF) with chevron braces. The SLBF system demonstrated more uniform distribution of storey drifts, reduced base shear, and a larger energy dissipation capacity per unit drift. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
