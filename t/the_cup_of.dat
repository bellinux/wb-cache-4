While Heracles traveled to Erytheia to retrieve the cattle of Geryon, he crossed the Libyan desert and was so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios, the Sun. Almost immediately, Heracles realized his mistake and apologized profusely, in turn and equally courteous, Helios granted Heracles the golden cup which he used to sail {{across the sea}} every night, from the west to the east because he found Heracles' actions immensely bold. Heracles used this golden cup to reach Erytheia.|$|E

25|$|During the night, nectar is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> the flower. This is commonly associated with flowers specialising in pollination by bats. Common brown lemurs Eulemur fulvus were seen fouraging from Brexia flowers in the early morning. These primates took the inflorescences with their hands and bent these to lick the nectar from the flower cups. This was repeated in other nearby specimens of Brexia immediately after. Flowers were not damaged, {{and it is likely}} the lemurs assisted the pollination. B. madagascariensis grows in coastal vegetations on a range of soil types such as coral, sand, loam or coarse rocky ground, in places like the edges of saline water swamp forest, mangrove swamps, evergreen shrubland and other forest types near the sea. In Tanzania it has been found in an almost pure stand of Maesopsis eminii. The fruit can float in sea water for many months and the numerous dark seeds within remain viable.|$|E

25|$|He {{studied a}} {{question}} analogous {{to that of}} the surface movement in a cup of coffee. What can we say, in general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant flow? Poincaré discovered that the answer can be found in what we now call the topological properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is compact, i.e. both closed and bounded, then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a limit cycle. Poincaré went further; if the area is of the same kind as a disk, as is the case for <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time intervalt. If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed, has no fixed point. then this is not necessarily the case.|$|E
