Stabilization is evaluated by marshall stability and <b>triaxial</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests.</b> Test specimens were compacted by the marshall, standard proctor and vibratory methods. Stabilization is evaluated primarily by <b>triaxial</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> in which confining pressures of 0 to 80 psi were used.

Several significant conclusions developed by the authors are as follows: (1) the values for effective angle of internal friction and effective cohesion were substantially independent of asphalt content, (2) straight line MOHR envelopes of failure were observed for all treated stones, (3) bituminous admixtures did little to improve volume change (deformation due to load) characteristics of the three crushed limestones, (4) with respect to pore water characteristics (pore pressures and suctions due to lateral loading), bituminous treatment notably improved only the bedford stone, and (5) at low lateral pressures bituminous treatments increased stability by limiting axial strain.
