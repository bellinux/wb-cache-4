40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{implementation}} on FPGA of an intermediate frequency transceiver for OFDM-based WLAN. The circuit has been particularized for Hiperlan 2 standard, {{but most of the}} work can be generalized to IEEE 802. 11. a,g standards. The system is composed by three main blocks (autocorrelator, CORDIC, and FFT processor) that are used in different time intervals to perform all the required operations. The autocorrelator is used for frame detection and carrier frequency offset estimation. The CORDIC is reused <b>to</b> estimate frequency <b>offset,</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> that frequency and to calculate the division in the channel estimation stage. Finally, the FFT/IFFT processor also uses its complex-number multiplier to perform the channel compensation of the received OFDM symbol. The whole IF transceiver fits in a low cost FPGA, an XC 3 S 400 - 4 Spartan III device. I...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent of}} which economic instruments {{can be used to}} minimise environmental damage in the coastal and marine environments, and the role of <b>offsets</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> for residual damage. Economic principles are used to review current command and control systems, potential incentive based mechanisms, and the development of appropriate offsets. Implementing offsets in the marine environment has a number of challenges, so alternative approaches may be necessary. The study finds that offsets in areas remote from the initial impact, or even to protect different species, may be acceptable provided they result in greater conservation benefits than the standard like-for-like offset. This study is particularly relevant for the design of offsets in the coastal and marine environments where there is limited scope for like-for-like offsets...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGovernments and {{industries}} increasingly use <b>offsets</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> for the unavoidable impacts of development on biodiversity. However, high {{uncertainty about the}} biodiversity outcomes of <b>offsetting</b> strategies has led <b>to</b> significant criticism in the academic and policy literature, while the ad-hoc application of offset rules within a region may lead <b>to</b> <b>offsets</b> favouring some species and communities {{at the expense of}} others. Here we explored opportunities <b>to</b> improve <b>offsetting</b> outcomes through strategic regional offset approaches, underpinned by concepts of complementarity and irreplaceability from the conservation planning literature, in comparison to more commonly used like-for-like approach. We assessed different offsetting strategies in the Hunter Valley, NSW, a rapidly developing region in Australia with an active mining industry. We quantified regional-level biodiversity losses arising from minimal to extensive mining expansion, along with species-specific impacts for 569 flora and fauna species, and prioritized areas for protection, restoration or both <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> the anticipated losses. Accounting for how well the offsets would complement existing protected areas, we compared the area needed for offsetting and the expected biodiversity outcomes among the different strategies. Our results highlight the benefits of a more systematic approach <b>to</b> <b>offsetting</b> in terms of an enhanced understanding of regional-scale impacts, more efficient identification of offset sites and improved biodiversity outcomes. Our approach encourages forward thinking about impending threats to, and opportunities for, biodiversity conservation and could serve as a template for strategic regional offset planning based on plausible scenarios of future biodiversity loss...|$|R
50|$|The Nikonos {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a rangefinder camera, but in truth it is a scale focus camera as there is no rangefinder. The viewfinder is used purely to compose the shot, and to display exposure information. Focus is set with an outsized dial mounted on the left side of the lens barrel (as seen from the operator's point of view), and the aperture is set with a dial mounted on the right. For many beginners, this meant some confusion over estimating distances underwater, since refraction makes objects appear 25% closer than they actually are. Strangely, Nikon's approach was to assume that the user did not make the correction, so the distance markers on the lens are <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> for it. Thankfully the Nikonos wide-angle lenses have ample depth of field, so these discrepancies are often not a noticeable problem.|$|R

50|$|Offsets can {{be defined}} as {{provisions}} to an import agreement, between an exporting foreign company, or possibly a government acting as intermediary, and an importing public entity, that oblige the exporter to undertake activities in order to satisfy a second objective of the importing entity, distinct from the acquisition of the goods and/or services that form the core transaction. The incentive for the exporter results from the conditioning of the core transaction to the acceptance of the offset obligation. Offset agreements often involve trade in military goods and services and are alternatively called: industrial compensations, industrial cooperation, offsets, industrial and regional benefits, balances, juste retour or equilibrium, to define mechanisms more complex than counter-trade.Counter-trade can also be considered one of the many forms of defense <b>offset,</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> a purchasing country. The main difference between a generic offset and counter-trade, both common practices in the international defense trade, is the involvement of money. In counter-trade, goods are paid through barters or other mechanisms without the exchange of money, while in other defense offsets money is the measure and the medium of exchange.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and test a {{mechanical}} DC torque tool testing rig that is capable of simulating dynamic response of the human arm under a torque impulse. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response is based on a nonlinear model derived from human subject testing. The testing rig, which uses both tension and compression springs to provide a bilinear stiffness rate to resist the motion of the torque tool handle, is used to analyze the tool handle angular displacement and reaction force, which has been strongly linked in previous studies to operator discomfort and injury. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response was tested under a number of different conditions, and compared to an analytical nonlinear model. The results showed that the mechanical simulation consistently underestimated the tool handle displacement by up to 16. 2 % when compared to the nonlinear model predictions. The discrepancy in handle displacement between the nonlinear model and mechanical simulation is likely due the coulomb friction not being included in the nonlinear model. Therefore, this study shows that by suing an <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> for the coulomb friction, the tool testing rig can be used to accurately simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of the human arm under...|$|R

40|$|Offsetting is {{emerging}} as an important but controversial approach for managing environment-development conflicts. Biodiversity <b>offsets</b> are designed <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> for damage <b>to</b> biodiversity from development by providing biodiversity gains elsewhere. Here, we suggest how biodiversity offset policies can generate behaviours that exacerbate biodiversity decline, and identify four perverse incentives that could arise even from soundly designed policies. These include incentives for (i) entrenching or exacerbating baseline biodiversity declines, (ii) winding back non-offset conservation actions, (iii) crowding out of conservation volunteerism and (iv) false public confidence in environmental outcomes due <b>to</b> marketing <b>offset</b> actions as gains. Synthesis and applications. Despite its goal of improving biodiversity outcomes, there is potential for best-practice <b>offsetting</b> <b>to</b> achieve the opposite result.

40|$|Abstract Background Biodiversity offsets are {{conservation}} projects used {{mainly by}} business to counterbalance {{the environmental impacts}} of their operations, with the aim of achieving a net neutral or even beneficial outcome for biodiversity. Companies considering <b>offsets</b> need <b>to</b> know: (1) if there are areas of such biological importance that no impact is acceptable, and outside of these no-go areas, (2) the relative importance of biodiversity in the impacted site versus the site(s) proposed for protection, <b>to</b> ensure that the <b>offset</b> is of equal or greater status than that lost through the company's operations. We compiled a database of 40 schemes that use various methods to assess conservation priorities, and we examined if the schemes would allow companies to answer the above questions. Description Overall, schemes tend to be designed to guide conservation organizations in their own priority setting or they categorize species based on conservation status. Generally, the schemes do not provide all the necessary information for offsets because they operate at a broad spatial scale or with low spatial resolution, which make it difficult to assess sites at the project level. Furthermore, most schemes do not explicitly incorporate threat, which we consider key <b>to</b> assessing whether <b>offsets</b> protect habitats or species that would otherwise be lost (i. e., provide additionality). The schemes are useful, however, for identifying the major conservation issues in different ecosystems around the globe. Conclusion Companies can proceed by first avoiding, reducing, and mitigating impacts, and then using existing schemes to identify i) no-go areas and ii) appropriate <b>offsets</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> for any unavoidable loss in biodiversity. If existing schemes are inadequate, then companies should use integrated conservation planning techniques <b>to</b> define <b>offset</b> options within the region of their operations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{conservation}} {{policy is a}} challenging process, often impeded {{by a lack of}} clear objectives and a limited understanding of the pathways to achieve them. Here, the utility of target-based &# 039;backcasting&# 039; is demonstrated for developing effective conservation policies. Backcasting encodes social values by requiring a desired future state be selected as a target; it then involves searching for multiple pathways to reach this state from the present. This approach is demonstrated with a case study examining policy options for mitigating impacts from the growth of Sydney on a critically endangered woodland community. A model was developed to predict changes in woodland area over time in response to a range of processes: declines in habitat condition; legal and illegal clearing for development; and the implementation of biodiversity <b>offsets</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> for clearing. Using a target of retaining 60 % of the current woodland distribution in 50 years time, the backcasting analysis involved searching for all combinations of processes that would achieve this target. Results demonstrate how backcasting provides a structured way to explore the trade-offs and robustness of combinations of policy interventions leading to a desirable future. For this case study, the most viable way of achieving the target may be <b>to</b> ensure the <b>offset</b> policy is adequate and enforced. If this was not feasible, the analysis shows that reducing the rate at which habitat is declining in condition would be most important in opening up other policy options. This study provides the first quantitative demonstration of backcasting in a conservation context...|$|R

40|$|A {{velocimetry}} experiment {{has been}} designed to measure shock properties for small cylindrical metal targets (8 -mm-diameter by 2 -mm thick). A target is accelerated by high explosives, caught, and retrieved for later inspection. The target is expected to move at a velocity of 0. 1 to 3 km/sec. The complete experiment canister is approximately 105 mm in diameter and 380 mm long. Optical velocimetry diagnostics include the Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR) and Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV). The packaging of the velocity diagnostics is not allowed to interfere with the catchment or an X-ray imaging diagnostic. A single optical relay, using commercial lenses, collects Doppler-shifted light for both VISAR and PDV. The use of fiber optics allows measurement of point velocities on the target surface during accelerations occurring over 15 mm of travel. The VISAR operates at 532 nm and has separate illumination fibers requiring alignment. The PDV diagnostic operates at 1550 nm, but is aligned and focused at 670 nm. The VISAR and PDV diagnostics are complementary measurements and they image spots in close proximity on the target surface. Because the optical relay uses commercial glass, the axial positions of the optical fibers for PDV and VISAR are <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> for chromatic aberrations. The optomechanical design requires careful attention to fiber management, mechanical assembly and disassembly, positioning of the foam catchment, and X-ray diagnostic field-of-view.
