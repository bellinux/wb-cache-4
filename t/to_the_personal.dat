5|$|Oliver Cromwell, born in April 1599, led England into a republic, {{abolishing the}} monarchy and the House of Lords, after the {{execution}} of King Charles I in January 1649. Cromwell's rule as Lord Protector (beginning in December 1653) was not dissimilar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Personal</b> Rule of his royal predecessors. He maintained sole, unrestricted power, and lived in the many royal palaces. In 1657 he was formally offered the title of King, but after an “agony of mind and conscience” turned it down. Throughout 1658, Cromwell suffered illness and family tragedy, and died {{on the afternoon of}} 3 September 1658 (Old Style).|$|E

An order to lock down the Manila International Airport was executed {{as a result of}} the rejection. This resulted in mobs surging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> space of The Beatles. There were also reports that their manager was issued a PHP 100,00 tax assessment.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Timess Agustin Gurza {{described}} {{the creative process}} between the pair as Chan creating the instrumental first, followed by Chana crafting the lyrics and melodies alongside him. Chana based her lyrics on her previous relationships and break-ups, while Chan found inspiration in the music of Manu Chao. Chana reported that she had some difficulties during the production process due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> nature of the lyrics. Although she {{said that it was}} more challenging to write lyrics in Spanish, Chana expressed a preference for it as she felt that it was more poetic than English. She often consulted a Spanish-English dictionary to translate her ideas.|$|E

5|$|The Sovereign has {{historically}} {{had the power}} to choose Knights of the Order. From the eighteenth century onwards, the Sovereign made his or her choices upon the advice of the Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both Orders returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> gift of the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{has become}} a fixture in American history due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and {{the symbolism of the}} fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention. The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis had {{designated}} Mary as {{his successor}} {{in both of}} his kingdoms, the Polish nobles, seeking an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> union with Hungary, were not willing to recognize Mary and her fiancé Sigismund as their sovereigns. They would have accepted Mary if she had moved to Kraków and reigned over both kingdoms from there rather than from Hungary, ruling according to their advice rather {{than that of the}} Hungarian nobles and marrying a prince of their choosing. Their intentions, however, were not to Elizabeth's taste. She too would have been required to move to Kraków, where a lack of men loyal to her would have rendered her unable to enforce her own will. Elizabeth was also aware of the difficulties her mother-in-law had faced during her regency in Poland, which had ended with the old queen fleeing her native kingdom in disgrace.|$|E

5|$|It {{conveyed}} a {{tenth of}} the royal demesne– the lands of the crown as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> property of the sovereign– into the hands of churches, ecclesiastics and laymen. In Anglo-Saxon England property was either folkland or bookland. The transmission of folkland was governed by the customary rights of kinsmen, subject to the king's approval, whereas bookland was established by the grant of a royal charter, and could be disposed of freely by the owner. Booking land thus converted it by charter from folkland to bookland. The royal demesne was the crown's folkland, whereas the king's bookland was his own personal property which he could leave by will as he chose. In the decimation Æthelwulf may have conveyed royal folkland by charter to become bookland, in some cases to laymen who already leased the land.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day ETA claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} of GeorgeVI in 1937 {{was broadcast}} on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), {{and parts of}} the service were filmed and shown in cinemas. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major outside broadcast. At ElizabethII's coronation in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.|$|E
