50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Brazilians</b> {{maintained}} <b>the</b> dominant, windward position; {{because the}} wind was blowing towards <b>the</b> Argentines, <b>the</b> <b>Brazilians</b> had <b>the</b> initiative. Sena Pereira duly tried to stage his ships in an attack line. However, the maneuvers of the vessels was disastrous: the goleta Liberdade do Sul grounded, while the Dona Januária left the formation and strayed within range of the fire of General Balcarce, the Sarandí, and 3 gunboats.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> Navy {{found itself}} well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} {{since the fall of}} <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play an essential role in remaking the country into an international power.|$|E
5|$|In June 1945, Orizaba was {{transferred}} under Lend-Lease to <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> Navy where {{she served as}} Duque de Caxias (U-11). In August 1945, Duque de Caxis carried parts of <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> Expeditionary Force from Naples back to Rio de Janeiro. The ship was badly damaged by a fire in 1947, but was repaired and remained in service. Permanently transferred to Brazil in 1953, Duque de Caxias was decommissioned in 1959and scrapped in 1963.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Brazilians</b> {{attacked}} {{again on}} 18 July, the flanking movement by Gen. Jose Luis Mena Barreto, and a frontal assault by Gen. Victorino J.C. Monteiro. Gen. Flores had Gen. Souza replace Gen. Monteiro {{when he was}} wounded. The allies lost Cols. Palleja, Aguero, and Martinez. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilians</b> had 630 killed, 2,938 wounded, and 54 missing, the Argentines had 201 killed, 421 wounded, the Uruguayans had 250 casualties, while the Paraguayans had 2,500 casualties.|$|R
50|$|In Acre {{profits in}} rubber drew {{thousands}} of Brazilians, largely {{immigrants from the}} poor northeast of the country. In 1889, the situation escalated when <b>the</b> <b>Brazilians</b> living in Acre decided to defy the authority of Bolivia. They wanted to create an independent territory, and request annexation from Brazil. Bolivia's response was to found the city of Puerto Alonso (today Porto Acre). Using military force, in October 1889 <b>the</b> <b>Brazilians</b> occupied and expelled the Bolivians.|$|R
50|$|Kessy and Ross quickly {{took control}} of the first set, winning it 21-10. In the second set it was Maestrini and Vieira who started fast.

5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein <b>the</b> <b>Brazilian</b> industry would participate in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E

50|$|Kaizer Chiefs {{finished}} in the runners-up spot for the second successive season after finishing five points behind <b>the</b> brilliant <b>Brazilians.</b> <b>The</b> Pretoria giants based their success on a rock-solid defence - just 25 goals conceded in 34 matches - and they were immensely difficult to beat, suffering just four defeats the whole season. <b>The</b> <b>Brazilians</b> racked up 68 points, five more than Chiefs could manage.|$|R
