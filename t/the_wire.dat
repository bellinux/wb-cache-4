5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> is an American crime drama {{television}} series set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland. Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon, {{the series was}} broadcast by the cable network HBO in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.|$|E

5|$|The Fox Terrier {{has been}} more {{successful}} than any other breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, with four Best in Show titles going to the Smooth Fox Terrier and fourteen titles going to <b>the</b> <b>Wire</b> Fox Terrier. They were both shown as one breed with two coat variations; this changed in 1985 when the American Kennel Club listed the two as separate breeds. In the UK, at Crufts, the Smooth Fox Terrier has not won any Best in Show titles, while <b>the</b> <b>Wire</b> Fox Terrier has won on three occasions.|$|E

50|$|A speaker wire’s {{impedance}} {{takes into}} account <b>the</b> <b>wire’s</b> resistance, <b>the</b> <b>wire’s</b> path, and <b>the</b> dielectric properties of local insulators. The latter two factors also determine <b>the</b> <b>wire's</b> frequency response. <b>The</b> lower the impedance of the speaker, the greater a significance <b>the</b> speaker <b>wire's</b> resistance will have.|$|R
40|$|We have {{produced}} arrays of Co nanowires in anodic porous alumina filters {{by means of}} electrodeposition. The structure and magnetization behavior of <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> was investigated with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetization measurements. NMR shows that <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> consist of a mixture of fcc and hcp texture with the (0001) texture of the hcp fraction oriented preferentially perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>wires.</b> <b>The</b> magnetization direction is determined by a competition of demagnetizing fields and dipole–dipole fields and can be tuned parallel or perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> by changing <b>the</b> length of <b>the</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> {{employs a}} broad {{ensemble}} cast, supplemented by many recurring guest stars who populate the institutions {{featured in the}} show. The majority of the cast is black, which accurately reflects the demographics of Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very believable appearance of floating. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> to realistically portray the movements of an unconscious human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured airlock. At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened his grip on <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back up toward the hatch.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of an apparatus and method that combines a signal generator and a passive signal receiver to detect and record the path of partially or completely concealed electrical <b>wiring</b> without disturbing <b>the</b> concealing surface. The signal generator applies a series of electrical pulses to <b>the</b> selected <b>wiring</b> of interest. <b>The</b> applied pulses create a magnetic field about <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> that can be detected by a coil contained within the signal receiver. An audible output connected to the receiver and driven by the coil reflects the receiver`s position with respect to <b>the</b> <b>wiring.</b> <b>The</b> receiver`s audible signal is strongest when the receiver is directly above <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> and <b>the</b> long axis of the receiver`s coil is parallel to <b>the</b> <b>wiring.</b> A marking means is mounted on the receiver to mark the location of <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> as <b>the</b> receiver is directed over the wiring`s concealing surface. Numerous marks made on various locations of the concealing surface will trace the path of <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> of interest...|$|R

5|$|A second regimental-sized {{attack against}} 3 RAR at Balmoral was {{launched}} by the North Vietnamese at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion assault preceded by 60mm and 80mm mortar fire from the south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as the North Vietnamese sappers blew up <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms fire from their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles. The main assault began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined effect of this firepower stopping the North Vietnamese on <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> before they could penetrate the position. Although the assault was well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The assault was subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships engaged the North Vietnamese, directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the third season, <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> was still {{struggling}} to maintain its ratings and the show faced possible cancellation. Creator David Simon blamed the show's low ratings in part on its competition against Desperate Housewives and worried that expectations for HBO dramas had changed following the success of The Sopranos.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, HBO {{produced}} three shorts depicting {{moments in the}} history of characters in <b>The</b> <b>Wire.</b> The three prequels depict the first meeting between McNulty and Bunk; Proposition Joe as a slick business kid; and young Omar. The shorts are available on the complete series DVD set.|$|E

5000|$|A weatherhead, {{also called}} a weathercap, service head, service {{entrance}} cap, or gooseneck (slang) is a [...] service drop entry point where overhead power or telephone wires enter a building, or where wires transition between overhead and underground cables. At a building <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> enter a conduit, a protective metal pipe, and the weatherhead is a waterproof {{cap on the}} end of the conduit that allows <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> to enter without letting in water. It is shaped like a hood, with the surface where <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> enter facing down at an angle of at least 45°, to shield it from precipitation. A rubberized gasket makes for a tight seal against <b>the</b> <b>wires.</b> Before they enter the weatherhead, a drip loop is left in <b>the</b> overhead <b>wires,</b> which permits rain water that collects on <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> to drip off before reaching the weatherhead.|$|R
5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company to move through <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group {{in an attempt to}} attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E
5|$|Fox Terriers are two {{different}} breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and <b>the</b> <b>Wire</b> Fox Terrier. Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century {{from a handful of}} dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds. In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier. <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011 Elba, {{known at}} the time for playing Stringer Bell in <b>The</b> <b>Wire,</b> {{reportedly}} joined the cast of Prometheus in an undisclosed role. When the film was released he described Janek's background, and the character's career as a longshoreman and sailor motivate him to maintain the well-being of his crew. Roger Ebert praised Elba's performance, calling Janek's evolution the most interesting in the film.|$|E
25|$|At {{different}} parts of <b>the</b> movie, <b>wires</b> were used. <b>The</b> production staff {{had to take care}} of <b>the</b> <b>wires.</b> To ensure they do not show on screen, they would spray <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> in <b>the</b> same colour as the set background. If <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> were shown, they would have to take it overseas for editing which was not popular at that time. However, no wires were used in the scene where actor Chin Siu-ho performed a back-flip up the door.|$|R

5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Photographs {{taken by}} Malcolm Browne of the {{self-immolation}} quickly spread across <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> services and were {{featured on the}} front pages of newspapers worldwide. The self-immolation was later regarded as {{a turning point in the}} Buddhist crisis and a critical point in the collapse of the Diệm regime.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{overlaying}} {{songs on}} the soundtrack, or employing a score, <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> primarily uses pieces of music that emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> is lauded for its {{literary}} themes, its singular acute {{exploration of}} society and politics, and its realistic portrayal of urban life.

50|$|<b>The</b> thin <b>wires</b> {{separating}} <b>the</b> scoring {{sections on}} the board occasionally overlap slightly, due to the manufacturing process. Any dart splitting <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> (landing in <b>the</b> tiny area where two wires overlap) is credited in the shooter's favor. For example, if the dart splits <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> separating <b>the</b> two and three point zones, the player is awarded three points. If the dart splits <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> separating <b>the</b> three point zone and the blue ring, the player is credited with three points.|$|R
50|$|Modern wiring methods assume {{two or more}} {{load-carrying}} conductors {{will lie}} very near each other, as for instance in standard NM-2 cable. Since <b>the</b> load-carrying <b>wires</b> are in proximity, when they heat up, the heating is shared across <b>the</b> <b>wires,</b> limiting <b>the</b> overall current load they can support. Since <b>the</b> load-carrying <b>wires</b> in K&T wiring are widely spaced, <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> can carry higher currents than the same conductors in proximity. When installed correctly, <b>the</b> K&T <b>wires</b> are held away from the structural materials by ceramic insulators.|$|R
30|$|The {{recovery}} {{stress of}} martensitic shape-memory alloy [SMA] wires {{can be used}} to confine concrete, and the confining effectiveness of <b>the</b> SMA <b>wires</b> was previously proved through experimental tests. However, the behavior of SMA wires under recovery stress has not been seriously investigated. Thus, this study conducted a series of tests of NiTiNb martensitic SMA wires under recovery stress with varying degrees of prestrain on <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> and compared <b>the</b> behavior under recovery stress with that under prestressing of <b>the</b> <b>wires.</b> <b>The</b> remaining stress was reduced by the procedure of additional strain loading and unloading. More additional strains reduced more remaining stresses. When <b>the</b> SMA <b>wires</b> were heated up to the transformation temperature under prestress, the stress on <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> increased due to the state transformation. Furthermore, the stress decreased with a decreasing temperature of <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> down to room temperature. The stress of <b>the</b> NiTiNb <b>wires</b> was higher than the prestress, and the developed stress seemed to depend on the composition of the SMAs. When an additional strain was subsequently loaded and unloaded on <b>the</b> prestressed SMA <b>wires,</b> <b>the</b> remaining stress decreased. Finally, the remaining stress becomes zero when loading and unloading a specific large strain.|$|R
