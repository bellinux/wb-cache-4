50|$|Duplex channel systems {{transmit}} {{and receive}} on different discrete channels. This defines systems where equipment cannot communicate without some infrastructure {{such as a}} repeater, base station or <b>Talk-Through</b> Base. Most common in the US is a repeater configuration where a base station is configured to simultaneously re-transmit the audio received from mobile units. This makes the mobiles, or hand-helds, able to communicate amongst one another anywhere within reception range of the base station or repeater. Typically the base or repeater station has a high antenna and high power, which allows much greater range, compared with a ground vehicle or hand-held transceiver.|$|E
50|$|The NRN offers {{full access}} to the BRT {{telephone}} network; public service telephone network (PSTN) dialling, including international, is also available. It can provide dedicated open channels on <b>talk-through</b> mode for incident management and an override priority facility to ensure that emergency calls are immediately connected to the railway's Train Control Offices (TCO) and Electrical Control Rooms (ECR). The NRN and ORN are based on analogue radio technology and provide {{a high level of}} coverage throughout the railway network for mobile communication at the trackside. The ORN offers facilities for driver emergency communication with the local train control office. The RETB system is based on similar technology as the NRN and ORN but provides data communication for signalling token block exchange as well as voice communication.|$|E
40|$|Hearing Protection Devices (HPDs) {{can protect}} the ear against loud {{potentially}} damaging sounds while allowing lower-level sounds such as speech to be perceived. However, {{the impact of}} these devices on the ability to localize sound sources is not well known. To address this question, we propose two different methods: one behavioral and one dealing with acoustical measurements. For the behavioral method, sound localization performance was measured with, and without, HPDs on 20 listeners. Five HPDs, including both passive (nonlinear attenuation) and three active (<b>talk-through)</b> systems were evaluated. The results showed a significant increase in localization errors, especially front-back and up-down confusions relative to the naked ear test condition for all of the systems tested, especially for the <b>talk-through</b> headphone system. For the acoustic measurement method, Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) were measured on an artificial head both without, and with the HPDs in place. The effects of the HPDs on the spectral cues for the localization of different sound sources in the horizontal plane were analyzed. Alterations of the Interaural Spectral Difference (ISD) cues were identified, which could explain the observed increase in front-back confusions caused by the <b>talk-through</b> headphone protectors...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigated}} crisis intervention in three secondary schools after the suicides of five students, {{focusing on the}} relation between crisis intervention and suicide contagion. The contagion hypothesis was supported. Following a suicide, the number of suicides that occurred in secondary schools in one year were markedly increased beyond chance. No new suicides took place at schools where adequate first <b>talk-throughs</b> and psychological debriefing were conducted by a mental health professional. Proper crisis intervention is recommended to prevent suicide contagion in schools...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{quality and}} safety {{improvement}} methods in healthcare {{rely on a}} complete and accurate map of the process. Process mapping in healthcare is often achieved using a sequential flow diagram, {{but there is little}} guidance available in the literature about the most effective type of process map to use. Moreover there is evidence that the organisation of information in an external representation affects reasoning and decision making. This exploratory study examined whether the type of process map - sequential or hierarchical - affects healthcare practitioners' judgments. Methods A sequential and a hierarchical process map of a community-based anti coagulation clinic were produced based on data obtained from interviews, <b>talk-throughs,</b> attendance at a training session and examination of protocols and policies. Clinic practitioners were asked to specify the parts of the process that they judged to contain quality and safety concerns. The process maps were then shown to them in counter-balanced order and they were asked to circle on the diagrams the parts of the process where they had the greatest quality and safety concerns. A structured interview was then conducted, in which they were asked about various aspects of the diagrams. Results Quality and safety concerns cited by practitioners differed depending on whether they were or were not looking at a process map, and whether they were looking at a sequential diagram or a hierarchical diagram. More concerns were identified using the hierarchical diagram compared with the sequential diagram and more concerns were identified in relation to clinical work than administrative work. Participants' preference for the sequential or hierarchical diagram depended on the context in which they would be using it. The difficulties of determining the boundaries for the analysis and the granularity required were highlighted. Conclusions The results indicated that the layout of a process map does influence perceptions of quality and safety problems in a process. In quality improvement work it is important to carefully consider the type of process map to be used and to consider using more than one map to ensure that different aspects of the process are captured. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{desire to}} {{increase}} the quality of teachers in classrooms has prompted educators, policy-makers, and researchers {{to search for the}} most effective models of teacher professional development. One model that utilizes a peer-coaching component and shows promise for improving teaching capacity is the Instructional <b>Talk-Through</b> (ITT) process. A case study on the Instructional <b>Talk-Through</b> model was conducted in a medium sized, rural, school district in North Carolina with 47 teachers of varying gender, experience and assignment participating to determine effects on perceived self-efficacy and student achievement. Research was also conducted to determine if participation in the ITT process contributed to teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceived improved leadership abilities. Through quantitative research {{in the form of the}} Teachers 2 ̆ 7 Sense of Efficacy Scale and qualitative research in the form of open-ended question responses, the study found inconclusive links to increased student achievement but significant increases in teacher self-efficacy related to student engagement, instructional strategies, and classroom management. The study also revealed increased self-reports of improved leadership ability attributed to both teacher desire and action in sharing new strategies with colleagues. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{outcome of}} an {{emergency}} is largely determined by the behaviour of the people involved. To improve the safety of buildings and to increase the effectiveness of response procedures and training programmes it is often necessary to predict human behaviour in emergency situations. There are several approaches {{which can be used}} to make these predictions, but not all had previously been systematically analysed and therefore their appropriateness for any given application was unknown. This thesis describes an analysis of approaches for predicting human behaviour in emergencies. The research focussed on approaches which could be used by human factors professionals to extend the contribution this systems-oriented and user-focussed discipline can make to managing risks and reducing danger. The investigated approaches were evaluated against criteria for judging their quality, including validity, reliability, resources, sensitivity and ethics. In research conducted to test the approaches, fire drills, virtual environments (VEs) and a new <b>talk-through</b> approach, in which participants describe the hypothetical actions they would take in an emergency scenario, demonstrated potential for predicting behaviour in emergency situations. These approaches were subsequently evaluated in a standardised comparison, in which each one was applied to analyse the behaviour demonstrated during an evacuation from a university building. The observed frequencies of behaviour produced by each approach were significantly correlated, as were the sequences of behaviour. All of the approaches demonstrated replicability. The resources required to apply each approach were relatively low, especially for the <b>talk-through</b> approach. Based on the findings from this research, and drawing upon previous work from the scientific literature, guidance was provided for selecting approaches and methods for behavioural prediction in emergency situations. The <b>talk-through</b> approach is suitable for use during the concept phase of a design as it is quick to implement and requires low resources. VEs and simulation tools are more appropriate for design activities when detailed CAD models become available. Fire drills can provide useful measures of human behaviour in evacuation scenarios, but require a physical representation of the building or environment under investigation. Fire drills, VEs and simulation tools can be used to inform emergency response procedures. Predictions from all of the aforementioned approaches can support the development of training programmes. This guidance was previously unavailable to human factors professionals and now serves both to inform design work and support the evaluation of existing evacuation procedures and protocols.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this U. S. Bureau of Mines study {{was to assess the}} ability of {{trainees}} to don an unfamiliar self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) after having become familiar with how to put on a different type of apparatus. Prepractice instruction was the same for all individuals learning to put on a device: a step-by-step, hands-on <b>talk-through</b> using the " 3 + 3 " method. Subjects were assigned to groups that had their initial donning instruction delivered on either the Draeger OXY-SR 60 B or the CSE SR- 100. Trainees' performances were then evaluated using the other model. Donning trials were analyzed using a number of measures. It was found that SCSR design had a moderate influence upon how well the donning task transferred...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLevel-dependent hearing {{protection}} devices protect the ear against harmful noise exposure, like impulse noise with high peak pressure levels, but allow unaltered {{perception of the}} quiet acoustic environment. Using this type of protection, speech communication is possible. For these {{hearing protection}} devices (HPDs) two principles exist: 1) passive systems (like nonlinear earplugs) and 2) active systems (<b>talk-through</b> systems) using electronics for the reproduction of the acoustic environment. The goal {{of this study is}} to quantify the degradation of spatial perception when these protections are worn. To which level is the localization still possible? Tests are realized in order to estimate the localization errors of sound in space with and without wearing level-dependent HPDs. Different kinds of protectors have been used. These tests show that the use of one of these HPDs impedes on the spatial perception: confusions between top-down as well as between in front-back perception...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of an approach for predicting the human response to a domestic fire, using a combination of a <b>talk-through</b> technique (Kirwan and Ainsworth, 1992) and sequential analysis (Bakeman and Gottman, 1986). 20 participants were asked what actions they would take upon hearing a strange noise in their house, which they were later told was a fire. Each act was recorded and the results were compared to previous research in which people involved in real fires had been interviewed (Canter et al, 1980). A significant relationship was found between the frequency (Spearman’s rho: 0. 694, p< 0. 01) and sequence (Spearman’s rho: 0. 441, p< 0. 05) of acts in this study and those from the interviews with people involved in real fires. More work is needed to develop the approach, but this case study indicates that it might have use as a low-cost method which can be used to predict behaviour in an emergency...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of modern, large-scale control systems {{has given rise}} to new require-ments for monitoring and control of those systems, and capabilities of colorgraphics computer-generated display systems are being applied to provide the user/system/computer interface. An evaluation of the advanced control/display system at the 10 MWe Solar Pilot Plant was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the colorgraphics system and its impact on plant performance and operator workload. A two-phase methodology was applied to evaluate workstation design; colorgraphics display structure, content, format, and readability; control input devices; dialogue structure; display access/utilization; and alarm handling. Data collection procedures included checklist ratings, analysis of documentation, structured interviews, observation of operations, analysis of process reports, and walk-through <b>talk-through</b> simulation. Results indicate the overall suit-ability of the colorgraphics control/display system in meeting the operating requirements, and suggest discrepancy/need areas where performance improvements can be realized. Reso-lution of issues in three areas seems crucial to maximizing the potential of the color-graphics interface: monitoring the process efficiently, retrieving needed information, and handling abnormal events...|$|E
40|$|An {{ergonomics}} {{analysis of}} a hospital pharmacy was initiated {{in response to a}} manager’s request “What is the correct height for a pharmacy bench? ” following reports of neck and back discomfort by pharmacy staff. A task analysis identified the sequencing of dispensing tasks and associated ergonomics considerations using direct observation and interviews of all five staff (two technicians and three pharmacists), <b>talk-through</b> protocols and review of archival data (job descriptions, departmental statistics and procedural documents). A Modified Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was administered to determine {{the nature and extent of}} discomfort. A dimensional analysis measured specific anthropometric dimensions for all staff that were compared with actual workspace dimensions and recommended guidelines. A mismatch between the elbow height and bench height was identified as a factor in staff adopting stooped postures when dispensing. Deficiencies in two computer workstations were also identified as factors contributing to awkward postures. The nature, severity and frequency of discomfort and dimensional mismatches indicated that workplace redesign was a priority. Recommendations were made to improve the computer set-up and workspace layout, including bench height and stock storage. A participative approach was used throughout the implementation phase with a report providing a basis for clarifying and prioritising the design specifications. The pharmacy was completely renovated and two adjustable dispensing benches were installed. On completion staff reported favourably on a reduction of discomfort, improved workflow and space, a reduction in errors from easier tracking of prescriptions, easier cleaning and an overall more pleasant working environment. The ergonomics analysis provided an objective rationale to highlight the need for management to take action and as a result the layout and workflow of the whole pharmacy was improved...|$|E
40|$|Drawing upon {{qualitative}} {{methods of}} semi-structured interviews and observational <b>talk-through</b> interviews, this qualitative dissertation investigates {{the ways in}} which graduate students in an online course context experience online instructional videos. A conceptual framework of user experience and multimodality, as well as the framework of sense-making developed by McCarthy and Wright (2004) guided this study and data analysis. The findings of this dissertation have implications for how students are participating in, interacting with, and making sense of online learning environments. Some of the findings of this research include: (a) students do not necessarily experience course videos as discrete elements (or differentiate them with other aspects of the course); (b) the times and contexts in which students view instructional videos shifts (e. g., between home and commuting); (c) student motivations and expectations shape how they approach and orient themselves towards watching online course videos; and (d) multimodal design elements influence students’ meaning-making of online instructional videos. These data findings are all in support of the overarching conclusion of this dissertation, which is that students have significant agency in these online environments, and their meaning-making of online videos may not align with designers’ intentions. This conclusion argues against deterministic views of design. The emerging findings have design implications related to the creation of learning environments in online spaces, such as: (a) fully integrating videos within the broader instructional design of a course; (b) foregrounding the embedded context of instructional videos; and (c) accounting for the shifting times, places, and contexts in which viewers watch instructional videos. This dissertation is situated in the growing field of online education, in particular higher education, where significant money and resources are increasingly dedicated towards the development of online spaces while still much is unknown in relation to the design, experiences, and impact of these online learning environments...|$|E
