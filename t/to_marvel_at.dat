5|$|In 1741, the Chamouny {{valley and}} its glaciers {{on the north}} side of the massif were {{discovered}} and written about by two aristocratic travelling Englishmen, named William Windham and Richard Pococke. The descriptions of their exploits were published across Europe, bringing the mountains of the Mont Blanc range to the attention of a wide audience for the first time. In 1760, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure offered a large financial prize to the first people who successfully ascended Mont Blanc. The summit was finally attained on 8 August 1786 by two Chamonix men, the guide Jacques Balmat and Dr. Michel Paccard. The decades that followed saw the gradual opening up of Chamonix to the world, as well as the rest of the Mont Blanc massif. The many published accounts of climbs and impressive sights amongst or around the mountain range attracted numerous wealthy and notable visitors, for whom a visit <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> the Sea of Ice (the Mer de Glace) became a fashionable thing to experience.|$|E
25|$|A {{railway station}} was opened in 1903 {{a few hundred}} yards west of its current {{position}} and railway companies often ran excursions to the town, bringing people <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> the social experiment and sometimes to mock it: Letchworth's founding citizens, attracted by the promise of a better life, were often caricatured by outsiders as idealistic and otherworldly. John Betjeman in his poems Group Life: Letchworth and Huxley Hall painted Letchworth people as earnest health freaks.|$|E
25|$|Father Walke was a High Churchman and {{the changes}} in {{services}} which he introduced were strange {{to the members of}} the congregation. Many came in the early days <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> the curious goings on in a communion service unlike the morning prayer to which they were accustomed. However this did not persist and many became hostile and stayed away while others remained faithful worshippers. The open air services he held late on Sundays on the Downs were however popular. W. H. Frere, Bishop of Truro, 1923–35, approved of many aspects of Walke's ministry but their views differed on reservation of the blessed sacrament: the bishop held that it was within his authority while Walke maintained it was inherent in that of a parish priest.|$|E

500|$|Veerapandiya Kattabomman {{received}} positive reviews upon release. Ananda Vikatan, in {{its original}} review dated 24 May 1959, praised the performance of Sivaji Ganesan, and said the film would make any Tamil proud. Baradwaj Rangan praised Ganesan's performance, stating that: [...] "To watch Veerapandiya Kattabomman is <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> the shades and nuances an actor can infuse into oratory."

Fitzmaurice wrote in conclusion, [...] "Along with this purely visceral pleasure, it's hard not <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> how awesome those growling-lion samples sound." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times said that he liked the song and viewed it as a [...] "syrupy instrumental" [...] that foreshadows [...] "the convergence of hip-hop, dance and rock".|$|E

[...] The paper called the film [...] "a marvelous arrangement of colored drawings", referring to the final explosive sequence, which McCay had hand-painted red (colored versions of this sequence have not survived). [...] The New York Morning Telegraph remarked, [...] " [...] moving pictures of his drawings have caused even film magnates <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> their cleverness and humor".

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s, DC had seen its {{dominance}} of the market overtaken by Marvel Comics, partly because Marvel had significantly {{increased the number of}} titles it published (both original material and reprint books).

500|$|Reviews were {{initially}} mixed, but have since {{become much more}} positive. At first Rolling Stone called the songs [...] "swell, but... entirely mannered and derivative" [...] and noted that the arrangements [...] "aren't bad", although the musicians were commended. The review ended with the assertion that the [...] "principals have some growing to do." [...] Modern reviews are more positive, however. Allmusic declares [...] "this is Grand Guignol pop—epic, gothic, operatic, and silly, and it's appealing because of all of this." [...] They acknowledge that Steinman is [...] "a composer without peer, simply because nobody else wanted to make mini-epics like this." [...] Rundgren's production is applauded, as is the wit in the music and lyrics. [...] "It may elevate adolescent passion to operatic dimensions, and that's certainly silly, but it's hard not <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> the skill behind this grandly silly, irresistible album." ...|$|E
500|$|Expectations {{about the}} {{performance}} and their engagement with it have changed over time (1). For example, in England during the 18th century, [...] "the prejudice against actresses had faded" [...] and in Europe generally, going to the theatre, once a socially dubious activity, became [...] "a more respectable middle-class pastime" [...] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the variety of popular entertainments increased. Operetta and music halls became available, and new drama theatres such as the Moscow Art Theatre and the Suvorin Theatre in Russia opened. At the same time, commercial newspapers [...] "began to carry theatre columns and reviews" [...] that helped make theatre [...] "a legitimate subject of intellectual debate" [...] in general discussions about art and culture. Audiences began to gather to [...] "appreciate creative achievement, <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at,</b> and be entertained by, the prominent 'stars'." [...] Vaudeville and music halls, popular {{at this time in}} the United States, England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, were themselves eventually superseded.|$|E
500|$|Stan Lee tweeted in February 2010 that Marvel was {{prepping}} {{the film}} and that he met with Wright for lunch to discuss the character. Wright noted {{that there was no}} timetable for the film because Marvel did not consider the character to be one of their bigger, tentpole properties, so [...] "It's more like me and Kevin Feige saying...'Let's make a good script that works, that's all about a great genre film, and that isn't necessarily relying on anything else'". At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright said that Ant-Man would not fit in the chronology of The Avengers due to the origin story he had written not working in the MCU. In January 2011, Wright stated that he had resumed writing the script for the film following the conclusion of the international promotion for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and by April he and Cornish delivered the second draft of Ant-Man <b>to</b> <b>Marvel.</b> <b>At</b> the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright revealed a third draft had been handed in.|$|E

50|$|The comic {{changed when}} in 1978 Dez Skinn {{was hired by}} Stan Lee <b>to</b> head <b>Marvel</b> UK. Skinn revamped all of Marvel UK's titles, {{including}} The Mighty World of Marvel, changing the title <b>to</b> <b>Marvel</b> Comic <b>at</b> #330 (January 24, 1979). This saw a move towards more traditional UK boys' adventure-type comics as Daredevil was joined (or re-joined) by Dracula, Conan the Barbarian, Shang-Chi, Skull the Slayer, and Godzilla, who replaced the Hulk three issues after the re-launch.|$|R

500|$|The grand fu of the Western Han dynasty {{were read}} and recited as {{celebrations}} of pure poetic delight, {{and were the}} first pieces of Chinese literature to fuse both unrestrained entertainment and moral admonitions together in single works. [...] However, after the reign of Emperor Wu, his court culture began to be criticized as having placed undue emphasis on the grandiose language in fu and therefore having missed opportunities to encourage moral restraint. [...] The most prominent critic of [...] "grand fu" [...] was the other great fu writer of the Han dynasty: Yang Xiong. [...] As a youth, Yang was an admirer and imitator of Sima Xiangru's fu, but later came to disapprove of grand fu. [...] Yang believed that the original purpose of fu was to [...] "indirectly admonish" [...] (fèng [...] ), but that the extended rhetorical arguments and complex vocabulary used in grand fu caused their hearers and readers <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> their aesthetic beauty while missing their moral messages. [...] Yang juxtaposed early Han dynasty fu with the fu-like expositions in the Classic of Poetry, saying that while those in the Poetry provided moral standards, the fu of the Han poets [...] "led to excess". [...] While {{known as one of}} the fu masters of the Han dynasty, Yang's fu are generally known for their focus on admonishing readers and listeners to uphold moral values.|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at?</b> Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{has long}} been {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} beautiful actresses in Hollywood, a designation The Daily Telegraph Mick Brown considers to be both [...] "a defining characteristic in her acting career" [...] and [...] "a curse". Pfeiffer initially struggled to convince casting agents and directors to take her seriously as an actress because they perceived her as little more than a pretty face during the early stages of her career. Pfeiffer's acting abilities continued to be overshadowed by her beauty even several years after her breakout performance in Scarface (1983); she responded by pursuing roles in which being blond is not a requirement. The Daily Beast Elizabeth Kaye recognized Pfeiffer among Hollywood's rare [...] "beautiful women" [...] who trust that it is possible to be physically beautiful and serious simultaneously. Kaye believes that the actress achieves this feat by [...] "grafting the sensibility of a modern woman onto the glamour of a '30s icon"; Rolling Stones Gerri Hirshey agreed that Pfeiffer's roles combine [...] "Nineties guts and Thirties glamour." [...] For Interview magazine, Peter Stone described Pfeiffer as a [...] "Blond, sultry, and ethereal" [...] actress with an [...] "unforgettable" [...] face. Nisha Lilia Diu, another The Daily Telegraph contributor, opined, [...] "It's not that she looks younger than she is – she doesn't particularly – it's the symmetry of her bone structure, the flashing aquamarine eyes and those lips, the top one so much fuller than the bottom. It's the kind of beauty you find yourself involuntarily taking a moment <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> mid-conversation." [...] At least two of Pfeiffer's films, Stardust (2007) and Chéri (2009), in which she plays a 5, 000 year old witch obsessed with beauty and a courtesan fading into obscurity, respectively, explore themes of beautiful women struggling with the idea of aging. Pfeiffer personally identified with the topic of [...] "our obsession with youth and the ludicrous degrees to which women will go to reclaim it" [...] portrayed in the films. Pfeiffer claims to not want to appear younger than she is and has yet to undergo plastic surgery, although she admits she would [...] "never say never" [...] to the procedure. Dismissing the claim that she is [...] "drop dead gorgeous", insisting that she is only [...] "conventionally pretty". Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, comparing herself to Howard the Duck.|$|E

[...] In 1999, Q magazine wrote that the album [...] "shows him as the authentic voice of love's pain and purity on such wonders as 'How Can You Mend A Broken Heart?'" [...] and that [...] "is cover of the Bee Gees' [...] took the soul ballad to new levels of artistry and refinement." ...|$|E

Crowds gathered on the waterfront of Charleston <b>to</b> <b>marvel</b> <b>at</b> and celebrate the completed battery in ceremony on March 15 despite cold weather. A Seven gun salute was fired to honor the seven states that had already seceded and after a pause, an additional gun was fired on behalf of Arkansas whose secession was pending. Public reaction in the North to the floating battery was as marked as had been their Southern counterparts' enthusiasm. The New York Herald invited readers to visit their offices so they could see a palmetto log {{similar to those used}} in the battery. The Herald also posted that another log had been brought north to sell to showman P.T. Barnum but that Barnum had balked at the $150 asking price.|$|E

In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker. The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear, and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover.

Sony Pictures chairman Thomas Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively <b>to</b> <b>Marvel.</b> <b>At</b> CinemaCon 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be Spider-Man: Homecoming, a reference to the common high school tradition homecoming as well as the character [...] "coming home" [...] to Marvel and the MCU.
