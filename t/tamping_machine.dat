40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] 31 railway {{workers and}} 32 lumberjacks were {{examined}} {{to compare the}} dose-response relation between the exposure to two types of hand-arm vibration and the sensory disturbances in peripheral nerves as evaluated by the vibration perception thresholds (VPTs). METHODS [...] Clinical examinations were carried out that included measurements of the VPTs, and electroneuromyography (ENMG), and an inquiry to confirm the use of vibrating tools. Diseases of {{the central nervous system}} and neuropathies were checked by inquiry and a clinical examination, diabetes was excluded by a blood sample analysis, and the subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome confirmed with ENMG were excluded from the study. RESULTS [...] Lifetime use of hand held <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> (railway workers) and chain saws (lumberjacks) had a significant correlation with the VPTs at frequencies from 32 to 500 Hz. The increase of the VPTs (250 Hz) in relation to use of vibrating tools was 1. 8 -fold higher on average in the whole group and 2. 3 -fold higher in the young (< 45) railway workers who had used hand held <b>tamping</b> <b>machines,</b> than in the corresponding groups of lumberjacks, who had used chain saws, whereas the frequency weighted acceleration of vibration in <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> was fourfold. CONCLUSION [...] There was a significant dose-response relation between the exposure to hand-arm vibration and the VPTs. The VPTs {{as a function of the}} frequency weighted acceleration of vibration and the exposure to vibration gave promising results for assessment of the risk of damage to sensory nerves induced by vibration...|$|R

50|$|A <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> or ballast tamper is {{a machine}} used to pack (or tamp) the track ballast under railway tracks {{to make the}} tracks more durable. Prior to the {{introduction}} of mechanical tampers, this task was done by manual labour with the help of beaters. As well as being faster, more accurate, more efficient and less labour-intensive, tamping machines are essential for the use of concrete sleepers since they are too heavy (usually over 250 kg) to be lifted by hand. Whilst also available as a plain tamper with no lifting or lining function this article will focus on the multi function machines.|$|E

For decades, Besser block was a worldwide standard term for masonry construction blocks. The Alpena-based Besser Company, which inventor Besser ran for many decades, manufactured these machines and made a fortune for Besser and his family. Concrete block became a feature of worldwide construction solutions in World War II and following years. Commencing in 1964, Besser turned over part of his assets to the newly founded Jesse Besser Museum, now known as the Besser Museum for Northeast Michigan, as an endowment.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Union {{made the}} {{transition}} to automatic brakes and couplers long after the United States did {{and as a result}} their brakes and couplers were more advanced.Their (air) brakes could operate in a mode where it was possible to slowly reduce braking effort, while the US system required full release of the brakes (in the entire train) and reapplication of the brakes in order to reduce braking effort.The Soviet Union developed advanced machinery for track maintenance and renewal such as a Continuous Action <b>Tamping</b> <b>Machine</b> which in 1977 could move at 3 km/hr and also straighten the track and dress the ballast. It was model ВПО-3000 (VPO-3000) and at that time no such machinery like this existed outside of the Soviet Union. It was claimed to be several times faster than non-Soviet tamping machinery of cyclical action. However, the reliability of locomotives in the USSR was much worse than for the US. Their high traffic density often resulted in traffic congestion and delays, especially after an accident blocked the line.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} use {{of these}} locomotives has been to haul trains using power from the rails until they reach the area where work is to be undertaken, where they switch to battery operation if the traction supply has been isolated. They are also used for transporting diesel powered equipment such as track <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> through tunnel sections. Normally one locomotive is marshalled {{at each end of}} the train, allowing the train to be reversed easily. The connections between different Underground lines often require reversals on route. Early locomotives were not allowed to operate on their own as they only had a single air compressor, but twin compressors were fitted to vehicles built from 1964 onwards, to allow single operation.With the building of the Jubilee line diesel-powered locomotives manufactured by Schöma of Germany in 1996 took over some of the duties of the battery locomotives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{requirements}} of higher speed, safety and more smooth and comfortable travelling are increasing strongly, {{this leads to}} the need of predictive maintenance of railway line, <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> have been used for this purpose. This paper presents the results of vibration characteristic of tamping device. Firstly, the basic working principle of tamping device was simply described; Then a simulation model of tamping device was established using SIMULINK in terms of mechanism principle; Finally, some vibration parameters were researched, such as velocity, acceleration, displacement of tamping device, which reflect the vibration characteristic of tamping device. In addition, the modeling process of simulation model was described, the function of SIMULINK was also simply recommended. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} propose an analysis method on facility vibration characteristic, which visualized reflects the kinematics characteristic of mechanism. The results show that the application of the technology can make the simulation process more visualization. The modeling process more simply, thus greatly improve modeling and simulation efficiency, and directly achieve our aims...|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} granule size {{fractions of}} Sorbitol instant(R) were filled into hard gelatine capsules on a tamp filling (Bosch) and a dosator nozzle machine (Zanasi) to allow {{comparison of the}} filling principles. An acceptable filling performance was always achieved and was independent of the <b>machine</b> type employed. <b>Tamp</b> filling {{was found to be}} slightly better for the coarser granule size fractions, because {{it does not seem to}} rely on a firm plug formation. A direct relationship between the angle of internal flow (Varthalis and Pilpel, 1976) and the coefficient of fill weight variation was found for both systems. Using the dosator nozzle machine, the plug formed was always denser than the maximum bulk density, whereas on the <b>tamp</b> filling <b>machine</b> for smallest granule size the maximum plug density could not be achieved with the settings employed. The results suggest that in situations where a low plug density is an essential prerequisite for drug dissolution and bioavailability the <b>tamp</b> filling <b>machine</b> appears the more suitable filling principle. However, if a greater extent of compression is required in order to fill large dose drugs or to use a smaller capsule size, the dosator nozzle principle might work more successfully for granules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The article {{deals with}} the {{conception}} of carrying out investigation work on lateral resistance {{in the course of}} geometrical railway track alignment by using a <b>tamping</b> <b>machine.</b> It is a continuation of the experimental work on the application of the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> to the continuous welded rail track diagnosis. In earlier articles, attention was concentrated on the determination of axial forces in rails. An analytical approach to the evaluation of lateral resis-tances based on a continuous registration of the displacement and the force used by the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> for the displacement of track on a horizontal plane (so-called slewing or shifting) is presented. The obtained results offer a possibility of estimating a phenomenon tested taking into consideration the state of the track ballast (the layer of crushed rock or gravel upon which the railway track is laid) bed stabilization, the distribution of the lateral resistances occurring along the length of railway track sections under tests, and also the effect of the longitudinal forces appear in track sections. The performed experiments have confirmed the thesis about the use of the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> to diagnose the lateral resistance state in railway tracks. Some trends towards further undertakings in this sphere, of development character intended to polish up the measuring system, and the way of archiving and interpreting the measuring results have been formulated...|$|E

30|$|Plan the {{maintenance}} for each track. Maintenance planning {{is done by}} the Trafikverket contractor. The car inspection records the faults, as shown in Fig.  4, and equates risk level to required maintenance. Corrective tamping maintenance is governed by regulations in the SS-EN 13848 standard and preventive tamping should be planned in advance. There are two main aspects to consider in maintenance planning: applying for track possession time and decreasing {{the maintenance}} cost by predicting the required tamping. For instance, predicting tamping for nine months is enough time to consider the maintenance plan and budget. However, the costs depend on the distance of the track needing maintenance and the location needing maintenance. Another person claimed setting up a maintenance plan for a certain part of the track will help estimate the cost required to order the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine.</b> At the same time, it will decrease the cost and improve the track quality and performance.|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} suggests that, ballast {{is the main}} cause of uniform and non-uniform settlement of railway track, provided the subgrade is adequately specified. Over a period of time uneven settlement of the ballast will cause voids to form under the sleepers leading to unacceptable ride quality of track. Regular maintenance is required to keep track geometry within acceptable limits and to maintain ride quality of the track. The two layered ballast system proposes to replace the crib ballast by stone of smaller size. The aim is to fill the voids beneath the sleeper as soon as they become unacceptably large and to maintain ride quality of track without use of tamping or stone-blowing. Preliminary model tests have been carried out on the proposed system which indicate good potential for it. The results of the model tests have been validated by full scale tests in the laboratory. The tests have shown that by replacing crib ballast by stone of smaller size a void beneath the sleeper will be filled up to less than, the void size minus the average particle size of crib ballast. The system is self maintaining and keeps track vertical profile within tolerable limits without use of Stone blowing or <b>Tamping</b> <b>machines.</b> Full scale live track trials on the proposed system are planned for, later this year...|$|R
50|$|This method {{can be done}} manually, {{and this}} method is still used in the UK. However, due to the {{complexity}} of the calculations over long lengths of track, it is now often done by computer, with the track geometry data being loaded straight onto a computer controlled <b>tamping</b> and lining <b>machine</b> for implementation.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{machines}} only {{lifted the}} track and packed the ballast. More modern machines, sometimes known as a tamper-liner or <b>tamping</b> and lining <b>machine,</b> also correct the alignment of the rails to make them parallel and level, {{in order to achieve}} a more comfortable ride for passengers and freight and to reduce the mechanical strain applied to the rails by passing trains. This is done by finding places where the sleepers have sunk from the weight of the passing trains or frost action, causing the track to sag. The tamper lifts each sleeper and the rails up, and packs ballast underneath. When the sleeper is laid down again, the sagged rails now sit at the proper level. In cases where frost action has caused adjacent rails to rise higher, ballast tampers can raise rails above their original level to make the line level again. [...] "Lining" [...] rails doesn't involve ballast tamping, it merely ensures the rails are perfectly parallel and straight as possible. Combining tamping and lining into a single machine saves time and money, as only one machine needs to be run over the track to perform both functions.|$|R
