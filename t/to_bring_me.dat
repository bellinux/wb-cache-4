After scoring the winning goal for his side, Mohammed Rafique was very happy while also singing the praises of his coach, saying, [...] "I cannot describe what I am feeling in words," [...] said the midfielder. [...] "I {{would like to thank}} my coach, who had faith in me. It was he who decided <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> on and what happened next was surreal.

500|$|McCall {{was picked}} for England and Scotland under-21 sides {{on the same}} day in 1984, and chose to join the England under-21 squad for their game against Turkey. However he was only picked as a {{substitute}} and the referee blew the final whistle, with McCall waiting to come on. He later told Scottish newspaper Glasgow Herald, [...] "I felt it was a mistake almost from the start. I was put on the bench and they tried <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> on with a minute to go. But I took my time re-tying my boots and generally warming up and luckily didn't get on, otherwise that would have been that." [...] Since he had not actually played for England, McCall was still eligible for Scotland. He eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father. He made his Scotland debut at under-21 level in March 1988, ironically against England. McCall made one more appearance for Scotland under 21s, against France in 1990.|$|E
500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone noted [...] "the album de-emphasizes the (very) guilty pop pleasures of her 2004 debut {{in favor of}} leaden I-hate-you-Daddy laments such as [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "My Innocence". Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt commented that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine a}} more explicit snapshot of the highly publicized family problems that have plagued the star than [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)"". PopMatters's Whitney Strub said [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] "immediately commences with a line about 'wait for the postman <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> a letter', which suggests songwriters dipping into the well of cliché without worrying about freshness," [...] while commenting that [...] "the world might not need another version of Britney Spears' 'E-Mail My Heart', but good lord, that song came out in 1999. Perhaps a text-message might arrive faster than snail-mail in late 2005, should Lohan's song-persona deign to enter the 21st century".|$|E

500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to The North Stands for Nothing {{was generally}} positive. Several reviewers noted {{on the balance}} that While She Sleeps have between melody and the heavier elements of their sound. Metal Hammer reviewer Terry Bezer, specifically complimented the track [...] "Hearts Aside Our Horses"– enthusing that it is [...] "a lesson in how to be both progressive and hook laden at once." [...] Adam Kennedy of Kerrang! complimented the band for putting [...] "their own spin" [...] on metalcore. Saying that they test and respect the genre's conventions in equal measure– specifically noting their use of a piano interlude on [...] "Trophies" [...] while suggesting that [...] "tearing heads off is their forte". In his review for Big Cheese, Lais Martin Wairing enthused that the band are [...] "very promising," [...] comparing them <b>to</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>Me</b> the Horizon but offering that While She Sleeps [...] "deserve success in their own right." [...] The album also received some minor criticism, with several reviewers picking up on the short overall length of the CD and While She Sleeps' similarities to other bands. In a generally favorable review for The New Review, Jen Rochester said that the CD [...] "is over before you know it," [...] while concluding that [...] "it’s definitely an effort worth checking out." [...] Similarly, Dom Wyatt of Dead Press! said that The North Stands for Nothing {{is very similar to}} Hollow Crown by Architects but that it is a [...] "cracking debut" [...] that While She Sleeps should be proud of.|$|E
500|$|... "Blank Page" [...] is {{a simplistic}} piano {{arranged}} ballad, which lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and four seconds). Her vocal range spans from F3 to G5. Lyrically, {{the song is}} about how Aguilera wishes to [...] "wipe the slate clean" [...] with a former lover and [...] "reconcile an old romance". She knows that she has wronged him, but is asking {{to be given a}} second chance. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by Aguilera in the lyrics [...] "If I could do undo that I hurt you/ I would do anything for us to make it through". The song begins with the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings [...] "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I do I say I'm sorry?/ How do I say I'm sorry?." [...] On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: [...] "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one forever". The arrangement of the minimalist piano composition is [...] "fiery" [...] yet [...] "spare". Aside from garnering innumerable comparisons to Aguilera's own song [...] "Beautiful", the composition of [...] "Blank Page" [...] was subject to critique by Jim Farber writing for New York Daily News.

2500|$|After {{over forty}} {{years on the}} air {{one of the most}} {{important}} aspects of the show is its huge stock of running gags which, if not always funny in themselves, can elicit huge anticipatory laughter from the studio audience.

In the [...] "Film Club" [...] round any reference by Graeme Garden <b>to</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>Me</b> the Head of Alfredo Garcia is sure to cause a similar response.

2500|$|... "Qué Quieres Tú De Mí" [...] is an {{acoustic}} guitar ballad which Queen {{covered in a}} minor-key; it features traditional Afro-Latin American influences. It was originally written in 1964 by Brazilian composers Evaldo Gouveia and Jair Amorim as [...] "Que Queres Tu De Mim" [...] for Brazilian singer Altemar Dutra. [...] "Que Lloren" [...] features minor key tonality, bowed strings, a string ensemble and elements of techno music. The song's lyrics show a woman's view of romance and belittles the stereotype that men shouldn't show emotions. The mid-tempo [...] "Sentimientos", {{is a blend of}} reggaetón and bachata music known as bachaton or bachateo, a musical movement in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico which combines bachata melodies and reggaeton style beats, lyrics, rapping, and disc jockeying. It features minor key tonality, mixed acoustic and electric instrumentation, bowed strings, a string ensemble, and ambient synthesizers. Ivy Queen indicated that the song emphasized human connection over material things, stating that [...] "What I wanted to say in the song is that material things have never been important to me.... I look for genuine feelings, honesty, the things that come from the heart, because the material things I can get." [...] In another interview, she identified the song as the one that best represented her at that time, explaining, [...] "if you think you can only conquer me if you're famous, rich and have an expensive car, you're wrong, because I'm a woman who needs affection, someone to open the door for me, <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> flowers and sing to me." ...|$|E
