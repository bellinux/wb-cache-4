5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing.</b> The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E
5|$|Hiroyuki, usually {{referred}} to as Yuki, is a tall and attractive trans woman living with her boyfriend Shiina. Yuki takes an early interest in Yoshino when she believes Yoshino to be a boy, though remains on good terms with Yoshino even after learning of Yoshino's assigned sex, and gives Shuichi and Yoshino helpful advice when they are troubled. Despite the differences between their situations, Yuki sees a lot of herself in Shuichi: when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> up, Shiina was the only friend who stood by the young Hiroyuki, as she was called then, while girls teased her and the boys bullied her to change. Yuki always keeps up a positive attitude, and runs a gay bar. Since her transition, {{she has not been}} on good terms with her parents, who run a uniform store.|$|E

5|$|The park's {{earliest}} human inhabitants {{arrived at}} least 8,000 years ago. By about 2,000 years ago, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> corn {{in the area}} and shortly thereafter building pit houses in what would become the park. Later inhabitants built above-ground dwellings called pueblos. Although a changing climate caused the last of the park's pueblos to be abandoned by about 1400CE, more than 600 archeological sites, including petroglyphs, have been discovered in the park. In the 16thcentury, Spanish explorers visited the area, and by the mid-19thcentury a U.S. team had surveyed an east–west route through the area where the park is now located and noted the petrified wood. Later, roads and a railway followed similar routes and gave rise to tourism and, before the park was protected, to large-scale removal of fossils. Theft of petrified wood remains a problem in the 21stcentury.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E
5|$|The {{country was}} {{historically}} about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities {{over most of}} the country. Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there. It became known internationally as the Protestant Rome, being base for such reformers as Theodore Beza or William Farel. Zürich became another stronghold around the same time, with Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger, later joined by fleeing Peter Martyr Vermigli, taking the lead there. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete {{separation of church and state}} was rejected by 78.9% of the voters. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority, not because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> in members, quite the contrary, but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012) especially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%), canton of Neuchâtel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or Zürich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%).|$|E

25|$|Charles' {{mother is}} Alix de Foresta (born 4 April 1926), {{daughter}} of Albéric, comte de Foresta. Although {{she was the}} only consort of the surviving Imperial line not born a princess, her family had been nobles in Lombardy since the 13th century, becoming counts palatine in 1330, constables of Venice in 1425, then retainers of the powerful Doria family in Genoa. They settled in Provence, France early in the 16th century, where they acquired twenty-two manors and the title of marquis by 1651. Ironically, the Forestas distinguished themselves during the French Restoration as courtiers loyal to the House of Bourbon, and to Henri, comte de Chambord in particular. Long established as squires of large estates and rice paddies in the Camargue, the Forestas often welcomed Charles and his siblings there while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> up.|$|E

25|$|Going {{into the}} game, the Giants were 5–6. A three-game losing streak {{on the road}} had made the team's playoff {{prospects}} much dimmer since midseason. However, a win at home against the favored Eagles could, the team hoped, reverse the trend and keep an outside shot at a playoff spot alive. Despite the team's storied past, the Giants had not played in the postseason since 1963 and had managed only two winning seasons since then. Although they were the league's fourth oldest franchise, they were almost a non-entity in the post-merger NFL. The move to New Jersey in 1976 had alienated some longtime fans, even if it made more seats available. Fans had never gone this long without a contender, but while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> restless, they were still forgiving.|$|E
25|$|Oral history {{provides}} {{evidence for}} how housewives {{in a modern}} industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.|$|E

25|$|This {{would also}} {{affect the way}} their {{offspring}} looked like in the early instars, resembling earlier ametabolous generations even after they had started {{to adapt to a}} new way of living, in a habitat where they actually could have some good use for flaps along their body. Since they matured {{in the same way as}} thysanurans with plenty of moultings as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> and very little difference between the adults and much younger individuals (unlike modern insects, which are hemimetabolous or holometabolous), there probably wasn't much room for adapting into different niches depending on age and stage. Also, it would have been difficult for an animal already adapted to a niche to make a switch to a new niche later in life based on age or size differences alone when these differences were not significant.|$|E

Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer.

25|$|The {{earliest}} known relative on her mother's side is her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields (1844-1938), who {{was held}} {{as a slave}} {{on a farm in}} Clayton County, North Georgia. Her master was Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm near Rex. He would have worked along with his slaves. Melvinia became pregnant at about age 15 and had a biracial son, Dolphus T. Shields, born into slavery about 1860. Melvinia did not talk to relatives about his father. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said the father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. After the Civil War, Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama. Charles later became a teacher and married a white woman. Michelle Obama's extended family has said that people didn't talk about slavery time while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> up. Michelle Obama's distant ancestry also includes Irish and other European roots.|$|E

25|$|The García {{government}} {{reacted to}} the growing external deficit {{in exactly the same}} way as had the governments of Velasco and of Belaúnde—by postponing corrective action while the problem continued to worsen. As ever, a major fear was that devaluation would worsen inflation. Inflationary pressures were, in fact, beginning to worsen behind the façade of control. To some degree, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> in response to the high rate of growth of demand and output, reducing margins of previously underutilized productive capacity. But the more explosive pressures were being built up by relying on price controls that required a dramatic expansion of credit to keep the system in place. Prices of public sector services—gasoline above all, oil products in general, electricity, telephones, and postal services—were frozen at levels that soon became almost ridiculous in real terms. The restrictions on prices charged by state firms drove them ever deeper into deficits that had to be financed by borrowing. The borrowing came from wherever it could, but principally from the Central Bank. At the same time, Central Bank credit rose steadily to keep financing agricultural expansion. Still another direction of Central Bank credit creation was the financing used to handle the government's new structure of multiple exchange rates. Differential rates were used to hold down the cost of foreign exchange for most imports, again with the dominant goal of holding down inflation, while higher prices of foreign exchange were paid to exporters to protect their incentives to export. The Central Bank thus paid more for the foreign exchange it bought than it received for the exchange it sold.|$|E
