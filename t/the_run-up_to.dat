5|$|Robinson's first {{position}} in broadcasting was at Piccadilly Radio in Manchester, {{which he took}} up while recovering from his injuries. He joined the BBC in 1986 as a production trainee, and later worked extensively as a television and radio producer {{for a variety of}} shows including Newsround and Crimewatch. He then became an assistant producer for On the Record, and in 1993 was promoted to deputy editor of Panorama, a position he held for three years. In 1995, whilst Robinson was at Panorama, he wrote an internal BBC memorandum questioning how an interview with Prime Minister John Major could be defended in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the Scottish local elections. When leaked, this gained attention from the Labour Party, which perceived it as the legitimised denial of equal time in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> local elections.|$|E
5|$|Tibetan Filmmaker Dhondup Wangcheng {{was sentenced}} to six {{years in prison for}} making a {{documentary}} on human rights in Tibet in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the Beijing Olympics.

50|$|When using <b>run-up</b> {{enhancements}} like <b>the</b> multi-slope <b>run-up,</b> where {{a portion}} of the converter's resolution is resolved during <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> phase, it is possible to eliminate the run-down phase altogether by using a second type of analog-to-digital converter. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> phase of a multi-slope run-up conversion, there will still be an unknown amount of charge remaining on the integrator's capacitor. Instead of using a traditional run-down phase to determine this unknown charge, the unknown voltage can be converted directly by a second converter and combined with the result from <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> phase <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> unknown input voltage.|$|R
50|$|The Bloc Québécois (BQ) {{had managed}} their best showing back in 1993, but they lost seats to the Liberals in 1997 and 2000, {{prompting}} pundits {{to suggest a}} decline in support for Quebec sovereignty. The Bloc continued to slide in the polls in most of 2003 after {{the election of the}} federalist Quebec Liberal Party at the National Assembly of Quebec under Jean Charest, and during <b>the</b> long <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> Paul Martin becoming leader of the federal Liberals.|$|R
50|$|Lopez, {{along with}} Joan Gramatte his {{business}} partner in Nuestro and also co-founder of the parent corporation Nuestro Grafico Inc., a successful graphic design and consulting company based in Washington, D.C., initially funded <b>the</b> preliminary <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> publication expenses with their own money. Then, with a solid business plan in place, they secured staff and production funding (more than $1.1 million) for the venture from the Federal Government's Small Business Administration (SBA), the prestigious Ford Foundation, and several private investors.|$|R
5|$|A Passion for Churches is a 1974 BBC {{television}} documentary written and {{presented by the}} then Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman and produced and directed by Edward Mirzoeff. Commissioned as a follow-up to the critically acclaimed 1973 documentary Metro-land, the film offers Betjeman's personal poetic record of the goings-on taking place throughout the Anglican Diocese of Norwich and its churches in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> Easter Sunday using the framing device of the Holy sacraments.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second Battle of Fallujah, the Marines faced {{three main}} tasks: {{providing}} humanitarian {{assistance to the}} hundreds of thousands of refugees returning to the city, retaking the numerous towns and cities they had abandoned along the Euphrates in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the battle, and providing security for the Iraqi parliamentary elections scheduled for 30 January.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{after the}} old Boer republics {{received}} self-government, and in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> {{the formation of}} the Union of South Africa, leading Afrikaner politicians J.C. Smuts and L. Botha asked Reitz to return to South Africa and play a role in politics again. Together with his wife, he established himself in Sea Point, Cape Town. In 1910, already sixty-six years old, he was appointed president of the Senate of the newly formed Union of South Africa.|$|E
50|$|He was {{selected}} for the Netherlands Olympic squad and was absolute first choice central defender during <b>the</b> entire <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Olympics, where he made a confident impression, seldom making a mistake. He played in all the group games, where the Dutch barely qualified for the quarter finals, coming second on points. He also played the quarter-final against Argentina, where they were eliminated. After the full 90 minutes and extra time had resulted in a 1-1 draw, they surprisingly lost 2-1.|$|R
50|$|Saint Agatha's Eve is a {{traditional}} event taking place {{at the beginning of}} February or end of January in many spots of the Basque Country. It holds a small but cherished slot in <b>the</b> city's <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Carnival. Groups dressed up in Basque traditional farmer costume march across the neighbourhood singing and wielding a characteristic stick beaten on the ground to the rhythm of the traditional Saint Agatha's tune. The singers ask for a small donation, which can be money, a drink or something to eat.|$|R

5|$|In {{some ways}} <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> Plataea resembled {{that at the}} Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the 1872 election, Macdonald {{had yet to}} {{formulate}} a railway policy, or to devise the loan guarantees that {{would be needed to}} secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Menzies {{retired in}} January 1966, and was succeeded as prime {{minister}} by the new Liberal Party leader, Harold Holt. After years of politics being dominated by the elderly Menzies and Calwell, the younger Holt {{was seen as a}} breath of fresh air, and attracted public interest and support in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> the November election.|$|E
50|$|The betting {{odds for}} Super Bowl XLIX {{initially}} opened after {{the conclusion of}} the conference championship games with the Seahawks favored by 2.5 points, but within hours of opening, heavy betting on the Patriots had moved the line to a pick 'em at most sportsbooks. Over most of <b>the</b> two-week <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Super Bowl, the line held steady with the Patriots as slight 1-point favorites, but, on the day before the Super Bowl, a surge of large bets on the Seahawks pushed the line back to a toss-up.|$|R
50|$|More damagingly, Liu had {{encouraged}} {{his wife to}} become involved in politics during <b>the</b> confused <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cultural Revolution. In 1963 she joined a work team investigating corruption in the countryside, a mounting problem after the failure of the 1958-61 Great Leap Forward. And in mid-1966, when the Red Guards erupted on the scene - and Liu and other leaders floundered trying to fathom what Mao had in mind - she headed a work team to restore order among the students at Beijing's Tsinghua University: they would become her chief persecutors.|$|R
40|$|Using {{bootstrap}} panel analysis, {{allowing for}} cross cross-country correlation, {{without the need}} of pre pre-testing for unit roots, we study the causality between government spending and revenue for the EU in the period 1960 1960 - 2006. We find spend spend-and and-tax causality for Italy, France, Spain, Greece, and Portugal, while tax tax-and and-spend evidence is present for Germany, Belgium, Austria Finland and the UK, and for several EU New Member States. Moreover, in <b>the</b> run <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> EMU there was some shifting away from a spend spend-and and-tax strategy, implying adjustments of fiscal behaviour. fiscal sustainability, EU, causality tests...|$|R
5|$|Morrissey is {{a lifelong}} Liverpool FC fan, {{having grown up in}} the city. He is also a {{supporter}} of the Labour Party, as well as being a patron of the human rights organisation Reprieve.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|Fischer's career-long stubbornness about {{match and}} tournament {{conditions}} was again seen in <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjavík, Iceland. For a time {{it appeared that}} the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($ million today) and Fischer finally agreed to play.|$|E
50|$|With {{the fall}} of France, the need for {{infantry}} tanks to advance with troops started to be replaced with a need for Assault tanks, a new class with heavier frontal armour to take on battlefield defences. Infantry tanks proved capable in this new role however, and the designation was rarely applied outside of experimental production. The term saw limited use with both British and US forces in joint development. Hobart would later return to Martel's idea of Engineer tanks in <b>the</b> 1944 <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> D-Day with Hobarts Funnies, and specialised tanks became a core component of the modern battlefield.|$|R

However whilst the {{plotters}} waited at Pedro Sainz Rodríguez's house word came through from Franco that the right was not yet ready and for the plan to be aborted. Galarza however remained a central figure in the conspiracies and, based as he was in the War Ministry in Madrid, he was central in passing messages between the generals in <b>the</b> immediate <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Civil War.|$|R
