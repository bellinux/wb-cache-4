Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Risk assessment is a very valuable tool with which to frame complex environmental problems. Although risk assessment is a very valuable tool it does have significant limitations. There are many aspects of the process that introduce considerable amounts of uncertainty to the outcome. The majority of the uncertainty in a risk assessment is due to the toxicity and exposure assessments. Extrapolations of available data, generalizations of characteristics, "upper-bound" estimates, and assumptions about the exposed population are just a few assumptions that contribute to the overall uncertainty in a risk assessment. The focus of this research is on chemical mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This group of chemicals represents a class of man-made environmental pollutants to which humans are regularly exposed. The primary objective of this research is to reduce the uncertainty in the toxicity assessment of a complex mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This is accomplished by developing a "user-friendly" criterion for the development of <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factors</b> (TEFs) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that have little or no toxicity data. This criterion will also be used to develop <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factors</b> for the alkylated versions of the parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A secondary objective was to identify the sensitive parameters in the assessment. This will help to identify modifications that will be necessary in current software/model equations and to provide a means to better design sampling regimes. It is the overall goal of this research to provide improvements in the science of risk assessment of complex mixtures and lead to a more focused research area for the future. This research shows the importance of structure and substitutions of chemicals in the overall toxicity of that compound. Secondly, the proposed <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factors</b> (TEFs) increased the risk estimates two to four orders or magnitude from the intial assessments that did not include the <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factors</b> (TEFs).

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that frequently accumulate in soils.

PAHs are a suite of individual chemicals, and there is an ongoing debate as to the most appropriate method for assessing the risk to humans from them. Two methods predominate: the surrogate marker approach and the <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factor.</b> The former assumes that all chemicals in a mixture have an equivalent toxicity. The toxic equivalency approach estimates the potency of individual chemicals relative to the usually most toxic Benzo(a) pyrene. The surrogate marker approach is believed to overestimate risk and the <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factor</b> to underestimate risk. When analysing the risks from soils, the surrogate marker approach is preferred due to its simplicity, but there are concerns because of the potential diversity of the PAH profile across the range of impacted soils. Using two independent data sets containing soils from 274 sites across a diverse range of locations, statistical analysis was undertaken to determine the differences in the composition of carcinogenic PAH between site locations, for example, rural versus industrial. Following principal components analysis, distinct population differences were not seen between site locations in spite of large differences in the total PAH burden between individual sites. Using all data, highly significant correlations were seen between BaP and other carcinogenic PAH with the majority of r 2 values > 0. 8. Correlations with the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) summed groups, that is, EFSA 2, EFSA 4 and EFSA 8 had even higher correlations (r 2 > 0. 95).

The World Health Organisation (WHO) compiled a list of <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factors</b> (WHO-TEFs) in 1998 on the basis of which the EU maximum levels for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food were established.

In its review of the WHO-TEFs, WHO has now proposed adjusted factors for some dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. BfR was asked to assess the new WHO-TEFs. The changes to some WHO-TEFs, which have now been undertaken, are based according to WHO on provisional and statistical considerations in conjunction with an unchanged toxicological data situation and constitute an interim solution. Calculations by BfR by way of example show that the new TEFs in some cases lead to TEQ values which are between 10 - 20 % lower, i. e. lead to a lower classification of the toxicity of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.

The EU-project ‘SYSTEQ’ aimed to develop, validate, and implement human systemic TEFs as indicators of toxicity for DL-congeners. Hence, the identification of novel quantifiable biomarkers of exposure was a major objective of the SYSTEQ project. In order to approach to this objective, a mouse whole genome microarray analysis was applied using a set of seven individual congeners, termed the ‘core congeners’. These core congeners (TCDD, 1 -PeCDD, 4 -PeCDF, PCB 126, PCB 118, PCB 156, and the non dioxin-like PCB 153), which contribute to approximately 90...|$|E
40|$|A risk {{assessment}} was performed of parsley- and dill-based plant food supplements (PFS) containing apiol and related alkenylbenzenes. First, {{the levels of}} the alkenylbenzenes in the PFS and the resulting estimated daily intake (EDI) resulting from use of the PFS were quantified. Since most PFS appeared to contain more than one alkenylbenzene, a combined {{risk assessment}} was performed based on equal potency or using a so-called <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> (TEQ) approach based on <b>toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factors</b> (TEFs) for the different alkenylbenzenes. The EDIs resulting from daily PFS consumption amount to 0. 74 – 125 µg kg – 1 bw for the individual alkenylbenzenes, 0. 74 – 160 µg kg – 1 bw for {{the sum of the}} alkenylbenzenes, and 0. 47 – 64 µg kg – 1 bw for the sum of alkenylbenzenes when expressed in safrole equivalents. The margins of exposure (MOEs) obtained were generally below 10, 000, indicating a priority for risk management if the PFS were to be consumed on a daily basis. Considering short-term use of the PFS, MOEs would increase above 10, 000, indicating low priority for risk management. It is concluded that alkenylbenzene intake through consumption of parsley- and dill-based PFS is only of concern when these PFS are used for long periods of time. </p...|$|R

The toxicity equivalent (TEQ) values ranged from 9 to 25 pg TEQ g(- 1) lipid (WHO-TEF values, 2005 [Van den Berg, M., Birnbaum, L.

40|$|Abstract: An {{assessment}} of potential health impacts of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds in recycled water for indirect potable reuse was conducted. <b>Toxic</b> <b>equivalency</b> <b>factors</b> (TEFs) for 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) congeners {{have been developed}} by the World Health Organization to simplify the risk {{assessment of}} complex mixtures. Samples of secondary treated wastewater in Perth, Australia were examined pre-and post-tertiary treatment in one full-scale and one pilot water reclamation plant. Risk quotients (RQs) were estimated by expressing the middle-bound toxic equivalent (TEQ) and the upper-bound TEQ concentration in each sampling point {{as a function of}} the estimated health target value. The results indicate that reverse osmosis (RO) is able to reduce the concentration of PCDD, PCDF and dioxin-like PCBs and produce water of high quality (RQ after RO= 0. 15). No increased human health risk from dioxin and dioxin-like compounds is anticipated if highly treated recycled water is used to augment drinking water supplies in Perth. Recommendations for...|$|R
