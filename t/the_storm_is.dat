50|$|Although it <b>was</b> {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> named by a {{clerk at the}} UK's Met Office, the Met Office themselves have stated {{that they do not}} know who named <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> named by <b>the</b> Weather Channel UK meteorologist Leon Brown, after the feast of Saint Jude the Apostle, which takes place on 28 October, the day when <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> expected to be at its height. The name is reported to have been popularised on Twitter before being adopted by the media in the United Kingdom.|$|R

5|$|Like {{its parent}} Jeep Wrangler, <b>the</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>is</b> first and {{foremost}} an airmobile, capable offroad and utility vehicle meant to tackle extreme terrain in a general reconnaissance role, and can be outfitted with a machine gun or other weapons systems. When armed with a 105mm (4.1in) M40 recoilless rifle, the vehicle is uniquely capable of firing directly over its blast guard equipped hood {{rather than in the}} perpendicular position required by most other vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{is considered}} one of the worst natural disasters in Cuban history. Damage was extensive, and thousands were left homeless. It also had a widespread impact in Florida, including the destruction of houses and flooding. Although total monetary damage from <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> unknown, estimates of losses in Havana, Cuba exceed $1million and in the Florida Keys, $250,000. At least 100deaths occurred in Cuba alone.|$|E
5|$|As the Racer {{endured the}} gale, another vessel to her north, HMSRingdove, felt the storm {{around the same}} time. Both ships {{recorded}} easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucatán Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south. The hurricane crossed the northern Yucatán Peninsula and moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, nearing {{the mouth of the}} Rio Grande by early on October3. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have peaked as the equivalence of a Category4 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. As the hurricane approached a strong high pressure area to the north, it slowed drastically and recurved sharply to the northeast while its center was just off southern Texas.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to local}} {{officials}} <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> an extreme nor'wester commonly formed over the Bay of Bengal during the hot {{months of the}} year. Meteorologist S.I. Laskar said <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> due to an unstable atmosphere caused by excessive heat and humidity. [...] "It is quite normal in the pre-monsoon season," [...] he added. The severity of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> likely due to wind pulling the moisture from the Bay of Bengal northward to north Bihar, where it converged with another cloud formation to form a 20km tall cloud mass. The cool air in the clouds was met by hot air rising from the ground, which caused <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> to start rotating. Although thunderstorms had been predicted, the severity of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> unexpected.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible}} {{for at least}} 10 deaths, including five in a single vehicle crash near Prince George, British Columbia where there was snow-covered roads. Three {{people were killed in}} Washington and two in Oregon. From the perspective of Chicago, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> viewed as an Alberta clipper with the potential for heavy snowfall. During the evening of December 2, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> reported to have a central pressure of 949 mb, pressures associated with a Category 3 hurricane.|$|R

5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many low-income housing units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating the worst of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> over, is part of the problem. In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alberto {{completed}} the largest loop ever observed over the Atlantic Ocean, spanning approximately 5degrees latitude by 8degrees longitude. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> currently the ninth longest-lived storm in the Atlantic Ocean (lasting 19.75days), {{and is also}} the second longest-lived Atlantic storm during August (the longest lived is the 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco). Also, Alberto is the third farthest-travelling in the Atlantic (travelling 6,500miles), only behind Hurricane Faith and Hurricane Carrie, being able to retain tropical characteristics at an unusually high latitude, up to 53˚N. The last storm to do so was Hurricane Frances in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In early June 1989, a {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from the}} west coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean, eventually crossing into the eastern North Pacific. Initially, several centers of circulation were associated with the system. Continuing organize, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have attained tropical depression status at 0000 UTC on June 18. The depression was broad and lacked substantial thunderstorm activity. However, it did have respectable outflow and banding. It moved towards the west and intensified into {{a tropical}} storm at 0000 UTC on June 20, 48 hours after being classified.|$|E
50|$|Overall {{damages from}} <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>were</b> {{estimated}} to be $20 million.

5000|$|Predictions of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>were</b> {{criticized by}} some due to {{overestimation}} of the predicted snowfall totals {{in the major}} metropolitan areas including New York City, with The Daily Mail calling it [...] "the blizzard that WASN'T". On March 14, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> {{not as bad as}} previously anticipated, due to the change over to a mix of snow and sleet, but advised residents to not let their guard down, as <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> still predicted to cause high wind gusts and coastal flooding.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>was</b> {{manufactured}} at Isuzu's main {{plant in}} Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan. <b>The</b> <b>Storm</b> and Impulse <b>were</b> sold in Canada by General Motors Canada as the Asüna Sunfire.|$|R
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{tropical}} storm {{of the season}} was first detected by a ship on October 17 southwest of Bermuda; in the HURDAT database, this date {{was considered to be}} the formation date, although the entire lifespan of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> unknown {{due to a lack of}} data on the system itself. It initially moved east-northeastward, though later began to turn northeastward on October 18. The storm curved slightly towards the east-northeast on October 19, and became extratropical later that day before its dissipation on October 20. The storm maintained its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) for most of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{affected}} {{the town of}} Norfolk, where it became the most damaging storm since 1879. Despite the damage inland, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> {{best known for the}} unusually high number of shipwrecks and maritime incidents it caused. One ship, a schooner called the Manantico, capsized, killing the captain and one of its crew members. Three other ships were driven ashore on Virginia beaches from Dam Rock to Cape Henry, and numerous others were put in danger.|$|E

25|$|Moving very rapidly, Hazel {{consolidated}} with a {{cold front}} and created a new centre, which moved straight towards Toronto. Once over Toronto, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> partially blocked by an area of high pressure to the northeast, which drastically slowed it down. The eye of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> over downtown Toronto at midnight.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> <b>the</b> American Red Cross brought {{supplies}} to areas {{affected by the}} hurricane, requesting as much as $10,000 in relief work. Several other local relief committees also brought {{supplies to}} affected areas. An estimated $2million in damages from <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>were</b> attributed to crop damage alone, especially rice and cotton. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> estimated to have killed 40people and caused $7.5million in damage.|$|R
5|$|This {{tropical}} storm was previously unidentified {{and was not}} considered a {{tropical storm}} until research by José Fernández-Partagás in 1997. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> believed to have originated west of the Canary Islands in the northeastern Atlantic on September 22. The tropical storm moved west-southwestward for several days, maintaining its peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h); however, the storm began to curve early on September 26 and traveled directly westward before curving northward during the afternoon. The tropical storm continued to change course, turning west-northwestward by September 28. The transitioned to an extratropical system on October 1, and reached England on October 3.|$|E
5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Florida, {{the storm}} {{continued}} rapidly northeastward and transitioned into a tropical cyclone. Late on February3 it {{reached its peak}} strength with maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h). On February4 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. Around that time, gale force winds extended 100miles (160km) to the east of the center. Later that day, it passed over Cape Cod, and early on February5 it moved into eastern Maine. The Hurricane Research Division assessed the storm as losing its identity shortly thereafter, over New Brunswick. However, a map produced by the U.S. Weather Bureau indicated that the storm continued northward into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and later crossed eastern Quebec and Labrador. By February6, it reached the ocean again, deepening to a minimum pressure of 988mbar (29.18inHg). At that point, the Weather Bureau track ended, and as such the ultimate fate of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E

50|$|Chin's Atlas has a {{tropical}} <b>storm</b> moving to <b>the</b> {{northwest of the}} Mariana Islands between the 15 and 16 of April. Weather maps indicate a weak low pressure area attached to a cold front, likely indicating <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> extra-tropical in nature. The remnants of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> located several miles south of Japan.|$|R
50|$|On November 27, a {{tropical}} storm formed north of Puerto Rico. It moved to the west-northwest, and looped to the northeast. While looping, it peaked at 80 mi/h km/h, but rapid weakening began while <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> moving to <b>the</b> northeast. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> last seen on December 4 in the open Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
5|$|Major {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Port Arthur and Beaumont. Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes in Louisiana were also devastated with the towns of Cameron and Holly Beach completely wiped out. Offshore oil platforms throughout Rita's path also suffered significant damage, though the refineries of Houston, originally thought to be at risk, escaped {{the brunt of the}} storm. Seven people are confirmed dead from Rita's direct effects, and total damage from <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> estimated at $10billion, almost entirely in Texas and Louisiana. 55-112 indirect deaths have also been reported, most resulting from incidents during the evacuation of Houston when the storm was predicted to strike the city. Many of the indirect deaths were caused by a single bus fire in the mass exodus.|$|E
5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> related {{to the evolution of}} VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Steered by {{currents}} {{from an area}} of {{high pressure}} to the north, the storm began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight counterclockwise loop, and continued to mature; on October 16 it reached peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar (hPa; 27.29 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the Florida Peninsula on October 17. Its center passed west of Key West and made landfall near Cape Romano. The storm moved due north for a time as it moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeast United States before heading out to sea. <b>The</b> <b>storm</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have dissipated on October 23.|$|E
