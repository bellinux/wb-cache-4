50|$|Clinical {{measurement}} of cardiac output {{has been available}} since the 1970s. However, this blood flow measurement is highly invasive, utilizing a flow-directed, <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheter</b> (also known as the Swan-Ganz catheter), which represents significant risks to the patient. In addition, this technique is costly (several hundred dollars per procedure) and requires a skilled physician and a sterile environment for catheter insertion. As a result, {{it has been used}} only in very narrow strata (less than 2%) of critically ill and high-risk patients in whom the knowledge of blood flow and oxygen transport outweighed the risks of the method. In the United States, it is estimated that at least two million pulmonary artery catheter monitoring procedures are performed annually, most often in peri-operative cardiac and vascular surgical patients, decompensated heart failure, multi-organ failure, and trauma.|$|E

PROCEDURE: Cats were anesthetized with isoflurane, and <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheters</b> were placed for measurement of central venous, pulmonary, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures and for determination of cardiac output. The dorsal pedal artery was catheterized for measurement of arterial blood pressures and blood gas tensions. Baseline variables were recorded, and medetomidine (20 microg/kg of body weight, IM) was administered. Hemodynamic measurements were repeated 15 and 30 minutes after medetomidine administration. RESULTS: Heart rate, cardiac index, stroke index, rate-pressure product, and right and left ventricular stroke work index significantly decreased from baseline after medetomidine administration, whereas systemic vascular resistance and central venous pressure increased. However, systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial pressures as well as arterial pH, and oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions {{were not significantly different}} from baseline values. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When administered alone to clinically normal cats, medetomidine (20 microg/kg, IM) induced a significant decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and heart rate.

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of {{progress}} in measurement techniques of the pulmonary circulation in recent years, and this has required updating of basic physiological knowledge. Pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are normally low and dependent on left atrial pressure (LAP) and cardiac output (CO). Therefore, defining the functional state of the pulmonary circulation for the detection of pulmonary vascular disease or evaluation of disease progression requires measurements of PAP, LAP and CO. Invasive measurements have lately improved by a better definition of zero leveling and of the effects of intrathoracic pressure changes, and understanding of the inherent limitations of fluid-filled <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheters.</b> The effects of LAP and pulmonary flow on PAP in health and disease are now integrated in the hemodynamic diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Development of alternative noninvasive approaches is critically dependent on their potential to quantify pulmonary vascular pressures and CO. Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging are coming close. Both approaches are performant for flow measurements, but pressures remain indirectly assessed from flow velocities and/or structural changes. Doppler echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be accurate, allowing for valid population studies, but with insufficient precision for single number-derived clinical decision making.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of a cold crystalloid cardioplegic solution with adenosine (1. 2 mmol/L) instead of supranormal potassium. MethodsSixty low-risk patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were randomized to receive standard cold crystalloid hyperkalemic cardioplegia (hyperkalemic group) or normokalemic cardioplegia in which supranormal potassium was replaced with 1. 2 mmol/L adenosine (adenosine group). End points were postoperative release of troponin T and creatine kinase MB, hemodynamics measured by PiCCO arterial <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheters,</b> perioperative release of markers of endothelial activation and injury, and clinical course. ResultsThe adenosine group had a significantly shorter time to arrest than did the hyperkalemic group (mean ± standard deviation, 11  ±  5 vs 44  ±  18 seconds; P < . 001). Three hearts in the adenosine group were probably not adequately drained and received additional hyperkalemic cardioplegia to maintain satisfactory cardioplegic arrest. There were no differences between groups with respect to perioperative release of markers of endothelial activation or injury and no differences between groups in postoperative release of troponin T or creatine kinase MB. Postoperative hemodynamics including cardiac index were similar between groups. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was significantly lower in the adenosine group than in the hyperkalemic group (4 vs 15; P = . 01).

We compared the effect of hANP and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on left ventricular (LV) mechano-energetics in heart failure (HF). MethodsTen patients with HF due to previous myocardial infarction (LV ejection fraction: 45 ± 3 %) were instrumented with conductance and coronary sinus <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheters.</b> LV contractility (Ees: slope of end-systolic pressure–volume relation) and the ratio of LV stroke work (SW) to myocardial oxygen consumption (SW/MVO 2 =mechanical efficiency) were measured in response to intravenous infusion of ANP (0. 05 μg/kg/min) or SNP (0. 3 μg/kg/min) to lower blood pressure by at least 10 mmHg, and changes in plasma cGMP. ResultsSNP {{had no effect on}} Ees, SW, or MVO 2, thus SW/MVO 2 remained unchanged (40. 54 ± 5. 84 % to 36. 59 ± 5. 72 %, p= 0. 25). ANP increased Ees, and decreased MVO 2 with preserved SW, resulting in improved SW/MVO 2 (40. 49 ± 6. 35 % to 50. 30 ± 7. 96 %, p= 0. 0073). Infusion of ANP (10. 42 – 34. 95 pmol/ml, p= 0. 0003) increased cGMP levels, whereas infusion of SNP had no effect (10. 42 – 12. 23 pmol/ml, p= 0. 75).

However, there are few data regarding the physiological role of NO in patients with heart failure. The aim {{of the present study}} was to address the role of NO in left ventricular (LV) contractile response to b-adrenergic stimulation and corresponding oxygen expenditure in human heart failure. Methods and Results—We studied 15 patients with heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (mean ejection fraction 0. 33). We examined LV contractility (Emax, the slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relation), LV external work (EW), myocardial oxygen consumption (MV ˙ O 2), and mechanical efficiency (measured as EW/MV ˙ O 2) with the use of conductance and coronary sinus <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheters</b> before and during dobutamine (DOB) infusion via a peripheral vein (4. 860. 3 mg z kg 21 z min 21 IV). Heart rate was kept constant with atrial pacing. We carried out a similar protocol during the intracoronary infusion of the NO synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 200 mmol). DOB increased Emax, EW, and MV ˙ O 2 (by 77617 %, 3965 %, and 2165 %, respectively), leading to an increase in mechanical efficiency (25. 463. 1 % to 29. 664. 1 %). L-NMMA alone did not significantly change these variables. Although the concurrent infusion of DOB with L-NMMA increased Emax, EW, and MV ˙ O 2 (by 140621 %, 6469 %, and 3565 %, respectively) more than DOB alone, mechanical efficiency did not increase further (24. 363. 3...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} pediatric cardiac output by thermodilution {{requires that the}} quantity of cold indicator introduced into the central circulation be known.

The Bland and Altman method to compare the concordance between two measurements, was used. Results: Forty measurements were performed. The results of both methods had a correlation coefficient of 0. 98. According to the Bland and Altman method, the difference between both methods was - 0. 5 L with a precision of 0. 52 L/min (95 % confidence interval - 1. 51 to 0. 52 L/min).

40|$|Radiocontrast–induced {{nephropathy}} in humans: Role of renal vasoconstriction. Radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) is {{a common}} cause of acute renal failure in hospitalized patients. Renal vasoconstriction figures prominently in the proposed pathogenesis of RCIN based on animal experiments. Prior human studies examining renal hemodynamic changes after contrast medium (CM) injection are inconclusive. No previous study of animals or humans has established a relationship between CM-associated renal hemodynamic changes and the subsequent development of RCIN. In the present study, we examined the renal hemodynamic effects of CM in patients {{at high risk of}} RCIN. In addition, we related those effects to the subsequent development of RCIN. Using renal vein <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheters,</b> we measured renal blood flow (RBF) in 12 patients with chronic renal failure [serum creatinine (SCr) ≥ 159 µmol/liter] during ionic CM injection for cardiac catheterization. We made measurements {{at the start of the}} procedure (t = 0), before the ventriculogram (t = 5), after the ventriculogram (t = 15), and after the coronary angiogram (t = 65). We measured SCr at t = 0 and again 24 and 48 hours later. Mean RBF for the group tended to increase after the ventriculogram, and increased significantly by t = 65 {P < 0. 005 vs. t = 0). When examined by individual patient, RBF fell below baseline in three patients (30 %) at t = 15, but rose above baseline again by t = 65. Only one patient (8. 3 %) had a fall in RBF below baseline at t = 65. RCIN (defined as an increase in SCr ≥ 25 % above baseline) developed in six patients (50 %) within 48 hours. Of those only two (33 %) had shown a fall in RBF at t = 15, and none at t = 65. Of the four patients in the group as a whole whose RBF had fallen at any time, only two (50 %) developed RCIN. We conclude that intracardiac injection of ionic CM is not associated with a fall in total RBF in most patients with chronic renal failure. Furthermore, there appears to be no relationship between the development of RCIN and any change in total RBF. Global renal vasoconstriction does not appear to play a pathogenic role in RCIN in humans with chronic renal failure...|$|R

At the time of the study, they were intubated, ventilated (volume-controlled regimen), and sedated with propofol and remifentanil to maintain a Ramsay score > 5. For each patient, a radial artery catheter (Leadercath 20 G, Vygon, Ecouen, France), a jugular central venous catheter, and a femoral 5 -F thermistor-tipped arterial catheter (Pulsiocath™ <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheter</b> PV 2015 L 20 N [Pulsion France sarl, La Montagne, France]) were inserted in the operating room after induction of general anesthesia [14]. The Pulsiocath <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheter</b> was connected to the stand-alone PiCCO 2 computer PC 8500 version 2.0 (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany). Continuous pulse contour cardiac index measurement was initiated after the initial calibration of the system by a triplicate 15 -mL ice-cold normal saline injection through the central venous catheter (transpulmonary thermodilution) [16]. The calibration process was then repeated at the arrival in the ICU and before and after fluid challenge in the ICU. All patients were intubated with a 7.5 -mm ECOM endotracheal tube (ECOM-ETT 7.5 G, ConMed, Utica, NY) after the induction of general anesthesia. This endotracheal tube is specially designed and contains seven silver electrodes on the cuff and tube that continuously measure the bioimpedance signal from the ascending aorta, in close proximity to the trachea [11]. After processing, it provides real-time continuous stroke volume and cardiac index values. At the arrival in ICU, the ECOM pressure monitor was connected to the radial arterial line and then to the ECOM endotracheal tube impedance wires. All pressure monitors were zeroed at the midaxillary line. Intra- and postoperative hemodynamic management were left to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist, who was not involved in the study protocol and was unaware of the hemodynamic data given by the ECOM system. Hemodynamic therapy in the ICU was guided by usual clinical parameters and values obtained from continuous mean arterial pressure and calibrated pulse contour monitoring.

In 15 patients, right ventricular parameters were measured using thermodilution at 10 % intervals of the ventilatory cycle at each PEEP level with a rapid-response thermistor. Mean right ventricular stroke volume and end-diastolic volume declined during incremental PEEP and normalized on return to 5 cmH 2 O PEEP (p = 0. 01 and p = 0. 001, respectively). Right ventricular SVV remained unaltered by changes in PEEP (p = 0. 26), regardless of incremental PEEP (p = 0. 15) or decreased PEEP (p = 0. 12). The coefficients of variation in the ventilatory cycle of all other thermodilution-derived right ventricular parameters also were unaffected by changes in PEEP. This study showed that increases in PEEP did not affect right ventricular SVV in critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation despite reductions in mean right ventricular stroke volume and end-diastolic volume.

Manual injection of the indicator bolus and/or injection of this bolus through the proximal lumen of a <b>thermodilution</b> Swan-Ganz <b>catheter</b> gave poor results of CO measurements by the thermodilution technique. On the other hand, results of CO measurements were highly reliable when the bolus injection was performed by an ECG-synchronized injection pump and/or through a right atrial catheter with a larger diameter and a shorter length than the classical Swan-Ganz catheter. It was concluded that an iced 5 % solution of dextrose (5 ml/ 100 kg body weight) injected through a right atrial catheter by an ECG-synchronized pump gives the most accurate and reproducible CO measurements by the thermodilution technique in unsedated calves.

40|$|Introduction The {{development}} of an appropriate animal model of ALF is paramount for {{the understanding of the}} disease pathogenesis and evaluation of potential therapeutic approaches. Acute liver failure (ALF) is a severe, usually rapidly progressive disease characterized by high mortality (60 - 90 %). Besides acute liver transplantation which faces a shortage of donors, the only possible therapeutic alternative is applying biological or non-biological liver support systems. To confirm the effectiveness of these methods, clinically relevant model of ALF on a large laboratory animal is essential. Surgically induced ALF models seem to be more reliable than models based on chemical intoxication. Ideal model of ALF has not yet been published. Surgical models are usually performed with devascularisation, large liver resection or hepatectomy. The aim of this work was to introduce three surgical models of ALF and evaluate their usefulness for testing biological and non-biological liver support systems. Materials and Methods Female laboratory pig weighing 35 - 45 kg was used for the experimental study. After induction of general anesthesia the <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheter</b> was introduced via jugular vein. Femoral artery and vein were cannulated for invasive blood pressure monitoring and for infusions and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac output {{estimates}} by {{the principle of}} thermodilution (COth) was compared with dye-dilution estimates (COdye) in pigs. For COth estimates a Swan-Ganz 7 F floating <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheter</b> and a 9500 Edwards Computer, were used. The COdye estimates were obtained by the apparatus constructed by Zijlstra and Mook. The effect of the thermistor position in the pulmonary artery on the COth estimates was also investigated. The reproducibility of COth was examined by duplicate determinations. Based on 101 simultaneous estimates of COth and COdye the correlation was found COth = 1. 020 COdye + 0. 2378, r = 0. 971 for cardiac outputs between 0. 65 l/min and 11 l/min. For 111 duplicate determinations of COth between 2 and 9 l/min the coefficient of variation was 4. 74 %. The thermistor position in the pulmonary artery had no influence on the COth estimates provided an undamped pressure curve could be monitored {{from the tip of}} the catheter. Cardiac output can thus be measured rapidly with good accuracy also for low values by means of a blindly inserted thermistor catheter positioned without x-ray control and a computer with digital display...|$|E
40|$|The use of thermodilution {{and other}} methods of {{monitoring}} in dogs during surgery and critical care was evaluated. Six Greyhounds were anaesthetised and then instrumented {{by placing a}} <b>thermodilution</b> <b>catheter</b> into the pulmonary artery via the jugular vein. A catheter in the dorsal pedal artery also permitted direct measurement of arterial pressures. Core body temperature (degreesC) and central venous pressure (mmHg) were measured, while cardiac output (mL/min/kg) and mean arterial pressure (mmHg) were calculated. A mid-line surgical incision was performed and the physiological parameters were monitored {{for a total of}} two hours. All physiological parameters generally declined, although significant increases (P< 0. 05) were noted for cardiac output following surgical incision. Central venous pressure was maintained at approximately 0 mmHg by controlling an infusion of sterile saline. Core body temperature decreased from 37. 1 +/- 0. 6 degreesC (once instrumented) to 36. 6 +/- 0. 60 degreesC (at the end of the study), despite warming using heating pads. Physiological parameters indicative of patient viability will generally decline during surgery without intervention. This study describes an approach that can be undertaken in veterinary hospitals to accurately monitor vital signs in surgical and critical care patients...|$|E
30|$|Arterial blood {{pressure}} was measured via a pressure transducer (DPT- 6003, PVB Medizin Technik, BMBH, Kirchseen, Germany). Signals from the <b>thermodilution</b> pulmonary artery <b>catheter</b> were fed into a Vigilance® Monitor (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, CA, USA) where the CO was calculated by three consecutive injections (10  ml) of ice-cooled isotonic saline. The flow probe was connected to a Transonic T 208 two channel flowmeter, and left renal volume blood flow was recorded continuously. Continuous online data acquisition was achieved by using the MP 150 /Acknowledge 3.9. 1 system (BIOPAC Systems; Goleta, CA, USA) with a sampling rate of 200  Hz. The two laser Doppler probes were calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions and connected to a Periflux 5001 base unit (780  nm wavelength, 15  kHz band width, 0.2 -s time constant; Perimed AB).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of age on pulmonary hemodynamics and hemorheological properties in healthy dogs. ANIMALS: 14 healthy Beagles. PROCEDURES: Dogs were placed in 2 age groups as follows: young dogs (or= 8 years old; 6). Hematologic characteristics, plasma total protein and fibrinogen concentrations, and blood viscosity were measured. Systolic time intervals of pulmonary blood flow were recorded by pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography. Early (E') and late (A') diastolic myocardial velocities, isovolumic contraction velocity, and systolic myocardial velocity of the free tricuspid annulus were recorded by pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). Dogs were anesthetized and pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP) and cardiac output were recorded with a pediatric <b>thermodilution</b> Swan-Ganz <b>catheter.</b> RESULTS: Hemorheological measurements were not different between the 2 groups. Systolic, mean, and diastolic PAP were higher in old dogs, compared with values in young dogs; this difference was attributed to a high pulmonary vascular resistance and low arterial compliance in old dogs. Systolic time intervals of pulmonary blood flow stayed unchanged. The A' wave of the free tricuspid annulus was increased in old, compared with that young dogs, and the E':A' ratio was decreased. Pulmonary vascular resistance was inversely correlated with compliance. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The age of dogs {{should be taken into}} account when interpreting pulmonary hemodynamic results and TDI variables of right ventricular diastolic function.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the prognosis of cardiogenic shock patients is primarily dependent on cardiac pumping reserve was tested in a prospective study of 28 consecutive patients clinically diagnosed to be in cardiogenic shock and treated medically. Haemodynamic function was assessed by <b>thermodilution</b> Swan-Ganz <b>catheters</b> and arterial cannulas. The cardiac pumping reserve was evaluated by {{the response of the}} failing heart to graded incremental dobutamine infusion (2. 5 to 40 micrograms/kg/min) after optimalising the left ventricular preload. Eleven of the patients survived for more than the one year of follow up and the rest died. Haemodynamic evaluation during the basal resting state was only able to identify unambiguously non-survivors whose cardiac function was most severely compromised. Survivors and non-survivors with higher values were indistinguishable by basal haemodynamic criteria. The response to dobutamine stimulation clearly separated the cardiac pump function of survivors and those who died. All patients with peak cardiac power output of less than 1. 0 W or peak left ventricular stroke work index of less than 0. 25 J/m 2 died whereas all those with higher values lived for more than a year. Thus this study showed that haemodynamic evaluation of cardiac reserve can provide objective criteria for predicting outcome in individual patients with cardiogenic shock. The availability of such a prognostic indicator will be invaluable in formulating management plans for these patients...|$|R
