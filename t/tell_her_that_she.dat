25|$|To leave a {{personal}} {{account of his}} experiences for his children and also to maintain his faculties amid the desolate Sarozek, Abutalip takes to writing about his time as a prisoner of war, his escape, and fighting for the partisans; he also records the various legends told to him by Yedigei. Unfortunately for him, these activities are discovered during a routine inspection of the junction and reported to higher authorities. The denizens of Boranly-Burannyi and Abutalip are interrogated by the tyrannical Tansykbaev, and he is deemed counterrevolutionary. In due Soviet process, he is taken away and unheard of for a long time. Later, Kazangap travels to the nearby Kumbel' to visit his son. There he finds a letter meant to inform Zaripa of Abutalip's death, but thinks it best to merely <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has a letter rather to inform her of its contents. Yedigei later accompanies Zaripa to Kumbel' {{in order to receive}} the letter; coincidentally, Joseph Stalin dies on the same day, but Zaripa was too overcome with grief to pay notice to the news.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, a French {{domestic}} servant, Estelle Faguette, {{reported seeing}} {{a series of}} 15 apparitions of the Virgin Mary in the bedroom where she was staying near Pellevoisin, France. When her visions allegedly began, Faguette was terminally ill with tuberculosis and near death. However, in the second apparition, she heard Mary <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be healed, and she recovered and lived until 1929. In 1983, following a medical and theological inquiry, Archbishop Paul Vignancour of Bourges recognized her recovery as having a miraculous nature. Faguette also said that during a later apparition, she saw Mary show her the design for the Scapular of the Sacred Heart {{and told her to}} ask her bishop to encourage its devotional use. The Shrine of Our Lady of Pellevoisin was later constructed near the site of the apparitions. Although Pope Leo XIII eventually approved the scapular and a confraternity to spread its use, according to the University of Dayton Marian Library, neither the local archbishops of Bourges nor the Vatican have made any statement approving the Pellevoisin apparitions themselves.|$|E

Lynsey realised Silas was the one who attacked her, after she heard his voice which [...] "triggers a flashback" [...] to the moment of the attack. Hassan added that when nobody believed Lynsey, it [...] "makes her want to bring Silas down even more. She's determined to find the evidence she needs to expose him for what he is". Waugh, who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl, explained that everyone believes that Lynsey is crazy and has made up the allegations. Lynsey then turns to Cheryl for help and although she hates seeing her best friend in such a state, Cheryl believed Lynsey was just being paranoid.|$|E

The concert was important for Coretta as a way to continue her professional career and participate in the movement. The concert gave the audience [...] "an emotional connection to the messages of social, economic, and spiritual transformation." ...|$|E

He goes on to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> didn't need any villains to destroy her happiness, because she was already good at doing that to herself.
