40|$|ABSTRACT: The ever {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} stock market as a revenue generating tool in recent years has seen it grow in size and complexity. Many investors seek the assistance of stock brokers to give them advice and to make trades on their behalf. However, the dynamic nature {{of the stock market}} makes it very difficult for brokers to do so without the aid of computerised systems. Existing systems are large and monolithic in nature, making them difficult to maintain and adapt to the changing environment of the stock market. This research proposes an architecture for a broker system that is based around a service oriented architecture (SOA) and Web service technology to modularise some of the tasks that need to be performed by the broker. This increases the adaptability of the system to a changing environment, allows existing stock market systems to be easily integrated, and minimises development time and costs. The focus of this paper is on the creation of a component of the broker system {{that can be used to}} investigate trading strategies. By combining basic web services for data extraction and <b>trading</b> <b>management,</b> it is possible to create a system that allows a broker to simulate and evaluate a strategy before applying it in a real market so that better trading decisions can be made...|$|E
40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency and the U. S. Department of Agriculture are {{promoting}} point/nonpoint trading {{as a way}} of reducing the costs of meeting water quality goals while giving nonpoint sources a larger role in meeting those goals. Farms can create offsets or credits in a point/nonpoint trading program by implementing management practices such as conservation tillage, nutrient management, and buffer strips. To be eligible to sell credits, farmers must first comply with baseline requirements. The EPA defines a baseline as the pollutant control requirements that apply to a seller in the absence of trading. EPA guidance recommends that the baseline for nonpoint sources be management practices that are consistent with the water quality goal. A farmer {{would not be able to}} create credits until the minimum practice standards are met. An alternative baseline is those practices being implemented at the time the trading program starts. The selection of the baseline has major implications for which farmers benefit from trading, the cost of nonpoint source credits, and ultimately the number of credits that nonpoint sources can sell to regulated point sources. We use a simple model of the average profit-maximizing dairy farmer operating in the Conestoga (PA) watershed to evaluate the implications of baseline requirements on the cost and quantity of credits that can be produced for sale in a water quality trading market, and which farmers benefit most from trading. nonpoint pollution, emissions <b>trading,</b> <b>management</b> practices, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} {{architecture}} of a complete intraday <b>trading</b> <b>management</b> system using a stock selection algorithm for building long/short portfolios. Our approach for stock selection is based on knowledge discovery in large databases technologies; more specifically, we build techniques that allow one to discover hidden price patterns which are capable of predicting the direction of stock prices. The base of the whole system is a novel pattern mining algorithm from time-series data, which involves highly compute-intensive aggregation calculations as complex but efficient distributed SQL queries on the relational databases that store the time-series. This algorithm follows similar path to Association Rule Mining algorithms (such as the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms) but with major differences. First, it has one step more at initialization which uses a rule-based generator algorithm that transforms relations and data structures in a binary string format. These patterns contain mixed information of small price patterns (3, 4 or 5 candlesticks) and trading signals/filters produced by technical indicators. As output, instead of generating association rules, it produces probabilities (varies between 60 % and 95 %) about the future stock price direction such as “within next 5 periods, price will increase (or decrease) more than 2 %”. Then, the stock selection system exploits all this information and uses it to find those stocks that appear to form patterns which have the highest accuracy in predicting prices. Each time period (finest interval length being 10 minutes), the stock selector system, having the support of trading systems, examines and decides which stocks should be replaced in current portfolio by other more profitable stocks. The system testing, which produced interested results, is made of portfolio of 10 stocks having open long position and 5 stocks having open short positions...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} show how efficient the markets are by using Fama’s Efficiency Market Hypothesis (EMH). The theory states that an investor cannot increase his returns without taking additional risk. The markets can be efficient in different forms depending on the information included in the traded asset. It is quoted that: "There ain't {{no such thing as}} a free lunch". However, the topic still remains disputable since researchers have introduced controversial findings after investigating different markets. Overall, emerging markets have been characterized with higher volatility which consequently declares for market imperfections. Commonly, these market inefficiencies are quickly captured by the eye of the investors who are lurking for potential benefits through exploiting them. These are the so called arbitrage opportunities which exist on different level of impact, depending on the attitude of the market. The existence of arbitrage is clear evidence against Fama’s theory and it has been documented in numerous studies. Unfortunately those events occur rarely and disappear in a matter of seconds, thus; is highly competitive to capitalize. Over the last decade high frequency trading (HFT) became popular on different markets and it allowed traders to make decisions and execute transactions in a matter of milliseconds using algorithms. The market we are interested in is the Forex market which is a decentralized market where currencies from all over the world are traded. Main participants include multinational banks which rely heavily on HFT. The method used to benefit from inefficiency is called triangular arbitrage and it involves selling and buying 3 sets of currency pairs in times when a parity is violated. The goal of this study is to answer the following research question, “Is there a difference in triangular arbitrage opportunities between emerging markets and developed ones?” The main objective of this research is to examine how the number of arbitrage occurrences varies considering different market characteristics. Furthermore, the originality of the research stems from the comparison between strategies using currencies from developed economies and emerging ones. Moreover, the additional academic value comes from the analysis of a new dataset that has not yet been examined. Lastly, our results make an empirical contribution into a country’s economy by reducing market inefficiencies and increasing economic stability. Our sample consists of quantitative data totaling to 2. 4 million observations per quotation taken from 2011 and 2013 for currencies picked using a non-probability convenience method based on their property to be converted to EUR and USD currency and availability of information. The research revealed that differences between the two types of market exist, and indicates that the “early” markets possess higher arbitrage activity in contrast to the mature economies. These results should boost the potential for a better <b>trading</b> <b>management</b> and upgrade the profit growth...|$|E
40|$|Department of Geography, 94 p. HF 5459. 6. K 4 N 4 2009 The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine socio-economic characteristics of street trading activities and determine their sustainable management practices by local authority and other stakeholders. Urban planning and its associated paradigms, and state intervention measures directly affect sustainability of street trading. Street trading activities are further shaped by sociodemographic attributes of street traders, political, economic and geographic variables in urban environment. Studies have only managed to exaggerate the uncertainties involved in using the institutional, fiscal and legal framework in explaining crises of street <b>trading</b> <b>management</b> in urban centres. This study was accomplished by pursuing the following specific objectives: examining the profiles of street trading activity, assessing the mode of street trading governance and response of other stakeholders, determining the perception and attitudes of stakeholders towards street trading activities and analysing how stakeholders' concern and government regulations impact on the viability of street trading activities. The hypotheses were tested using both chi-square and descriptive analysis. Apart from the second hypothesis, the other three were rejected based on the significant differences observed on the findings. Both primary and secondary data were collected using questionnaires, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. A sample size of 120 respondents was considered and the respondents were drawn from; street traders, local government officials, and other stakeholders in street trading business. Descriptive and inferential techniques were used to analyse data and it involved calculation of means, frequencies, percentages and chi-square test. Qualitative analysis based on study themes was done to determine mode of governance and various institutional responses to street trading. The study established that education level, gender and starting capital were crucial factors in determining profitability of street trading activities. Although most of the street traders (37. 1 %) sell foodstuffs, it was found that monthly returns from food selling activities were very low compared to other street trading activities. Investigations on governance mode of street trading activities revealed that dealing with street traders is a difficult task and this was attributed to the ever-increasing number of street traders, hostility between traders and local authority, and inability to register traders by local authority. The greatest setback to good governance of street trading activities was lack of collaboration between stakeholders, and inability to solicit divergent views. Qualitative analysis showed that policies on street trading are not clearly barked by action to improve the profitability of street trading activities. Absence of an organized institutional body was noted as a major drawback in addressing the plight of street traders. Most stakeholders (67. 8 %) believed that street trading activities are viable and lucrative in providing jobs and social safety nets to many urban households. They identified sanitation, garbage generation, obstruction, and undignified behaviour of street traders as major challenges. The study recommends intervention measures that can enhance the profitability of street trading activities. They include policies on livelihood options for low-income urban residents and dialogue between various stakeholders on sustainable management of street trading activities. The study, further, recommends need to foster working partnership between street traders, other stakeholders and the officials of local authorities as one way of sustainable management of street trading activities.
