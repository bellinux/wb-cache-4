Recently foreign doctors have also been encouraged <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>employment</b> in Malaysia. There is still, however, a significant shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists; thus, certain medical care and treatment are available only in large cities. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment.|$|E

25|$|The {{founder of}} the nursery was Joachim Conrad Loddiges (1738–1826). He was born in Hildesheim, Lower Saxony; his father Casper Lochlies was a {{gardener}} to a nobleman in Wrisbergholzen, near Hannover. Conrad trained in The Netherlands and emigrated to Britain {{at the age of}} 19 during the Seven Years' War <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>employment</b> as gardener for Dr J. B. Silvester in the suburban village of Hackney, north of London. It was then that the family name was anglicised. When in his forties he married, he had not accumulated sufficient savings to expand a small seed business started by fellow German émigré John Busch, which he purchased, together with the good will of Busch's clientele in 1771 and had fully paid for by 1777, by which time he began to write to people all over the world, urging them to send him packets of seeds collected from trips to native hills, valleys and plains. From these small beginnings, its initial catalogue appearing in 1777 the nursery business gained a specialist market in Britain, and was increasingly able to attract clients from estates and botanical gardens throughout Europe.|$|E

Attending various schools, John and his brother Maurice lived in Sydney for a time with Muriel following their parents' separation in 1917, before Noel brought them back to Hobart in 1921. In 1923 he moved with them to Grafton, New South Wales, where he managed the Clarence River County Council. [...] John attended Grafton High School, where he attained his leaving certificate. [...] Considered by family to be a [...] "loner", [...] "a clear thinker", and a [...] "quite, determined, achiever", he entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in February 1927, aged sixteen. Early on he was subjected to the usual bastardisation handed out to younger cadets by seniors, but was not known to inflict the same treatment on juniors once he reached the senior class. Although somewhat aloof from his fellows, he did well in team sports such as rugby and hockey, as well as swimming and diving. Second academically in his class of twelve, Wilton graduated from Duntroon on 9December 1930.|$|E
500|$|Eaton {{remained}} in the RAF following the cessation of hostilities. He married Beatrice Godfrey in St. Thomas's church at Shepherd's Bush, London, on 11January 1919.

Moving to South Yarra, Victoria, he enlisted as a flying officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at Laverton on 14August 1925. He was posted to No.1 Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook, as a flight instructor, where he became known as a strict disciplinarian who [...] "trained his pilots well". Here Eaton acquired his nickname of [...] "Moth", the Air Force's basic trainer at this time being the De Havilland DH.60 Moth. Promoted flight lieutenant in February 1928, he flew a Moth in the 1929 East-West Air Race from Sydney to Perth, as part of the celebrations for the Western Australia Centenary; he was the sixth competitor across the line, after fellow RFC veteran Jerry Pentland.|$|E

2500|$|While {{he remains}} {{fundamentally}} {{associated with the}} city of Iași, Fătu was actually born just to the south of it, at Mușata, Fălciu County—presently Vaslui County—on January 2, 1816 (Old Style: December 21, 1815). He had a younger brother, Iacob, who worked alongside Costache Conachi as a translator of literature. Their father, born into a peasant family, was a parson of the Moldavian Orthodox Metropolis. After finishing primary school in Huși, at the school maintained by the Orthodox bishopric, Anastasie passed an examination and received a scholarship for Iași's Vasilian Gymnasium, thus profiting from a meritocratic shift in Moldavian society. As noted by historian A. D. Xenopol, Moldavian Prince Mihail Sturdza and his adviser Gheorghe Asachi were tacitly encouraging [...] "people from the lower strata of society" [...] to acquire and education, and then <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>employment</b> in the state apparatus, at the expense of boyardom. Scholar V. A. Urechia also records the [...] "great diversity of origin" [...] at the Vasilian boarding school, arguing that it was a positive contribution to Romania's culture.|$|E
50|$|Skinner opposed World War I as {{a socialist}} and a pacifist. He was a {{conscientious}} objector, but also refused <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> alternative <b>employment,</b> {{and so was}} imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs in 1916. The prison authorities refused to provide vegetarian food, so Skinner suffered greatly from hunger. Although he was released three months later, he again refused military service, and was imprisoned a second time. While imprisoned, he contracted tuberculosis, which {{left him with a}} permanent disability affecting his knee and elbow.|$|R
40|$|Estimates of a supply-side {{model of}} the nonprimary sectors, in which {{particular}} {{attention has been paid}} to modeling key characteristics of the evolution of the apartheid system, are presented.

This relatively small gap implies that medium-term prospects for the advancement of the disadvantaged groups in South Africa depend heavily on their ability <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>up</b> skilled <b>employment,</b> with the direct gains from the elimination of apartheid being relatively small. ...|$|R

50|$|The young Prinsep {{lost his}} father {{and two of his}} sisters to an {{outbreak}} of fever in 1768.

Within a few years, though, Prinsep discovered indigo. In 1779 Prinsep introduced the cultivation and manufacture of indigo at a factory (plantation) located in Nilgang, near Baraset. Indigo was also being grown in South Carolina for export to England as textile dye, but Prinsep's establishment of the Indian indigo business, simultaneously with the Revolutionary War having slashed American indigo export to England, meant that the Indian producers soon controlled the market.|$|R
