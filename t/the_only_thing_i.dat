They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E

500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} left their {{independent}} record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing {{to a major}} label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't {{go back to the}} punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could do was get on my bike and go forward." ...|$|E

500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have to send home; but I {{do not believe that}} it would be very easy to find anything better... I even think {{it is one of the}} most delightful things I have ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E

500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could do was get on my bike and go forward."

500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> cared about was that we finally got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [...] But the knowledge that this might be the last time we see them puts a damper on things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.” ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.", [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> said was that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E
500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you {{to go ahead and}} do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E
500|$|When Dragon Ball began, it was {{loosely based}} on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Xuanzang. Toriyama {{continued}} to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but {{over the course of}} time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a [...] "nearly-pure fighting manga" [...] later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama admitted, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy."

500|$|With the team's {{probation}} over, Farmer and {{the other}} three seniors played in their first [...] and only [...] postseason games in the 199192 season. After an opening round win against Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament in Birmingham, Alabama, Kentucky won its third meeting of the season with LSU 8074 in the second round; the Tigers were without star center Shaquille O'Neal, who was suspended for fighting with Tennessee's Carlus Groves in his team's opening round victory. In the finals, Kentucky faced three-time defending tournament champion Alabama, which was without forward Andre Perry, who suffered a broken foot in the semifinals against Arkansas. Star sophomore Jamal Mashburn led all scorers with 28 points on 12-of-14 shooting, en route to an 8054 victory and tournament Most Valuable Player honors. Mashburn, who shot 26-for-31 in the Wildcats' three tournament games, said of his performance, [...] "At the beginning of the season, I told the four seniors 'this is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can give you.

500|$|In 2011, manga {{critic and}} editor of Viz's editions of the series Jason Thompson said that: [...] "Dragon Ball {{is by far the}} most {{influential}} shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shōnen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways." [...] Explaining its basic formula of [...] "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, [...] a few jokes" [...] became the model for other shōnen series, such as Naruto. Thompson cited the artwork as influential, pointing out that popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had [...] "manly" [...] heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball had the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that he says still continues. Commenting on Dragon Balls global success nearly two decades after it ended, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.

500|$|After O'Leary's {{revelation that}} {{producers}} had rehearsed {{what would happen}} if Cole abstained in week 5, allegations were made that the result was rigged for Waissel to stay, given that her outlandish performances and growing unpopularity with the public resulted in better ratings and sensational press for the show. Cowell denied this claim, saying he would never want to defraud viewers and said the situation had [...] "been blown out of proportion". O'Leary defended himself and the show on Twitter, saying [...] "We never know which way the judges are going to vote. Ever. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know is who's in the bottom two when I'm given the card. I don't know which judge to go to until I'm called and the judges, including , don't know the vote or who we're coming to next. It's that simple." [...] The following week, Heat magazine printed a report claiming that Cowell was aware of the public votes before the judges make their votes, and several other media reports contained rumours of the show being fixed. The X Factor bosses instructed their lawyers to file a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission against Heat, saying that the article was a lie, that very few people know the actual public voting results and conspiracy theories being printed in the media are [...] "total and utter rubbish". Heat printed an apology in their 1 January 2011 issue and accepted that Cowell was unaware of the votes cast until after the final.|$|E
