5|$|Hawaii did {{not allow}} {{same-sex}} marriages or civil unions, but two unmarried people can register for a reciprocal beneficiary relationship, which {{provides some of the}} rights and benefits that come with marriage. The bill was written to become law on January 1, 2010, would allow all couples to obtain rights equal to those of married couples, and make Hawaii <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in the Western United States to allow civil unions instead of domestic partnerships.|$|E
5|$|Many {{places and}} {{entities}} {{have been named}} in honor of Washington. His name became that of the nation's capital Washington, D.C. The state of Washington is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> to be named after a United States president. Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest mountain in the Northeast, was named soon after the American Revolution by Colonel John Whipple.|$|E
5|$|William Justus Goebel (January 4, 1856 – February 3, 1900) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 34th Governor of Kentucky for four days in 1900 after having been mortally wounded by an assassin the day before he was sworn in. Goebel remains <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> governor in the United States to be assassinated while in office.|$|E

5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Despite his meager {{political}} experience—having previously {{served only}} {{three years in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives—Johnson labored vehemently to ensure the success of the shadow government. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, but the shadow government's influence in the Commonwealth extended only as far as the Confederate Army advanced. When Albert Sidney Johnston abandoned the Confederate capital of Bowling Green, Governor Johnson and the other government officials accompanied him. Despite his advanced age and a crippled arm, Johnson volunteered for military service in General Johnston's army. Johnson was killed at the Battle of Shiloh, making him <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> governor, Union or Confederate, to fall in battle during the Civil War. He was succeeded by Richard Hawes, the second and last governor of Confederate Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh {{parliament}} was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Humphrey brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota {{has gone to the}} Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Kerala's {{sex ratio}} of 1.084 {{is higher than}} that of the rest of India and is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> where women outnumber men. While having the {{opportunities}} that education affords them, such as political participation, keeping up to date with current events, reading religious texts etc., these tools have still not translated into full, equal rights for the women of Kerala. There is a general attitude that women must be restricted for their own benefit. In the state, despite the social progress, gender still influences social mobility.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November 1986, DMK members protested {{against the}} new {{education}} policy by burning Part XVII of the Constitution. 20,000 DMK members, including Karunanidhi, were arrested. 21 persons committed suicide by self-immolation. Karunanidhi was sentenced to ten weeks of rigorous imprisonment. Ten DMK MLAs including K. Anbazhagan were expelled from the Legislative Assembly by the speaker P. H. Pandian. Rajiv Gandhi assured Members of Parliament from Tamil Nadu that Hindi would not be imposed. As part of the compromise, Navodhaya schools were not started in Tamil Nadu. Currently, Tamil Nadu is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in India without Navodaya schools.|$|E

5|$|Sarawak is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in Malaysia where Christians outnumber Muslims. The {{earliest}} Christian missionaries in Sarawak were Church of England (Anglicans) in 1848, {{followed by}} Roman Catholics {{a few years}} later, and Methodists in 1903. Evangelizing first took place among the Chinese immigrants before spreading to indigenous animists. Other Christian denominations in Sarawak are Borneo Evangelical Mission (or Sidang Injil Borneo), and Baptists. Indigenous people such as the Iban, Bidayuh, and Orang Ulu have adopted Christianity although they do retain some of their traditional religious rites. Many Muslims come from the Malay, Melanau, and Kayan ethnic groups. Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese folk religion are predominantly practised by Chinese Malaysians. Other minor religions in Sarawak are Baha'i, Hinduism, Sikhism, and animism.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2006 state election, the Democractic Action Party (DAP) has derived the {{majority}} of its support from urban centres and became the largest opposition party in Sarawak. In 2010, it formed the Pakatan Rakyat coalition with Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS); the latter two parties had become active in Sarawak between 1996 and 2001. Sarawak is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in Malaysia where West Malaysia-based component parties in the BN coalition, especially the UMNO, have not been active in state politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. It was reconfirmed as the {{national flag}} when the republic gained independence on 9 August 1965. Prior to its independence, it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> flag in Malaysia {{not to have a}} 1:2 ratio. The design is a horizontal bicolour of red above white, overlaid in the canton (upper-left quadrant) by a white crescent moon facing a pentagon of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.|$|E

5|$|West Bengal is {{bordered by}} three countries: Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh; and five Indian states: Sikkim, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Assam. Sikkim and Bhutan are located {{to the north}} of the state, Nepal to the northwest, Bihar and Jharkhand in the west, Odisha in the southwest, the Bay of Bengal to the south, and Bangladesh and Assam are in the east. West Bengal is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> of India that has both the Himalayas in the north and the Bay of Bengal at the south. In between them, the river Ganga enters the state from west, before it {{branches}} off into its main distributaries: the Hooghly River, which flows southwards to reach the Bay of Bengal, and the Padma River, which flows eastwards into Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar {{was noted}} for his {{diplomatic}} skills, {{and both the}} British and Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions. He was also an avid traveller, {{and became the first}} Malay ruler to travel to Europe during his first visit to England in 1866. In particular, Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of Queen Victoria in his later years. Abu Bakar's friendship with Queen Victoria {{played an important role in}} shaping Johor's relationships with Britain, and was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> by the end of the 19th century in the Peninsular Malaya to maintain autonomy in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the Malay states by placing a British Resident in the states. He was also an Anglophile, and many of his personal habits and decisions were aligned to European ideas and tastes.|$|E

5|$|After the 1948 election, {{the state}} turned firmly Republican. Although {{registered}} Republicans were {{a minority in}} the state until 2015, starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates {{in all but one}} election (1964). This is not to say every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was one of three states, the others being Utah and West Virginia, where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in 2012, and it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> where Barack Obama failed to carry any county in 2008. In 2016, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, again won every county, being one of only two states, the other being West Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton failed to carry a single county.|$|E
5|$|After the {{partition}} of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in East Bengal, the non-contiguous {{eastern part of the}} Dominion of Pakistan, made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan's 69 million people. The Dominion of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan. In 1947, a key resolution at a national education summit in Karachi advocated Urdu as the sole state language, and its exclusive use in the media and in schools. Opposition and protests immediately arose. Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of Abul Kashem, the secretary of Tamaddun Majlish, a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal. However, the Pakistan Public Service Commission removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, after the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Leane advocated for the introduction of radio communications into the police, stressing the need for quick response in cases of civil emergency. On 18 June 1940, Leane was appointed as {{the commander of the}} Returned and Services League-organised Volunteer Defence Corps (VDC) in South Australia, an organisation similar to the Home Guard in the United Kingdom. Within two weeks, more than 2,000 returned World War I servicemen had enlisted in the VDC. In response to {{the outbreak of}} war, by July 1940 Leane had authorised the swearing-in of 3,000 special constables to guard vulnerable points and industry against fifth column elements. On 19 October, Leane commanded a parade of more than 5,000 VDC members, including 2,000 who had travelled from country areas. By February 1941, the VDC had increased to a strength of 8,000 men. During World War II, South Australia was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>state</b> to permit members of the police to enlist in the armed forces, but this was withdrawn after Japan entered the war, due to the need to maintain police numbers. In July 1943, Leane's appointment as VDC commander was extended for twelve months, {{despite the fact that he}} had reached the normal Army retirement age of 65. On 30 June 1944, Leane retired as police commissioner, and was replaced by William Francis Johns, a serving superintendent.|$|E
