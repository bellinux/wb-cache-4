The effects of switch size, <b>tile</b> <b>length,</b> level-restoring, and slow input slew rates are examined. Two new fanin-based switch designs {{are used to}} eliminate {{nearly all of the}} increase in delay that arises from fanout with a previous switch design. Alternating between buffers and pass transistors is shown to improve connection delay without fanout by 25 %. To take advantage of this, we propose schemes to replace some buffers with pass transistors to simultaneously reduce area and delay. Routing a suite of MCNC benchmark circuits shows that 14 % in area  delay, or 7 % in delay can be saved using the new switch schemes. Alternatively, approximately 13 % in area can be saved with no degradation to delay. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—It is {{well known}} that tile-boundary {{artifacts}} occur in wavelet-based lossy image coding. However, until now, their cause has not been understood well. In this paper, we show that boundary artifacts are an inescapable consequence of the usual methods used to choose tile size and the type of symmetric extension employed in a wavelet-based image decomposition system. This paper presents a novel method for reducing these tile-boundary artifacts. The method employs odd tile sizes (2 + 1 samples) rather than the conventional even tile sizes (2 samples). It is shown that, for the same bit rate, an image compressed using an odd <b>tile</b> <b>length</b> low-pass first (OTLPF) convention has significantly less boundary artifacts than an image compressed using even tile sizes. The OTLPF convention can also be incorporated into the JPEG 2000 image compression algorithm using extensions defined in Part 2 of this standard.

By using the multi-pass method they unroll and rearrange the multiple nested loops. The integer ME {{can be implemented}} with a two-pass process on the GPU. Moreover, fractional ME needs six passes for frame interpolation with a six-tap filter and MV refinement. They obtain a speed-up of between 6 x and 56 x, depending on the encoding conditions. Cheng and Hang [18] decomposed the H. 264 /AVC ME algorithm into five steps so as to achieve highly parallel computation with a low external memory transfer rate. Experimental results show that, {{with the assistance of}} a GPU, the processing time is 12 times shorter than when using only the CPU. However, the major failing of these two approaches is that they do not show RD performance; although the speed-up and TR are acceptable, they are only valid if they keep the RD {{as close as possible to}} the sequential approach. More recently, Cheung et al. [19] proposed a GPU implementation of the simplified UMHexagons (smpUMHexagonS) ME algorithm, which is a fast ME technique implemented in the H. 264 /AVC reference software. The authors divide the current frame into multiple tiles and they obtain a speed-up of up to 3 x when compared with this fast algorithm.

30|$|While it is {{possible}} to use these devices for Cherenkov radiation measurements in an event-triggered mode [26], in the present work, the PDPCs were used in an event-histogramming mode typically used for calibration to generate the dark count map (DCM). In this mode, one cell per pixel at a time is activated, while the other cells are physically deactivated. The number of photons detected by the cell is summed over a predetermined period called the activation time. Each die is read independently but entirely and row by row every time one of the four simultaneously active cells (one {{in each of the four}} pixels in a die) is fired. The output of the acquisition is a DCM, which is a file containing, for every cell of the <b>tile,</b> the <b>length</b> of the activation period, the temperature of the measurement, and the total number of photons counted. The advantage of the DCM mode over the conventional event-triggered mode is that it allows the information on the single cell level to be preserved. When reading cells sequentially, any distortion due to crosstalk is automatically excluded [23]. Usually the DCMs are used to create inhibition maps to mitigate the effects of cells with high dark count rates on noise and dead time.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of phase-slip observations in superfluid 4 He in a double-hole hydromeehanical resonator tiffed with a micro-aperture yields the remanent current trapped in the superfluid loop threading the two holes. The value of this bias current remains constant in each given cool-down below the +X point. Its value at each cool down appears to be fixed at random. It can be determined to about a hundredth of the circulation quantum. This is the present practical resolution of the double-hole resonator used as an absolute gyrometer. I) ouble-hole hydromechanical resonators fitted with a microscopic orifice and a long channel, as shown in fig. l, are close analogs, for superfluids, of the well-known 7 f-SQUIDS in superconductivity [1]. Their operation can be analyzed in detail [2], and so can their output. This output consists of {{the positive and negative}} going peak amplitude of the membrane deflection d at successive half cycles of the resonant motion.

In this context, Tilera Corporation has developed a brand new CMP architecture with 64 cores (tiles) called Tile 64, and has launched several Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) cards to be used and monitored from a host Personal Computer (PC). These cards may execute parallel applications built in C/C++ and compiled with the Tile-GCC compiler. We have previously demonstrated {{the usefulness of the}} Tile 64 architecture for bioinformatics [S. Gálvez, D. Díaz, P. Hernández, F. J. Esteban, J. A. Caballero, G.

We have chosen a bioinformatics algorithm to test this many-core Tile 64 architecture because of actual bioinformatics challenging needs: data-intensive workloads, space and time-consuming requirements and massive calculation. This algorithm, known as Needleman-Wunsch/Smith-Waterman (NW/SW), obtains an optimal sequence alignment in quadratic time and space cost, yet requires to be optimized {{to take full advantage of}} computing parallelization.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) examine patterns in ambient nutrient concentrations and nutrient spiraling in drained water during flow events, (2) evaluate spatial and seasonal variations in sediment-nutrient interactions in drainage ditches, and (3) characterize the magnitude and transport of tile added-nutrients and their retention in the drainage ditches. In this study water and sediment samples were collected in J. B. Foltz ditch (Reynolds, Indiana), Box ditch and Marshall ditch (West Lafayette, Indiana). Ditch water was collected and analyzed for soluble phosphorus (SP), total phosphorus (TP), ammonia (NH 3 -N), nitrate (NO 3 -N), and total nitrogen (TN). Sediments were collected and extracted to determine equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC 0), exchangeable phosphorus (Ex-P), phosphorus sorption index (PSI), and exchangeable nitrogen (Ex-N). Effects of tile effluent on nutrient concentrations and transport in these ecosystems were also evaluated using both datasets. The water quality constituent concentrations during various flow regimes did not indicate any longitudinal pattern in nutrient concentrations. NO 3 -N and SP concentrations in the ditches were high and comparable to NO 3 -N and SP concentrations in previous studies in the Midwest. Comparisons between measured nutrient concentrations in tile effluent and ditch water resulted in high SP, TP and NH 3 -N concentrations in the ditch water, whereas NO 3 -N concentrations were higher in <b>tile</b> effluent. Uptake <b>lengths</b> were long indicating that nutrients were generally not assimilated as efficiently as by natural streams.

40|$|The {{forecasted}} {{accuracy of}} upcoming surveys of large-scale structure cannot be achieved without a proper quantification of the error induced by foreground removal (or other systematics like 0 -point photometry offset). Because these errors are highly correlated on the sky, their influence {{is expected to}} be especially important at very large scales, at and beyond the first Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO). In this work we quantify how the uncertainty in the visibility mask of a survey, that gives the survey depth in a specific sky area, influences the measured power spectrum of a sample of tracers of the density field and its covariance matrix. We start from a very large set of 10, 000 catalogs of dark matter (DM) halos in periodic cosmological boxes, produced with the PINOCCHIO approximate method. To make an analytic approach feasible, we assume luminosity-independent halo bias and an idealized geometry for the visibility mask, that is constant in square <b>tiles</b> of physical <b>length</b> l; this should be interpreted as the projection, at the observation redshift, of the angular correlation scale of the foreground residuals. We find that the power spectrum of these biased tracers can be expressed as the sum of a cosmological term, a mask term and a term involving their convolution. The mask and convolution terms scale like P ∝ l 2 σA 2, where σA 2 is the variance of the uncertainty on the visibility mask. With l = 30 − 100 Mpc/h and σA = 5 − 20 %, the mask term can be significant at k ~ 0. 01 − 0. 1 h/Mpc, and the convolution term can amount to ~ 1 − 10 % of the total. The influence of mask uncertainty on power spectrum covariance is more complicated: the coupling of the convolution term with the other two gives rise to several mixed terms, that we quantify by difference using the mock catalogs. These are found to be of the same order of the mask covariance, and to introduce non-diagonal terms at large scales. As a consequence, the power spectrum covariance matrix cannot be expressed as the sum of a cosmological and of a mask term. More realistic settings (realistic foregrounds, luminosity-dependent bias) make the analytical approach not feasible, and the problem requires on the one hand usage of extended sets of mock catalogs, on the other hand detailed knowledge of the correlations among errors in the visibility masks. Our results lie down the theoretical bases to quantify the impact that uncertainties in the mask calibration have on the derivation of cosmological constraints from large spectroscopic surveys...|$|R
