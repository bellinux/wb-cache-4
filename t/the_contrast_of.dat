Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E

For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations.

The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E

40|$|Contrast {{enhancement}} is {{a technique}} which enables images to improve <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> level <b>of</b> images. <b>Contrast</b> enhancement <b>of</b> images requires filtering <b>of</b> regions where <b>contrast</b> level is high or where noise level is more.

40|$|AbstractAttention {{increases}} <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> gain <b>of</b> V 4 neurons, {{causing them}} to respond to an attended stimulus as though its contrast had increased. When multiple stimuli appear within a neuron's receptive field (RF), the neuron responds primarily to the attended stimulus. This suggests that cortical cells may be “hard wired” to respond preferentially to the highest-contrast stimulus in their RF, and neural systems for attention capitalize on this mechanism by dynamically increasing <b>the</b> effective <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stimulus that is task relevant. To test this, we varied <b>the</b> relative <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> two stimuli within the recorded neurons' RFs, while the monkeys attended away to another location. Increasing <b>the</b> physical <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> one stimulus caused V 4 neurons to respond preferentially to that stimulus and reduced their responses to competing stimuli. When attention was directed to the lower-contrast stimulus, it partially overcame {{the influence of a}} competing, higher-contrast stimulus...|$|R

25|$|Contrast {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in brightness between two stimuli, divided by the sum of brightness of both stimuli. Contrast sensitivity is the inverse of the smallest contrast that can be detected, a contrast sensitivity of 100 means that the smallest contrast that can be detected is 1%. Birds have comparably low contrast sensitivity to mammals. Humans have been shown to detect contrasts as low as 0.5-1%, whereas most birds tested have require ca 10% contrast to show a behavioural response. A contrast sensitivity function describes an animal's ability to resolve detect <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> patterns of different spatial frequency (detail). For stationary viewing experiments the contrast sensitivity is highest for a medium spatial frequency and lower for higher and lower spatial frequencies.|$|E

25|$|The facial pit {{actually}} visualizes {{thermal radiation}} {{using the same}} optical principles as a pinhole camera, wherein {{the location of a}} source of thermal radiation is determined by the location of the radiation on the membrane of the heat pit. However, studies that have visualized the thermal images seen by the facial pit using computer analysis have suggested that the resolution is actually extremely poor. The size of the opening of the pit results in poor resolution of small, warm objects, and coupled with the pit's small size and subsequent poor heat conduction, the image produced is of extremely low resolution and contrast. It is known that some focusing and sharpening of the image occurs in the lateral descending trigeminal tract, and {{it is possible that the}} visual and infrared integration that occurs in the tectum may also be used to help sharpen the image. In addition, snakes may deliberately choose ambush sites with low thermal background radiation (colder areas) to maximize <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>of</b> their warm prey in order to achieve such a high degree of accuracy from their thermal “vision”.|$|E
