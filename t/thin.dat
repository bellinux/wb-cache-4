30|$|This {{work closely}} follows that of Nishizono (2010), the major {{difference}} being the definitions of <b>thinning</b> intensity {{and the addition of}} fertilisation. Analyzing the models using a <b>thinning</b> intensity defined as the volume removed in a previous <b>thinning,</b> as was used by Nishizono (2010) resulted in a poorer fit. The definition of <b>thinning</b> intensity that was implemented (volume removed divided by time since <b>thinning)</b> results in the effect of the <b>thinning</b> in the model dwindling over time. The stands in the data set were only <b>thinned</b> once; hence only one <b>thinning</b> was modelled. It is not intuitive how to modify the implemented <b>thinning</b> intensity definition for multiple entries. Two options are to either accumulate the <b>thinning</b> intensities or to calculate the <b>thinning</b> intensity as if a previous <b>thinning</b> had not been done. The two methods would give similar results if the thinnings are far apart in time.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 <b>Thinning</b> {{of young}} Douglas-fir forests has the {{potential}} to enhance structural diversity and improve habitat for wildlife. I examined the effects of <b>thinning</b> and <b>thinning</b> intensity on abundance and demographic characteristics of forest-floor small mammals in the Coast Range of Oregon 5 and 6 years after <b>thinning</b> had occurred. <b>Thinning</b> resulted in greater densities of Townsend's chipmunks (Tamias townsendii), creeping voles (Microtus oregoni), and Pacific jumping mice (Zapus trinotatus), and densities of chipmunks and creeping voles were greater in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands than in moderately <b>thinned</b> stands. Movement of female chipmunks was less in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands and movement of female deer mice was less in <b>thinned</b> stands. Sex ratios of deer mice and creeping voles were skewed toward females in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands. Body mass of male deer mice was also greater in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands. <b>Thinning</b> had neutral effects on density of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and on populations of Trowbridge's shrews (Sorex trowbridgii), Baird's shrews (Sorex bairdi), Pacific shrews (Sorexpacjflcus), and shrew-moles (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) were more abundant in unthmnned stands than in <b>thinned</b> stands 5 years after <b>thinning</b> had occurred. Greater amounts of small-diameter down wood and slash, and increases in percent cover of low shrubs after <b>thinning</b> may partially explain the increases in abundance of chipmunks, Pacific jumping mice, and creeping voles in <b>thinned</b> stands. <b>Thinning</b> young Douglas-fir forests appears to enhance habitat quality for most species of forest-floor small mammals. In addition, heavy <b>thinning</b> may hasten development of mature forest conditions that may provide optimal habitat for these species.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} <b>thinning</b> {{effects on the}} {{stability}} of crowns, {{some changes in the}} stability of crowns after <b>thinning</b> were simulated in sixteen sorts of <b>thinning</b> plans by the canopy dynamic model. Both the height and the eccentricity of the center of gravity of a tree 2 ̆ 7 s foliage were used as indexes of the stability of a crown. The results of simulation were summarized as in the following : 1. The <b>thinning</b> intensity largely effected the stability of crowns. The risings of center of gravity accompanying with the tree-height-growth were reduced in accordance with an increasing in the <b>thinning</b> ratio. This result suggests the possibility of keeping the vertical stability of crowns by the execution of intensive <b>thinning.</b> The relative frequency of occurrence of the trees supplied with changing eccentricity during 5 years after the <b>thinning,</b> increased linearly with the <b>thinning</b> ratio. 2. The upper and the all storied <b>thinning</b> reduced eccentricity more significantly than other <b>thinning</b> systems did. The cutting of the trees which were large enough to suppress the others was deemed to be effective to keep the horizontal stability of crowns. 3. The line <b>thinning</b> showed less effects on the individual foliage weight than other <b>thinning</b> systems did. Consequently, the planning of the <b>thinning</b> ratio by using the stand density control diagram was deemed to be inadaptable to the line <b>thinning</b> system. 4.

40|$|<b>Thinning</b> of {{plantations}} is a recognised {{practice for}} concentrating growth onto selected trees while providing an intermediate {{return from the}} thinnings. A great deal of {{work has been done}} on methods for estimating optimum time and weight of <b>thinning</b> for the particular stand. However, the selection of individual trees to be <b>thinned</b> in the forest has relaxed in recent years to make <b>thinning</b> more flexible, reduce costs and to better facilitate mechanised harvesting. Some plantations are now being <b>thinned</b> by the harvesting machine operator selecting the trees to be <b>thinned</b> while harvesting. A series of field trials were undertaken in Pinus radiata plantation at Rennick, Victoria, to compare conventional tree marked <b>thinning</b> with operator selected <b>thinning</b> (OST) where the harvesting machine operator selected trees while harvesting. The results indicate good control of tree selection by the operators: <b>thinning</b> to the same density and diameter distribution as the tree marked treatment while removing all required defect trees. Operator tree selection did not affect harvesting productivity, however, it improved log processing time in a second <b>thinning</b> by an experienced tree selecting operator, it also improved falling and work cycle time (approach tree, fall and process) in first <b>thinning</b> on a high site quality. <b>Thinning</b> trials at an operational level, about 6 ha, tested operator selection <b>thinning</b> to two different sets of guidelines: a diameter limit; and spacing requirements for residual trees. These OST <b>thinning</b> operations were no worse than the conventional tree marked <b>thinning</b> and resulted in less residual tree damage and more trees harvested per hour in second <b>thinning.</b> A simple economic analysis, based on data from the field trials, showed each operator selection <b>thinning</b> to be similar to the conventional tree marked <b>thinning</b> for revenue from thinnings and PNV of the rotation taken through to final harvest by a computer model.
