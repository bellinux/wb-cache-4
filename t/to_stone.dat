Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E

5|$|Since the Middle Ages, most {{dwellings}} were log {{houses with}} notched corners, carefully crafted to ensure {{protection against the}} elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires with smoke vents in the roofs gave way <b>to</b> <b>stone</b> stoves and chimneys in early modern times. Specialized buildings became commonplace, organized around farmyards or gårdstun. The introduction of exterior boarding (weatherboarding) in the 18th century improved housing standards considerably and gave rise to larger houses.|$|E

5|$|The core of {{the pyramid}} is made of roughly hewn {{limestone}} blocks {{similar to those of}} the main pyramid.

5|$|Aegaeon– Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged a blood oath to Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him <b>to</b> <b>stone,</b> making him the giant Prison of the Damned and becoming a symbol to all who may think of breaking a blood oath to a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending off two of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from his suffering.|$|E
5|$|At {{the south}} end of {{corridor}} lies an antechamber, which is located directly under the tip of the pyramid. The antechamber is oriented on the east–west axis and leads west to the king's burial chamber. The burial chamber has the same height and width as the antechamber, but is longer. At the western end of the burial chamber Perring discovered some fragments of an empty and undercorated black basalt sarcophagus which had been originally placed in a slight depression as well as a canopic chest. The chambers are protected from the pyramid weight by a gabled ceiling made of two large Tura limestone blocks, an architecture common to all pyramids of the 5th and 6th dynasties. The chambers are lined with the same material, while the floor pavement was lost <b>to</b> <b>stone</b> robbers.|$|E
