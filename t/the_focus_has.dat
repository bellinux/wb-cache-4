5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art {{historian}} Andreas Aubert (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrich's Rückenfigur (back figure), although in Munch's work <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.|$|E
5|$|In recent times, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> been on {{creating}} {{an awareness of}} the threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources. Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public. Education programs can help the public develop greater environmental awareness by understanding the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E

50|$|On April 20, 2009, it was {{announced}} that the Kepler science team had concluded that further refinement of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> would dramatically increase the scientific return. On April 23, 2009, it {{was announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>had</b> been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror 40 micrometers (1.6 thousandths of an inch) towards the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 0.0072 degree.|$|R
25|$|At {{universities}} <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> {{largely been}} to pass resolutions supporting divestment in student government. Few campaigns have gone further than these resolutions in pressuring universities {{to agree to}} divest.

25|$|The pilgrimage {{sites have}} shifted during history. The main Christian archaeological finds from the Byzantine and {{possibly}} even Roman period indicated that the initial venerated pilgrimage site was on the east bank, but {{by the beginning of}} the 6th century <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>had</b> moved onto <b>the</b> more accessible west bank of the river.|$|R

25|$|Brisbane's {{population}} growth placed strains on South East Queensland's transport system. The State Government and Brisbane City Council have responded with infrastructure plans and increased funding for transportation projects, {{such as the}} South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program.

25|$|In Curitiba <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> been on {{teaching}} children aged 8–12. The Associaçao Brasileira de Cricket employed a local junior development officer/coach for three years, {{and the success}} of the programme, which works with about 300 kids at four schools, was recognized by the ICC through the Volunteer of the Year Award presented to Norman Baldwin and to the programme itself for Best Junior Development Programme. This ongoing programme provided the platform for a very successful U13s tournament held in July 2009 in Curitiba, played between Argentina, the eventual winners, Chile and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The dibbler(Paranthechinus apicalis) {{is a small}} {{carnivorous}} marsupial {{found on}} two islands {{off the coast of}} Jurien Bay (island dibblers) and on the south coast of Western Australia within the Fitzgerald River National Park (mainland dibblers). It once had a much wider distribution, but is now classified as endangered by the IUCN. Perth-Zoo-bred dibblers were used to establish a new population on Escape Island in Jurien Bay. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> now changed to breeding dibblers from Fitzgerald River National Park for release on the mainland. By early 2011, over 500 dibblers had been provided by the zoo for release into protected habitat.|$|E
2500|$|In Taiwan, school {{counseling}} traditionally {{was done by}} [...] "guidance teachers." [...] Recent advocacy by the Chinese Guidance and Counseling Association pushed for licensure for school counselors in Taiwan's public schools.

25|$|Since then, {{the park}} was {{expanded}} twice, adding the second section in 1964 and the third section ten years later. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> been on {{the maintenance of the}} area. By 1998, the paths of the park, especially in the first section, were saturated with over 3,000 peddlers with few regulations or norms. In 2005, the first section of {{the park was}} closed for renovations, effectively evicting all vendors from the area. When it reopened months later, permits for selling were strictly limited and police began to crackdown vendors in the park. However, some vendors continue to operate illegally and exchange information on the police's steps with radio communication equipment. At the entrances to the park, where the vendor restrictions are not in place, some vendors sometimes block the entrances and cover signs so that visitors a forced to pass through their stands.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Park {{was planned}} to {{incorporate}} 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, {{with a total}} of 525 bird boxes, and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process. Renewable energy also features at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, this may now be as little as 9%. Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> since moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Food packaging at the Olympics is made from compostable materials– like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics– where it cannot be re-used or recycled. This includes fast food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons. After they have been used, many of these materials would be suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.|$|E
25|$|Since the pre-Hispanic period, Xochimilco’s {{economy has}} {{traditionally}} been based on agriculture, mostly by supplying {{to the needs of}} Mexico City. This not only dominated the economy but also the area’s religious practices, some of which can still be seen to the present day. Agriculture still remains important in the borough, but most of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> shifted to flowers and ornamental plants. One major reason for this is the poor quality of the area’s water supply. Xochimilco has four major markets dedicated to the sale of plants and flowers: Cuemanco, Palacio de la Flor, Mercado de Madre Selva and the historic market at San Luis Tlaxialtemalco. Cuemanco is the largest in Xochimilco and the largest of its kind in Latin America, covering thirteen hectares, with its own cactus garden and forms part of the ecological preserve of Cuemanco. The borough produces 2.5 million poinsettias each year, accounting for most of the 3.5 million sold each year in Mexico City. This represents an income for the borough of about 25 to 30 million pesos annually, grown by about 10,000 growers.|$|E

50|$|Margaret Thatcher's first {{government}} and her popular policy of giving council house tenants the Right to Buy while promoting share ownership {{among the public}} sector workforce, not to mention her emphasis on the individual, perhaps saw Skeltonian principles at their height.

500|$|Ever {{since the}} planetarium's closing, {{there have been}} groups that have lobbied for its reopening. At first, efforts {{concentrated}} on reopening the existing facility, but in more recent years, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>has</b> shifted to establishing a wholly new permanent planetarium facility elsewhere in downtown Toronto. Smaller educational planetaria still exist in the Toronto region. At some time after 1995, Seneca College closed their Roberta Bondar Earth and Space Centre planetarium. [...] The Ontario Science Centre on Don Mills Road operates a high-resolution digital planetarium with funding from CA, Inc., and the Royal Ontario Museum also offers a small, portable, inflatable planetarium for school groups.|$|E
