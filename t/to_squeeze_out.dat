5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>out</b> water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
25|$|A twenty-minute warm-up {{session was}} held {{on the morning of}} the main race. Mortara again managed <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>out</b> Ericsson to top the timesheets, with Coletti also being within a tenth of a second from the fastest time. Ricciardo was fourth ahead of Bottas, van der Zande, Sims, Chilton, Merhi and the {{qualification}} race winner Vernay. Ho and Boyd did not set times during the session, with the Ulsterman's Hitech Racing car looking unlikely to start the race after his accident on Saturday.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of date-presses (madbassat) are found in houses {{throughout}} the town. They are small rooms with ridged plastered floors sloping to one corner where a jar would have been placed. Dates were packed in sacks and placed {{on the floor with}} weights on top <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>out</b> the date juice - a sweet sticky syrup (dibs). The jar would collect and preserve the syrup for later consumption or use in cooking. In 2014, a site was excavated which revealed the largest yet-discovered date-pressing site in the country and region. There were 27 date presses found overall, including 11 found in one lone complex.|$|E

Olga Savchuk won a tiebreaker against Arn to take women's singles, 5–4, and give the Freedoms a 17–15 lead heading to the final set.

500|$|It {{was during}} the months of spring 1819 that he wrote many of his major odes. [...] Following the month of May 1819, he began to tackle other forms of poetry, {{including}} a play, some longer pieces, {{and a return to}} his unfinished epic, Hyperion. His brother's financial woes continued to loom over him, and, as a result, Keats had little energy or inclination for composition, but, on 19September 1819, he managed <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>out</b> To Autumn, his last major work and the one that rang the curtain down on his career as a poet.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} issued a redistricting plan following the 1980 census and congressional reapportionment. It tried <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>out</b> Republican lawmakers. The newly drawn district put Doolittle into a predominately Democratic district, where he lost to then-Assemblyman Leroy Greene in 1982 {{for the state}} senate. But by a quirk of redistricting rules, Doolittle {{was able to keep}} his original seat until 1984. He won another term in the state senate by beating Ray E. Johnson, a Republican turned Independent from Chico. An administrative law judge later found Doolittle guilty of violating campaign finance laws because his campaign had contributed to his Democratic opponent in order to pull votes away from Johnson.|$|E

Estimation of the settlement which takes place during and after construction is of considerable importance to the construction engineer. The theoretical analysis of the settlement of a rectangular area under uniform load {{is presented in the}} paper and the more significant results are abstracted in tables and graphs. These results can be used to treat more complicated load distributions or irregular foundation areas by superposition. For the accuracy required in engineering, this extension requires only simple arithmetic. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mistletoe}} {{fruit is}} a single-seeded berry, often brightly coloured, with striking adaptations for bird dispersal, germination and attachment. Under the outer coat {{of the fruit}} is a sticky layer of viscin, which is rich in glucose, and which envelops the seed. Birds which feed on the fruits often have specialized feeding behaviour, swallowing the seed whole after squeezing it from the fruit coat. Birds have been reported nipping the end off the fruit, as though removing a cap, prior <b>to</b> <b>squeezing</b> <b>out</b> the seed. Notable dispersal agents are the mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum), and some honeyeaters in Australia (Grantiella, Acanthagenys, Plectorhyncha) ...|$|R
2500|$|The Oligarchy is {{the largest}} {{monopoly}} trusts (or robber barons) who manage <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>out</b> the middle class by bankrupting most small to mid-sized business as well as reducing all farmers to effective serfdom. This Oligarchy maintains power through a [...] "labor caste" [...] and the Mercenaries. Laborers in essential industries like steel and rail are elevated and given decent wages, housing, and education. Indeed, the tragic turn in the novel (and Jack London's core warning to his contemporaries) is the treachery of these favored unions which break with the other unions and side with the Oligarchy. Further, a second, military caste is formed: the Mercenaries. The Mercenaries are officially {{the army of the}} US but are in fact in the employ of the Oligarchs.|$|E
2500|$|Carl {{concludes that}} as of the 2010s, the {{interest}} in Brian's life comes primarily from [...] "the human-interest angle" [...] rather than a musical one, [...] " [...] plays into the popular tendency to fetishise any overlap between genius and madness, which seems at once like a denial of the commonness of mental illness {{and a way to}} channel our envy of the gifted. [...] there is the nagging desire, whether exploitative or well-meant, to push the one-time prodigy to produce again, <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> <b>out</b> one last masterpiece. These factors all distort both Wilson’s story and his significance." [...] In 2011, after speaking to some of Wilson's close acquaintances, biographer Jon Stebbins speculated that [...] "Working in the studio and especially touring is not really his choice. His handlers, managers, and wife insist that he work. It's all a bit Landy-like when you look behind the curtain." ...|$|E
