5|$|Coon {{assumed the}} role of {{superintendent}} of shops in 1896. During his tenure at Georgia Tech, he moved the curriculum away from vocational training. Coon emphasized a balance between the shop and the classroom. Coon <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> students more modern quantification methods to solve engineering problems instead of outdated and more costly trial and error methods. He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis and problem solving, and mathematics.|$|E
5|$|After a {{preliminary}} investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and family for questioning. Georgekutty, who had predicted {{that this would}} happen, had already <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> family how to change their alibi {{at the time of}} murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies. Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. However, Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later.|$|E
5|$|As a teacher, Sudirman <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> {{students}} {{lessons on}} morality using {{examples from the}} lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.|$|E

5|$|Flooding also {{occurred}} in Cuba. Hundreds were evacuated {{their homes in}} four different provinces in Cuba, including 400peasant families in Oriente Province. Near Santiago de Cuba, 25houses were swept away after the Bayamo River overflowed. In the same area, {{a woman and her}} four sons drowned due to the swollen river. Additionally, a body of a man was recovered near Santa Cruz del Sur. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas. Losses in Cuba were estimated to have reached $100,000. Ella had a role in the Cuban Revolution as the government troops of Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar stayed in their barracks during the storm while the rebels made progress under cover of Ella. Later, when the guerrillas heard about Hurricane Fifi on the radio, Che Guevara <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> illiterate comrades that entities like tropical cyclones are named in alphabetical order.|$|E
5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
5|$|Hogg and {{his family}} {{subsequently}} lived a mostly quiet and stable life together. At times their finances were strained, although {{they were able to}} afford a cook and a maid. Hogg enjoyed spending time with his children and paid particular attention to their education. He <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> daughter Prudentia Greek and Latin, but discouraged her from becoming a Bluestocking. Hogg also tried to convince Jane to study Greek, but was unsuccessful. Henry Cleveland, Jane's nephew, moved into their household after leaving the military. Hogg then accepted Henry {{as a member of the}} family. Gardening had always been a hobby of Hogg's, and in his later years he often spent time maintaining his gardens with Jane.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E
5|$|In 1680, Zotov {{embarked}} on a three-year diplomatic mission to the Crimea; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter. When Peter left the Kremlin to spend his childhood at Preobrazhenskoye, two years after Zotov's departure, his memories of the tutors who had <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> siblings, Feodor and Sophia, were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic subjects for a time. He later resumed his studies under Afanassyi Nesterov and Zotov after the latter's return from the Crimea. Although Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology, he nevertheless {{learned a great deal}} of the latter from his tutors. Zotov (and later his sons) later worked with Peter to translate books about fortification from a Western European language into Russian. Peter did not learn, or forgot, a great deal about mathematics, a subject that he had to learn properly in his late teens for use in siege warfare and fortification. In later years, Peter regretted his lack of a fuller education, and sought to give his daughters Anne and Elizabeth educations equivalent of any European princess.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} March 1801, Jean-François left Figeac for Grenoble, {{which he}} reached on the 27th of March, and where Jacques-Joseph lived in a two-room flat on the rue Neuve. Jacques-Joseph was then working as an {{assistant}} in the import-export company Chatel, Champollion and Rif, yet <b>taught</b> <b>his</b> brother to read, and supported his education. His brother also may {{have been part of}} the source of Champollion's interest in Egypt, since as a young man he wanted to join Napoleon's Egyptian expedition, and often regretted not being able to go. Often known as the younger brother of better known Jacques-Joseph, Jean-François was often called Champollion le Jeune (the young). Later when his brother became the more famous of the two, Jacques added the town of his birth as a second surname and hence is often referred to as Champollion-Figeac, in contrast to his brother Champollion. Although studious and largely self-educated, Jacques did not have Jean-François' genius for language; however, he was talented at earning a living, and supported Jean-François for most of his life.|$|E

Solomon notes that, while Leopold was a devoted teacher to his children, {{there is evidence that}} Mozart was keen to progress beyond what he was <b>taught.</b> <b>His</b> first ink-spattered composition and his precocious efforts with the violin were of his own initiative, and came as a surprise to Leopold, who eventually gave up composing when his son's musical talents became evident.|$|E
