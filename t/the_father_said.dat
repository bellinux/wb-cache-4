2500|$|To me, the Robo quarterback {{means the}} guy has all the equipment, <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>said.</b> Everything in sync. Everything balanced. The perfect machine. From a {{training}} standpoint, not that Todd is that, but the appearance of that is a positive situation. In February Sports Illustrated published an article, titled [...] "Bred To Be A Superstar", that discussed his unique upbringing under his father who wanted to turn his son into the [...] "perfect quarterback". [...] The article declared Marinovich [...] "America's first test-tube athlete", and discussed how his mother encouraged his interest in art, music, and classical Hollywood cinema while banning cartoons as too violent.

2500|$|The first middle-school [...] "cheese" [...] {{death in}} {{published}} accounts {{was that of}} Oscar Gutierrez, a 15-year-old eighth grader in northwest Dallas, who died February 18, 2007; his brother stated that the boy had previously survived an overdose of the same drug. Community rallies followed Gutierrez' death as parents and others urged the police and school district to become more active in fighting what {{was viewed as a}} growing problem. The death of Fernando Cortez Jr., a high school student, on March 31, 2007, led to further community activism. Initially this death was linked to cheese heroin based on the father's comments in press reports; <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>said</b> his son was at a Dallas party when he was offered [...] "cheese" [...] and that the boy had not tried drugs before that he was aware of. Cortez's father {{went on to become a}} speaker at community meetings within the school system, urging that parents keep closer watch over their children. On April 24, the same day toxicology results were announced confirming the link to cheese, police announced a family friend would be charged with murder for having mixed the drugs for Cortez.|$|E
