5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{requisition}} promised to the legions, Germanicus paid {{them out of}} his own pocket. All 8 legions were given money, even if they didn't demand it. Both <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> of the Lower and Upper Rhine had returned to order. It seemed prudent to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>armies,</b> but Germanicus took it a step further. In a bid to secure the loyalty of his troops, he led them on a raid against the Marsi, a Germanic people on the upper Ruhr river. Germanicus massacred the villages of the Marsi he encountered and pillaged the surrounding territory. On the way back to their winter quarters at Castra Vetera, they pushed successfully through the opposing tribes (Bructeri, Tubantes, and Usipetes) between the Marsi and the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> from Savoy, Auvergne and Montferrat joined Louis in Constantinople, {{having taken}} the land route through Italy and {{crossing}} from Brindisi to Durazzo, the entire army was shipped across the Bosporus to Asia Minor.

Byzantium had just been invaded by Roger II of Sicily, and all of Manuel's army was needed in the Peloponnese. Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance, unlike <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> of the First Crusade. In the tradition set by his grandfather Alexios I, Manuel also had the French swear {{to return to the}} Empire any territory they captured.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis {{considered}} replacing John Bell Hood {{in command of the}} Army of Tennessee and he asked Robert E.

Davis met with Beauregard in Augusta, Georgia, on October 2 and offered him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River, with <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> of Hood and Richard Taylor under his ostensible command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of <b>the</b> <b>armies</b> unless he should join them in person during an emergency.
