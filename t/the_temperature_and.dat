5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is divided into}} a number of sections depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65km. At the furnace-like surface the winds are slow, but {{at the top of the}} troposphere <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E

5|$|The {{park has}} a large {{diversity}} of vegetation. Due to <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> climate differences between different areas and elevations of the park, {{not only is the}} typical Aegean flora present, but also many specimens normally only found in separate coastal areas of Turkey, such as in the Mediterranean, Marmara, and Black Sea regions.|$|E
5|$|To left {{of center}} in the station model, <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> dew point are plotted. Within the United States on surface weather maps, they are still plotted in degrees Fahrenheit. Otherwise, {{they will be in}} units of degrees Celsius. This {{knowledge}} is important to meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal dew point) are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, which can help determine location of weather fronts.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> velocity, <b>temperature,</b> <b>and</b> {{concentration}} variation {{along the}} y-direction is considered small {{enough so that}} it is negligible. Therefore, <b>the</b> velocity, <b>temperature,</b> <b>and</b> concentration distributions within the pond are two-dimensional.|$|R

5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. <b>The</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases <b>the</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>and,</b> as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out {{a position where they}} can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to <b>the</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>and</b> the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E
50|$|Mobile energy {{carriers}} (for example conduction-band {{electrons in}} a semiconductor) will move along temperature gradients due to statistics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relationshipbetween <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> kinetic energy. If {{there is a}} magnetic field transversal to <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient <b>and</b> <b>the</b> carriers are electrically charged, they experience a force perpendicular to their direction of motion (also the direction of <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> gradient) <b>and</b> to <b>the</b> magnetic field. Thus, a perpendicular electric field is induced.|$|R

5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> day length.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, <b>the</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>and</b> the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have a 43% {{chance of}} {{surviving}} their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17years has been recorded. <b>The</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates {{with the number of}} young fledging each year and their survival rate. Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.|$|E

5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> heating rate).|$|E
5|$|Roman baths {{played a}} leading role in the {{development}} of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. These domes are very conical in shape, similar to those on an Assyrian bas-relief found in Nineveh. At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar, Spain, a dome has been identified from the middle of the 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily. According to Vitruvius, <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus. Domes were particularly well suited to the hot rooms of baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> (<b>and</b> dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} micro <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> {{humidity}} sensors are fabricated to measure <b>the</b> junction <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> humidity of {{light emitting diodes}} (LED). <b>The</b> junction <b>temperature</b> is frequently measured using thermal resistance measurement technology.

In its initial configuration, it measures up to multipoles of 3,000 with a resolution of around 6 arcminutes.

5|$|When helium is {{exhausted}} at {{the core}} of a massive star, the core contracts and <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process).

Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.|$|E
