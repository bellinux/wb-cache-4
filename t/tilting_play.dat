40|$|In this study, the {{characteristics}} of moist potential vorticity (MPV) {{in the vicinity of}} a surface cyclone center and their physical processes are investigated. A prognostic equation of surface absolute vorticity is then used {{to examine the relationship between}} the cyclone tracks and negative MPV (NMPV) using numerical simulations of the life cycle of an extratropical cyclone. It is shown that the MPV approach developed herein, i. e., by tracing the peak NMPV, can be used to help trace surface cyclones during their development and mature stages. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to investigate the impact of different initial moisture fields on the effectiveness of the MPV approach. It is found that the lifetime of NMPV depends mainly on the initial moisture field, the magnitude of condensational heating, and the advection of NMPV. When NMPV moves into a saturated environment at or near a cyclone center, it can trace better the evolution of the surface cyclone due to the conservative property of MPV. It is also shown that the NMPV generation is closely associated with the coupling of large potential temperature and moisture gradients as a result of frontogenesis processes. Analyses indicate that condensation, confluence and <b>tilting</b> <b>play</b> important but different roles in determining the NMPV generation. NMPV is generated mainly through the changes in the strength of baroclinicity and in the direction of the moisture gradient due to moist and/or dry air mass intrusion into the baroclinic zone.

40|$|We study {{magnetopause}} crossings {{made by the}} Interball Tail spacecraft at {{high latitudes}} under various interplanetary conditions. When the IMF mostly northward the Interball Tail observes quasi steady state reconnection signatures at the high latitude magnetopause, which include a well-defined de Hoffman-Teller frame, satisfaction of stress balance (Walen relations) and D-shaped ion velocity distributions. Under variable or southward IMF the high latitude magnetopause is a tangentional discontinuity. However, in certain conditions, just after the magnetopause crossing, irrespective of the IMF orientation, decelerate magnetosheath flows are observed in the magnetosheath region adjacent to the high latitude magnetopause. This leads to formation of the region where the sub-Alfvenic flow at high latitudes exists.

40|$|Our first-principles {{computations}} {{show that}} the ground state of PbTiO_ 3 under hydrostatic pressure transforms discontinuously from P 4 mm to R 3 c at 9 GPa. Spontaneous polarization decreases with increasing pressure so that the R 3 c phase transforms to the centrosymmetric R 3 ̅c phase at around 30 GPa. The first-order phase transition between tetragonal and rhombohedral phase is exceptional {{since there is no}} evidence for a bridging phase. The essential feature of the R 3 c and R 3 ̅c phases is that they allow the oxygen octahedron to increase its volume V_B at the expense of cuboctahedral volume V_A around a Pb ion. This is further supported by the fact that neither the R 3 m nor Cm phase, which keep the V_A/V_B ratio constant, is a ground state within the pressure range between 0 and 40 GPa. Thus tetragonal strain is dominant up to 9 GPa, whereas at higher pressures efficient compression through oxygen octahedra <b>tilting</b> <b>plays</b> the central role for PbTiO_ 3. Previously predicted pressure induced colossal enhancement of piezoelectricity in PbTiO_ 3 corresponds to unstable Cm and R 3 m phases. This suggests that the phase instability, in contrast to the polarization rotation, is responsible for the large piezoelectric properties observed in systems like Pb(Zr,Ti) O_ 3 {{in the vicinity of the}} morphotropic phase boundary...|$|R

The simulations were carried with the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, adaptive mesh 'Hydra' code (SPH-A$P^ 3 $M), with model galaxies consisting of dark halo, and gas and stellar disc components. The simulations also include radiative cooling, {{which is important}} for keeping the warm, diffuse gas of moderate density from being unrealistically heated by the ICM. We examine the role that wind velocity, density and galaxy <b>tilt</b> <b>play</b> in gas stripping. The onset of the ICM wind has {{a profound effect on}} the disc gas that is not immediately stripped. This remnant disc is displaced relative to the halo center and compressed. This can trigger gravitational instability and the formation of numerous flocculent spirals. These waves transport angular momentum outward, resulting in further compression of the inner disc and the formation of a prominent gas ring. This 'annealing' process makes the inner disc, which contains much of the total gas mass, resistant to further stripping, but presumably susceptible to global starbursts. When the mass loss and annealing processes go to completion we find that the total amount of mass lost from a fixed target galaxy is well fit by a simple power-law function of a dimensionless parameter that combines the ram pressure and internal properties of the galaxy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the experiences and results gained {{in the use of}} tiltmeters at Mt. Etna during the last twenty years. The tilt data represent a fundamental contribution to understanding of volcanic phenomena. Moreover, the <b>tilt</b> <b>played</b> an important role in analytic modelling, of the sources linked to the most important recent lateral eruptions. The tilt data also provided evidence of co-seismic variations for higher energy and shallower seismic events. We also discuss the marked variations that often occur over the entire volcano edifice without being associated with seismicity or eruptive activity. This work also analyses and discusses experiments conducted to verify the limitations of shallow borehole sensors. The main causes of noise are the thermo-elastic effects on the ground and the spurious effects on the sensor due to temperature variations. To this end, results of recent experiments to verify the theoretical filtering of thermal noise at depth and to examine the real thermal coefficients of the sensors through a patented instrument are discussed. Finally, results obtained from signal recordings, applied theoretical studies, experiments performed and technological advances have recently suggested new horizons for tilt monitoring through the development of innovative instrumentation. We describe the application of new technology for the detection of tilt by a long base fluid tiltmeter, installed in 1997, which is able to record very stable, high precision signals with very low noise, thus allowing more detailed investigation of the different phases of volcanic activity...|$|R
40|$|The Milankovitch theory {{states that}} the orbital eccentricity, precession, and {{obliquity}} of the Earth influence our climate by modulating the summer insolation at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Despite considerable success of this theory in explaining climate change over the Pleistocene epoch (2. 6 to 0. 01 Myr ago), it is inconclusive with regard to which combination of orbital elements paced the 100 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles over the late Pleistocene. Here we explore {{the role of the}} orbital elements in pacing the Pleistocene deglaciations by modeling ice-volume variations in a Bayesian approach. When comparing models, this approach takes into account the uncertainties in the data as well as the different degrees of model complexity. We find that the Earth's obliquity (axial <b>tilt)</b> <b>plays</b> a dominant role in pacing the glacial cycles over the whole Pleistocene, while precession only becomes important in pacing major deglaciations after the transition of the dominant period from 41 kyr to 100 kyr (the mid-Pleistocene transition). We also find that geomagnetic field and orbital inclination variations are unlikely to have paced the Pleistocene deglaciations. We estimate that the mid-Pleistocene transition took place over a 220 kyr interval centered on a time 715 kyr ago, although the data permit a range of 600 [...] 1000 kyr. This transition, occurring within just two 100 kyr cycles, indicates a relatively rapid change in the climate response to insolation.
