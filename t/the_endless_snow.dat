50|$|Amundsen spurned the {{traditional}} white tent, and instead dyed his tent material black. He stated {{that this was}} to serve three purposes: First, black would absorb what little solar radiation would fall upon the tent. Second, a black tent would provide the best possible contrast against <b>the</b> <b>endless</b> <b>snow</b> and ice if one became lost. And finally, the black provided a rest for the eyes. In addition, the square, pyramid-style tent was equipped with a single central pole that was lashed {{to one of the}} sledges in its full length during travel, avoiding the need to assemble tent-poles and making the job of pitching the tent very simple and quick. The tent also featured a sewn-in floor, which was an innovation several years ahead of its time.|$|E

Along <b>the</b> <b>endless</b> background of <b>snow</b> and ice, aerial documentation is taken of the participants forming a line that reenacts the image of his painting held {{in the collection of the}} Guggenheim museum.|$|R
6000|$|Mechanically they {{swept the}} ice and snow with their eyes. It was a {{homogeneous}} scene, devoid of contrasts or bold contours, dreary, desolate, and monotonous,--the ice-packed sea, the slow slope of the beach, the background of low-lying hills, and over all thrown <b>the</b> <b>endless</b> mantle of <b>snow.</b> [...] "No trees, no bluffs, no cabins, no telegraph poles, nothin'," [...] moaned Red Bill; [...] "nothin' respectable enough nor big enough to swing the toes of a five-foot man clear o' the ground. I give it up." [...] He looked yearningly at that portion of Jan's anatomy which joins the head and shoulders. [...] "Give it up," [...] he repeated sadly to Lawson. [...] "Throw the rope down. Gawd never intended this here country for livin' purposes, an' that's a cold frozen fact." ...|$|R
60|$|But on its {{northern}} side Canada is set fast against the frozen seas of the Pole and the desolate region of barren rock and ice-bound island that is joined to the polar ocean {{by a common}} mantle of snow. For {{hundreds and hundreds of}} miles the vast fortress of ice rears its battlements of shining glaciers. The unending sunshine of the Arctic summer falls upon untrodden snow. The cold light of the {2} aurora illumines in winter an endless desolation. There is no sound, save when at times the melting water falls from the glistening sides of some vast pinnacle of ice, or when the leaden sea forces its tide between the rock-bound islands. Here in this vast territory civilization has no part and man no place. Life struggles northward only to die out in the Arctic cold. The green woods of the lake district and the blossoms of the prairies are left behind. The fertility of the Great West gives place to the rock-strewn wilderness of the barren grounds. A stunted and deformed vegetation fights its way to the Arctic Circle. Rude grasses and thin moss cling desperately to the naked rock. Animal life pushes even farther. The seas of the frozen ocean still afford a sustenance. Even mankind is found eking out a savage livelihood on the shores of the northern sea. But gradually all fades, until nothing is left but <b>the</b> <b>endless</b> plain of <b>snow,</b> stretching towards the Pole.|$|R
50|$|Each of <b>the</b> <b>Endless</b> has a realm {{in which}} they are {{absolutely}} sovereign. Within their realm, each member of <b>the</b> <b>Endless</b> has a gallery containing symbols, or sigils, of <b>the</b> other <b>Endless.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Endless</b> may contact each other by holding the appropriate sigil and calling for that member of <b>the</b> <b>Endless.</b> Destiny is also able to summon his siblings by using his gallery of portraits, whether they want it or not (as seen in The Sandman : Overture).|$|R

50|$|Red Lobster {{has offered}} an <b>endless</b> <b>snow</b> crab leg {{promotion}} twice in its history. However, in 2003, the promotion resulted in parent company Darden Restaurants taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris' {{departure from the}} company. The ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was {{the amount of time}} a customer spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. This resulted in increased wait times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Endless</b> {{spend most}} of their time {{fulfilling}} their functions as embodiments of natural forces. For example, Death leads the souls of the dead away from the realm of the living, while Dream oversees the realm of dreams and imagination ("The Dreaming") and regulates dreams and inspiration. One notable facet of their depiction is that none of them are [...] "representations" [...] or [...] "personifications" [...] of their function, they simply are their function; as Sto-Oa says of Death in Endless Nights, [...] "She is Death, just as he is Dream, and that one is Desire." [...] In The Sandman (vol. 2) #48, Destruction gives a further description of <b>the</b> Endless:"The <b>Endless</b> are merely patterns. <b>The</b> <b>Endless</b> are ideas. <b>The</b> <b>Endless</b> are wave functions. <b>The</b> <b>Endless</b> are repeating motifs. <b>The</b> <b>Endless</b> are echoes of darkness, and nothing more... And even our existences are brief and bounded. None of us will last longer than this version of the Universe." ...|$|R
