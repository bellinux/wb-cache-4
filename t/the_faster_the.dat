5|$|M87 is a {{very strong}} source of gamma rays, which are the most {{energetic}} rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but in 2006, using the High Energy Stereoscopic System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 the most promising source for these gamma rays. In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> variation in flux, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is {{a special kind of}} military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics; relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E

25|$|One subtle {{feature of}} rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while {{carrying}} a given load, {{is capable of}} giving a particular delta-v. This delta-v means that the speed increases (or decreases) by a particular amount, independent of the initial speed. However, because kinetic energy is a square law on speed, this means that <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> rocket is travelling before the burn the more orbital energy it gains or loses.|$|E
25|$|Aberration may be {{explained}} as the difference in angle of {{a beam of light}} in different inertial frames of reference. A common analogy is to consider the apparent direction of falling rain. If rain is falling vertically in the frame of reference of a person standing still, then to a person moving forwards the rain will appear to arrive at an angle, requiring the moving observer to tilt their umbrella forwards. <b>The</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> observer moves, the more tilt is needed.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} methods of using stirrups, a shorter stirrup to allow more {{mobility}} and a longer stirrup to allow greater control. The stirrup itself is similar, but {{the length of the}} stirrup leather is different. In each case, the stirrup length allows the rider to remain over the center of balance of the horse for the average speed characteristic of the discipline; <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> horse travels, the more forward the rider must be positioned, and hence the shorter the stirrup.|$|E

25|$|Since supercapacitors do {{not rely}} on {{chemical}} changes in the electrodes (except for those with polymer electrodes), lifetimes depend mostly on {{the rate of evaporation}} of the liquid electrolyte. This evaporation in general is a function of temperature, of current load, current cycle frequency and voltage. Current load and cycle frequency generate internal heat, so that the evaporation-determining temperature is the sum of ambient and internal heat. This temperature is measurable as core temperature {{in the center of a}} capacitor body. The higher the core temperature <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> evaporation and the shorter the lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The {{emission}} lines seen on {{the spectrum}} of a Seyfert galaxy may come {{from the surface of}} the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the central engine in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to our line of sight, and <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the emission line will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.|$|E
25|$|Because surface ocean {{currents}} {{are driven by}} the movement of wind over the water's surface, the Coriolis force also affects the movement of {{ocean currents}} and cyclones as well. Many of the ocean's largest currents circulate around warm, high-pressure areas called gyres. Though the circulation is not as significant as that in the air, the deflection caused by the Coriolis effect is what creates the spiraling pattern in these gyres. The spiraling wind pattern helps the hurricane form. The stronger the force from the Coriolis effect, <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> wind spins and picks up additional energy, increasing {{the strength of the}} hurricane.|$|E

25|$|Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} play {{an important}} role in action potentials. If enough channels open when there is a change in the cell's membrane potential, a small but significant number of Na+ ions will move into the cell down their electrochemical gradient, further depolarizing the cell. Thus, the more Na+ channels localized in a region of a cell's membrane <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> action potential will propagate and the more excitable that area of the cell will be. This is an example of a positive feedback loop. The ability of these channels to assume a closed-inactivated state causes the refractory period and is critical for the propagation of action potentials down an axon.|$|E
25|$|The zoetrope {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as its predecessor, the phenakistoscope, but is more convenient and allows the animation to be viewed by several people at the same time. Instead of being radially arrayed on a disc, the sequence of pictures depicting phases of motion is on a paper strip. For viewing, this is placed against the inner surface of {{the lower part of}} an open-topped metal drum, the upper part of which is provided with a vertical viewing slit across from each picture.

25|$|Members of {{the order}} Diptera have a {{holometabolous}} lifecycle, meaning they go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago, or adult. C. cadaverina typically has around 17 generations of offspring per year with 25 to 50 eggs per generation if the right conditions are present. Temperature can have an extreme impact on development. If the temperature gets above or below a certain temperature it can cause all development of the fly to stop. In general, the warmer it is, <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>the</b> lifecycle will go; while if it is colder, the lifecycle may take longer than usual.
