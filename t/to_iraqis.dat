5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province <b>to</b> <b>Iraqis.</b> On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant {{to show off the}} Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E
25|$|A {{research}} {{regarding the}} comparison of Y chromosomes of Indian Muslims with other Indian groups was published in 2005. In this study 124 Sunnis and 154 Shias of Uttar Pradesh were randomly selected for their genetic evaluation. Other than Muslims, Hindu higher and middle caste group members were also selected for the genetic analysis. Out of 1021 samples in this study, only 17 samples showed E haplogroup {{and all of them}} were Shias. The very minor increased frequency however, does place these Shias, solely with regards to their haplogroups, closer <b>to</b> <b>Iraqis,</b> Turks and Palestinians.|$|E
500|$|Farmers holding grain {{ingested}} it instead, {{since their}} own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed {{free of charge}} or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. Many Iraqis were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings. [...] Initially, farmers were to certify with a thumbprint or signature that they understood the grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors {{did not ask for}} such an indication. Warnings on the sacks were in Spanish and English, not at all understood, or included the black-and-white skull and crossbones design, which meant nothing <b>to</b> <b>Iraqis.</b> The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared to be fine. The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The {{producers}} knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, [...] "we were all pretty nervous, {{in the sense that we}} all felt we owed a real obligation, not just <b>to</b> <b>Iraqis</b> but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played." [...] In an early draft of [...] "Solitary", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.|$|E

50|$|Syria has {{historically}} offered assistance to Iraqi refugees. At {{the beginning of}} 2007, the UNHCR estimated {{that the number of}} Iraqi refugees in Syria was over 1.2 million. 80-90% of the Iraqi refugee population lives in the capital city of Damascus. The reason for its large refugee population can be attributed to more than just geography. Until 2007, Syria maintained an open-door policy <b>to</b> <b>Iraqis</b> fleeing the war-ravaged country.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{anthropologist}} Geraldine Chatelard has written, Jordanian officials initially viewed the Iraqis {{as a security}} and economic issue and not a humanitarian concern.

For this reason, the Government of Jordan argued that the displaced Iraqis were not refugees, but [...] "guests" [...] who would return to Iraq.|$|E
