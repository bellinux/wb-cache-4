50|$|Because of timber's great importance, in 1820 a {{committee}} of the House of Lords was formed to review {{the state of the}} timber trade. Led by Lord Lansdowne the committee strongly supported the reduction of the duties. This has been viewed {{as one of the first}} successes of free trade ideology in Britain. The duties were not eliminated, but they were brought to a level that left Baltic wood competitive with that from Canada. These reductions were a rare example of laissez-faire in an era still almost totally committed to mercantilism. The post-war era also saw a great unwillingness to enforce the duties that were in place. Rampant smuggling of timber into and out of Norway was mostly ignored, as were the illegal exports of bullion to fund the trade. In 1824 the duties were further lowered when Britain began to sign reciprocity treaties with other powers. Out of the first ten bilateral trade treaties signed, seven of them were with Baltic nations covering all the major <b>timber</b> <b>exporters</b> except for Russia. These quick reversals of Baltic trade policy in an era before free trade was paramount can almost certainly be attributed to the navy's unwillingness to become reliant on Canadian timber now that trade with the Baltic had been unquestionably secured.|$|E

40|$|Trade {{interventions}} are increasingly advocated {{as a means}} for controlling timber-related tropical deforestation. This paper analyzes the impact on deforestation of such policy instruments in a dynamic framework. The forest is modelled as a potentially renewable resource, and timber is extracted for purposes of export and domestic consumption. Optimality conditions for a variety of model specifications are derived, and the impacts of changes in the terms of trade and market structure on long-run deforestation are analyzed. The results of this analysis suggest that trade interventions that seek to affect the terms of trade against the export of tropical timber products are in the long run a second-best policy option for influencing the deforestation process.

40|$|Just {{fifty years}} ago old-growth forests {{blanketed}} much of the tropical Asia-Pacific. Since then corporate loggers have irrevocably degraded most of the valuable commercial forests. The Philippines, for example, {{once one of the}} world’s largest tropical <b>timber</b> <b>exporters,</b> is now a net importer of tropical timber, with old-growth forests covering less than three percent of total land area. The outcry over this ecological devastation has put loggers under increasing pressure over the last decade to harvest on a genuinely sustainable basis. Internationally, a forests regime has been consolidating with the principle of sustainable management at the core. Nationally, states have been reforming policies to increase timber rev-enues and internalize environmental principles. Such changes would appear at first glance to pose a great challenge to corporate loggers in the Asia-Pacific. Yet, so far, the transformation of the rules and principles of forest management has done little to alter logging practices on the ground. Why this disjuncture?

40|$|Implemented in March 2013, the EU Timber Regulation is {{affecting}} hardwood exporters and importers. The EUTR requires proof of timber’s origin and legality {{to ensure that}} no illegal timber is imported into the EU. The EUTR is part of the EU’s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, with its specific goal to end illegal logging, thereby improving sustainability of forest resources. To this end the EU intends to block imports of any wood or wood product which comes from unknown sources. Certification of SFM will help EU importers minimize risk, which {{is an essential part of}} their required due diligence system.

The EU’s response to this problem came with the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, with its specific goal to end illegal logging, thereby improving sustainability of forest resources. In March 2013, an additional step was taken by implementing the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR).

40|$|The timber {{industry}} is currently growing rapidly in Malaysia, {{who is the}} second largest tropical <b>timber</b> production <b>exporter</b> in the world. The {{timber industry}} contributes to various sectors such as furniture and components, panel products, mouldings and joinery, and the construction especially for the roof trusses. Most of the Malaysian buildings are adopted the timber roof truss system because of its availability, economics, simple design and fast installation due to the prefabricated method. However, there are some challenges such as the impact from steel trusses, raw material supply, and technology and techniques. This review will provide the information that will be extremely useful to the timber roofing industry. 62 % of the total land area of Malaysia is covered by tropical forest. The natural resources are used for farming, agricultural, mining, timber and urbanisation and infrastructure. The forest use {{is controlled by the}} government to achieve a definite and stable forest resource. The timber must be certified by the Malaysian Timber Certification Council to show that the timber products are from the sustainable managed forests or else a penalty will be imposed. The forest industry and timber industry are closely related. The Malaysian timber industry can be classified into three main sectors, i. e. sawmilling, wood chipping and veneer manufacturing. The sawmilling produces the sawn timber that is adopted for the timber roof truss system. The research aims to review the current timber industry in Malaysia, particularly in the construction technique of roof trusses. The objectives of this research are as follows: - investigate the classifications, properties, uses and market of Malaysian timber; - review the roofing industry in Malaysia; - document the standard and quality of timber required for the timber trusses; and - review the design method and the costing involved for the system...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe study {{examines}} the export tax as a trade policy tool in Malawi, {{with a specific}} focus on the timber industry. This study was motivated by the sudden imposition of an export tax on timber trade by the Malawi Government in 2011, as a reactive policy to an upsurge in timber exports from Malawi. The objective of the study was, therefore, to investigate why the Malawi Government decided to impose the export tax, and whether this trade policy tool has been effective in meeting the objectives. In this regard, the study was done in a broad manner to cover both the theoretical aspects of the export tax, as a trade policy tool, and the practical realities about the Malawi Government's management of the forestry sector and the timber trading {{in an environment where}} the Government decided to join the global rules-based trading system. The study used a descriptive explanatory design, employing qualitative methods that involved the use of questionnaires and analysis of the existing literature. The results revealed that an export tax is a duty that is applied on products before they are exported in order to achieve certain objectives, which include government revenue collection, domestic price stabilization, achieving food security, or promoting value addition, hence, industrial development. The review of the literature has demonstrated that care should be exercised when adopting this policy tool because export taxes can be trade-restricting and welfare diminishing on a country, or can constitute a "beggar-thy-neighbour" policy when not properly designed. It is in consideration of such consequences that it has now become fashionable for modern free trade agreements (FTAs) to include provisions on export taxes. For instance, the SADC Protocol on Trade includes Article 5 which prohibits Member States from applying any export duties on goods for export to other Member States. However, from the study, it has been established that if the export taxes are properly designed and implemented, they can boost Government revenue and catalyse industrial productivity. In this respect, evidence has shown that the Government imposed the export tax on timber to curb influx of foreign traders who have been buying the timber because it was cheaper that the timber found in the neighbouring countries. This was a reactionary use of export tax as a trade policy tool, rather than taking a proactive approach to ensure that the Government achieves the policy objectives. Thus, the available literature has shown that the Government could combine the various objectives for introducing the export tax on timber. In this regard, the efficacy of the export taxes depends on the creation of proper linkages with other policy initiatives, such as existence of local knowledge, technological development and processing capacity for increased local production to meet high standards of the international market. Thus, while the Malawi Government can maintain the export tax on timber, it should be done with a very clear objectives and timeframe for using it as a trade policy tool. The Government can combine a number of policy objectives, such as, revenue generation and use the proceeds to undertake re-afforestation programme and protect the environment while, at the same time, encouraging value addition or encouraging global value chains. Such initiatives have the capacity to generate economic gains because as the country builds the productive capacities, there is employment creation and use of other domestically produced inputs or raw materials. In this respect, {{it is important that the}} pricing of timber or forestry products should also reflect the appropriate or true economic rent, which should be levied from the use of the natural resource. The study has, therefore, revealed that the Malawi Government should review the method of collecting the export taxes to ensure maximum compliance, curb corruption, and avoid loss of foreign exchange earnings. The Government should devise other ways of collecting the export taxes than at the points of exit or the designated borders. One recommendation is for the Government to place the Malawi Revenue Authority officials at the sites where the timber is harvested, and make such sites as the collection points. More importantly, the study recommends that Government should conduct civic education campaigns targeted towards <b>timber</b> producers and <b>exporters,</b> highlighting the benefits of the export taxes to avoid illegal trade and corruption. The study has further revealed that it is possible for the Government to increase the stumpage fee to the levels that would be comparable to the stumpage fees in other countries such as Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania...|$|R
40|$|With the U. S. {{housing market}} at a {{seventeen}} year low, {{it is becoming}} increasingly important to find global markets for U. S. forest products. One market that values Alaska forest products and offers tremendous opportunity is Japan. However, due to a previously strong U. S. Dollar, increased competition from Europe, and other factors, Alaska forest products have lost significant market share in Japan. The purpose of this research project was to examine recent trends that affect Japan’s forest products market and present potential opportunities for Alaska forest products. Data was collected from government and industry organizations and industry experts were interviewed. The research identified five major trends affecting Japan’s forest products market: • Changing Building Regulations – The Building Standards Law was revised in 2007 requiring certification of the structural integrity of new residential buildings by qualified architects or structural engineers. This revision was in response to a recent building scandal where some architects falsified structural strength documents required by the Japanese government. As a result, a number of buildings in the Tokyo area were declared unable to withstand a moderate earthquake and condemned. • Changing Timber Supply – Overall, Japan’s lumber and log imports from North America have decreased. In contrast, lumber and log supplies from Europe, Russia, China, and within Japan have increased. However, several recent occurrences are constricting Japan’s timber supply including a Russian log export tariff and increased demand from other regions. Many of the industry experts interviewed pointed out that mills are looking for new suppliers to hedge against disruptions in their traditional timber supply. • Increasing Green Building and Green Procurement Policies – Japan has developed a green building certification program called the Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency (CASBEE). This system consists of various green building criteria. Additionally, the Japanese government has announced a public procurement program that requires all forest products purchased by the government to come from legally harvested timber. • Changing Exchange Rates – The U. S. Dollar has depreciated approximately 6 percent against the Japanese Yen in the past two years. This makes Alaska and other U. S. forest products more price competitive in the Japanese market. • Changing Demographics – Two of the most important demographic segments in Japan are the Baby Boomers and the children of the baby boomers or Eco Baby Boomers. The Baby Boomers are retiring and many are looking to improve their houses. Eco Baby Boomers are having families of their own and many are choosing to purchase value priced houses rather than condominiums or renting apartments. Based on the analysis of Japan’s forest products market, the researchers offered the following recommendations: • Identify Alaska forest products companies interested in exporting to Japan. The first step to promote Alaska forest products in Japan is to identify companies interested in and qualified to export to Japan. These companies need to have the production capacity to do container load volumes and the commitment of management to pursue the Japanese market. Once these companies are identified, a directory should be created in Japanese to distribute to Japanese forest products buyers. These companies should also be encouraged to participate in the Japan Home Show and trade mission described below. • Utilize trade organizations to increase awareness of Alaska forest products. Alaska’s presence in the Japanese market has dwindled and needs to be rebuilt. This can be done at a relatively low cost through utilizing resources that are already in place. There are two organizations that the authors recommend Alaska’s forest products industry utilize in Japan. The first is the Softwood Export Council headquartered in Portland, OR and with a Japan office in Tokyo. The University of Alaska is active with the Softwood Export Council and can assist with making connections. The second is the State of Alaska’s Japan Office located in Tokyo. Both of these organizations participate in forest products events held in Japan. The Alaska forest products industry should work closely with both these organizations. The contact information for these organizations is provided in Appendix A. • Promote WWPA Alaska forest products’ labels in Japan. A coordinated marketing effort should be organized to promote the three WWPA registered labels in Japan: Alaska Hem, Alaska Yellow Cedar, and Alaska Spruce. Each of these should be promoted as a brand with unique attributes. The goal should be to build brand recognition for Alaska species in Japan by promoting these species and their unique attributes. Literature should be developed in Japanese explaining each species, their unique attributes, and the end usage for which they are suitable. It would also be beneficial to include contact information for Alaska forest products companies that can supply each of these species. • Promote the structural values of Alaska lumber in Japan. The revised Building Standards Law requires builders to certify the structural integrity of their buildings by approved architects. In order to do this, architects will need access to the structural values of members used for structural support. Therefore, the results of the in grade testing program conducted by the Ketchikan Wood Technology Center should be translated into Japanese. Japanese architects responsible for certifying building plans will need access to modulus of elasticity and bending strength calculations for Alaska yellow cedar, hemlock, and Sitka spruce. • Target the glulam beam industry. One expected outcome of the revision to the Building Standards Law is an increase in market share for glulam beams. Mr. Miyazawa (Miyazawa 2007), of the Japan Housing Newspaper, emphasized the revision to the Building Standards Law will favor glulam beams over solid sawn lumber because the exact structural values are written on each glulam beam. The opportunity for Alaska forest products manufacturers is to target the glulam beam industry with lamstock. Japan’s glulam beam industry has shown strong growth and there are opportunities for Alaska yellow cedar, hemlock, and Sitka spruce (CINTRAFOR 2008). • Develop a certificate of harvest origin program for Alaska forest products. The Japanese government is starting to require all forest products purchased by government agencies to provide proof that the wood originated from legally harvested timber. This procurement program is still in the initial stages but {{what is clear is that}} some documentation will be required. As of now, the Japanese government is being very flexible with the documentation. At the GOHO Wood (Legal Wood) Conference in Japan, the Japanese official explained that companies can develop their own certificate and attach supporting documents such as <b>timber</b> sale receipts. <b>Exporters</b> should work closely with their Japanese customers and make sure that proper documentation is provided. • Create an Alaska forest products display for the Japan Home Show held annually in November. One of the main conclusions to be drawn from this research is that Japan’s forest products manufacturers are becoming very concerned with the stability of their raw materials supply. Their concern centers on what will happen in the future to Russian and European supply and so Japanese buyers are looking for new suppliers. However, in order for this to benefit Alaska forest products companies, Japanese companies need to be informed of what products exist and how to get them. An excellent venue to meet Japanese buyers and educate them about Alaska forest products is the Japan Home Show. The Japan Home Show is held in November in Tokyo. The Softwood Export Council has a booth each year and allows members to display products. An Alaska forest products display should be designed to display product samples, product literature, and copies of the Alaska Forest Products Directory. • Organize a Japan Trade Mission for Alaska forest products companies. As a follow up to the Japan Home show, a Japan trade mission should be organized for Alaska forest products companies interested in the Japanese market. The primary purpose of this trade mission would be to introduce Alaska forest products companies to potential Japanese buyers. The secondary purpose of the mission would be to educate Alaska forest products companies about the Japanese market and the types of forest products used in the market. This trade mission should include Japanese mill visits, a seminar given by an Alaska representative explaining to potential Japanese buyers about Alaska forest products, and a reception to bring Alaska companies together with potential Japanese buyers. The visit should also include a visit to pre-cut lumber mills, laminators, and post and beam construction sites. This trade mission should be organized in cooperation with the Alaska Department of Trade, the University of Alaska, and the Softwood Export Council. • Invite potential Japanese customers to Alaska for an Alaska mill tour. This would be a way to introduce Alaska mill owners to Japanese forest products buyers. Additionally, it would allow the Japanese forest product buyers to educate Alaska mills about what products the Japanese market demands and their product specification...|$|R
