Bayern Munich limited capacity during their league and cup games to 69,000. The partial roof covers all seats, although winds can still blow rain onto some of them. Prior to the 2012-13 season, Bayern Munich announced that capacity had been increased to 71,000 for domestic matches and 68,000 for UEFA matches, with the addition of 2,000 seats in the upper tier of the arena.|$|E

30|$|Often {{described}} as <b>tiered,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four <b>tiers</b> excluding the OEMs, tier 1 supplies interior compartments, e.g. seats, engines, floors; tier 2 carries out subassembly {{activities such as}} cut and sew and supply parts such as headliners; tier 3 supplies the manufacturing for the upholstery whilst tier 4 supplies the materials (Shishoo 2008). Tiers 1 and 2 companies may be integrated, and ‘cut and sew’ operations may {{be carried out by}} the same company. Fabric laminators supply their services the cut and sew operations (Tier 2). The fabric formation companies may also conduct fabric lamination in-house or out-source. There are many permutations; companies may supply yarn directly to the fabric formation company, foam and scrim directly to a fabric lamination company or only yarn to the fabric formation company and the fabric formation company supplies the scrim to the fabric lamination company. Moreover, the three companies may be integrated (Taylor 2012). An example is the consolidation by tier 1 companies. The OEMs, frustrated by the increasingly longer lead times and operational constraints, only worked with fabric suppliers with cut and sew operations. Tier 1 companies (e.g. Johnson Controls) have bought out fabric companies and become vertically integrated companies with control of upstream and downstream activities making the full range of products from seats, instrument panels, headliners, etc. With 25 % of the market, Johnson Controls vertical integration captures increasing amount of value along the chain but loses flexibility and speed. The independent status of Sage AI is advantageous because it affords flexibility and speed within the system (Taylor 2012).|$|R

3000|$|The first {{iteration}} analyses {{the influence}} of the thrU on the SLA violations and the resource cost. The values of the other configuration parameters (except the thrU) are held constant during the simulation to isolate the relationship between the thrU and the cost factors. In this experiment a multi-tier cloud service is simulated. According to Table 1, the business and the database tiers have the same service demand which is 0.076  s. This value is decided according to the service demand that is used in [14]. Based on the QNM (Queuing Network Model) theory [19, 23 – 26], each of these <b>tiers</b> can handle <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1 / 0.076 ≈ 13 [...] requests per second. Therefore, to fully utilize each of the VMs capacities, the thrU should be set to 13 requests per second.
