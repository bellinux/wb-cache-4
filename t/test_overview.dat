Comparison with experimental results to prove the reliability of {{finite element analysis}}. Then, the paper analyzed different parameters which affect the joints ’ loading capacity, {{the results indicate that}} to a certain extent, the eccentricity of the upper and lower column sections and steel ratio both have important effects on the stiffness and ultimate loading capacity of the joints; with the increment of the ratio of axial compression, the joints ’ ductility will be reduced. Preface Steel Reinforced Concrete (SRC) structure has the advantages of both concrete structure and steel structure. At present, this structure has been more widely used in civil engineering. A large number of SRC joints will be emerged with the development of industrial and civil buildings. For SRC joints, past researches were mostly aimed at the structure of the regular joints [1 - 4], the researches of the SRC abnormal exterior joints which upper and lower column sections changed were quite less [5]. Therefore, ABAQUS was used in this paper to do nonlinear finite element analysis of the abnormal exterior joints consist of Steel Reinforced Concrete column and Reinforced Concrete beam. The paper briefly analyzed some factors which affect the loading capacity of joints, such as the eccentricity of column section, the ratio of steel in the joint’s core, stirrup ratio, the strength of concrete, the ratio of axial compression and so on. <b>Test</b> <b>Overview</b> Table 1 Section size and reinforcement ratio of Joints column beam n the strength of concrete upper column lower column b × h 250 × 240 250 × 280 200 × 70...|$|E

40|$|Implementing new {{technology}} in aerospace propulsion systems is becoming prohibitively expensive. One {{of the major}} contributions to the high cost {{is the need to}} perform many large scale system tests. The traditional design analysis procedure decomposes the engine into isolated components and focuses attention on each single physical discipline (e. g., fluid for structural dynamics). Consequently, the interactions that naturally occur between components and disciplines can be masked by the limited interactions that occur between individuals or teams doing the design and must be uncovered during expensive engine <b>testing.</b> This <b>overview</b> will discuss a cooperative effort of NASA, industry, and universities to integrate disciplines, components, and high performance computing into a Numerical propulsion System Simulator (NPSS) ...|$|R
