5|$|In Shreveport, meanwhile, {{whatever}} positive momentum {{the team}} had gained {{at the end of}} the 1994 season failed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> into 1995. Notable NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver was signed and put up decent numbers; the rest of the team, however, was unable to muster much success and limped to a 5â€“13 record. As elsewhere, the team saw a second season attendance decline. With the season winding down, the city had clearly soured on the Gliebermans. They became embroiled in legal difficulties and, in one particularly absurd incident, Bernie Glieberman had his lawyer attempt (unsuccessfully) to abscond with a half-million dollar Tucker automobile that Glieberman had donated to a local museum.|$|E
5|$|After being {{stripped}} of the victory in previous year's race {{because of an}} underweight car, Audi Sport ABT team principal Hans-Jurgen Abt said his team's objective was to get onto the podium. He acknowledged that getting the victory would not be easy because of the competitiveness of the field. After retiring from the preceding Buenos Aires ePrix, Bird stated that he would enter the Mexico City race with a positive attitude and affirmed his belief in his team and he felt {{there was a possibility}} of getting onto the podium in the event they perform well in qualifying. Mitch Evans reiterated that despite his team Jaguar not scoring points in the season's opening three races, the Buenos Aires race showed that he was becoming more confident and wanted <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> his momentum from the four-month break. He also said he was excited to compete in the Mexico City event.|$|E
5|$|The {{first hint}} of its {{existence}} became public when Square Enix trademarked the name in May 2013. The game was first announced in the second September issue of Famitsu Weekly, and was demoed during TGS 2013. Originally scheduled for release {{in the winter of}} 2013, it was delayed due to development problems concerning environment sizes, which needed to be scaled down. It was rescheduled for the first quarter of 2014, then was pushed forward to spring of that year. Street clothes for the characters were offered as a pre-registration bonus, while a code to download outfits inspired by Kurasame, a supporting character from Type-0, were included in the final volume of the spin-off manga Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade. Pre-registration closed on May 7, 2013. Chapter delivery began the day after the game's official release on May 14, 2014. The base game was a free download, but players had the option of buying items, restore health and speeding up re-spawn time via microtransactions. The original version also reset individual character experience levels {{at the end of a}} playthrough, while an update in 2015 allowed players <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> experience levels between playthroughs.|$|E

5|$|The game indeed {{reversed}} Square's lagging fortunes, and {{it became}} the company's flagship franchise. Following the success, Square immediately developed a second installment. Because Sakaguchi assumed Final Fantasy would be a stand-alone title, its story was not designed to be expanded by a sequel. The developers instead chose <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> only thematic similarities from its predecessor, {{while some of the}} gameplay elements, such as the character advancement system, were overhauled. This approach has continued throughout the series; each major Final Fantasy game features a new setting, a new cast of characters, and an upgraded battle system. Video game writer John Harris attributed the concept of reworking the game system of each installment to Nihon Falcom's Dragon Slayer series, with which Square was previously involved as a publisher. The company regularly released new titles in the main series. However, the time between the releases of Final Fantasy XI (2002), Final Fantasy XII (2006), and Final Fantasy XIII (2009) were much longer than previous titles. Following Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix stated that it intended to release Final Fantasy games either annually or biennially. This switch was to mimic the development cycles of Western games in the Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed and Battlefield series, as well as maintain fan-interest.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{of sleep}} apnea via a {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (CPAP) device has shown dramatic improvement in apnea and nearly complete resolution of RMD symptoms. Behavioral interventions may alleviate some RMD symptoms and movements. In such a therapy, sufferers {{are asked to}} perform RMD-like motions during the day in a slow and methodic manner. In such, patients come short of full rhythmic movements that they experience in sleep. Such behavioral training has been shown <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> into sleep, and the forcefulness of the RMD movements is reduced or eliminated.

25|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in August 2013, and the development team wanted <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> elements from the original Dungeon Keeper games by Bullfrog Productions, especially the humour. Richard Ridings provided the voiceovers, {{as he did with}} the previous instalments. The game is noted for its monetization of gameplay by relying on in-app purchases, for which it received widespread criticism. The reliance on in-app purchases also caused outcry in the gaming public. In the UK, Electronic Arts' advertising of the game was ruled to have misled customers, which forced them to amend their adverts. Electronic Arts also faced criticism over filtration of user reviews.|$|E
25|$|Cambodge took French {{troops from}} Algeria to France after the Algerian War, was a {{hospital}} {{ship in the}} Vietnam War, and with the ever-increasing popularity of air travel, she withdrew from regular passenger service and began to run cruises from Australian ports to destinations in the Indian Ocean. In 1968, Messageries Maritimes renamed Viet Nam as Pacifique, and in 1970 the company put all three ships up for sale. Cambodges sister ships were bought by Compania Navegacion Abeto to carry Muslim pilgrims, and remodelled <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> 1,600 passengers. Both were destroyed by fire in the mid-1970s. Cambodge, however, was bought by Sun Lines, a Greek cruise line, for conversion into a cruise ship.|$|E

25|$|In Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read {{either on}} Shemini Atzeret (by Yemenites, Italians, some Sepharadim, and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) {{or on the}} Shabbat of the Intermediate Days of Sukkot (by Ashkenazim). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of Sukkot, even the Ashkenazim read it on Shemini Atzeret (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first Shabbat of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a {{reminder}} to not get too {{caught up in the}} festivities of the holiday, as well as <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> the happiness of Sukkot {{to the rest of the}} year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless.

25|$|In 2000, Belfast was {{announced}} as the {{location for the}} first Worlds to be held outside the Republic of Ireland. At the time, some competitors expressed fears for their safety in the new location, but Belfast authorities were keen to ensure the event's success to improve the city's reputation as a tourist destination. The 2001 Championships, planned {{to be held in}} Ennis, were cancelled due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain, from where nearly 35% of that year's competitors were expected to travel. The first Worlds to be cancelled caused excessive demand for the North American National Championships, traditionally held at the end of July. Furthermore, as a result of qualifiers for the 2001 event being allowed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> their qualification status to 2002, the next year in Glasgow saw a one-third increase on the usual number of competitors.|$|E

25|$|In late 2007, CAFE {{standards}} {{received their}} first overhaul {{in more than}} 30 years through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), and were set to rise to 35 mpg by the year 2020. However, in May 2009 the Obama Administration announced a new harmonized national policy that will require an average fuel economy standard of 35.5 mpg in 2016. The flex-fuel CAFE credits are scheduled to end in 2016, but because the 2007 EISA made CAFE credits exchangeable between different classes of automobiles and tradable between companies, and also carmakers are allowed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> credits {{for up to five}} years, the flex-fuel credits accumulated up to 2016 can be carried over and traded until 2020. The CAFE standards proposed in 2011 for the period 2017-2025 will allow flexible-fuel vehicles to receive extra credit but only when the carmakers present data proving how much E85 such vehicles have actually consumed.|$|E
25|$|Some hunt proponents {{argue that}} {{large numbers of}} wolves are central to the spread of {{numerous}} infectious diseases because of their nomadic nature. Diseases recorded to be carried by wolves include rabies, brucella, deerfly fever, listeriosis, foot and mouth disease and anthrax. Wolves are major hosts for rabies in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and India. Wolves in Russia have been recorded <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> 50 different kinds of harmful parasites. A 10-year study in the former Soviet Union showed that in some regions, every successful wolf litter in spring coincided with a 100% increase in cestode infections in moose and wild boar, with some specimen having up to 30-40 cysts. It also showed that where wolves were absent, the number of cysticerosis infected wild ungulates was much less. Despite their habit of carrying harmful diseases, large wolf populations are not negatively influenced by epizootic outbreaks as with other canids, and thus some hunting proponents argue that disease cannot be a guarantee of naturally controlling wolf numbers.|$|E
25|$|Nationals {{pitchers}} grabbed much of {{the attention}} as the season came to an end. On October 1, rookie starting pitcher A. J.

The same day, starter Tanner Roark posted his career-best 16th win of the regular season, defeating Wei-Yin Chen and the Marlins 2â€“1. On October 2, {{the last day of}} the regular season, staff ace Max Scherzer earned his 20th win, although he gave up five runs in a seesaw 10â€“7 victory over the Marlins; he also notched four runs batted in during the game, going 2-for-2, for the first time in his career. Closer Mark Melancon finished his year with 47 saves, the second-highest season total of his career. Catching prospect Spencer Kieboom, meanwhile, made his major league debut on October 2, drawing a walk from Marlins reliever Brian Ellington as a pinch-hitter and then coming around to score later in the inning.|$|E
