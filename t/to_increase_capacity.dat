5|$|In 1949, the Board of Transportation {{issued a}} $504,000,000 plan <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> on several subway lines through the {{construction}} of a new trunk line under Second Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The line {{is due to}} be {{electrified}} {{as part of the}} 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line, {{which will}} also see the addition of two new running lines <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity.</b> Service frequency will be improved as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{track and}} {{signalling}} systems are being upgraded, {{and the old}} six-car C Stock trains {{have been replaced by}} new seven-car S Stock trains in a programme <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> by 65 per cent by 2019.|$|E
5000|$|From 1995 to 2002, PET {{business}} has grown after {{engaging in the}} downstream production of PET preforms, bottles and closures through {{a joint venture with}} Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> <b>capacities</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The Highways Agency {{has plans}} <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>capacity</b> from Junctions 3 to 10 near Kettering 'in the longer term' {{and also to}} widen the road {{throughout}} Northamptonshire to [...] "help {{cut the number of}} accidents and cope with the likely growth in traffic".|$|R
50|$|In 1934, Ajax {{relocated}} {{to a new}} stadium De Meer Stadion, playing <b>to</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>capacity</b> of 22,000. The stadium was designed and funded by Architect and Ajax Commissioner Jordanus Roodenburgh, who had designed and completed the first stadium for Ajax as well. Ajax also played their International fixtures at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam <b>to</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>capacity</b> of 64,000.|$|R
5|$|WMATA expects {{an average}} of one million riders daily by 2030. The need <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> has renewed plans to add 220 cars to the system and reroute trains to {{alleviate}} congestion at the busiest stations. Population growth in the region has also revived efforts to extend service, build new stations, and construct additional lines.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, in {{the lead}} up to Manchester hosting the Commonwealth Games, a {{requirement}} <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> on for the event led to Metrolink investigating the purchase of redundant second-hand USSLRV vehicles from the Muni Metro system in San Francisco. To this end, two were procured for testing and shipped to the UK, with one taken to Metrolink's Queen's Road depot. In the end, the proposal was not taken forward as the vehicles {{were found to be}} unsuitable for use in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} was upgraded in 1998 <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> both <b>capacity</b> and performance.|$|R
50|$|In transport, {{as in any}} network, {{managing}} demand can be {{a cost-effective}} alternative <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>capacity.</b> A demand management approach to transport also {{has the potential to}} deliver better environmental outcomes, improved public health, stronger communities, and more prosperous cities. TDM techniques link with and support community movements for sustainable transport.|$|R
50|$|Variations on {{traditional}} shelf files, designed <b>to</b> offer <b>increased</b> <b>capacity</b> {{for a given}} floor area, include Rotary Storage systems.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, Network Rail {{announced}} that platforms 20–24 would be fully refurbished in order <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> at Waterloo by 30%. Communications manager Kevin Parker {{stressed that the}} international platforms were only designed to cope with six trains per hour, well below the expected capacity for commuter services. The platforms closed in September 2017 for the works, with a revised timetable to be published the following year.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the stadium is the head office of many sports federations, a bandy field, and commercial property including a conference center, hotel and shopping mall. The stadium is located adjacent to Ullevål Stadion Station of the Oslo Metro and the Ring 3 motorway. Plans call to replace the West Stand <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> to 30,000 and perhaps add a retractable roof and artificial turf.|$|E
5|$|Its {{construction}} {{was linked to}} that of Hunterston A nuclear power station, to store surplus night-time nuclear generated electrical energy. The power station was originally operated by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, before being transferred to the South of Scotland Electricity Board. It has been owned by Scottish Power since the privatisation of Britain's electricity industry in 1990, and they are looking <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> to 1,040 MW.|$|E
50|$|This stadium was re-built <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> its <b>capacity</b> from 12,000 {{people up}} to 30,000.|$|R

5|$|Later in 2007, BA {{announced}} their order of thirty-six new long-haul aircraft, including twelve Airbus A380s and twenty-four Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Rolls-Royce Trent engines were again selected for both orders with Trent 900s powering the A380s and Trent 1000s powering the 787s. The Boeing 787s will replace 14 of British Airways' Boeing 767 fleet, while the Airbus A380s will replace 20 of BA's Boeing 747-400s and {{will most likely}} be used <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> on key routes from London Heathrow.|$|E
5|$|Since the redevelopments to Celtic Park and Hampden Park were {{completed}} in the late 1990s, Ibrox has had the smallest capacity {{of the three major}} stadiums in Glasgow. Rangers have since explored options <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity.</b> After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006, chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be replicated in the Copland Stand. A report in the Daily Record in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> to 57,000, principally by removing the JumboTron screens and lowering the pitch to accommodate more seating. These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by the team. In January 2008, Rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop Ibrox. One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70,000, by replacing three of the stands with a bowl-type structure. These plans were shelved by October 2008, however, due to the late-2000s financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|The line {{is due to}} be {{electrified}} {{as part of the}} 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line, {{which will}} also see the addition of two new running lines <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity,</b> although no platforms will be built for these lines. Service frequency will however be improved as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} redevelopment <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> its <b>capacity</b> {{and expand}} services {{was completed in}} 2010.|$|R

5|$|Concourse D was {{constructed}} as a ground level commuter terminal for American Eagle with 15 ground level commuter aircraft parking spots and gate facilities. All American Eagle flights operated out of Concourse D until, as a cost-cutting measure after 9/11, all American Eagle flights {{were moved to}} Concourse C to share gates with American Airlines. For {{a short period of}} time, Concourse D was used by Corporate Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became a regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection, at which point the concourse was closed by the MNAA. Currently, plans exist to expand Concourse D with additional gates <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> and attract new airlines, as well as provide new retail and dining offerings.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{existing}} double track {{all the way}} from Oslo to Moss, a further upgrade southwards will not be able <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> past the current single train per hour to Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg and Halden. The most optimistic plans involve finishing the first upgrades of track south of Moss simultaneously with the Follo Line. The Rail Administration and Ministry of Transport is working on proposals for a high-speed railway between Oslo and Gothenburg in Sweden. This line would most likely use the Follo Line for the initial distance from Oslo.|$|E
5|$|Lerkendal opened as a {{multi-purpose}} stadium on 10 August 1947, as {{the main}} football and athletics stadium in Trondheim. Originally the venue was mostly used by the football teams SK Freidig and FK Kvik, and Rosenborg did not became a tenant until 1957. A new grandstand with roof was completed in 1962, and floodlights were installed in 1968. The oldest of the current stands were built in 1996, along with new lighting. Three more grandstands were built between 2000 and 2002, which also saw {{the removal of the}} athletics facilities and the sale of the stadium from Trondheim Municipality to Rosenborg. Further expansions plans have been launched, <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> by filling in the corners and possibly by building a retractable roof.|$|E

5|$|On April 12, 2012, the Steelers {{confirmed}} {{they would}} seek {{approval from the}} NFL to expand seating by 3,000. On May 19, 2014, {{after more than two}} years, the Steelers and the SEA came to an agreement to add about 3,000 seats to the venue. After contractors surveyed the complex the final number of 2,390 added seats with five additional suites including more parking, restrooms and concessions was determined in December 2014 <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> to a total of 67,890. The seating was put in place by the summer of 2015.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Park is {{the largest}} Association {{football}} stadium in Northern Ireland, with Glentoran's ground, the Oval, being the next largest. The governing body of Northern Irish football, the Irish Football Association, leases the ground {{for use by the}} Northern Ireland national football team. The club currently receives 15% of Northern Ireland international gate receipts as rent. This is controversial as rival Irish League clubs see this as giving Linfield an unfair advantage by allowing them to offer more attractive wages and have a larger squad than all of the other clubs. In 2010, UEFA provided €500,000 towards substantial refurbishment of the stadium, <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity</b> and improve safety.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo {{allocated}} $22 million to renew {{planning and design}} efforts for the Second Avenue line, but in 1993 the MTA, facing budget cuts, removed these funds from its capital budget. In 1995, the MTA began its Manhattan East Side Alternatives (MESA) study, both a MIS and a DEIS, seeking ways to alleviate overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue Line and improve mobility on Manhattan's East Side. The study analyzed several alternatives, such as improvements to the Lexington Avenue Line <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>capacity,</b> enhanced bus service with dedicated lanes, and light rail or ferry service on the East Side. Second Avenue was chosen over First Avenue for logistical reasons. In November 1997, the MTA initiated the Lower Manhattan Access Study (LMA) to improve access to Lower Manhattan from the New York City suburbs. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway from 63rd Street to Lower Manhattan {{was one of the}} five build alternatives developed by the study.|$|E
