Every Sunday he would go out to the nearby Ballenberg mountain until a heavy crash destroyed his glider in the fall of 1932. In 1935, after Adolf Hitler officially revoked the Treaty of Versailles, Graf applied for flight training in the newly created Luftwaffe.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{documentation}} {{that allows}} us to reconstruct a genealogy of artists after Gasparo, from his son Simone onwards. Though little information is available about Simone, it appears that no works are attributed directly to him; rather, he appears to have worked as a builder when outside his father's workshop. In a bill dated 1534, Simone declares his age as 38, born in 1496, and around twenty years of age on his father's death. He also cites his firstborn son Gasparo, <b>twelve</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> in turn a sculptor, his wife Catlina, sister of the engraver Andrea Testi of Manerbio. A daughter of Gasparo, Giulia, became the wife of an artisan potter, while a third child, Giovanni Antonio, was a qualified goldsmith, as indicated in a deed relating Stefano Lamberti and Bernardino delle Croci.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the series, events {{converge}} with accepted history, when King Richard IV and {{his entire}} family are poisoned, allowing Henry Tudor to take the throne as King Henry VII. He then rewrites history, presenting Richard III as a monster, and eliminating Richard IV's reign from the history books. In reality, Richard, Duke of York, one of the Princes in the Tower, was only <b>twelve</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> (and perhaps two years dead) when the Battle of Bosworth Field took place in 1485, and thus too young to have had two adult sons. One notable anachronism is Edmund´s title, Duke of Edinburgh, as Scotland was an independent kingdom ruled by a different royal house from its inception in the ninth century until 1603 (with the exception of some periods during the turmoil of the Scottish Wars of Independence) though given that this is an alternate history, it is possible that Henry Tudor falsified the history of Scotland as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, when Roddenberry was <b>twelve</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> {{the family}} moved to 4906 Monte Vista in the shadow of Mount Washington, and he began {{attending}} Luther Burbank Junior High School. This was the house that Roddenberry would later describe as his childhood home. His father helped the boys obtain local jobs; Gene worked as a newspaper delivery boy and as a gas station attendant on Saturdays, and after school. The young Roddenberry moved to Franklin High School during the middle years of the Great Depression. His father was relatively unaffected by the Great Depression because of his stable employment with the police department. The family distributed food to friends and family who were in need. Glen's parents and her younger sister Willodean moved into the house for a time before finding other accommodation in Redondo Beach. During his time at Franklin, Roddenberry joined the Varsity Debate Team and {{was a member of the}} Authors Club under Mrs. Virginia Church. He graduated in 1939.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin Coolidge Jr. {{was born}} in Plymouth Notch, Windsor County, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, the only U.S. {{president}} to be born on Independence Day. He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge Sr. (1845–1926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846–85). Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations, and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper and public servant. He held various local offices, including {{justice of the peace}} and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate. Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer. She was chronically ill and died, perhaps from tuberculosis, when Coolidge was <b>twelve</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875–1890), {{died at the age of}} fifteen, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of eighty.|$|E

After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career.

5|$|More than {{a century}} before {{the events of the}} series begin, Fire Lord Sozin, ruler of the Fire Nation, planned a world war to expand his nation's {{territory}} and influence. He was prevented from carrying out his plans by Avatar Roku, who was born in the Fire Nation. After Roku's death, the Avatar was reincarnated as an Airbender named Aang. As Aang was then only a child, Sozin saw his chance and proceeded with his militant plans. Because of the threat of Sozin's war, Aang learned about his avatar status when he was only <b>twelve</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Afraid of his new responsibilities and of separation from his mentor, Gyatso, he fled his home on his flying bison named Appa. Forced into the ocean by a storm, Aang entered the avatar state and encased them in suspended animation in an iceberg for one hundred years. Sozin, knowing that the avatar's reincarnation cycle mandated that an air nomad was the new avatar, carried out a genocide against the Air Nomads during the passing of a once-a-century comet which increases the Firebenders' power, and continues his world conquest.|$|E
