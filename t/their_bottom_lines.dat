This thesis examined whether multidimensional sustainability performance {{could be one}} of those drivers in the pharmaceutical industry. There are currently very few (if any) mandatory requirements for integrating multidimensional sustainability. Nor are there standardized methods of integrating, measuring, or communicating multidimensional sustainability. This thesis reviewed, compared, and contrasted (also known as benchmarking) voluntary sustainability initiatives and pharmaceutical company sustainability initiatives. The results were as follows: 1) the concept of multidimensional sustainability is generally understood; 2) integrating multidimensional sustainability is the morally and ethically correct action for pharmaceutical companies to take; 3) research is insufficient to support the relationship between integrating sustainability and driving business value in the pharmaceutical industry; and 4) pharmaceutical companies taking action to integrate multidimensional sustainability are reaping significant business value added. This thesis also discusses the reasons for and methods of measuring and reporting multidimensional sustainability performance, the elements required for successful integration of multidimensional sustainability in the pharmaceutical industry, and the steps necessary to integrate multidimensional sustainability throughout a pharmaceutical company...|$|E

40|$|The bottom line: it {{reflects}} a company’s profitability or lack thereof, the profit {{that a particular}} company has made after all expenses and taxes have been paid. In an economic environment increasingly filled with global business competitors employing relatively cheap labor and inexpensive materials, many companies, including those in the United States, have had to think of creative ways to cut expenses {{in order to keep}} <b>their</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> from shrinking. In this type of high pressure environment, where products often have limited pricing power, the primary focus is on improving productivity, and employee health remains a secondary concern, something to be dealt with as the need arises, not something in which to invest one’s hard-earned capital. From a purely economic standpoint, we believe that treating employee health in this manner is a mistake. While workplace injury rates appear 1 to have declined substantially since the Bureau of Labor Statistics first began reporting such data in the 1970 s, with 4 years of consecutive declines between 2003 and 2006 [1], the physical environment is not the only contributor to employee ill health.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} current {{activities}} of U. S. Fortune 500 companies {{with respect to}} global biodiversity protection and {{the goals of the}} Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD). Data and information collected from five hundred companies within eight major industrial sectors was further categorized at the company level to assess each company’s involvement in global biodiversity protection. Our findings show that although companies’ business profiles highly influence their decision-making process regarding the adoption of biodiversity protection policies and measures, their revenue profiles are less influential. We show that despite generating low revenues, companies in the utility sector are more active in the adoption of biodiversity protection policy than are those in the financial sector, which generates high revenues. This study also demonstrates that companies must be convinced of the major effects of biodiversity loss on <b>their</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> to be motivated to protect biological diversity. Companies’ business and business related risk profiles can also influence the adoption of biodiversity protection policies within the company. The study further demonstrates that a measurable biodiversity impact indicator is necessary for the companies to get seriously involved in the mitigation action. Finally this study proposes a three step biodiversity loss mitigation action framework which is drawn upon the assessment of the 500 companies which can contribute to develop an elaborative framework of business sector specific mitigation plan. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of logistics {{has offered a}} wide range of new business opportunities for transport operators. Shipping lines have been taking advantage of these opportunities and have expanded their business scope beyond the movement of cargo, to include, for example, coordination among transport modes, route rationalisation and even value added logistics services. Carriers offer today transportation as part of integrated global supply chain solutions in an attempt to provide a better service to their customers as well as improve <b>their</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>lines.</b> This appears to be a winning strategy since an increasing number of industry players are investing in logistics operations and infrastructure. The offering of products and services jointly as a package or bundle is a common marketing strategy in a variety of industries and also appears to be a successful strategy for enhancing shipping lines’ competitiveness and profitability. Only limited research is available though to better understand under what conditions such bundled sales are possible; what attitude shippers show towards this industry trend; how bundling strategies could be developed optimally; and how they could be priced. This thesis is a contribution to research in this area and provides an analysis of the viability and the benefits of bundling strategies in the container industry, and specifically with reference to the joint provision of ocean transportation and other logistics services...|$|E
