5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting {{a cause of}} action resulting in failure {{to return to the}} hive. In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested <b>that</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects more susceptible to attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
5|$|Health effects {{extended}} to residents, students, and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown. Several deaths {{have been linked}} to the toxic dust, and the victims' names were included in the World Trade Center memorial. Approximately 18,000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses {{as a result of the}} toxic dust. There is also scientific speculation <b>that</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development. A notable children's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse, and were living or working nearby. A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions, and that 30–40% were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{considerable}} amount of evidence <b>that</b> incidental <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> marketing communications can influence consumer behavior. Janiszewski (1988, 1990, 1993) finds <b>that</b> incidental <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> advertisements can influence liking for an advertisement and for the brand names and product packages included in the advertisement (see also Anand, Holbrook, and Stephens 1988). Hawkins and Hoch (1992) demonstrate <b>that</b> incidental <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> consumer trivia encourages consumers to believe that these statements are true when they are encountered at a later time. Shapiro (1999) shows <b>that</b> incidental <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> an advertisement increases the likelihood that the product will subsequently be judged acceptable for inclusion in a consideration set. Although judgments about preference, truth, and acceptability would seem to involve significantly different processes, recent theories of mere <b>exposure</b> have proposed <b>that</b> all of these biases are the result of a common misattribution process. The processing fluency/attribution model proposes <b>that</b> prior <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> a stimulus makes the stimulus easier to perceive, encode, and process when it is encountered a...|$|R

5|$|In China and Tibet, mercury use {{was thought}} to prolong life, heal fractures, and {{maintain}} generally good health, although it is now known <b>that</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> mercury vapor leads to serious adverse health effects. The first emperor of China, Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì—allegedly buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury on {{a model of the}} land he ruled, representative of the rivers of China—was killed by drinking a mercury and powdered jade mixture formulated by Qin alchemists (causing liver failure, mercury poisoning, and brain death) who intended to give him eternal life. Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun, the second Tulunid ruler of Egypt (r. 884–896), known for his extravagance and profligacy, reportedly built a basin filled with mercury, on which he would lie on top of air-filled cushions and be rocked to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have {{double- or}} multiple-layering of cones {{on the inner}} surface of the eggshell, a pathological condition known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, which represents {{the end of the}} Mesozoic Era. This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the pathological multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may {{have played a role in}} the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like eggs from Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes <b>that</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated <b>that</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E
