500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at one time, {{the other at}} another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that {{it makes no sense}} to simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E
2500|$|In an August 27, 2006, {{appearance}} on Meet the Press, Novak {{was asked if}} indeed Armitage was his source of Mrs. Wilson's identity as a CIA operative. Novak responded: [...] "I told Mr. Isikoff... that I do not identify my sources on any subject if they're on a confidential basis until they identify themselves... I'm going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> though, I haven't said before. And that is that I believe {{that the time has}} way passed for my source to identify himself." ...|$|E

I am proud that Israel is among the most open countries in the world in relation to the LGBT community discourse." [...] During an event held for the annual community rights day at the Knesset, Netanyahu proclaimed that he was [...] "asked to come here in the middle of my busy schedule <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to the male and female members of the LGBT community: We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not quite. I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> {{and then}} there shall be an end of it," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. [...] "You won't care {{to stay at home}} now, perhaps?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Mabel Fierz, {{who later}} became Blair's confidante, said: [...] "He used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he wished in this world was that he'd been {{attractive}} to women. He liked women and had many girlfriends I think in Burma. He had a girl in Southwold and another girl in London. He was rather a womaniser, yet he was afraid he wasn't attractive." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 20 January 2013, Mehdi Rahmati {{announced}} his temporary retirement {{from the national}} team, he stated in an interview [...] "Maybe I cannot be {{at the service of}} Team Melli, so I temporarily announce my resignation." [...] He added, [...] "Due to some problems, I prefer not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything for the time being, but I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that I am not at the service of Team Melli for a while." ...|$|R

6000|$|They {{shook hands}} with {{lingering}} regret, as if unwilling to resign their relationship. 'You will explain this to Arthur, and give him my thanks for his friendliness; and you--accept my very best thanks for your great kindness and sympathy. If she had known you earlier--But good-bye. Only, if I might venture <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more--you and Arthur will not give me up as a friend, will you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. And you {{lie down}} on the sofa there, Julius, and sleep--Rose would say you must. Only I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more, please. If I do get to Oxford, and you are so good, I've made up my mind to one thing. It's not only for the {{learning}} that I'll go; but I'll try to be a soldier in your army and Bowater's. That's all that seems to me worth the doing now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Abrams, Kurtzman, and Orci {{said that}} {{selecting}} a villain was difficult; according to Abrams, [...] "the universe Roddenberry created is so vast that it's hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> particular <b>thing</b> stands out". They also discussed {{the possibility of}} Khan Noonien Singh and Klingons. Kurtzman and Lindelof said they had [...] "broken" [...] the story (created an outline); instead of a sequel, {{it will be a}} stand-alone film. Abrams admitted in December 2010 that there was still no script.|$|R
6000|$|... "You did," [...] she answered, looking {{me in the}} eyes. [...] "Now {{before we}} go I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> more <b>thing.</b> Harût and the head priestess have made me a present. They have given me a box full of that herb they called tobacco, but of which I have {{discovered}} the real name is Taduki. It is the same that they burned in the bowl when you and I saw visions at Ragnall Castle, which visions, Mr. Quatermain, by another of your coincidences, have since been translated into facts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am comforted, Sylvia, {{rest assured}} of that. And {{now there is}} little more <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. I shall not see your husband yet, and leave you {{to tell him what}} seems best, for, with the {{instinct}} of an animal, I always go away to outlive my hurts alone. But remember that I acquit you of blame, and believe that I will yet be happy in your happiness. I know if Geoffrey were here, he would let me do this, because he has suffered as I suffer now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I'd {{asked her}} to write to me, though," [...] he thought. [...] "And yet even that might disturb her a bit, perhaps. She wants to be quite quiet in her old way for a while. And I've no right to be {{impatient}} and interrupting her with my wishes. She's told me what her mind is, and she's not a woman <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and mean another. I'll wait patiently." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more, while I've {{got it in}} my head,' said Alfred. 'Mr. Cope {{said all}} this {{sickness}} was a cross to me, and I'd got to take it up for our Saviour's sake. Well, and then mayn't yours be being plagued and bullied, without any friends? I'm sure something like it happened to our Lord; and He never said one word against them. Isn't {{that the way you}} may be to follow Him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Jeff added, [...] "I haven't got {{anything}} to say against it. Mr. Westover, I've always wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to you. Then I came to your room that night, I wanted to complain of Mrs. Vostrand for not letting me know about the engagement; and I wasn't man enough to acknowledge that what you said would account for their letting me {{make a fool of}} myself. But I believe I am now, and I want to say it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the score's {{programme}} note, Lutosławski {{wrote that}} the prospect of work with the Heinz and Ursula Holliger was [...] "a great inspiration" [...] while working on the concerto. He added, [...] "The music is multi-faceted and just when it seems <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> it is <b>saying</b> something else {{at the same time}} - sometimes in contradiction. The titles of the movements ... are only to be taken figuratively." [...] The work is scored for solo oboe and harp and a reduced orchestra consisting of only two percussionists and strings. It has a duration of approximately 20 minutes and is cast in three movements: ...|$|R
6000|$|Parsons' {{apprenticeship}} was over; he {{had reached}} the status of an Improver, and he dressed {{the window of the}} Manchester department. By all the standards available he dressed it very well. By his own standards he dressed it wonderfully. [...] "Well, O' Man," [...] he used <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about my position here,--I can dress a window." ...|$|R
60|$|If I {{were asked}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{impressed}} {{me as the}} dominant and characteristic note of San Francisco, I should say it was this untiring presence of sun and wind and sea. They typified, {{even if they were}} not, as I sometimes fancied, the actual incentive to the fierce, restless life of the city. I could not think of San Francisco without the trade winds; I could not imagine its strange, incongruous, multigenerous procession marching to any other music. They were always there in my youthful recollections; they were there in my more youthful dreams of the past as the mysterious vientes generales that blew the Philippine galleons home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{regret the}} work," [...] said the Secretary, [...] "so {{long as we}} carry the riding. You see," [...] he added in {{explanation}} to me, [...] "we're up against a pretty hard proposition here. This riding really is Liberal: they've got the majority of voters though we HAVE once or twice swung it Conservative. But whether we can carry it with a man like Grouch is hard <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> is certain, boys, if he DOES carry it, he doesn't owe it to himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My children, {{never forget}} this. You are not pale-faces, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and do another. What you say, you do. When {{you make a}} law, you keep it. That is right. No red-man wants another's wigwam. If he wants a wigwam, he builds one himself. It is not so with the pale-faces. The man who has no wigwam tries to get away his neighbor's. While he does this, he reads in his Bible and goes to his church. I have {{sometimes}} thought, the more he reads and prays, the more {{he tries to get}} into his neighbor's wigwam. So it seems to an Indian, {{but it may not be}} so.|$|E
6000|$|... "We wish," [...] said Michael, [...] "to {{give all}} {{reasonable}} facilities to the prosecution; {{especially as it}} will save {{the time of the}} whole court. The latter object I shall once again pursue by passing over all those points of theory which are so dear to Dr. Pym. I know how they are made. Perjury is a variety of aphasia, leading a man <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> instead of another. Forgery is a kind of writer's cramp, forcing a man to write his uncle's name instead of his own. Piracy on the high seas is probably a form of sea-sickness. But it is unnecessary for us to inquire into the causes of a fact which we deny. Innocent Smith never did commit burglary at all.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brumley managed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just <b>one</b> other <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> Lady Harman {{before the}} lunch was over. It struck {{her for a}} moment as being irrelevant. [...] "The gardens at Hampton Court," [...] he said, [...] "are {{delightful}} just now. Have you seen them? Autumnal fires. All the September perennials lifting their spears in their last great chorus. It's the Götterdämmerung of the year." ...|$|R
2500|$|Roger Troutman {{developed}} [...] "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] {{around the}} theme of romantic commitment. [...] "Guys have trouble committing and women want us to commit," [...] he explained to authors Adam White and Fred Bronson. [...] "Women want us to admit that we don't want to commit." [...] Troutman took the idea and began working on a track similar in style to [...] "Computer Love," [...] a 1986 hit for his band Zapp. [...] "I was playing in Dallas and [...] flew out. We sat {{in the hotel room}} one day and wrote the song. I talked to him about what I was trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> led <b>to</b> another. We came back and recorded a vocal." ...|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{likened the}} album to {{the works of}} The Libertines, Babyshambles and Arctic Monkeys, all bands known for their British rock roots. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "they sound like songs by about 15 other Britpop acts" [...] but went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "it's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> copy a look, a sound, or a formula, it's another to do it so utterly convincingly and with such {{infectious}} raucousness".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should never}} dream of {{attempting}} such a thing, Miss Starbrow. But {{it would be}} useless to say much more; whatever line I take to-night only makes matters worse for me. But allow me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> before bidding you good-night. The annoyance you feel at the present moment will not last. You have too much generosity, too much intellect, {{to allow it to}} rest long in your bosom; and deeply as I feel this rebuff, I am not going to be so weak as to let it darken and spoil my whole life. No, my hope is too strong and too reasonable to be killed so easily. I shall come to you again, and again, and again. For I know that with you for a wife and companion my life would be a happy one; and not happy only, for that is not everything. An ambitious man looks to other greater and perhaps better things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You do me proud, Captain. But, dear, I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{and then}} I'm done; for you don't need much advice of mine after my good man has spoken. I {{read somewhere that}} every inch of rope used in the British Navy has a strand of red in it, so that {{wherever}} a bit of it is found it is known. That is the text of my little sermon to you. Virtue, which means honour, honesty, courage, and all that makes character, is the red thread that marks a good man wherever he is. Keep that always and everywhere, so that even if wrecked by misfortune, that sign shall still be found and recognized. Yours is a rough life, and your mates not all we could wish, but {{you can be a}} gentleman in the true sense of the word; and no matter what happens to your body, keep your soul clean, your heart true to those who love you, and do your duty to the end.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Leonard made a step forward, and his clear steady tone did not shake for {{a moment}} as he spoke. 'No. I see that {{appearances}} are so much against me, that man can hardly decide otherwise. I have known from the first that nothing could show my innocence but the finding of the receipt. In the absence of that one testimony, I feel that I have had a fair trial, and that all has been done for me that could be done; and I thank you for it, my Lord, and you, Gentlemen,' as he bent his head; then added, 'I should like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more. My Lord, you would not let the question be asked, how I brought all this upon myself. I wish to say it myself, for it is that which makes my sentence just in the sight of God. It is true that, though I never lifted my hand against my poor uncle, I did in a moment of passion fling a stone at my brother, which, but for God's mercy, might indeed have made me a murderer. It was for this, and other like outbreaks, that I was sent to the mill; and it may be just that for it I should die--though indeed I never hurt my uncle.' ...|$|E
5000|$|When Wouk was 13, his {{maternal}} grandfather, Mendel Leib Levine, {{came from}} Minsk {{to live with}} them and took charge of his grandson's Jewish education. Wouk was frustrated by the amount of time he was expected to study the Talmud, but his father told him that [...] "if I were on my deathbed, and I had breath <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> more <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> you, I would say 'Study the Talmud.'" [...] Eventually Wouk took this advice to heart. After a brief period as a young adult during which he lived a secular life, he returned to religious practice. Judaism would become integral to both his personal life and his career. He would later say that his grandfather and the United States Navy were the two most important influences on his life.|$|R
2500|$|Brands {{observes that}} Jackson's {{reputation}} declined after the mid-20th century as his actions towards Indians and African Americans received new attention. After the Civil Rights movement, Brand writes, [...] "his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked {{him as one}} to be censured rather than praised." [...] Further, [...] "By {{the turn of the}} present [...] century, it was scarcely an exaggeration <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> American schoolchildren learned about Jackson was that he was the author of the Trail of Tears." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pomona," [...] said I, [...] "we may yet visit {{many foreign}} countries. We may see kings, queens, dukes, counts, sheikhs, beys, sultans, khedives, pashas, rajahs, and I don't know what potentates besides, and I wish <b>to</b> <b>say</b> just this <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> you. If you don't {{want to get}} {{yourself}} and us into some dreadful scrape, and perhaps bring our journeys to a sudden close, you must put a curb on your longing for communing with beings of noble blood." ...|$|R
