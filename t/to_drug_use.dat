American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant, in English Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide. The Government of Canada has also influenced culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created Crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content.|$|E

No adverse symptoms were found. These findings demonstrate the long-term effect of prasterone on drug relapse.|$|E
25|$|Although {{security}} failures at {{the club}} {{were one of the}} contributing factors to the club eventually closing, the most likely cause was finances. The club simply did not make enough money from the sale of alcohol, and this was mainly because many patrons instead turned <b>to</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> As a result, the club rarely broke even as alcohol sales are the main source of income of nightclubs. Ultimately, the club's long-term future was crippled and, with spiralling debts, the Haçienda eventually closed definitively in the summer of 1997. Peter Hook stated in 2009 that the Haçienda lost up to £18 million in its latter years.|$|E

25|$|Both {{voluntary}} and compulsory {{drug treatment programs}} are provided in China, although the compulsory treatment is more common. Most addicts who attend these centers do so involuntarily upon orders from the Government. Voluntary treatment is provided at centers operated by Public Health Bureaus, but these programs are more expensive and many people cannot afford to attend them. Addicts, who return <b>to</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> after having received treatment, and who cannot be cured by other means, may be sentenced to rehabilitation at {{any one of the}} special centers for re-education through labor.

25|$|An {{influential}} cognitive-behavioral {{approach to}} addiction recovery and therapy has been Alan Marlatt's (1985) Relapse Prevention approach. Marlatt describes four psychosocial processes {{relevant to the}} addiction and relapse processes: self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, attributions of causality, and decision-making processes. Self-efficacy refers to one's ability to deal competently and effectively with high-risk, relapse-provoking situations. Outcome expectancies refer to an individual's expectations about the psychoactive effects of an addictive substance. Attributions of causality refer to an individual's pattern of beliefs that relapse <b>to</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> {{is a result of}} internal, or rather external, transient causes (e.g., allowing oneself to make exceptions when faced with what are judged to be unusual circumstances). Finally, decision-making processes are implicated in the relapse process as well. Substance use is the result of multiple decisions whose collective effects result in consumption of the intoxicant. Furthermore, Marlatt stresses some decisions—referred to as apparently irrelevant decisions—may seem inconsequential to relapse, but may actually have downstream implications that place the user in a high-risk situation.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use {{of brand}} rather than generic names for {{medications}} can increase health care costs. However, {{little is known}} at a national level about how often physicians refer <b>to</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>using</b> their brand or generic names. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how often physicians refer <b>to</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>using</b> brand or generic terminology. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the 2003 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), a nationally representative survey of 25, 288 community-based outpatient visits in the United States. After each visit, patient medications were recorded on a survey encounter form by the treating physician or transcribed from office notes. MEASUREMENTS: Our main outcome measure was {{the frequency with which}} medications were recorded on the encounter form using their brand or generic names. RESULTS: For 20 commonly <b>used</b> <b>drugs,</b> the median frequency of brand name use was 98 % (interquartil...|$|R
500|$|In February, the Yardbirds {{released}} [...] "Shapes of Things", {{which is}} frequently considered the first psychedelic rock song. Reaching No. 3 in the UK and 11 in the US, the work continued the Yardbirds' exploration of guitar effects, Eastern-sounding scales, and shifting rhythms {{that began with}} their 1965 singles. By overdubbing guitar parts, Beck layered multiple takes for his solo, which included extensive use of fuzz tone and harmonic feedback. The Yardbirds' lyrics, described as [...] "stream-of-consciousness", have been interpreted as pro-environmental or anti-war. Another record often considered the first psychedelic rock song is the Byrds' [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] (March 1966). For their new single, the Byrds moved away from their earlier folk rock with Roger McGuinn's 12-string Rickenbacker guitar interpretation of free jazz (Coltrane) and Indian raga-sounding scales (Shankar). [...] The Byrds' lyrics were widely taken to refer <b>to</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> although the group denied it at the time. [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] peaked at No. 14 in the US. and No. 24 in the UK. According to author David Simonelli, despite being released a month apart from each other, both songs [...] "achieved the same status" [...] as the first [...] "psychedelic" [...] hit, and the Yardbirds became the first British band to have the term applied to one of its songs.|$|E
500|$|Parcells instituted {{numerous}} changes {{before the}} 1984 season. He changed {{half of the}} roster, getting rid of players he deemed problematic, overhauled the team's strength training program, and trained the players harder {{to make them more}} resistant to injury. The Giants had a problem with player abusing drugs in the early 1980s, and Parcells decided he had to take a stand. He estimates that he released 20–30 players due <b>to</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in his first three years as head coach, some after giving them second chances. He would often call their mothers to tell them of the players habits in an attempt to get them off drugs, and several times he recounts crying along with players as he released them. Simms won the starting job back for the season, and Brunner was released. Parcells announced the decision by saying, [...] "e gives us our best chance to win right now." [...] Simms responded by throwing for 4,044 yards, making him the first Giant to reach 4,000yards passing in a season. The Giants had a resurgent season, highlighted by a midseason stretch where they won five of six against opponents such as the defending conference champion Redskins, the Dallas Cowboys and their new co–tenants at Giants Stadium, the Jets. With two games left the Giants had a 9–5 record and a chance to win their first divisional title in 21 years. Yet {{despite the fact that they}} lost those final two games to finish 9–7, the Giants still made the playoffs as a Wild Card. In the first round, they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16-13 in Anaheim before losing, 21–10, to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. Standout performers included Rob Carpenter and Joe Morris, who split running back duties, combining for over 1,300yards and 11 touchdowns. Four receivers had over 30 catches on the year, including tight end Zeke Mowatt and receiver Bobby Johnson who tied for the team lead with 48 catches each. Phil McConkey returned punts and kickoffs. Parcells installed five new starters on defense, including Leonard Marshall at defensive end and Jim Burt at nose tackle, and the team's first round pick was used to draft Michigan State linebacker Carl Banks, who would become a key member of the Giants' linebacking corps for the next several seasons.|$|E

40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study compared perceived peer <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and actual <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> {{in a sample}} of Latin American university students. Students from nine universities in five countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Honduras and Peru) completed a questionnaire that addressed the use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine.

While students generally overestimated peer use of tobacco, marijuana and cocaine, they accurately estimated or underestimated peer use of alcohol. Apart from the anomalous findings with regard to alcohol, this study shows that perceived <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> relates <b>to</b> actual <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in Latin America as it does elsewhere.
