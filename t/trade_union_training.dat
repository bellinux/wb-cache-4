50|$|In 1973, an {{improved}} scheme of allowances {{was introduced to}} assist parents of children {{who did not have}} reasonable access to school services {{as a result of their}} geographic location. The quality of health care in rural areas was also improved via the development of a regional hospitals program and promotion of community-based health services. The <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Training</b> Authority Act of 1975 set up a national college and state centres designed to educate trade union leaders in various aspects of industrial relations. The Commonwealth Secondary Scholarship Scheme was replaced by a system of secondary allowances which were made available on the basis of financial need. An isolated children’s allowance was introduced to compensate the educational disadvantages faced by children living in remote parts of the country. Greater spending was allocated to the arts, while spending on urban and regional development was accelerated, which contributed to a significant rise in the number of Australian households connected to a sewerage services. A School Dental Service Scheme was also introduced, providing free dental care for schoolchildren. Via grants to the states, the Whitlam Government funded the construction of 18,500 homes for low income earners from 1973 to 1975.|$|E

(2) Transnational citizenship (immigrants acting in codevelopment activities, embedded in a transnational dynamic, are also transnational citizens, {{to the extent that}} they have a dual presence.

In order to meet the aim of presenting “the case”, and reflections on the theoretical-methodological, ethicalpolitical and pedagogical processes in which systematisation can involve the subjects it gathers, and which it can launch onto them, the article initially presents, in a summarised manner, information on the object of reflection. It spells out the concept of systematisation used and also presents “theoretical reasons” which show that this kind of investigation: attached to social practices and performed collectively, with the intention of producing knowledge and learning from and for practices, and which flows into a subjectivation process, can lead to reflections that actually surpass the limits of systematised practices. It provides elements for reflections on this subjectivation process which allows the subjects to criticise what has been experienced, gives them freedom to reorient their ways of being in the world (“being-oneself”, “beingtogether”, “being-relationship”), and submit their political practices to a reflective surveillance that will keep them moving.

40|$|This central {{underlying}} {{principle is}} now almost unchallenged and is sup-ported by peak {{education and training}} bodies, state governments, business groups and key university VET research centres.

But that {{is a far cry from}} the early days of training reform when trade unions provided the inspiration for the reforms implemented by Labor governments between 1983 and 1996. Then the labour movement, and the union movement in particular set out to restructure the entire vocational training system and to tie the changes to the industrial award system.

40|$|The central {{proposition}} of {{this article}} is that <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> involvement in <b>training</b> is essential to ensure that workers {{are in a position to}} adapt readily to changing circumstances and bargain from a strong position.

First, <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> need to engage with training and workplace learning in more direct and involved ways than allowed for by current partnership arrangements. This involvement is to protect workers’ interests, promote worker development and to develop jobs as decent jobs. Second, such engagement requires that unions consider their organizational capacities in two respects, within national contexts and across borders.

At the time, the participants did not realize that their deliberations would determine our movement 2 ̆ 7 s direction in education until the year 2000. Discussions ranged from how we can coordinate the development and sharing of education materials, offer more schools and educational activities, use new technology in the area of distance education, and build more resources to further our education work. In the course of the discussions, the question of who we were reaching emerged as the major theme. The discussion document entitled, Why We Educate summed up the discussions this way: 2 ̆ 2 [...] . <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> education has historically targeted the local union leadership and activists through a myriad of educational institutes and schools. Once back in the workplace it was anticipated that this group would share its knowledge and skills.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of getting workers involved in safety and health issues at work. Since modernisation and industrialisation have led to human loss and tragedy all around the world due to industrial accidents, safety practitioners and observers have widely agreed that the traditional belief that employers are solely responsible for the workers’ safety at work should have a new paradigm. To create a safe working condition, workers should be allowed to participate actively in safety and health matters and cooperate with the employers. Since they are closer to their work, it is felt that the workers themselves are the most qualified to make decisions about safety and job improvements. Evidence showed that various benefits could be yielded if workers work together with employers including the reduction of death and injury rates at work. However, to make workers’ participation in this field effective, several criteria are crucial. They are the legal support, management support, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> support, <b>training</b> and the positive quality of the workers involved...|$|R
