5000|$|While professionally established, Hall went to {{work for}} {{ecologist}} Frederic Clements at the Carnegie Institution Division of Plant Sciences at Stanford University in 1919 in an effort to explore experimental methods of taxonomy. [...] The pair established methods for conducting reciprocal transplant experiments, whereas plants were moved and studied in the habitats of similar <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species.</b> These experiments provided methods for studying plant adaptation, but did not readily explain mechanisms of plant evolution. In 1924, Hall began to work with geneticist, and friend, E. B. Babcock to look beyond ecological methods to genetics and cytology as experimental methods to explore taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. Hall left Clements group and started to assemble his own experimental team, hiring David Keck and William Hiesey in 1926 and Jens Clausen in 1931.|$|E
50|$|The {{focus of}} Vences' work {{is on the}} {{amphibians}} and reptiles of Madagascar. He works closely together with Frank Glaw on many <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> descriptions; together they have described over 100 new species of frogs, and numerous new species of snakes, chameleons, and other reptiles. In 1992, they produced the first field guide to the reptiles and amphibians of Madagascar, notably in English (previous works were mostly in French). In 1994 they produced a second edition of this guide, including the descriptions of numerous new taxa, and a significantly expanded reptile section. In 2007, a third edition was produced, which did not describe any new species, but included colour photographs and short text descriptions of over 100 unnamed species.In recent years, Vences has been coauthor on around 20 publications per year, {{over a wide range}} of subjects, including but not limited to biogeography, amphibian disease, population genetics, evolution and speciation, and taxonomy.|$|E
40|$|The use of morphospecies as surrogates for <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} overcome the identification difficulties associated with many invertebrate studies, such as biodiversity surveys. Hymenoptera specimens were collected by beating and pitfall traps, and were separated into morphospecies by a non-specialist with no prior training, and later identified by an expert taxonomist. The number of Hymenoptera morphospecies and <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> was 37 and 42, respectively, representing an underestimation error of 12 %. Different families presented varying levels of difficulty, and although the species estimation provided by the use of morphospecies initially appeared to have a relatively minor error rate, this was actually an artefact. Splitting and lumping errors balanced each other out, wrongly suggesting that morphospecies were reasonable surrogates for <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> in the Hymenoptera. The use of morphospecies should be adopted only for selected target groups, which have been assessed as reliable surrogates for <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> beforehand, and some prior training to the nonspecialist is likely to be of primary importance...|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review is {{conducted on the}} phylogenetic discontinuities in mtDNA sequences of 252 <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> of vertebrates. About 140 of these species (56 %) were subdivided clearly into two or more highly distinctive matrilineal phylogroups, {{the vast majority of}} which were localized geographically. However, only a small number (two to six) of salient phylogeographic subdivisions (those that stand out against mean within-group divergences) characterized individual species. A previous literature summary showed that vertebrate sister species and other congeners also usually have pronounced phylogenetic distinctions in mtDNA sequence. These observations, taken together, suggest that current <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> often agree reasonably well in number (certainly within an order-of-magnitude) and composition with biotic entities registered in mtDNA genealogies alone. In other words, mtDNA data and traditional taxonomic assignments tend to converge on what therefore may be “real” biotic units in nature. All branches in mtDNA phylogenies are nonanastomose, connected strictly via historical genealogy. Thus, patterns of historical phylogenetic connection may be at least as important as contemporary reproductive relationships per se in accounting for microevolutionary unities and discontinuities in sexually reproducing vertebrates. Findings are discussed {{in the context of the}} biological and phylogenetic species concepts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although DNA {{sequence}} analysis {{is becoming a}} powerful tool for identifying species, {{it is not easy to}} assess whether the observed genetic disparity corresponds to reproductive isolation. Here, we compared the efficiency of biological species identification between nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast DNA sequences, focusing on an Asian endemic perennial lineage of Mitella (Asimitellaria; Saxifragaceae). We performed artificial cross experiments for 43 pairs of ten <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species,</b> and examined their F 1 hybrid pollen fertility in vitro as a quantitative measure of postzygotic reproductive isolation. Results A nonlinear, multiple regression analysis indicated that the nuclear ribosomal DNA distances are sufficient to explain the observed pattern of F 1 hybrid pollen fertility, and supplementation with chloroplast DNA distance data does not improve the explanatory power. Overall, with the exception of a recently diverged species complex with more than three biological species, nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences successfully circumscribed ten distinct biological species, of which two have not been described (and an additional one has not been regarded as a distinct <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species)</b> to date. Conclusion We propose that nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences contribute to reliable identification of reproductively isolated and cryptic species of Mitella. More comparable studies for other plant groups are needed to generalize our findings to flowering plants. </p...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 A taxonomic {{revision}} of the genus Anthracobia Boudier is presented. The genus and eight included taxa are described and figured. A discussion of the taxonomic criteria used to delimit the genus and the species is included, and {{a key to the}} recognized taxa is given. Four imperfect states for included species and the imperfect state for one excluded species are described and figured; of these, three have been previously reported, and two are new. Other previously included species and forms are either synonymized or excluded, with an indication of their affinities, on the basis of examination of the types involved. Anthracobia is again restricted to organisms having hyaline, smooth, biguttulate, elliptical spores and small, yellow-orange to dark brown, lenticular apothecia which are externally clothed with short, blunt, brown excipular hairs grouped in fascicles occurring at and below the margin. All but one species occur on burned soil and charcoal; the one exception occurs on cow dung. After revision, the seven accepted species and one accepted variety include one provisional new combination and two new species which are fully characterized but not formally described. The included taxa are: A. rnacrocystis, A. melaloma, A. nitida, A. subatra, A. subatra var. fusca, A. tristi,s, A. <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> "A, " and A. <b>taxonomic</b> <b>species</b> "B. ...|$|E

40|$|Most {{ecological}} diversity indices summarize {{the information about}} the relative abundances of community <b>species</b> without reflecting <b>taxonomic</b> differences between <b>species.</b> Nevertheless, in the environmental conservation practice, data on species abundances are generally unknown.

Most of these measures are based on <b>taxonomic</b> relations among <b>species</b> and ignore species relative abundances. In a recent paper, Izsa´k and Papp suggest that the quadratic entropy index (Q) is the only diversity index used to date in the ecological practice that incorporates both speciesrelative abundances and a measure of the pairwise <b>taxonomic</b> differences between <b>species</b> in the analyzed data set. I show here that a number of traditional {{ecological diversity}} measures can be generalized to take into account a taxonomic weighting factor.
