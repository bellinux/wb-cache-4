Fanged Frisbees are quite literally normal Frisbees with fangs and are first mentioned in Goblet of Fire as one of Filch's newest restricted items during Dumbledore's start-of-term speech.

500|$|Although Comedy Central did {{not object}} to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to {{material}} they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a Nativity play, a baby Jesus resembling a fetus pops out of Wendy, who is playing the Virgin Mary, and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation [...] "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> out of it. Comedy Central officials would not allow {{the scene in the}} episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off-camera, which Parker said he felt was actually funnier.|$|E

There was a game during his tenure with the Phillies where Demeter had missed several defensive plays at 3rd base. The fans were upset and booing loudly, even prompting one overzealous fan to throw an apple onto the field. Demeter recalled, [...] "I'd made two errors and here came an apple sailing out of the stands." [...] He continued, [...] "So I just picked it up, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> out of it and the booing stopped." ...|$|E

The inaugural three-day Michigan International rally should have been easy for the AMC Eagle SX/4, but [...] "several of the very sandy stages that would have been to Henderson's advantage were cancelled" [...] so with co-driver Jon Wickens, the team finished second in the Production Class and tenth overall. The next event with the SX/4 was the Manistee Trails rally in Michigan, where Henderson and Kloosterman won the Production class and finished fifth overall.

"I was {{perfectly}} sensible, but felt somewhat dazed and stupid; I found myself vaguely {{thinking that he}} must, after all, have been very badly hit, and, instead of making off, had hid up within a short distance of the spot where we saw him.

They won't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want.
