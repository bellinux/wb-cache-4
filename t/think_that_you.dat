5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I <b>think</b> (<b>that)</b> <b>you</b> are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

Just because I'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist, it means I'm fucking smart. Sorry." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Mitchell's defense {{attorney}} argued that Jones' injuries were inconsistent with {{those found in}} Manson's paintings, Lord Nimmo Smith said during sentencing that he did [...] "not feel able {{to ignore the fact}} that there was a degree of resemblance between the injuries inflicted on Jodi and those shown in the Marilyn Manson paintings of Elizabeth Short that we saw. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> carried an image of the paintings in your memory when you killed Jodi." [...] Mitchell was found guilty of murder and sentenced to serve a minimum of twenty years in prison. Manson later dismissed claims that his work inspired the murder, arguing instead that [...] "the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive" [...] plays a more direct role in violent behavior, and criticised media who attempted to [...] " [...] the blame elsewhere." ...|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Bowen, {{a former}} Middle East {{correspondent}} for BBC News, {{was chosen to}} present the programme for its UK broadcast. Despite not being religious, {{he was drawn to}} the programme for its use of scientific and historical information. As well as presenting, Bowen also narrated and scripted large portions of the series. He stated that he brought a degree of scepticism to the show: before the first episode aired, he admitted that he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could [...] "corroborate anything that was in the Gospels". In the US version of Son of God, which was broadcast on the Discovery Channel and retitled Jesus: The Complete Story, the footage of Bowen was edited out and his narration was redubbed by American actor Avery Brooks. It was also released in this format under the name Jesus: The Real Story, with narration from Tom Hodgkins.|$|E
500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|The story's central {{location}} {{was set at}} Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew [...] "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well {{to make it as}} practical as possible." [...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You have to believe that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw." [...] Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey.|$|E

500|$|Wellesley {{later told}} Stevenson that [...] "I should {{not like to}} see again such a loss as I {{sustained}} on the 23rd September, even if attended by such a gain", and in later life he referred to Assaye as [...] "the bloodiest for the numbers that I ever saw". Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Munro, the Company's district collector at Mysore, was critical of the high proportion of casualties and questioned Wellesley's decision not to wait for Stevenson. He wrote to Wellesley: [...] "I am tempted to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did it {{with a view of}} sharing the glory with the smallest numbers". In response, Wellesley politely rebuffed Munro's accusations and defended his action as necessary because he had received and acted upon incorrect intelligence regarding the Maratha position. Assaye was 34-year-old Wellesley's first major success and despite his anguish over the heavy losses, it was a battle he always held in the highest estimation. After his retirement from active military service, the Duke of Wellington (as he later became known) considered Assaye the finest thing he ever did in the way of fighting even when compared to his later military career.|$|E
500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Swift and {{produced}} by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. It was inspired by an ex-boyfriend who was later revealed to be opposite of what Swift had originally thought. Swift recalled that, at first, [...] "He came across as prince charming." [...] As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. [...] "And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was," [...] she said. She wrote [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] in an emotional state, which she described as [...] "the breaking point", where she thought to herself, [...] "'You know what? Don’t even <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can keep on hurting me.'" [...] The circumstances {{reached a point where}} she felt she had to walk away. [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on October 28, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store. The song was reissued on March 5, 2009, as remix, the same day she made her guest appearance on the television series [...] in the episode [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn".

500|$|On {{the evening}} {{after the first}} day's shooting, Corbijn told the band about Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the American Southwest, and he {{suggested}} their use on the sleeve. Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant's etymology; according to Mormon legend, early settlers named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree's stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled The Joshua Tree. That morning, while driving on Route 190 near Darwin, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert. Corbijn had been {{hoping to find a}} single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a group of trees. They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something the Edge called [...] "fairly spontaneous". Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather during parts of the trip. Bono explained, [...] "it was freezing and we had to take our coats off so it would at least look like a desert. That's {{one of the reasons we}} look so grim." [...] Regarding the serious tone of the images, Corbijn said, [...] "I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously. It was definitely the most serious, I <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can photograph a band. You couldn't go any further down that line unless you start photographing graves." ...|$|E
500|$|... "742617000027" [...] is the intro {{track to}} the album. It {{contains}} some guitar scratches and abstract sound {{samples from the}} sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must {{get the better of}} certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob."
