5|$|The schools {{currently}} meet only in lacrosse, as {{all other}} Johns Hopkins athletics fall under NCAA Division III and all Maryland athletics are Division I.

5|$|West Virginia {{also enjoyed}} a long-standing rivalry with the Syracuse Orange. <b>The</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> competed {{annually}} from 1955-2012, with the 1993 {{addition of the}} Ben Schwartzwalder Trophy being awarded to the victor. The significance of the trophy resides {{in the fact that}} Ben Schwartzwalder was a West Virginia native, former WVU player, and legendary head coach at Syracuse. While Syracuse holds a 33–27 lead in the series, WVU has won eight of the last ten games between the schools. Much like the status of the Backyard Brawl, Syracuse's departure from the Big East for the Atlantic Coast Conference and WVU's joining of the Big 12 Conference casts doubt over the future of the series.|$|E

25|$|Steiner's {{belief that}} all people are imbued with a spiritual core has fueled Waldorf schools' social mission. <b>The</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> always been coeducational and open to {{children}} of all social classes.

25|$|If the shoal {{becomes more}} tightly organised, {{with the fish}} {{synchronising}} their swimming so they all move {{at the same speed}} and in the same direction, then the fish may be said to be schooling. Schooling fish are usually of the same species and the same age/size. Fish schools move with the individual members precisely spaced from each other. The schools undertake complicated manoeuvres, as though <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> minds of their own.|$|E

25|$|On August 29, 2006, Caruthersville Emergency Manager and Fire Chief Charlie Jones {{was awarded}} the StormReady Community Hero Award for his actions {{preventing}} further injuries and fatalities in the area. He ordered the sirens to sound repeatedly and used the fire department's communications frequency to warn of the imminent and extreme danger that lay ahead, which saved many lives that evening. No lives were lost in Caruthersville as a result. More than half the community was destroyed. Charitable outpouring was enormous and several key buildings, including one of <b>the</b> <b>schools,</b> <b>have</b> been rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|There has {{occasionally}} been {{calls to}} move the game from Jacksonville, usually when either Georgia or Florida is dominating the rivalry. However, <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> continued to renew their contract since it makes financial sense for both schools to keep the game in Jacksonville. For example, despite vocal calls {{to move the}} game to Atlanta or make it a home-and-home contest after Florida went on a 16-3 run in the series, Georgia's athletic board unanimously agreed in 2009 to a six-year contract to keep the game in Jacksonville through 2016. The most recent contract extension keeps the game in Jacksonville until 2021.|$|E

25|$|There are {{multiple}} misconceptions {{in regards to}} poverty. Research has undermined the idea that parents of low socioeconomic status do not value education, when in truth they hold the same attitudes as wealthy families. It {{is not an issue}} of value, but more so a problem of access. A parent from a lower socioeconomic class is likely to have more factors than a parent from a wealthy socioeconomic class that may affect their involvement with their child’s education. For instance a person living in poverty is more likely to work multiple jobs, as well as not having certain means of transportation, thus hindering their access to their child’s education. The teachers, faculty, and administrators of <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> to take these real-life factors into consideration.|$|E
25|$|Having {{developed}} {{with the city}} in the 19th century, a number of the University buildings {{are an important part of}} Belgrade’s architecture and cultural heritage. Former sites include today's Museum of Vuk and Dositej and Princess Ljubica's Residence buildings, both of them being recognized as Belgrade's topmost historic buildings. The historical Subotica Law School (1920-1941) was also a part of the University of Belgrade. Some of the Post-World War II facilities were built in the brutalist style. The University has sites throughout the city, with the two major campuses, one next to the Prince Michael Street at Studentski Trg and the other on King Alexandar Boulevard. It has eleven dormitories scattered throughout the city’s urban neighborhoods for 11.340 students, including one dormitory complex in New Belgrade. Many of <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> separate buildings at various locations in Belgrade. The University also owns several endowment buildings in the downtown district, most of them being built in the 19th and early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Mirroring the {{historical}} political {{conflicts between the}} freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a subsidised religious—mostly Catholic—branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they {{must be able to}} prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that—at least for the Catholic schools—the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation VSKO. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. Steiner, Montessori, or Freinet) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.|$|E

500|$|The {{establishment}} of Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (Poly) in 1883 {{was an important}} development for City College's athletics program. With the founding of Poly, City College acquired an arch rival in academics and sports—particularly football. <b>The</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> met annually in a football clash since 1889. [...] The [...] formal organization of an athletic program at BCC did not begin until 1895. During {{the early years of}} the athletic program, City College played chiefly against college teams because few other secondary schools existed in Maryland. City College's 1895 football schedule included St. John's College, Swarthmore College, the United States Naval Academy, University of Maryland, and Washington College.|$|E
500|$|Although early opponents {{suggested}} the Pūnana Leo schools would harm students' academic development, graduates from <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> achieved several measures of academic success in later life. This is true {{despite the fact}} that the emphasis of the schools is on language revitalization rather than academic achievement: [...] "Immersion students have garnered prestigious scholarships, enrolled in college courses while still in high school, and passed the state university's English composition assessments, despite receiving the majority of their English, science and mathematics instruction in Hawaiian. Student achievement on standardised tests has equalled... surpassed that of Native Hawaiian children enrolled in English language schools, even in English language arts [...]" [...] These academic benefits come in addition to language revitalization and an increased realization of cultural pride.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the national building programme for schools, these redevelopments did not go ahead. In 2009, only two schools in the city were judged [...] "inadequate", whereas 29 of the city's 63 schools were considered [...] "no longer good enough" [...] by Ofsted. Before being taken over by Ark Schools and becoming a Charter Academy, StLuke's Church of England secondary school was, in terms of GCSE achievement, {{one of the worst}} schools in the country. It was also criticised by officials for its behavioural standardsreports were made of students repeatedly throwing chairs at teachers. Since becoming an academy in 2009, <b>the</b> <b>schools</b> <b>have</b> significantly improved; 69% of students achieved five GCSEs at grades A*C including English and mathematics. Charter Academy operates its intake policy as a standard comprehensive taking from its catchment area rather than selecting on religious background.|$|E
