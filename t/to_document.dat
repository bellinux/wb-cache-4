5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men.

The cameramen were sent to every army air force base <b>to</b> <b>document</b> all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained to load film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if need be, to develop it on location.

The assignment of subjects <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> is modeled as a multilabel classifica-tion problem. Experiments with a real parliamentary corpus are reported, evaluating several methods to assign conceptual subjects <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> and <b>to</b> match those sets of subjects with user profiles. ...|$|R

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. The idea <b>to</b> <b>document</b> his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E
5|$|Another epic film, On My Honor, was {{conceived}} and begun by Cecil B. DeMille. It was <b>to</b> <b>document</b> {{the founding of}} the Scouting movement but was left unfinished after DeMille died in January 1959. The screenplay, by Jesse Lasky, Jr., focused on Baden-Powell, Burnham and other pioneers who were to have a major influence on Scouting. After DeMille's death, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon continued to work on the film until 1962, hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{trend towards}} {{recognising}} a general principle of public access <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> held by public authorities, both in national and in Community law. Once such a fundamental principle of Community law is established, the exceptions to public access <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> laid down in the internal rules of the institutions must not be construed or interpreted in a manner which will render it impossible to attain the objective of openness. To this effect, and {{in the light of}} the increasing � but still marginal � judicial review of the institutions refusals of access <b>to</b> <b>documents,</b> the European Ombudsman's inquires into public access <b>to</b> <b>documents</b> and his decisions on individual complaints of maladministration have provided an efficient and cost-effective recourse for European citizens.
