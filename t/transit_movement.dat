Our non-radiolabeled dye study also supported these findings (data not shown). The half-life of 99 mTc is 6 h; thus, the image obtained after 22 h in normal mice showed no activity in transverse colon and other location, with only trace amounts remaining in the stomach, which clearly indicates that the free 99 mTc was accumulated in the labeled parietal cells present in the stomach.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} transit experiences of migrants from Sub-Saharan African {{countries in the}} Turkish metropolis of Istanbul. Although the narratives of the individuals met {{in the course of}} fieldwork in Istanbul are the primary focus, the thesis also outlines the larger macro-structural conditions faced. The overarching goal of this thesis is thus, through the experiences of the migrants themselves, to critically approach and discuss the concept of transit with the aid of the theoretical perspectives of social networks analysis and mobility. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and an explorative design, this thesis investigates the ‘black-box’ that the state of transit has hitherto often represented in the literature by focusing on migrants’ experiences of mobility, immobility and social networks. Insecurity, uncertainty, and an overall precariousness constitute the state of transit. Light is shed on questions relating to the peculiarities of a state of transit and its impact on everyday life. The thesis highlights the processual nature of mobility and immobility strategies. The issue of migrant capital (conceptualised as local knowledge, with a particular focus on the migrant experience) is found to be a crucial aspect of immobility in transit. The thesis further identifies a pattern of social stratification based on immobility intersected with legal status and migrant capital, and argues that this stratification is produced by <b>transit</b> <b>movements</b> and, in turn, reproduces <b>transit</b> <b>movements.</b> Related to social stratification is the presentation of Istanbul as the socio-economic context that offers prerequisites for establishment in situ and establishment in mobility...|$|R

So, for example if the sun and Mars are in a difficult aspect in the natal chart, a positive or easy aspect between progressed Mars and the natal sun will not produce the same expected benefit. Also, if planets are not aspected in the natal chart, progressed aspects will in general not have the same effect.

30|$|The {{universal}} {{problem of}} bacterial resistance to antibiotic reflects {{a serious threat}} for physicians to control infections. Evolution in bacteria results {{in the development of}} various complex resistance mechanisms to neutralize the bactericidal effect of antibiotics, like drug amelioration, target modification, membrane permeability reduction, and drug extrusion through efflux pumps. Efflux pumps acquire a wide range of substrate specificity and also the tremendous efficacy for drug molecule extrusion outside bacterial cells. Hindrance in the functioning of efflux pumps may rejuvenate the bactericidal effect of conventional antibiotics. Efflux pumps also {{play an important role in}} the exclusion or inclusion of quorum-sensing biomolecules responsible for biofilm formation in bacterial cells. This <b>transit</b> <b>movement</b> of quorum-sensing biomolecules inside or outside the bacterial cells may get interrupted by impeding the functioning of efflux pumps. Metallic nanoparticles represent a potential candidate to block efflux pumps of bacterial cells. The application of nanoparticles as efflux pump inhibitors will not only help to revive the bactericidal effect of conventional antibiotics but will also assist to reduce biofilm-forming capacity of microbes. This review focuses on a novel and fascinating application of metallic nanoparticles in synergy with conventional antibiotics for efflux pump inhibition.|$|E
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} two {{concrete}} developments. One is the historical process {{that produced the}} Bay Area Rapid Transit District in 1957 and the district's particular regional rapid transit plan, approved by the voters of Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco counties in November, 1962. The other is the process that produced the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District in 1955 and 1956, and the particular transit service this District began operating in 1960. The relation between the two districts, the latter is contained within the former's territory, {{is one of the}} central concerns. These developments are analyzed as contingent outcomes of a regional <b>transit</b> <b>movement</b> that was active during this period. Several aspects of this movement's history are analyzed. Its origins are located in the context of postwar automobile-based suburban growth and the decline of privately owned interurban transit. Government-owned interurban rapid transit, in addition to freeways and off-street parking, are discussed as the transport means sought by business and political leaders in downtown San Francisco and Oakland to maintain and enhance their competitive positions and to gain shares of postwar economic growth. The composition of movement leadership groups is described; the informal and formal regional organizations they created are analyzed with particular reference to the internal conflicts which delayed the movement's progress in the early years, and then caused it to fracture and partially disintegrate during the latter period. These conflicts are interpreted as instances of urban mercantilist politics. Existing central business districts were in competition with each other while they were also in competition with growing suburban commercial zones. Transit was a controversial political terrain on which the many places in the region sought to gain competitive locational advantages. The movement sponsored a pioneering venture in regional transportation planning; the central planning innovation was a regional rapid transit system designed to function in a metropolitan area where land use patterns had been and would continue to be shaped by the motor vehicle. The important roles of private consulting firms and representatives of private financial capital in the public works planning process are high-lighted. Several alternative transit system designs were technically feasible and were advocated by various interested individuals and groups. The political and economic reasons why some technical features, such as an underwater tube, were adopted, and others, such as the bus rapid transit, were rejected are discussed; the priorities of an alliance between downtown Oakland and San Francisco account for many of the technical choices made. In addition to its internal, mercantilist dimension, two aspects of the movement's situation are considered. One of these is its relation to the three major privately owned interurban transit companies in the region. The decline of Key System, which was controlled by national City Lines from 1946 through 1960, and its consequences are traced in detail. The role of the California Public Utilities Commission, which closely regulated privately owned transit companies, is analyzed. The other aspect is the relation of the <b>transit</b> <b>movement</b> to the large-scale program of freeway and bridge building conducted by state government agencies. The movement's progress was intimately linked with bridge location controversies that raged during the period; the political and design connections between transit and freeways are explored, particularly with regard to the San Francisco freeway "revolt" of 1959...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} acoustic tagging of 8 yellowfin tunas (#Thunnus albacares$, Bonnaterre, 1788) undertaken around Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in La Reunion island (Indian Ocean). Emphasis is laid on {{the horizontal}} movements and thus complete previous studies on vertical movements around the same FADs. The first result {{of the present study}} deals with the relative dwelling time of yellowfin over the distance to FAD where tagged, in 0. 9 km intervals. Distributions of dwelling time are different between day and night. During daytime, the fishes remain in the close vicinity of the FAD (mostly within a 1. 8 km radius), whilst a drastic disassociation to the FAD occurs at night. During the day, the attractive influence of the FAD disappears 9. 3 km away; this finding leads to the suggestion that a minimum distance of 18 km between neighbouring FADs should be applied in La Reunion to avoid overlapping radii of influence. The second group of results points out the potential use of the vertical and total swimming speeds as indicators of the foraging activity of the fish and of the type of movements (behaviour of tight association to FAD, transit among FADs or offshore migration, away from the area of FADs). The day/night change affects the vertical activity, with large magnitude of vertical movements exhibited at night. The total speed during the offshore movements is estimated about 1. 2 m/s : the shift from a phase of tight association to FAD toward a phase of <b>transit</b> <b>movement</b> is characterised by an increase of the total speed. A typology of the relationships between swimming speed and feeding activity is proposed and discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops the}} concept of post-capitalist struggles. This concept highlights how a post-capitalist future is a recurring moment within the capitalist present and can be developed through struggles that express the latent powers found within what Marx called the collective worker. Using a comparative and historical framework, I examine four case studies in Latin America: Venezuelas socialist enterprises, Argentinas recuperated factories, the Chilean student movement and the Brazilian <b>transit</b> <b>movement.</b> In expressing new values and practices, such as collective management, solidarity and participatory democracy, {{and their ability to}} develop the political capacities to formulate clear demands and strategies through the state, these four cases can indeed be considered examples of post-capitalist struggles. However, as mere glimpses of the future, these struggles display number of contradictions and ambiguities, particularly in relation to democratic practice and political organization. This is most marked in struggles that originate in the sphere of capitalist reproduction. A comparative analysis of the four cases also reveals the possibilities and limits of Latin Americas pink tide. These are found in what I call the neostructuralist bargain. Through this bargain, vulnerable sectors of the population become the target of small economic reforms that evidence a departure from the neoliberal orthodoxy of previous decades. However, in exchange, horizons beyond liberal democracy are temporarily closed off and the institutions of liberal democracy acquire a renewed legitimacy. The exception to this is the case of Venezuela, whose Chavista government goes beyond the boundaries of neostructuralism. This is evident in the Venezuelan governments support of new institutions that express the values of participatory democracy. However, in all cases new political challenges come to the surface, particularly with the rise of the regions right wing...|$|E
40|$|The appalling {{conditions}} of many 19 th century industrial cities, {{brought by the}} Industrial Revolution, triggered numerous ideas and concepts looking for a better form of urban environment. Although most of the ideas may be today categorized as utopian, they had nevertheless significantly influenced urban development and heralded, at that time, {{the emergence of the}} Modernist City. With time, the Modernist City grew increasingly car-dependent. The crisis of the contemporary “Automobile City” stimulates, yet again, efforts to develop visions for a new, better city, free from ill-effects of car traffic. These visions may also fall into category of urban utopia, but they hopefully will, like in the past, set new directions in urban development and contribute to emergence of a new city form. Numerous research, planning and design works up today allow to speculate on the emerging new urban design paradigm. The visions of a future “Post Automobile City” go generally in two directions: a radical Car-free City model entirely devoid of automobile and – less radical - a Sustainable Mobility City, offering diverse modes of movement and related diverse life styles. The latter concepts would comprise both city forms: entirely car-free zones and “ordinary” urban areas accessible for cars, but more habitable due to priorities for pedestrian, bike and <b>transit</b> <b>movement.</b> We already observe growing number of car-free neighborhoods, mostly in the cities of Western Europe. They usually do not differ physically from ordinary housing complexes, other than added car- free arrangements. However, like in the past, we can expect that new urban forms will start to evolve following ongoing changes in urban transport. The paper attempts to answer the question if, and how, future changes towards sustainable mobility, may influence urban form, and in particular, how car-free residential areas in future cities may look like...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss how {{international}} students' movements affect higher education policies with an aim of forming education hubs. International students' movements have become more active, massive and diversified in the process of globalization and internationalization of higher education. People in general have come to be more concerned about studying abroad through the cross-border programs, while governments are also eagerly attracting international students for human resource development. There are several types of students' movements as follows; 1) bilateral movement, 2) multilateral movement through international networking, and : 3) <b>transit</b> <b>movement</b> in which students can move from one place to another. As a result, education centers have appeared or are being designed to become hubs for international students. Those hubs are classified into three types; “student hub”,“skilled workers hub”, and “knowledge /innovation hub” (Knight, 2011), which can become an important strategic factor of higher education policy in many countries. For example, Sri Lanka has just started a reform of higher education with an aim to become “the most-cost effective and quality education hub in Asia”. Malaysia has already started functioning as a “student hub”, thus attracting various international students from Asia, Middle East and African countries. It can be said that Malaysia is a transit point as the preliminary destination for students who will eventually go on to English speaking countries like USA, UK, Canada, Australia and so on to get higher degrees. However, the formation of hub by international students' movement has also caused some issues as follows; frictions between local people and newcomers, drastic cultural changes and social security problems, one of which is the typical issue of people flowing illegaly into countries. These conflicts can stimulate people's nationalism, thus bringing about controversial political debates. International students' movements can provide higher education policies with new perspectives, while it is also true that it causes political and social problems...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how {{marine species}} use their {{environment}} {{has become increasingly}} important in management and conservation. Acoustic monitoring allows long-term tracking of marine animal movement that is traditionally analysed using kernel-based home range estimators. These traditional methods, however, are limited {{because they do not}} examine movement pathways within activity spaces. Network analysis (NA) provides an alternative approach to traditional home range analysis that treats acoustic receivers as network nodes and analyses movement between nodes. To investigate the utility of NA in identifying core use areas and compare the results with traditional analysis, a case study using acoustically monitored coastal sharks was conducted. To make direct comparisons with static traditional analysis a temporal scale was not explicitly explored. Comparison of traditional analysis and NA demonstrated that both methods provided similar results for identifying core use areas (50 % kernel utilization distribution (KUD) equivalent), but that NA tended to overestimate general use areas (95 % KUD equivalent) compared to kernel-based methods. Furthermore, frequent bidirectional movements within core use areas were identified by NA, indicating the importance of movement corridors within or between core areas. Movements between acoustic receivers outside core use areas were less frequent and unidirectional suggesting <b>transiting</b> <b>movements.</b> Therefore, NA may be a practical alternative to traditional home range metrics by providing useful data interpretation that allows for a comprehensive picture of animal movement, including identifying core use areas and pathways used...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{population}} and increase of travelling requirements in metropolitan areas, public transit has been recognized as a promising remedy and is playing an ever more important role in sustainable transportation systems. However, {{the development of the}} public transit system has not received enough attention until the recent emergence of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). In the conventional public transit system, little to no communication passes between transit vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, such as traffic signals and loop detectors. But now, thanks to advancements in automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems and wireless communication, real-time and high-resolution information of the movement of transit vehicles has become available, which may potentially facilitate the development of more advanced traffic control and management systems. This dissertation introduces a novel adaptive traffic signal control system, which utilizes the real-time location information of transit vehicles. By predicting the movement of the transit vehicle based on continuous detection of the vehicle motion by the on-board AVL system and estimating the measures of effectiveness (MOE) of other motor vehicles based on the surveillance of traffic conditions, optimal signal timings can be obtained by solving the proposed traffic signal optimization models. Both numerical analysis and simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed system improves a transit vehicle's operation as well as minimizes its negative impacts on other motor vehicles in the traffic system. In summary, there are three major contributions of this dissertation: a) development of a novel AVL-based adaptive traffic signal control system; b) modeling of the associated traffic signal timing optimization problem, which is the key component of the proposed system; c) applications of the proposed system to two real world cases. After presenting background knowledge on two major types of transit operations, i. e., preemption and priority, traffic signal control and AVL systems, the architecture of the proposed adaptive signal control system and the associated algorithm are presented. The proposed system includes a data-base, fleet equipped with surveillance system, traffic signal controllers, a <b>transit</b> <b>movement</b> predictor, a traffic signal timing optimizer and a request server. The mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) and nonlinear programming (NP) are used to formulate signal timing optimization problems. Then the proposed system and algorithm are applied to two real-world case studies. The first case study concerns the SPRINTER rail transit service. The proposed adaptive signal control (ASC) system is developed to relieve the traffic congestion and to clear the accumulated vehicle queues at the isolated signal around the grade crossing, based on the location information on SPRINTER from PATH-developed cellular GPS trackers. The second case study involves the San Diego trolley system. With the information provided by the AVL system, the proposed ASC system predicts the arrival times of the instrumented trolley at signals and provides the corresponding optimal signal timings to improve the schedule adherence, thus reducing the delays at intersections and enhancing the trip reliability for the trolley travelling along a signalized corridor in the downtown area under the priority operation. The negative impact (e. g., delay increase) on other traffic is minimized simultaneously. Both numerical analysis and simulation tests in the microscopic environment are conducted using the PARAMICS software to validate the proposed system for the aforementioned applications. The results present a promising future for further field operational testing...|$|E
40|$|Bangkok's extreme traffic {{problems}} have been traditionally {{explained in terms of}} a lack of road infrastructure and policy responses for many years have almost exclusively stressed road investment to the exclusion of all other forms of transport infrastructure development. This thesis questions this interpretation of the traffic problem and its chief policy response: building still more roads. It suggests that in order to effectively analyse Bangkok's traffic predicament and to formulate more sustainable responses to the crisis, an understanding is required of Bangkok's land use and transport development, as well as a systematic and detailed perspective on the similarities and differences between Bangkok and many other cities around the world, particularly those in Asia. This thesis suggests that Bangkok has passed through three key periods: a water-based transport and walking period, a transport modernisation period and a motorisation period. In each period up to motorisation Bangkok appeared to maintain a harmonious relationship between its high density, mixed use urban form, ideally suited to nonmotorised modes and to public transport. Even in the motorisation period, high density, mixed use development has mostly followed major road corridors and remains well-suited to much higher public transport and non-motorised mode use than currently exist. However, in this period, rapidly rising motor vehicle ownership and use began to come into conflict with the city's pre-automobile form. Road infrastructure could not be built fast enough to keep pace with traffic growth, despite almost exclusive commitment of resources to roads. High capacity public transport systems, including rail, renewed water transport and busways failed to materialise to help curb the motorisation process and to provide much needed relief on the roads. A basic conflict or mismatch between urban form and transport began to emerge, leaving the city ill-equipped to cope with the automobile and subject to large environmental, social and economic impacts from congestion. The thesis argues that while Bangkok's per capita road supply is low in an international sense, it is not atypical for an Asian city and road availability per hectare is similar to many other cities around the world. Likewise, com mon arguments about an inadequate road hierarchy are systematically analysed and are shown to be insufficient in explaining Bangkok's present crisis. The thesis thus suggests that attempting to tackle the traffic problem through an intensification of road building efforts will not provide the relief sought, but will only exacerbate the traffic impacts which are shown to be already at the limits of international experience. The international comparison of Bangkok with other cities, highlighting basic similarities and differences in land use and transport features, continues to build upon this argument. It shows that Bangkok lies at one extreme in many transport characteristics such as the amount of travel per hectare, and within the Asian cities, it is very high in vehicle ownership and use and energy use, comparatively low in public transport use and very low in non-motorised modes. The thesis suggests that in physical planning terms, Bangkok's traffic crisis appears to stem from a set of mismatches between its transport patterns, urban form and transport infrastructure. These mismatches are between: (1) vehicle use and urban form: higher levels of private vehicle use than can be properly accommodated in its dense, tightly woven urban fabric; (2) vehicle use and road supply: levels of private vehicle use which are incompatible with its road availability and which are uncharacteristically high compared to other Asian cities; (3) transit use, urban form and road supply: lower levels of overall transit use than would be expected in a city of its urban form and road availability; (4) transit infrastructure, urban form and road supply: a public transport infrastructure which is inadequate to meet the demands for <b>transit</b> <b>movement</b> inherent in such a dense city, particularly a lack of rail infrastructure; (5) non-motorised modes and urban form: levels of non-motorised mode use which are uncharacteristically low for such a dense, mixed use urban fabric. These mismatches are mainly the consequence of a long series of inappropriate and ineffective transport policies and investments which are biased towards private transport and which have at least in part arisen from narrow and outdated transport planning processes. In order for transport planning in Bangkok to address the suggested roots of the crisis, the thesis contends that at least two key constraints would have to be dealt with: the traditional urban transport planning process and the institutional fragmentation in transport policy and implementation. Notwithstanding, there are forces pushing in the direction of change and these are examined in terms of the growing global and local trends towards sustainability, community outrage over traffic and the role of NGOs. Based on these findings, this thesis provides a case for a series of policies to help deal with Bangkok's traffic disaster. In line with global trends towards sustainability as an organising principle for urban policy development, these policies are offered within a framework of developing a more sustainable transport system in Bangkok. The policies suggested cover priority to public transport infrastructure development, transitoriented,mixed land use development, transport demand management, improvement of waterway transportation, facilitation of walking and cycling and institutional reform of Bangkok's transport decision making structure. Opportunities for further complementary research are suggested...|$|E

This research focused on the effectiveness of conditional transit priority or the manipulation of traffic signal timing plans to reduce delay of late transit buses. The integration of two transportation subsystems—traffic signals and public transit systems—was studied. These subsystems interact along a congested corridor where they share a common roadway infrastructure and transit signal priority (TSP) regulates the interaction between traffic signals, passenger traffic, and buses. Previous research has focused on the evaluation of bus TSP performance at the route level. In practice, {{it is important to understand}} not only TSP performance at the route level but also the impact of TSP at the level of the traffic signal intersection (e. g., to allow progression in major cross streets). TSP can significantly improve performance at specific intersections, even though at the route level TSP shows a more modest impact. This study proposed the integration of several data sets such as bus scheduling and location, passenger flows, and TSP requests to evaluate schedule adherence at the stop level and TSP performance at the level of the signalized intersection. A congested arterial corridor was analyzed and regression analysis was used to determine the key factors that affect bus travel time and schedule recovery for late buses. TSP was found to be most effective at lower-volume intersections where queuing was less problematic. Implications of the findings are analyzed and discussed...|$|R

Implantable archival tags (n = 561) were deployed in bluefin tuna from 1996 to 2005 and 106 tags were recovered. Movement paths of the fish were reconstructed using light level and sea-surface-temperature-based geolocation estimates. To quantify habitat utilization we employed a weighted kernel estimation technique that removed the biases of deployment location and track length. Throughout the North Atlantic, high residence times (167 +/- 33 days) were identified in four spatially confined regions on a seasonal scale. Within each region, bluefin tuna experienced distinct temperature regimes and displayed different diving behaviors. The mean diving depths within the high-use areas were significantly shallower and the dive frequency and the variance in internal temperature significantly higher than during <b>transit</b> <b>movements</b> between the high-use areas. Residence time in the more northern latitude high-use areas was significantly correlated with levels of primary productivity. The regions of aggregation are associated with areas of abundant prey and potentially represent critical foraging habitats that have seasonally abundant prey. Throughout the North Atlantic mean diving depth was significantly correlated with the depth of the thermocline, and dive behavior changed in relation to the stratification of the water column. In this study, with numerous multi-year tracks, there appear to be repeatable patterns of clear aggregation areas that potentially are changing with environmental conditions. The high concentrations of bluefin tuna in predictable locations indicate that Atlantic bluefin tuna are vulnerable to concentrated fishing efforts in the regions of foraging aggregations...|$|R

Results showed that the nurses spent 89 % of their work time in the NICU and when in the NICU they spent 44. 8 % of their time charting neonate information, 40. 1 % on direct patient care at the incubator, 6. 8 % of their time in transit between NICU location, 5. 4 % of the time on washing or sanitizing their hands and 2. 9 % of the time searching for supplies. Based on this information and the spatial layout of the existing and proposed NICUs it was found that each layout has its own unique layout deficiencies, and the proposed layout does not necessarily improve efficiency. The proposed layout lowers <b>transit</b> times for <b>movements</b> from the incubator to the computer, the incubator to the medical supply cart, and the computer to the medical supply cart however the open bay layout lowers <b>transit</b> times for <b>movements</b> from the incubator to the sink. All other <b>movement</b> <b>transit</b> times depend on the specific pod unit within the pod layout where care is taking place. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|This project {{focuses on}} Copenhagen as a dense and diverse city that wishes {{to explore the}} {{possibilities}} of sustainable and recreational planning. We will examine how rooftops {{can be characterized as}} vague spaces - spaces that potentially can contribute to a healthy urban environment. In the analysis of vague spaces we establish the right to the city as an important issue in urban planning. Moreover, we explore the potentials of vague spaces and their controversial structures, which differ from typical public spaces like parks and squares. This manifestation will lead to a discussion concerning the poten-tial that lies in focusing on vertical planning through an expanded focus on the city as a place that does not only consist of <b>transit</b> and <b>movement</b> but makes room for simply just being...|$|R

Cooperative vehicle-highway automation systems are systems that provide driving control assistance or fully automated driving and are based on information about the vehicle's driving environment that can be received by communication from other vehicles or from the infrastructure, as well as from their own on-board sensors. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a context}} of growing car {{dependency}} and suburban sprawl, planners search for ways of intensifying urban development and reducing reliance on the automobile. The creation of planned mixed-use centres intended to become hubs of <b>transit</b> and pedestrian <b>movement</b> within the dispersed suburban environment represents one such intensification strategy. I investigate three suburban mixed-use centres in the Greater Toronto Area, selected for their advanced level of development, and identify the planning rationales and objectives {{that have led to}} their creation. To verify {{the extent to which they}} meet their intensification goal, I monitor the three selected centres' level of development, modal split, land-use pattern, inner synergy, and inner movements. Findings are mixed. If the suburban centres have been successful in attracting development and attaining levels of <b>transit</b> use, pedestrian <b>movement</b> and inner synergy exceeding those of the typical suburban area, they are not as distinct from the remainder of the suburb as intended and thus fall short from their planning objectives. I conclude that a strategy combining the creation of nodes (such as suburban mixed-use centres) with high-density, transit-oriented corridors within the suburban environment would be more effective in bringing intensification to this portion of the metropolitan region. ...|$|R

It is looked at from three {{different}} perspectives: historical urban plans, Alfred Döblin 2 ̆ 7 s novel Berlin Alexanderplatz, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder 2 ̆ 7 s 19802 ̆ 7 s film adaptation of Berlin Alexanderplatz. Through these three mediums, an argument forms that Alexanderplatz functioned as both a major <b>transit</b> space for <b>movement</b> of transportation and pedestrians, but also the transit space for the movement of ideas and information...|$|R

A solar eclipse {{is also a}} solar transit of the Moon, but technically only {{if it does not}} cover the entire disc of the Sun (an annular eclipse), as [...] "transit" [...] counts only objects that are smaller than what they are passing in front of.

40|$|This lecture will {{be focused}} on the {{physiology}} of how nutrients control the movement of a meal through the gut. The goal of the seminar is to illustrate the bench-to bedside impact of translational research that link basic science to clinical medicine. The following areas will be covered: 1. Control of upper gut transit by nutrient-triggered inhibitory feedback, 2. Examples of exploiting feedback control in nutritional support. 3. Clinical conditions associated with impaired transit control 4. Clinical consequences of uncontrolled transit 6. A novel, nutrient-based approach to the problem of accelerated <b>transit.</b> The <b>movement</b> of food through the small intestine is tightly controlled via the triggering of nutrient-triggered inhibitory feedback. Load-dependent slowing of gastric emptying is achieved through a metering mechanism based on the length of nutrient spread (1). Post-ulcer surgery is the classic example of accelerated gastric emptying. In that setting, dumping symptoms are the consequences of exaggerated feedback response (2) secondary to uncontrolled transit of the meal through the small intestine (3) ...|$|R
40|$|The work of {{passages}} evokes movement — the constitutive {{actions of}} passing on, across, over, through a space or medium, {{as much as}} the performance of their arrest. These are movements of voyage and migration, <b>transit</b> and flight. <b>Movements</b> within and between tradition and translation, appropriation and transformation, rights of passing and rituals of law; the dissemination of border crossing and transgression, surveillance and forgetting, territory and terror, subject and subjection, verdict and sentence, enactment and performance, mimesis and poesis. In short, passages — whether conjuring the movement of bodies, affections, concepts or texts — speak to questions of politics and aesthetics, the mediating relations of life and law...|$|R
40|$|Situated at the {{intersection}} of cinema, art and architecture, my thesis addresses the role of movement, time and duration in contemporary video practices. My thesis includes video and video-installation projects that are produced within fixed limits of time and very often in collaboration with others. Oscillating between academic enquiry and creative studio practice, I employ a combination of self-reflexive, collaborative and performative methodologies to investigate the potential of camera movement and editing in articulating contemporary ideas of time and duration. Working in sites of transit, my thesis also addresses the potential of architecture as both an active and passive agent, constantly moving between the foreground to the background of the narratives of <b>transit,</b> time and <b>movement...</b>|$|R

The municipality of Nickelsdorf (province of „Burgenland“) and the refugee arrivals in fall 2015 serve as field. The authors consider borders neither as simple thresholds nor as ramparts, but as socio-political places that de-mobilize or accelerate <b>transit</b> and sustained <b>movement.</b> The refugees’/migrants’ routes in the Balkans coincide with the biographical mobilities of the bus drivers who transport the arriving people, traffickers are in connivance with customs officers, and infrastructures in proximity of borders boost or collapse {{in accordance with the}} changing border regimes.

40|$|Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is an {{operational}} strategy that {{is capable of}} enhancing traditional transit services by facilitating <b>transit</b> vehicle <b>movements</b> in the prioritized direction. A wide variety of different TSP strategies have been proposed; however, the majority of TSP applications use a Red Truncation (RT) and/or a Green Extension (GE) strategy. A considerable amount of research has been directed to evaluate TSP operational capabilities for various traffic and control conditions. The results of this research suggest that there is widespread agreement among practitioners and researchers that GE is superior to RT as a TSP strategy when evaluated on the basis of delay impacts. The inferiority of the RT strategy appears to be a result of inefficiencies in the recovery algorithm. This paper examines the performance of the RT TSP strategy for different cycle recovery algorithms. The results suggest that the typical practice of implementing RT with out giving compensation to the non prioritized approach considerably undermines the potential benefits of RT. Consequently, an alternative cycle recovery algorithm is proposed and evaluated. The findings suggest that the magnitude of cross street vehicular delay is greatly influenced by the cycle recovery algorithm. Even a relatively naïve compensating cycle recovery algorithm was able t...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} gender {{relationships in the}} formal labor market in the 2000 's {{in the city of}} Caxias do Sul. The objective is to discuss the effects of technical and productive changes in the world of labor, and possible repercussions on the profile of jobs and workers. The research uses as its primary source data available in the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS), administered by the Ministry of Labor, Brazil. This paper is located within an interdisciplinary field of human sciences and the survey data and indicators treatment is an exercise of statistical approach to the applied and social sciences. The methodology uses the data as evidence to consider multiple social relations among workers: monitoring changes in wages, the sectors of activity, and types of occupation. One can establish a relation with variables that problematize the profile of the workers as relations of gender and education level. Changes were observed in the profiles of the workers. The rise of education, especially for males, is a major factor in this period. There was an increase in female participation in traditionally male sectors of occupation and the solidification of female leadership in some occupations. Although there are <b>transits</b> and <b>movements,</b> gender relations remain as an element of segregation in the workplace...|$|R
