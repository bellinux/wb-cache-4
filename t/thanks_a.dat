5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, nearing the halftime break, came an unusual string of {{reckless}} challenges from Toronto right back, Mikael Yourassowsky, on loan from Croatian side Rijeka. In the 36th minute of play, Yourassowsky was carded for a reckless challenge on Andy Najar, and a minute later was given a second yellow and subsequently ejected for doing a similarly mistimed tackle on Chris Pontius. It would not be until the 62nd minute that United were able to capitalize on the shorthanded Toronto, restoring parity at 2–2 <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> goal from Ngwenya. The draw gave D.C. United the cup title.|$|E

500|$|Liam Lacey, also {{writing for}} The Globe and Mail, {{described}} Iyall's voice as [...] "sultry [...] sexy", while Mason called it [...] "powerful". Her style {{has sometimes been}} compared to Chrissie Hynde, vocalist for the Pretenders. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post acknowledged the similarity, but also noted the influence of other singers in [...] "Never Say Never" [...] where Iyall mixed the [...] "aggressive bitchiness of , the coy confrontational tactics of Patty Donahue of the Waitresses and the slack sensuality of Debbie Harry of the earliest Blondie." [...] Iyall used to find the comparison annoying, but eventually warmed to it: [...] "When people said I sounded like her, I'd [...] say, 'Oh yeah, <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> lot.' But this year, I've {{fallen in love with}} [...] Learning To Crawl so now I don't care if [...] people want to make comparisons." [...] After a live show in 1982, [...] Niester contended that she was the weakest part of the group and had the [...] "vocal range of an automobile horn". Billboard writer Kathy Gillis wrote after a concert two years later that Iyall exhibited a [...] "dramatic range that, while not extreme in either direction, was touching." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{landing on}} the surface of the Moon {{occurred}} several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969, at which time one of three -long probes attached to three of the Lunar Module's four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light inside the LM lit up, and Aldrin called out, [...] "Contact light." [...] Armstrong shut the engine off and said, [...] "shutdown." [...] As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, [...] "Okay. Engine stop", then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a ten-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, [...] "We copy you down, Eagle." [...] Armstrong announced the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, [...] "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." [...] Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and pat on the back before quickly returning to the checklist of tasks needed to ready the lunar module for liftoff from the Moon should an emergency unfold during the first moments on the lunar surface. After Armstrong had confirmed touch-down, Duke re-acknowledged, and expressed the flight controllers' anxiety: [...] "Roger,Twang -- Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue - we're breathing again - <b>thanks</b> <b>a</b> lot!" [...] During the landing, Armstrong's heart rate, at one point, reached 160 beats per minute, according to section 12-1 of the NASA Apollo 11 Mission Report.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Bayesian technique aimed at classifying signals without prior training (clustering). The approach consists of modelling the observed signals, known {{only through a}} finite set of samples corrupted by noise, as Gaussian processes. As in many other Bayesian clustering approaches, the clusters are defined <b>thanks</b> to <b>a</b> mixture model. In order to estimate the number of clusters, we assume a priori a countably infinite number of clusters, <b>thanks</b> to <b>a</b> Dirichlet process model over the Gaussian processes parameters. Computations are performed <b>thanks</b> to <b>a</b> dedicated Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm, and results involving real signals (mRNA expression profiles) are presented...|$|R
