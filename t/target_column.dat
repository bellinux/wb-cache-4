40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} {{analysis of}} building structures is usually performed under sudden column loss conditions. This {{means that the}} bearing capacity of the <b>targeted</b> <b>column</b> disappeared instantaneously. Hence, a time length less than one tenth of the natural period in the gravitational direction of the damaged structure has been recommended for disabling the <b>targeted</b> <b>column</b> in the numerical analysis. The time length required for disabling the postulated column in dynamic progressive analysis {{is defined as the}} rise time. Most seismically designed structural members may have a minimum ductility capacity as regulated in design codes. When the column is subjected to a devastating abnormal loading, it may gradually lose its load-carrying ability with increased deflection. Thus, the column strength is completely lost within a finite rise time. In other words, the dynamic loading for progressive collapse analysis of the remaining structure is increased gradually rather than instantaneously. This study intends to apply the work-energy principle to investigating the rime-time effect on the dynamic response amplification under column loss. A single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model is used to derive the analytical formulation with consideration of the rise-time effect. It is constructed with an assumption that the maximum imposed loading can be attained before yielding. Analytical procedures for calculate the force- and displacement-based dynamic increase factors (DIFs) are proposed. Nonlinear time-history analyses are then carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach. The analysis results indicate that the dynamic amplification will decrease with increased finite rise time. The rise-time effect decreases with increased plastic demand. For practical application, the rise-time effect may be reasonably neglected as the ductility demand is larger than 5. 0 and the normalized loading is larger than 1. 5 for the force- and displacementbased DIFs, respectively. Its influence on the column-loss response may vary with the ratio of the rise-time length to the natural period and the extent of plastic deformation...|$|R

40|$|SummaryDuring Drosophila {{visual system}} development, {{photoreceptor}} (R) axons choose their correct paths and targets in a step-wise fashion. R axons with different identities make specific pathfinding decisions {{at different stages}} during development. We show here that the transmembrane protein Golden goal (Gogo), which is dynamically expressed in all R neurons and localizes predominantly to growth cones, is required in two distinct steps of R 8 photoreceptor axon pathfinding: Gogo regulates axon-axon interactions and axon-target interactions in R 8 photoreceptor axons. gogo loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes suggest that Gogo mediates repulsive axon-axon interaction between R 8 axons to maintain their proper spacing, and it promotes axon-target recognition at the temporary layer to enable R 8 axons to enter their correct <b>target</b> <b>columns</b> in the medulla. From detailed structure-function experiments, we propose that Gogo functions as a receptor that binds an unidentified ligand through its conserved extracellular domain...|$|R

40|$|Well-publicized {{intentional}} and accidental {{explosions in}} the last two decades have exposed the lack of resilience in structures triggering disproportionate failure. This has fuelled change in the civil engineering industry with government agencies leading the way. This research further contributes to the topic of blast resistant design with particular focus placed on the response of building structures subjected to external blasts. A software tool to assess the response of structure to blast loads is firstly presented. The proposed tool integrates a staged process and can broadly be broken down into three core modules: the blast load condition, the response of the target structural element(s), and frame stability in the event of a support being compromised. By automating this process, the resistance of a building can be investigated under a number of possible blast situations in quick succession. In addition, the application incorporates a design feature that sizes 2 D moment frames for wind and gravity loading, for the sole purpose of studying blasts on different frame strengths and geometries. The latter stages of the report demonstrate the capabilities of the tool by firstly proposing standard input metrics based on industry norm, and following on from this exploring the effects of each input through a parametric analysis. Example input parameters include blast weight, standoff distance, wind speed, number of bays & stories, <b>target</b> <b>column</b> location and element plastic limits. by Killian T. O'Leary.

40|$|The Orchidaceae is characterised by the {{repeated}} evolution of sexual deception, {{one of the}} most specialised pollination strategies. In orchids, sexual deception involves long-range pollinator attraction via mimicry of female insect sex pheromones. At close range, visual signals involving colour mimicry, contrast to the background, and exploitation of pollinator sensory biases could attract pollinators, but remain largely untested. Here we focus on a remarkable system in which species from two only distantly related sexually deceptive orchid genera with strikingly different flowers (Drakaea livida and three species of Caladenia) share the same pollinator, males of the thynnine wasp Zaspilothynnus nigripes. We used spectral reflectance measurements and modelling to investigate pollinator perception of colour, including the first examination of overall colour patterns in flowers via colour pattern geometry analyses. Rather than closely matching the colours of female Z. nigripes, these orchids had strong chromatic and achromatic contrast against their backgrounds. For Caladenia, the sepals and petals show high contrast, while in D. livida, which has diminutive petals and sepals, it is the labellum that contrasts strongly against the background. Despite varying in colour, the Caladenia species all had strong within-flower contrast between a UV-bright central <b>target</b> (<b>column</b> and labellum) and a corolla of radiating stripes (petals and sepals). The colour pattern geometry analyses also indicated that the orchids’ overall colour patterns are highly conspicuous against their backgrounds. Contrast, UV, and target patterns could all enhance detection, and exploit pollinators’ innate preferences. Since colour contrast may function with a range of colours and floral forms, attracting pollinators via contrast rather than visual mimicry may be a critical but previously overlooked process facilitating the evolution of sexual deception...|$|E

The <b>target</b> <b>columns</b> in this study were designed with static shear strength greater than the estimated lateral shear corresponding to the maximum moment capacity of the section.

Based on the damage observations and measured responses, conclusions were drawn on the role of the spiral reinforcement on the lateral displacement capacity of the columns tested with two different aspect ratios (a/D = 1. 5 and a/D = 2. 5). ^ The test results indicated that the columns with transverse reinforcement ratios meeting the minimum requirements for confinement in Chapter 21 of the ACI 318 - 05 and those with only 60 percent of the minimum code requirement were able to sustain the lateral shear corresponding to the moment capacity of the section up to a drift ratio of 3 % for the two aspect ratios investigated. ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{research}} on {{topics such as}} effective connectivity, neuronal coding strategy or signal propagation in the central nervous system requires simultaneous recordings from multiple sites within functionally grouped but topologically distributed neuronal clusters. We have addressed this issue by characterization of the cortical functional architecture using optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OI) and subsequent placement of multiple, individually adjustable electrodes into pre-selected domains. In order to achieve maximum precision and flexibility for the positioning of electrodes, a plastic cylinder containing channels of an extremely high aspect ratio (density > 20 channels/mm(2)) was fixed above the cortex and individual channel positions were superimposed onto the functional maps of orientation columns obtained previously with OI. Subsequently, channels corresponding to the desired locations in the functional map were used as guide tubes for electrode insertion. The spatial precision of this approach was in the range of 100 mum and experiments in cat primary visual cortex revealed a close correlation between the desired and the actually recorded orientation preferences of the <b>targeted</b> <b>columns.</b> The method is applicable to all cortical areas in which OI is feasible and offers a high degree of flexibility with respect to the number and geometry of applicable probes. It is, thus, an excellent tool for studying distributed codes and interactions between multiple predefined recording sites. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
