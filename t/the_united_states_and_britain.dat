5|$|The 1895 {{dispute between}} <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain</b> over Venezuela was peacefully {{resolved}} through arbitration. Both nations {{realized that a}} mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. American secretary of state Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat Julian Pauncefote. President William McKinley supported the treaty, as did most opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. The main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in which <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain</b> were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 Secretary of State Daniel Webster {{negotiated}} with Britain the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which determined {{the border between}} Maine and Canada.

Though the treaty improved Anglo-American diplomatic relations,, Tyler was nevertheless unsuccessful in concluding a treaty with the British to fix the boundaries of Oregon. On Tyler's last full day in office, March 3, 1845, Florida was admitted to the Union as the 27th state.|$|E

5|$|In {{the meeting}} Tecumseh warned Harrison {{that he would}} seek an {{alliance}} with the British if hostilities broke out. Tensions between <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>Britain</b> had been high for several months {{as a result of}} British interference in U.S. commerce with France.

5|$|In January 1896 the British Government {{decided in}} effect to {{recognise}} the US right {{to intervene in}} the boundary dispute, accepting arbitration in principle without insisting on the Schomburgk line as a basis for negotiation.

An agreement between the US and UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission's work was suspended in November 1896, though it still went on to produce a large report.|$|E

5|$|In September 1943, Italy capitulated {{and signed}} an Armistice with the Allies. Littorio was then renamed Italia.

In 1864, Sir Edwin Landseer's Man Proposes, God Disposes caused a stir at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on a tattered ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen at the time as in poor taste, but has remained {{one of the most powerful}} imaginings of the expedition's final fate.

The Japanese would have to surrender unconditionally to all the Allies. To prolong the war, the Soviets opposed any attempt to weaken this requirement. This would give the Soviets time to complete the transfer of their troops from the Western Front to the Far East, and conquer Manchuria (Manchukuo), Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang), Korea, South Sakhalin, the Kuriles, and possibly, Hokkaidō (starting with a landing at Rumoi).|$|E
