[...] This was the very secret {{connected}} with the magic fish-bone, which she had found out for herself from the good fairy Grandmarina's words, and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the Duchess.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may smile, Grizel," [...] Tommy would say, [...] "and {{now that}} I think of it, I can smile myself, {{but we are}} an eerie quartet at the time.

6000|$|... "No, it's {{the girl}} herself. She's not only {{beautiful}} in body, she's all sweetness and sincerity in mind. There isn't a petty thing about her. And her happy smile--do you know, I have times when I resent that smile? How can she {{be so happy}} without me? That's crazy, too, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it, sometimes. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>the</b> time when she will not smile--when that brute Belden will begin to treat her as he does his sisters--then I get murderous." ...|$|R

"And, to digress for a moment, {{especially}} {{as there are}} more of them in this state than there are Mormons, though you never can tell what will happen with this vain generation of young girls, that think more about wearing silk stockings than about minding their mothers and learning to bake a good loaf of bread, and many of them listening to these sneaking Mormon missionaries--and I actually heard one of them talking right out on a street-corner in Duluth, a few years ago, and the officers of the law not protesting--but still, as they are a smaller but more immediate problem, let me stop for just a moment to pay my respects to these Seventh-Day Adventists. Not that they are immoral, I don't mean, but when a body of men go on insisting that Saturday is the Sabbath, after Christ himself has clearly indicated the new dispensation, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> legislature ought to step in----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Very well, said I, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> riches {{and wealth}} of America {{is very well}} searched, in {{comparison}} to the number of people you have to search after it. No, says he, it is not, neither; for the greatest number of our people live in that part where the wealth is not the greatest, and where even the governor and viceroy, enjoying a plentiful and luxurious life, they take no thought for the increase either of the king's revenues, or the national wealth. This he spoke of the city of Mexico, whose greatness, and the number of its inhabitants, he said, was a disease {{to the rest of the}} body. And what, think you, seignior, said he, that in that one city, where there is neither silver nor gold but what is brought from the mountains of St. Clara, the mines at St. Augustine's and Our Lady, some of which are a hundred leagues from it, and yet there are more Spaniards in Mexico than in both those two prodigious empires of Chili and Peru? ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR MR. HALL,--I want {{to throw}} out a {{suggestion}} {{and see what you}} think of it. We have a good start, and solid ground under us; we have a valuable reputation; our business organization is practical, sound and well-devised; our publications are of a respect-worthy character and of a money-breeding species. Now <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> association with us of some one of great name and with capital would give our business a prodigious impetus--that phrase is not too strong.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was some}} talk once about Scotland," [...] said Theodora, [...] "but {{that was a}} long time ago. Many things have {{happened}} since <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Scotch visit is by any means so settled as you think." ...|$|R
30|$|If you {{get closer}} to this person, {{get to know the}} person and {{understand}} that this person has another cultural background [than the appearance suggests] because he or she has grown up in <b>the</b> Swedish culture, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> differences [in attitudes] should be bigger than shown here. But obviously the physical appearance remains; adoptees will still be judged by what they look like and where they were born, and so on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is scary, and I cannot understand this really.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{leaving this}} large and {{possibly}} contentious {{subject of the}} modifications which such new revelations must produce in Christianity, let us try to follow what occurs to man after death. The evidence on this point is fairly full and consistent. Messages from the dead have been received in many lands at various times, mixed {{up with a good}} deal about this world, which we could verify. When messages come thus, it is only fair, I think, to suppose that if what we can test is true, then what we cannot test is true also. When in addition we find a very great uniformity in the messages and an agreement as to details which are not at all in accordance with any pre-existing scheme of thought, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> presumption of truth is very strong. It is difficult to think that some fifteen or twenty messages from various sources of which I have personal notes, all agree, and yet are all wrong, nor is it easy to suppose that spirits can tell the truth about our world but untruth about their own.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have often}} amused myself, by fancying one {{question}} which an old Roman emperor would ask, were he {{to rise from}} his grave and visit the sights of London {{under the guidance of}} some minister of state. The august shade would, doubtless, admire our railroads and bridges, our cathedrals and our public parks, and much more of which we need not be ashamed. But after awhile, I think, he would look round, whether in London or in most of our great cities, inquiringly and in vain, for one class of buildings, which in his empire were wont to be almost as conspicuous and as splendid, because, in public opinion, almost as necessary, as the basilicas and temples: [...] "And where," [...] he would ask, [...] "are your public baths?" [...] And if the minister of state who was his guide should answer: [...] "Oh great Caesar, I really do not know. I believe there are some somewhere at the back of that ugly building which we call the National Gallery; and I think there have been some meetings lately in the East End, and an amateur concert at the Albert Hall, for restoring, by private subscriptions, some baths and wash-houses in Bethnal Green, which had fallen to decay. And there may be two or three more about the metropolis; for parish vestries have powers by Act of Parliament to establish such places, if they think fit, and choose to pay for them out of the rates." [...] <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> august shade might well make answer: [...] "We used to call you, in old Rome, northern barbarians. It seems that you have not lost all your barbarian habits. Are you aware that, in every city in the Roman empire, there were, as a matter of course, public baths open, not only to the poorest freeman, but to the slave, usually for the payment of the smallest current coin, and often gratuitously? Are you aware that in Rome itself, millionaire after millionaire, emperor after emperor, from Menenius Agrippa and Nero down to Diocletian and Constantine, built baths, and yet more baths; and connected with them gymnasia for exercise, lecture-rooms, libraries, and porticoes, wherein the people might have shade, and shelter, and rest? I remark, by-the-bye, that I have not seen in all your London a single covered place in which the people may take shelter during a shower. Are you aware that these baths were of the most magnificent architecture, decorated with marbles, paintings, sculptures, fountains, what not? And yet I had heard, in Hades down below, that you prided yourselves here on the study of the learned languages; and, indeed, taught little but Greek and Latin at your public schools?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Zionists {{of whose}} sincerity I am {{personally}} convinced, and of whose intelligence anybody would be convinced, {{have told me}} that there really is, in places like Rishon, something like a beginning of this spirit; the love of the peasant for his land. One lady, even in expressing her conviction of it, called it [...] "this very un-Jewish characteristic." [...] She was perfectly well aware both of the need of it in the Jewish land, and the lack of it in the Jewish race. In short she was well aware of the truth of that seemingly topsy-turvy test I have suggested; that of whether men are worthy to be drudges. When a humorous and humane Jew thus accepts the test, and honestly expects the Jewish people to pass it, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> claim is very serious indeed, and one not lightly to be set aside. I do certainly think it a very serious responsibility under the circumstances to set it altogether aside. It is our whole complaint against the Jew that he does not till the soil or toil with the spade; it is very hard on him to refuse him if he really says, [...] "Give me a soil and I will till it; give me a spade and I will use it." [...] It is our whole reason for distrusting him that he cannot really love any of the lands in which he wanders; it seems rather indefensible to be deaf to him if he really says, [...] "Give me a land and I will love it." [...] I would certainly give him a land or some instalment of the land, (in what general sense I will try to suggest a little later) so long as his conduct on it was watched and tested according to the principles I have suggested. If he asks for the spade he must use the spade, and not merely employ the spade, in the sense of hiring half a hundred men to use spades. If he asks for the soil he must till the soil; that is he must belong to the soil and not merely make the soil belong to him. He must have the simplicity, and what many would call the stupidity of the peasant. He must not only call a spade a spade, but regard it as a spade and not as a speculation. By some true conversion the urban and modern man must be not only on the soil, but of the soil, and free from our urban trick of inventing the word dirt for the dust to which we shall return. He must be washed in mud, that he may be clean.|$|E

6000|$|For {{a moment}} {{they were both}} serious and silent. Then she said: [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> fault is all in myself, and that if I were not so {{sophisticated}} and--and--selfish, I should find {{the old way of}} doing good just as effective and natural as ever. <b>Then</b> again, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> conditions are all wrong, and {{that we ought to be}} fairer to people, and then we needn't be so good to them. I should prefer that. I hate being good to people I don't like, and I can't like people who don't interest me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> must be very hard-hearted." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked whether}} he see himself as a [...] "Muslim Zionist", he replied: [...] "If one means a Muslim who {{supports}} {{the right of the}} Jewish people to have their own independent and sovereign State, who is solidly behind the State of Israel when it is attacked by terror and when its existence in menaced, who thinks that developing friendly relations between the Muslim nations and the State of Israel {{is in the interest of}} the Muslims and of human civilization in general, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> label of Muslim Zionist is appropriate.|$|R
60|$|But again, these {{officials}} {{would have no}} sinecure. Crime would perhaps be less, {{for some of the}} motives of crime we may suppose would pass away. But if Socialism were carried out with any fulness, there would be more contraventions. We see already new sins ringing up like mustard—School Board sins, factory sins, Merchant Shipping Act sins—none of which I would be thought to except against in particular, but all of which, taken together, show us that Socialism can be a hard master even in the beginning. If it go on to such heights as we hear proposed and lauded, if it come actually to its ideal of the ant-heap, ruled with iron justice, the number of new contraventions will be out of all proportion multiplied. Take the case of work alone. Man is an idle animal. He is at least as intelligent as the ant; but generations of advisers have in vain recommended him the ant’s example. Of those who are found truly indefatigable in business, some are misers; some are the practisers of delightful industries, like gardening; some are students, artists, inventors, or discoverers, men lured forward by successive hopes; and the rest are those who live by games of skill or hazard—financiers, billiard-players, gamblers, and the like. But in unloved toils, even under the prick of necessity, no man is continually sedulous. Once eliminate the fear of starvation, once eliminate or bound the hope of riches, and we shall see plenty of skulking and malingering. Society will then be something not wholly unlike a cotton plantation in the old days; with cheerful, careless, demoralised slaves, with elected overseers, and, instead of the planter, a chaotic popular assembly. If the blood be purposeful and the soil strong, such a plantation may succeed, and be, indeed, a busy ant-heap, with full granaries and long hours of leisure. But even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> whip will be in the overseer’s hands, and not in vain. For, when it comes to be a question of each man doing his own share or the rest doing more, prettiness of sentiment will be forgotten. To dock the skulker’s food is not enough; many will rather eat haws and starve on petty pilferings than put their shoulder to the wheel for one hour daily. For such as these, then, the whip will be in the overseer’s hand; and his own sense of justice and the superintendence of a chaotic popular assembly will be the only checks on its employment. Now, you may be an industrious man and a good citizen, and yet not love, nor yet be loved by, Dr. Fell the inspector. It is admitted by private soldiers that the disfavour of a sergeant is an evil not to be combated; offend the sergeant, they say, and in a brief while you will either be disgraced or have deserted. And the sergeant can no longer appeal to the lash. But if these things go on, we shall see, or our sons shall see, what it is to have offended an inspector.|$|E
6000|$|The {{great point}} {{remained}} {{for me at}} all events that I could afterwards appear to myself to have done nothing but establish with him a relation, that I established it, to my imagination, in several cases--and all in {{the three or four}} hours--even to the pitch of the last tenderness of friendship. I recover that, strolling about with honest and so superior fellow-citizens, or sitting with them by the improvised couches of their languid rest, I drew from each his troubled tale, listened to his plaint on his special hard case--taking form, this, in what seemed to me the very poetry of the esoteric vernacular--and sealed the beautiful tie, the responsive sympathy, by an earnest offer, in no instance waved away, of such pecuniary solace as I might at brief notice draw on my poor pocket for. Yet again, as I indulge this memory, do I feel that I might if pushed a little rejoice in having to such an extent coincided with, not to say perhaps positively anticipated, dear old Walt--even if I hadn't come armed like him with oranges and peppermints. I ministered much more summarily, though possibly in proportion to the time and thanks to my better luck more pecuniarily; but I like to treat myself to making out that I can scarce have brought to the occasion (in proportion to the time again and to other elements of the case) less of the consecrating sentiment than he. I like further to put it in a light that, ever so curiously, if the good Walt was most inwardly stirred to his later commemorative accents by his participating in the common Americanism of his hospital friends, the familiar note and shared sound of which formed its ground of appeal, I found myself victim to a like moving force through quite another logic. It was literally, I fear, because our common Americanism carried with it, to my imagination, such a disclosed freshness and strangeness, working, as I might say, over such gulfs of dissociation, that I reached across to their, these hospital friends', side of the matter, even at the risk of an imperilled consistency. It had for me, the state in question, colour and form, accent and quality, with scarce less [...] "authority" [...] than if instead of the rough tracks or worn paths of my casual labyrinth I had trod the glazed halls of some school of natural history. What holds me now indeed is that such an institution might have exemplified then almost nothing but the aspects strictly native to our social and seasonal air; so simply and easily conceivable to the kindly mind were at that time these reciprocities, so great the freedom and pleasure of them compared with the restrictions imposed on directness of sympathy by the awful admixtures of to-day, those which offer to the would-be participant among us, on returns from sojourns wherever homogeneity and its entailed fraternity, its easy contacts, still may be seen to work, the strange shock of such amenities declined on any terms. Really not possible <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> perception now accompanying, on American ground, this shock--the recognition, by any sensibility at all reflective, of the point where our national theory of absorption, assimilation and conversion appallingly breaks down; appallingly, that is, for those to whom the consecrated association, of the sort still at play where community has not been blighted, strongly speaks. Which remarks may reinforce the note of my unconsciousness of any difficulty for knowing in the old, the comparatively brothering, conditions what an American at least was. Absurd thus, no doubt, that the scant experience over which I perversely linger insists on figuring to me as quite a revel of the right confidence.|$|E
