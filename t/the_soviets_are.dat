The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and Venona documentation released {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union.|$|E

In the novel, the real-life {{destruction of the}} fighter is a cover for a secret US-Canadian continental air-defense initiative that fields a fleet of Arrows. A Polish-Canadian RCAF pilot flies one Arrow on a high-speed reconnaissance flight over Russia to find proof that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> planning an airstrike on North America.|$|E

When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> allies {{working for the}} same goals, and threatens to retaliate by {{disclosing}} Turing’s homosexuality if his role as an agent is revealed. When the MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already, and planted Cairncross among {{them in order to}} leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay and lying about never having cared for her. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.|$|E
500|$|When, in September 1943, Joseph Goebbels was {{informed}} that the German army had {{to withdraw from the}} Katyn area, he wrote a prediction in his diary. His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: [...] "Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite a little trouble in the future. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> undoubtedly going to make it their business to discover as many mass graves as possible and then blame it on us".|$|E
500|$|From Russia, with Love {{is one of}} the few {{stories by}} Fleming in which <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> the main enemy, {{although}} Eco considers Bond's Russian opponents [...] "so monstrous, so improbably evil that it seems impossible to take them seriously". Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes. Eco—and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels—consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a [...] "sexually neuter" [...] individual. Red Grant was Fleming's first [...] "psychotic opponent" [...] for Bond, according to Benson. Charlie Higson—who later wrote the Young Bond series—finds Grant to be [...] "a very modern villain: the relentless, remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a 'drowned man'." ...|$|E

He is then stationed to Intentions, an intelligence unit who is tasked to assess intentions of the Soviets, {{under the command of}} Marine Colonel Chuck Lowe, who supports Toland's conclusions.

2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{strategic}} planning, Brown shared {{much the same}} concerns as his Republican predecessors—the need to upgrade U.S. military forces and improve collective security arrangements—but with a stronger commitment to arms control. Brown adhered {{to the principle of}} [...] "essential equivalence" [...] in the nuclear competition with the Soviet Union. This meant that [...] "Soviet strategic nuclear forces do not become usable instruments of political leverage, diplomatic coercion, or military advantage; nuclear stability, especially in a crisis, is maintained; any advantages in force characteristics enjoyed by <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> offset by U.S. advantages in other characteristics; and the U.S. posture is not in fact, and is not seen as, inferior in performance to the strategic nuclear forces of the Soviet Union." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{most of the}} Soviet gains {{listed above}} were matched by the United States within a year, and {{sometimes}} within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful space rendezvous), which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>are</b> not as impressive as they seem; {{that a number of}} these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, e.g., the first woman in space. In fact, {{by the time of the}} launch of the first manned Earth-orbiting Apollo flight (Apollo 7), the USSR had made only nine spaceflights (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970, and refer to individual flights for the length of time.) ...|$|E

25|$|Like <b>the</b> Germans, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> {{influenced}} by experience showing most combat happens within 400 meters {{and that their}} soldiers were consistently outgunned by heavily armed German troops, especially those armed with the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifles. On July 15, 1943, a Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People's Commissariat of Arms of <b>the</b> USSR. <b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>were</b> so impressed with the Sturmgewehr, that they immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber automatic rifle of their own, to replace the badly outdated Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifles and PPSh-41 submachine guns that armed most of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Army.|$|R
