The series ran on the ABC network from March 18, 2009, to January 26, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Not doing {{anything}} creative is nearly killing me. <b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> {{is that there}} is no one near me who cares whether I ever do any more work or not... I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the other}} packs, <b>The</b> <b>Trouble</b> with Clones {{contained}} about an hour of gameplay.

5|$|There was mayhem {{outside the}} court {{premises}} with large crowds gathering around restively and camera crews waiting to capture <b>the</b> <b>trouble.</b> In some places, buses, taxis and autorickshaws were set on fire, in others areas public transport just stayed off the roads.

5|$|Although Cryer gained fame {{with his}} early film roles, {{it took several}} years to find success on television; none of his star vehicles, {{including}} The Famous Teddy Z, Partners, and <b>The</b> <b>Trouble</b> with Normal, lasted more than 22 episodes. In 2003, Cryer was cast as Alan Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009 and 2012. Cryer received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is well worth <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by one of our best science journalists.|$|E

5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. <b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth <b>the</b> <b>trouble,</b> and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E

He portrays a {{soon to be}} retired high school history teacher and ex-Special Forces soldier Sam Decker who has one last detention to proctor; he must band together <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> makers and misfits in detention to defeat a drug ring intent on taking over the school.|$|E

5|$|The state {{government}} {{have tried to}} proposed a new ferry terminal in the town to attract more tourist particularly from the Philippines and also from Indonesia. But the proposal was turned down due to <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> in the southern Philippines which could spread {{to the state and}} there is a call from the former Chief Minister of Sabah and the Current President of Sabah Progressive Party Yong Teck Lee to suspend the ferry service to counter the high level of people migration from the Philippines which now has become the major problem to Sabah as they are overstaying in the state and becoming an illegal immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Total drew {{attention}} to the unexplained absence from his post of the Gulf employee whose duty it was to supervise the unloading from the on-shore control room.

Exactly what happened that night has never been established beyond doubt.|$|E

5|$|Usually {{reports were}} issued on any {{incident}} with every aircraft. On the date McCudden died, 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s {{but the report}} pertaining to his accident is not among them leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained. It is possible the engine failed due to a wrongly installed carburettor. However, there is some doubt as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit. The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low-level stunts, manifesting in several turns and rolls. Many years later other witnesses disputed the aircraft performed a roll, but all agreed <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> began when the machine entered an attitude resembling a near-vertical turn.|$|E
5|$|When the {{convention}} concluded, Ross returned home {{and spent the}} next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for Texas State Senator from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no one asked Ross whether he wanted to run for office, the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> and expense of another convention.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} parlour, Rose wakes up {{along with the}} newly-reanimated corpses of Mrs. Peace and Mr. Redpath.

After hearing about <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift that exists {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{positive}} reception accorded to L'Arianna at its premiere, the duke did not request a second showing, {{as he had}} with L'Orfeo the previous year". The next hint of a performance of L'Arianna is in 1614, when the Medici court in Florence requested {{a copy of the}} score, presumably with the intention of staging it. There is, however, no record of any such performance there. Early in 1620 Striggio asked Monteverdi to send him the music for a projected performance in Mantua as part of the celebration for the Duchess Caterina's birthday. Monteverdi went to <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> and expense of preparing a new manuscript with revisions; had he had more time, he informed Striggio, he would have revised the work more thoroughly. Hearing nothing further from the Mantuan court, Monteverdi wrote to Striggio on 18 April 1620, offering to help with the staging. A month or so later, however, he learned that the duchess's celebrations had been scaled back, and that there had been no performance of L'Arianna.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this and the report of a committee investigating {{the slow pace of}} the Court of Chancery, the Judicature Commission was formed in 1867, and given a wide remit to investigate reform of the courts, the law, and the legal profession. Five reports were issued, from 25 March 1869 to 10 July 1874, with the first (dealing with the formation of a single Supreme Court of Judicature) considered the most influential. The report disposed of the previous idea of merging the common law and equity, and instead suggested a single Supreme Court capable of using both. In 1870 the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherly, attempted to bring the recommendations into law through an Act of Parliament, but did not go to <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> of consulting the judiciary or the leader of the Conservatives, who controlled the House of Lords. The bill ran into strong opposition from lawyers and judges, particularly Alexander Cockburn. After Hatherly was replaced by Lord Selborne in September 1872, a second bill was introduced after consultation with the judiciary; although along the same lines, it was far more detailed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1851, Tubman {{returned}} to Dorchester County {{for the first time}} since her escape, this time to find her husband, John. She once again saved money from various jobs, purchased a suit for him, and made her way south. John, meanwhile, had married another woman named Caroline. Tubman sent word that he should join her, but he insisted that he was happy where he was. Tubman at first prepared to storm their house and make a scene, but then decided he was not worth <b>the</b> <b>trouble.</b> Suppressing her anger, she found some slaves who wanted to escape and led them to Philadelphia. John and Caroline raised a family together, until he was killed 16 years later in a roadside argument with a white man named Robert Vincent.|$|E
