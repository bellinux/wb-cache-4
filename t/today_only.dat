5|$|Methodism was a {{significant}} influence in 19th-century Stretford, but of the seventeen churches in the town <b>today,</b> <b>only</b> one is Methodist whereas five are Roman Catholic. The Catholic mission in Stretford was begun in 1859, in a small chapel on Herbert Street.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} tag team {{championship}} in November 2006, the team disbanded, with Kenny {{the only member}} to appear on WWE television regularly. Nicky, Mikey and Johnny returned to OVW, where Mikey and Nicky formed a tag team, and Mitch was released from his WWE contract in May 2007. <b>Today,</b> <b>only</b> Nicky has been continually signed since their breakup, wrestling under the name Dolph Ziggler. Right now, Kenny and Mikey wrestle on the independent circuit.|$|E

5|$|Built between 946 and 972, el-Mansuriya was a walled city holding {{elaborate}} palaces {{surrounded by}} gardens, artificial pools and water channels. It was briefly {{the centre of}} a powerful state that encompassed most of North Africa and Sicily. It continued to serve as provincial capital of the Zirids until 1057, when it was destroyed by the invading Banu Hilal tribes. Any useful objects or relics were scavenged during the centuries that followed. <b>Today,</b> <b>only</b> faint traces remain.|$|E
5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} {{the abandonment of}} villages from the bubonic plague of 1348, the Black Death, which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the Breckland of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as Leicestershire were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in Gloucestershire can be seen <b>today</b> <b>only</b> as a ground-plan from the air.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} classify the Gospel of the Hebrews {{as one of}} {{the three}} Jewish–Christian gospels, along with the Gospel of the Nazarenes and the Gospel of the Ebionites. Others suggest that these three titles may have been referring to one and the same book. All are known <b>today</b> <b>only</b> from fragments preserved in quotations by the early Church Fathers. The relationship between the Jewish–Christian gospels and a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel remains a speculation.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{more than}} 1000 stave churches {{were built in}} Norway during the Middle Ages, most of them during the 12th and 13th centuries. Until the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, as many as 150 stave churches still existed. Many were destroyed as part of a religious movement that favored simple, puritan lines, and <b>today</b> <b>only</b> 28 remain, though a large number were documented and recorded by measured drawings before they were demolished.|$|E
5|$|Radyr {{hawkweed}} is {{the common}} name of Hieracium radyrense, a very rare endemic member of the aster, daisy, or sunflower family. It is a microspecies, so far only identified at Radyr. It was first identified in 1907 at the quarry, {{was described as a}} variety in 1948 and then as a separate species in 1955. It has rarely been seen and regular surveys between 1998 and 2004 indicate that <b>today</b> <b>only</b> a single population of about 25 plants survives in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Taman Sari {{consisted}} of four distinct areas: a large artificial lake with islands and pavilions {{located in the}} west, a bathing complex in the centre, a complex of pavilions and pools in the south, and a smaller lake in the east. <b>Today</b> <b>only</b> the central bathing complex is well preserved, while the other areas have been largely occupied by the Kampung Taman settlement.|$|E

5|$|The Amazon river dolphin has {{historically}} been kept in dolphinariums. <b>Today,</b> <b>only</b> three exist in captivity: one in Acuario de Valencia in Venezuela, one in Zoologico de Guistochoca in Peru, and one in Duisburg Zoo in Germany. Several hundred were captured between the 1950s and 1970s, and were distributed in dolphinariums throughout the US, Europe, and Japan. Around 100 went to US dolphinariums, and of that, only 20 survived; the last (named Chuckles) died in Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The caliph Al-Mu'izz {{moved from}} {{the city to the}} new city of al-Qāhira (Cairo) in 973, but Al-Mansuriya {{continued}} to serve as the provincial capital.

5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. <b>Today</b> <b>only</b> a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see it closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, Darius {{sponsored}} large {{construction projects}} in Susa, Babylon, Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius {{built a new}} palace complex {{in the north of}} the city. An inscription states that the palace was destroyed during the reign of Artaxerxes I, but was rebuilt. <b>Today</b> <b>only</b> glazed bricks of the palace remain, the majority of them in the Louvre. In Pasargadae Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of Cyrus the Great. A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, the palace {{is believed to have been}} constructed by Darius.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the dodo was {{assigned}} the genus Didus, now a junior synonym of Raphus. In 1848, {{a new species}} within the now defunct genus Didus, D. nazarenus, was named by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville. To house their new species, {{as well as the}} other species known at the time, Strickland and Melville named the subfamily Didinae. In 1893 three species were assigned to the group Pezophaps solitarius, Didus ineptus, and the possible species Didus borbonicus. <b>Today,</b> <b>only</b> two raphine species are known, with Didus ineptus becoming a junior subjective synonym of Raphus cucullatus; Didus? borbonicus now classified as the ibis Threskiornis solitarius; and Didus nazarenus being identified as synonymous with Pezophaps solitarius.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006-2007 school year, 964 {{students}} attended North. North's minority enrollment {{has grown}} in {{the last twenty years}} despite attempts to keep it low. In 1987 North's minority enrollment was 46%. Minority enrollment continued to grow, becoming over 60% in 1991. <b>Today,</b> <b>only</b> three percent of students are white, with the majority of students, 69%, being black.

These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; <b>today</b> <b>only</b> two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E
5|$|Longford Park was {{the home}} of John Rylands, industrialist, philanthropist, and Manchester's first multi-millionaire, from 1855 {{until his death in}} 1888 and of his widow Enriqueta Augustina Rylands until her death in 1908. The house Rylands {{constructed}} in the park in 1857, Longford Hall, was demolished in 1995. It replaced an earlier house of the same name that had been the residence of Thomas Walker (died 1817) and subsequently of his sons Thomas (died 1836) and Charles. <b>Today</b> <b>only</b> the front porch, coach house, and the stable buildings remain. The estate and hall were sold to Stretford Council in 1911 after a poll of ratepayers, and the park was opened to the public the following year.|$|E
5|$|Other early {{versions}} of the charters survive <b>today.</b> <b>Only</b> one exemplification of the 1216 charter survives, held in Durham Cathedral. Four copies of the 1217 charter exist; three of these are held by the Bodleian Library in Oxford and one by Hereford Cathedral. Hereford's copy is occasionally displayed alongside the Mappa Mundi in the cathedral's chained library and has survived along with a small document called the Articuli super Cartas that was sent along with the charter, telling the sheriff of the county how to observe the conditions outlined in the document. One of the Bodleian's copies was displayed at San Francisco's California Palace of the Legion of Honor in 2011.|$|E
