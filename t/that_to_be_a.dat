5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Cockney, {{one had to}} be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside.

In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E

25|$|A {{tradition}} {{reported by}} Ishtori Haparchi (1280–1355) and other early Jewish writers is that Ramla was the biblical Gath of the Philistines. Initial archaeological claims {{seemed to indicate}} that Ramla was not built {{on the site of}} an ancient city, although in recent years the ruins of an old city site were uncovered on the southern outskirts of Ramla. Earlier, Mazar had proposed that ancient Gath lay at a site Ras Abu Hamid east of Ramla. Avi-Yonah, however, considered <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> different Gath, usually now called Gath-Gittaim. This view is also supported by other scholars, those holding that there was, both, a Geth (believed to be Tell es-Safi) and Gath-Rimmon (in or near Ramla).|$|E

500|$|Morchella populiphila is {{a species}} of morel fungus (family Morchellaceae) native to northwestern North America. Described as new to science in 2012, its {{specific}} epithet refers to its association with black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). The morel used {{to be referred to}} as Morchella semilibera in western North American field guides until molecular analysis established <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strictly European species. M.populiphila occurs in California, Nevada and Oregon. Its fruit bodies grow up to [...] tall with a ridged and pitted conical cap that attaches about halfway down the stipe.

It was previously referred to as phylogenetic species Mel-5 (i.e., identified based on DNA sequence) in a 2011 publication. The specific epithet populiphila refers to its association with the tree species Populus trichocarpa.|$|E

In describing Motoko as a [...] "shapely" [...] and [...] "strong [...] {{at the center of the}} story" [...] who is [...] "nevertheless almost continuously nude", Roger Ebert noted that [...] "an article about anime in a recent issue of Film Quarterly suggests <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 'salary man' in modern Japan is so exhausting and dehumanizing that many men (who form the largest part of the animation audience) project both freedom and power onto women, and identify with them as fictional characters".

On coming ashore, the Malagasy reached a farm belonging to Dutchman Matthijs Rostok and discovered {{that they had been}} deceived by the ship's crew. Local officials had ordered local Dutch farmers and burghers to form an impromptu militia; some of the Malagasy were shot dead and some were imprisoned at Wessels Wesselsen's property close by. On 27February a local official named Hentz wrote a letter describing events to Johannes Le Sueur, the VOC magistrate for Stellenbosch, about [...] to the north-west. Two days later Le Sueur arrived in Soetendaal's Valleij, a little more than [...] north-west of Struisbaai, and [...] "installed himself" [...] in the home of farmer Barend Geldenhuijs. Le Sueur then went to Wesselsen's property, where he interrogated eighteen male Malagasy in an attempt to assess the situation on board Meermin. On 3March he went from there to Matthijs Rostok's farm and began corresponding with the VOC's Cape Colony government, based in what is now the city of Cape Town. A crew member who had come ashore with the Malagasy and subsequently escaped was taken to Le Sueur, who sent him to report in person to the authorities at Cape Town. Meanwhile, local farmers and burghers were recapturing Malagasy in small groups. The authorities at Cape Town sent two hoekers, Neptunus and Snelheid, with a party of soldiers under two corporals and a sergeant, to assist in retaking Meermin, but the ships did not arrive until the action was over.|$|E
