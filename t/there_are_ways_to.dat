25|$|The light-front coupled cluster (LFCC) {{method is}} a {{particular}} form of truncation for the infinite coupled system of integral equations for light-front wave functions. The system of equations {{that comes from the}} field-theoretic Schrödinger equation also requires regularization, to make the integral operators finite. The traditional Fock-space truncation of the system, where the allowed number of particles is limited, typically disrupts the regularization by removing infinite parts that would otherwise cancel against parts that are retained. Although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> circumvent this, they are not completely satisfactory.|$|E

25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple {{way to do this is}} to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement along the length of the tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E
25|$|IOPS {{performance}} of a ZFS storage pool can suffer if the ZFS raid is not appropriately configured. This applies to all types of RAID, {{in one way or}} another. If the zpool consists of only one group of disks configured as, say, eight disks in RAIDZ2, then the IOPS performance will be that of a single disk (write speed will be equivalent to 6 disks, but random read speed will be similar to a single disk). However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> mitigate this IOPS performance problem, for instance add SSDs as L2ARC cache— which can boost IOPS into 100.000s. In short, a zpool should consist of several groups of vdevs, each vdev consisting of 8–12 disks, if using RAIDZ. It is not recommended to create a zpool with a single large vdev, say 20 disks, because IOPS performance will be that of a single disk, which also means that resilver time will be very long (possibly weeks with future large drives).|$|E

2500|$|While the Cell chip {{can have}} a number of {{different}} configurations, the basic configuration is a multi-core chip composed of one [...] "Power Processor Element" [...] ("PPE") (sometimes called [...] "Processing Element", or [...] "PE"), and multiple [...] "Synergistic Processing Elements" [...] ("SPE"). The PPE and SPEs are linked together by an internal high speed bus dubbed [...] "Element Interconnect Bus" [...] ("EIB"). Due to the nature of its applications, Cell is optimized towards single precision floating point computation. The SPEs are capable of performing double precision calculations, albeit with an order of magnitude performance penalty. [...] New chips expected mid-2008 are rumored to boost SPE double precision performance as high as 5x over pre-2008 designs.

However, {{for people who do}} not want device fingerprinting, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> attempt to block fingerprinting. The only ways to stop device fingerprinting cause web browsing to be very slow and websites to display information incorrectly. “There are not convenient options for privacy when it comes to device fingerprinting” said Peter Eckersely a staff scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and privacy-advocacy group. [...] Trying to avoid device fingerprinting is mostly just impractical and inconvenient. Fingerprints are tough to avoid because they are taken from data that are routinely passed from computers to websites automatically. Even if someone changes something slightly, the fingerprinters can still recognize the machine. There is one way to figure out that a device is being fingerprinted. The software JavaScript can be used to collect fingerprinting data. If it asks a browser for specific information, that could be a clue that a fingerprinter is working. Companies that are most known for conducting fingerprinting are advertisers.|$|E

60|$|I doubt not, nevertheless, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{be found}} to assist our reason in this most useful part; and this the judicious Hooker {{encourages}} me to say, who in his Eccl.

I do not pretend to have found or discovered here any of those 'right helps of art,' this great man of deep thought mentions: but that is plain, that syllogism, and the logic now in use, which were as well known in his days, can be none of those he means. It is sufficient for me, if by a Discourse, perhaps something out of the way, I am sure, as to me, wholly new and unborrowed, I shall have given occasion to others to cast about for new discoveries, and to seek in their own thoughts for those right helps of art, which will scarce be found, I fear, by those who servilely confine themselves to the rules and dictates of others. For beaten tracks lead this sort of cattle, (as an observing Roman calls them,) whose thoughts reach only to imitation, NON QUO EUNDUM EST, SED QUO ITUR. But I can be bold to say, that this age is adorned with some men of that strength of judgment and largeness of comprehension, that, if they would employ their thoughts on this subject, could open new and undiscovered ways to the advancement of knowledge.|$|E
