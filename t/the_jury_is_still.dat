The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90. Couturat's reading {{of this paper was}} the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among analytic philosophers. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> out.|$|E

[...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details.

[...] The Evening Standard said some people would see the display of the painting as revenge against Serota, after he had rejected the Stuckists' offer to donate work to the Tate; it also mentioned that the Stuckists had first drawn attention to the Tate's purchase of The Upper Room by Chris Ofili, a Tate trustee, which had led to the Tate being censured by the Charity Commission in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The court {{established}} {{that in fact}} the due process clause of the 5th and 14th amendments prohibits the shackling of a defendant during the sentencing phase of a trial. The court made this determination by looking at important facts or legal standards. The court noted that shackling a defendant undermines the presumption of innocence, since shackling tells jurors that the person being shackled is dangerous {{and needs to be}} restrained. Breyer also noted that shackling a defendant hurts his ability to interact with his attorneys, and prevents a defendant from taking the witness stand. The principle of court dignity also came up in the opinion of the court. The court stated, “The routine use of shackles in the presence of juries would undermine these symbolic yet concrete objectives.” [...] By making these conclusions about shackling a defendant, the court ruled “the considerations that militate against the routine use of visible shackles during the guilt phase of a criminal trial apply with like force to penalty proceedings in capital cases.” This deals with the fact the in these cases, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> deciding between life and death and that this is a decision of equal importance compared to the question of innocence and guilt. The decision of life or death in the sentencing phase is serious which requires reliable sentencing. According to Justice Breyer, the court has “stressed the ‘acute need’ for reliable decision making when the death penalty is at issue.” [...] Breyer stated that in Deck’s case his right to reliable sentencing was infringed upon (a right derived from the Eight Amendment).|$|E

5000|$|In late 2013 and {{the first}} half of 2014, Saunders was the judge in charge of the {{high-profile}} 'hacking trial' that arose out of the News International phone hacking scandal. At the start of the trial, Saunders noted that [...] "The defendants are on trial but British justice is also on trial", and cautioned against the significant comment on the case that had been made online: [...] "There has {{been a great deal of}} publicity about this case, perhaps an unprecedented amount. The internet is generally not controlled and often fuelled by opinion and speculation, a great deal of information is imparted and received by people through Facebook and Twitter. A significant amount of publicity has been inaccurate and misleading... offensive and demeaning to some of the defendants. A lot is ill-informed and most of it is abusive".Towards the end of the trial, Saunders issued a public request for public figures, in particular politicians, to avoid commenting on the trial until it had reached its conclusion. His intervention came after Prime Minister David Cameron had issued a public apology for employing Andy Coulson as his director of communications following his being found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones, but while <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> considering other verdicts against Coulson and other defendants.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{derivation}} of <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> system from <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> of Henry II. To this end, a short history of English law {{and the history of}} the development of <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> given. <b>The</b> method of <b>the</b> English <b>jury's</b> development <b>is</b> used to show the evolution of <b>the</b> early American <b>jury</b> into <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> of today. <b>The</b> American <b>jury</b> still resembles <b>the</b> English <b>jury</b> from which it evolved. The American system has a grand jury to indict criminals and a petit <b>jury</b> to try <b>the</b> case. The practice of taking an oath was begun by the English jurors and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in practice in American today as well as the challenging of potential jurors for bias. The American system differs from <b>the</b> <b>juries</b> of old in its inability to determine matters of law and in its move away from unanimity in verdicts and <b>the</b> twelve-man <b>jury.</b> Some of <b>the</b> aspects of <b>the</b> historical English <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in use in <b>the</b> American <b>jury</b> system of today, but some differences have been created through case law and legislation.

5000|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion of the Court. Florida's capital sentencing scheme, requiring that a judge instead of a <b>jury</b> to make <b>the</b> critical findings necessary to impose the death penalty, violated the Sixth Amendment in light of Ring v. Arizona. The Court also rejected Florida's counterarguments. Firstly, Florida argued that <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> recommendation necessarily included an aggravating circumstance finding but still violated Ring because <b>the</b> <b>jury's</b> function <b>was</b> <b>still</b> advisory only. Secondly, Florida's reliance on Blakely v. Washington is misplaced: Florida alleges that Hurst's counsel allegedly admitted {{the existence of a}} robbery, but Blakely applied Apprendi v. New Jersey to facts admitted in a guilty plea, in which the defendant necessarily waived his right to a jury trial, but Florida had not explained how Hurst's alleged admissions accomplished a similar waiver. In any event, Hurst never admitted to either aggravating circumstance alleged. Thirdly, although the Court had repeatedly upheld Florida's capital sentencing scheme in the past (such as Hildwin v. Florida and Spaziano v. Florida), it did not mean that stare decisis compelled the Court to do so again. Instead, time and subsequent cases had [...] "washed away" [...] the logic of Spaziano and Hildwin. Finally, the Court normally leaves it to state courts to consider whether an error is harmless.|$|R
