5|$|After {{just over}} a year in office, Cook was forced to call a new election, the first double dissolution.

He struggled with the demands of Australia's participation in World War I, and in October 1915 resigned in favour of Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66.

Seeadler and Condor, meanwhile, had been converted into mine storage hulks after the start of the war. Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. Condor was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class to survive the war, and she was scrapped in 1921.|$|E
