25|$|While carrier {{females are}} {{generally}} an asymptomatic condition, they do experience {{an increase in}} uric acid excretion, and some may develop symptoms of hyperuricemia, and suffer from gout in their later years. Testing in this context has no clinical consequence, but it may reveal the possibility of transmitting the trait to male children. Women may also require testing if a male child develops LNS. In this instance, a negative <b>test</b> <b>means</b> the son's disease {{is the result of}} a new mutation, and the risk in siblings is not increased.|$|E

A positive result is not considered a diagnosis, since it may be obtained decades before the symptoms begin. However, a negative <b>test</b> <b>means</b> that the individual does not carry the expanded copy of the gene and will not develop HD. The test will tell a person who originally had a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease if their risk goes up to 100 percent or is eliminated. A person who tests positive for the disease will develop HD sometime within their lifetime, provided he or she lives {{long enough for the}} disease to appear.|$|E

In my view, a person's alleged [...] "predisposition" [...] to crime should not expose him to government participation in the criminal transaction that would be otherwise unlawful.|$|E

2500|$|This test {{measures}} {{the changes in}} body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld to induce dehydration. [...] The body's normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. [...] Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In primary polydipsia, the urine osmolality should increase and stabilize at above 280 Osm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus. Stabilization in this <b>test</b> <b>means,</b> more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour {{for at least three}} hours. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time consuming to perform.|$|E
2500|$|Once it is {{established}} that a dismissal took place, the employer must show that its reason for dismissing the employee was [...] "fair". Dismissal {{on grounds of}} union membership, or {{one of a number}} of grounds set out in sections 99 to 107 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, will be automatically unfair. Otherwise the employer has the opportunity to show the dismissal is fair if it falls within five main categories listed in ERA 1996 section 98. The dismissal must have been because of the employee's capability or qualifications, because of conduct, because the employee was redundant, because continued employment would contravene a law, or because of [...] "some other substantial reason". If the employer has an argument based on one of these categories, then the tribunal evaluates whether the employer's actual decision fell within a [...] "reasonable range of responses", i.e. that a reasonable employer could have acted the same way. Thus the review standard lies in between an outright perversity, or [...] "Wednesbury unreasonableness" [...] test and a forthright reasonable person test. The test arguably requires Tribunals to evaluate the employer's conduct according to good enterprise practice, by analogy to the Bolam test in tort. The [...] "proportionality test" [...] (requiring the employer's action is appropriate, necessary and reasonable in pursuit of a legitimate aim) has also been proposed as an alternative, which would have the advantage of deferring to the employer's aim, if legitimate, but scrutinising whether its actions were proportionate. In practice, the Court of Appeal has given conflicting judgments and remains unable to articulate what the <b>test</b> <b>means,</b> begging the question of how a [...] "hypothetical reasonable employer" [...] standard under section 98(4)(a) should actually be applied. It has been repeated that Tribunals should not substitute their judgment for the employer's. However, there is considerable room for Tribunals to assess the facts and come to their own conclusions, which can only be appealed on legal grounds, and not on their judgment of good workplace relations. For example, in a conduct case, HSBC Bank plc v Madden, the Court of Appeal held that it was acceptable for a Tribunal to have decided that dismissing an employee for potential involvement in theft of credit cards was fair, even though an actual police investigation turned up no evidence. By contrast, in Bowater v Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust, an employer argued a nurse who, while physically restraining a naked patient who was unconscious and having a seizure, said [...] "It's been a few months since I have been in this position with a man underneath me" [...] was lewd and deserved dismissal for her misconduct. The Tribunal said the dismissal was unfair and the Court of Appeal held the Tribunal had competently exercised its discretion in granting the unfair dismissal claim. The absence of a role for elected worker representatives in assessing the fairness of the employer or manager's conduct in the UK contrasts to many EU member states. While courts act as a final check, it is often thought that the parties best placed to resolve disputes would be representatives of all staff members, who (unlike an employer or manager) usually have fewer conflicts of interest in dismissal disputes.|$|E

50|$|Exploratory <b>testing</b> <b>means</b> {{simultaneous}} <b>test</b> {{design and}} test execution {{with an emphasis}} on learning.

Exploratory testing is very common, but in most writing and training about testing it is barely mentioned and generally misunderstood. Some writers consider it a primary and essential practice. Structured exploratory testing is a compromise when the testers are familiar with the software. A vague test plan, known as a test charter, is written up, describing what functionalities need to be tested but not how, allowing the individual testers to choose the method and steps of testing.|$|R

The Planning code is no longer used but was meant to designate aircraft [...] "on the drawing board". For example, using this system an airframe such as the F-13 could have initially been designated as ZF-13 during the design phase, possibly XF-13 if experimental testing was required before building a prototype, the YF-13; the final production model would simply be designated F-13 (with the first production variant being the F-13A). Continuing the example, some F-13s during their service life {{may have been used}} for testing modifications or researching new designs and designated JF-13 or NF-13; finally after many years of service, the airframe would be permanently grounded due to safety or economic reasons as GF-13.|$|E
