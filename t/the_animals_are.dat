5|$|A {{capacity}} for aggressive behavior {{should not be}} overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted. Within groups, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> extremely peaceful and cooperative. Group hierarchies are not rigid and the animals easily share roles.|$|E
5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is weaning, when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after weaning, when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of coon hunting is sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> both climbers by nature, and {{are common in}} the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being too easy to hunt and too greasy to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, the Purkinje neurons {{begin to}} die off shortly after <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> born and <b>the</b> {{condition}} <b>is</b> noticeable when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> {{less than six}} months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms <b>is</b> gradual and <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.|$|R
30|$|After {{completing}} the catheterization, <b>the</b> sedated <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> transported for <b>the</b> experiment. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> kept warm during the experiments.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>animal</b> study {{protocol}} <b>was</b> {{approved by}} <b>the</b> Finnish National <b>Animal</b> Experiment Board, ELLA (Permit # ESAVI/ 3485 / 04.10. 03 / 2012). <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> experiments <b>were</b> {{carried out in}} <b>the</b> Central <b>Animal</b> Laboratory of <b>the</b> University of Turku. The institutional guidelines and the protocols for the analgesia, anesthesia, and housing of the rats were followed. Before surgery, the rats were acclimated to their new environment and fed a standard laboratory diet. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> housed in groups of two with constant room temperature. After surgery, the functional activity of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>was</b> not restricted. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> allowed free weight-bearing after recovery from anesthesia.|$|R
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|Jake focuses his {{attention}} on the trials and tribulations of a rabbit. First, the rabbit is tormented by a rogue deer. Then, a storm threatens to destroy his home. But luckily, the rabbit enlists {{the aid of a}} friendly sea lard and several beavers, and together, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> able to rebuild the rabbit's home. While Jake narrates, the entirety of Ooo tunes into the broadcast and becomes engrossed in the tale of the rabbit, unbeknownst to Jake.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
30|$|All incisions {{were closed}} using {{interrupted}} silk sutures. At this point, {{the process of}} surgical interference <b>was</b> complete. Postoperatively, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> administered 1  g of amoxicillin once daily for 5  days. Sutures were removed 14  days after surgery, and <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> fed a soft laboratory diet for the study duration. Further, the operated areas and general conditions of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> checked daily according to standard veterinary postoperative care.|$|R
40|$|On Feb. 15, 1954, the cadaver of a 3 -year-old female St. Bernard was {{admitted}} to Stange Memorial Clinic for diagnosis. There was a history of occasional straining and frequent scanty urination. The abdomen was greatly distended and before death <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> quite depressed. <b>The</b> owner thought <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> pregnant; however, there was no increase in mammary development. Since <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> dead on arrival there was no clinical diagnosis made...|$|R

5|$|Many of the Quest's {{rules are}} {{intended}} to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E
5|$|Painted turtle pet-keeping {{requirements}} {{are similar to}} those of the red-eared slider. Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} the iconic symbol of Svalbard, {{and one of}} the main tourist attractions. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> {{protected}} and people moving outside the settlements are required to have appropriate scare devices to ward off attacks. They are also advised to also carry a firearm for use as a last resort. A British schoolboy was killed by a polar bear in 2011. Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3,000 polar bears, with Kong Karls Land being the most important breeding ground.|$|E
5000|$|After slaughter, both {{require that}} <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>be</b> {{examined}} {{to ensure that}} it is fit for consumption. Dhabiha guidelines generally say that the carcass should be inspected, while kashrut says that <b>the</b> <b>animal's</b> internal organs must be examined [...] "to make certain <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> not diseased".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> an evenly light ochreous {{cream in}} color. The mantle {{is up to}} 30 mm long. <b>The</b> whole <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> up to 55 mm long.|$|R

5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle and}} ponies {{living on the}} New Forest are not {{completely}} feral, but are owned by commoners, who pay an annual fee for each animal turned out. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> looked after by their owners and by the Agisters employed by the Verderers of the New Forest. The Verderers are a statutory body with ancient roots, who share management of the forest with the Forestry Commission and National park authority. Approximately 80per cent of the animals depastured on the New Forest are owned by just 10per cent of the commoning families.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> given human IgG, 250  mg/kg (Octapharma; Vienna, Austria), or IgGAM, 250  mg/kg (Pentaglobin; Biotest, Dreieich, Germany), {{intravenously}} via penile vein 5  min {{after the}} CLP procedure. After the IV injection, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> placed {{back in their}} cages for recovery.|$|R
50|$|Spoor {{can be used}} in hunting. For example, {{a hunter}} can stick their finger in an animal's scat to measure its temperature. If the scat <b>is</b> cold, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> likely far and if the scat <b>is</b> warm, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> likely close.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} of forfeiture, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> shelter may {{determine}} whether <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> suitable for adoption and if adoption can <b>be</b> arranged for <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> may not <b>be</b> adopted by the defendant or by any person residing in the defendant's household. If <b>the</b> adopted <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> a dog used for fighting, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> shelter shall notify any persons adopting the dog of the liability provisions for owners of dangerous dogs under Article 1A of Chapter 67 of the General Statutes. If no adoption can be arranged after the forfeiture, or <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> unsuitable for adoption, the shelter shall humanely euthanize <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} engine propelling {{the carousel}} was a belt-driven mechanism, {{but after the}} initial restoration it was exchanged for a fluid drive provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who suggested the platform for the carousel be improved. To provide crowd control, a pavilion was built over the carousel and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was a composite of several other structures. <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> removed {{one at a time}} from the carousel for routine maintenance and refurbishment, which is carried out in the museum's own shops.|$|E
5|$|African {{elephants}} {{are listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E
50|$|On 20 February, the State Government denied {{allegations}} that a dolphin {{had been caught}} on a drum line. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> covered by a tarpaulin, a management response that activists had not seen previously. The Government stated that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> a tiger shark.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{technique}} that zooarchaeologists use is lab analysis. [...] This analysis can include comparing the skeletons found on site with already identified animal skeletons. [...] This not only helps {{to identify what}} <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>is,</b> but also whether <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> domesticated or not.|$|R

5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E
5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. The mating season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> first {{checked to}} ensure they were free from disease and {{unblemished}} (temimim or tamimim, ἀνώμους in the Septuagint, without spot in the King James Version) {{as required by the}} law. Leviticus 22 identified <b>animals</b> [...] "that <b>are</b> blind or broken or maimed, or have an ulcer or eczema or scabs" [...] as 'blemished' - these you shall not offer to <b>the</b> Lord". <b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> brought to <b>the</b> north side of the altar, and ritually slaughtered. <b>The</b> <b>animal's</b> blood <b>was</b> carefully collected by a priest and sprinkled on the outside corners of the altar. Unless <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> a bird, its corpse was flayed, with the skin kept by the priests.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Responses were {{recorded}} from isolated neurons {{in the visual}} cortex of rhesus monkeys while they performed an orientation match to sample task. In each trial <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> first cued with randomly selected orientation, and then presented with a sequence of gratings whose orientations <b>were</b> randomly selected. <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> required to release a switch when it saw a grating that matched the cued orientation. For some recordings <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> given a tactile cue by having it feel the orientation of a grooved plate {{that it could not}} see. In other experiments the cue orientation was presented visually on the screen in front of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> and then removed before the sequence of gratings was presented. Using this task it was possible to determine if a neuron's response to a particular orientation was affected by {{whether or not it was}} the orientation for which <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> looking. Over half the neurons examined in V 4 (110 / 192) responded differently to the visual stimuli when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> cued to look for different orientations. For some neurons responses to all stimuli <b>were</b> strong when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> cued to look for a particular orientation, but weak when the same stimuli were presented in trials where <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> had <b>been</b> cued to look for another orientation. This type of sensitivity was found in neurons recorded while <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>was</b> given a tactile cue, and also in other neurons tested when a visual cue was used, suggesting that the activity was not of direct sensory origin. In support of this, neurons in V 4 were not strongly affected when <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> felt <b>the</b> grooved plate while not performing the orientation matching task.
