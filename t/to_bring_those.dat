25|$|The Peruvian {{government}} actively {{seeks to}} attract both {{foreign and domestic}} investment in all sectors of the economy. International investment was spurred by the significant progress Peru made during the 1990s toward economic, social, and political stability, but it slowed again after the government delayed privatizations and as political uncertainty increased in 2000. President Alejandro Toledo has made investment promotion a priority of his government. While Peru was previously marked by terrorism, hyperinflation, and government intervention in the economy, the Government of Peru under former President Alberto Fujimori took the steps necessary <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> problems under control. Democratic institutions, however, and especially the judiciary, remain weak.|$|E

Also in 1987 the press box was redecorated, a few more seats were installed at the upper portion of the west lower stands, and all seating within the stadium was renumbered using a uniform seat-width.

25|$|It {{emerged that}} a number of the {{suspects}} made prepared statements to police {{on both sides of the}} border, with their legal representatives present, in the weeks after the murder. They were then questioned under caution by the authorities. As the suspects live and travel between the Republic and Northern Ireland, extraditions may have to be sought <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> responsible to justice in the Republic of Ireland. An Extradition Agreement in place between the Irish and British governments means that extradition orders can only be made when the police force requesting the extradition has sufficient evidence to charge the suspect, and can only question them after they are charged in a court of law.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, the Public Service Commission {{planned a}} new {{platform}} for the shuttle, close to the Lexington Avenue Line station. The platform was constructed, {{but it was never}} used. The wall and roof of the old subway were removed at the curve just south of the old Grand Central station, and trackways were built continuing east under 42nd Street, <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> two tracks into the new station with a narrow island platform between them. The unused trackways of the proposed shuttle platform were covered with wooden flooring in 1918, and the width of the station was finished up as a passenger walkway between the Lexington Avenue Line and Shuttle stations. The wooden flooring was replaced by concrete in 1946, and the former downtown express track between this station and Times Square–42nd Street was removed in 1975.|$|E

500|$|Julian Jarrold became {{attached}} {{to direct the}} film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after Kinky Boots, which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he [...] "liked [...] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just {{had a feeling that}} he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also {{with a certain amount of}} brio and Julian was able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> two things to the production." [...] The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it [...] "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience." [...] The director intended to [...] "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" [...] and adding [...] "more life and energy and fun," [...] opining that past Austen adaptations had been [...] "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice." ...|$|E

The response has included the cancelling of all 83,000 permits granted to West Bank and Gaza residents to travel during Ramadan, the suspension of 204 work permits of individuals in the alleged attackers’ extended families, and the sealing off of their entire home town by the Israeli security forces. Israel has a human rights obligation <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>those</b> responsible to account for their crimes. And this it is doing.
