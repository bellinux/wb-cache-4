Design/methodology/approach: Between May and June of 2007 a total of 23 winery owners, managers and wine makers located in the Canary Islands were interviewed from a sample of 61 wineries identified in Tenerife and La Palma islands.

Overall, wineries focus on <b>the</b> <b>tasting</b> room as a way to advertise and present their wines to visitors and passers by as part of a long-term strategy, rather than as a way to make direct wine sales. Research limitations/implications: It is acknowledged that the sample of only 23 participating businesses may not be enough to make generalisations about the impact of <b>the</b> <b>tasting</b> room on wineries of the Canary Islands.

40|$|Taste aversion {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that rats conditioned to avoid monosodium glutamate (MSG) with amiloride added to reduce the intensity of the sodium component of MSG taste, generalize this aversion to aspartic acid and to L-AP 4, but not to ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists. That is, MSG, L-AP 4 and aspartate have similar tastes to rats. However, conditioned taste aversion methods are unable to show to what extent <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> of two substances are different. If two substances activate the same afferent processes (e. g. taste receptors), they are likely to produce <b>the</b> same <b>tastes,</b> but if they activate different afferent processes, the subject may detect differences between <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> of <b>the</b> substances. In this study, rats were tested to determine if they could discriminate between <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> of these agonists and MSG. We also established the detection thresh-olds for NMDA, aspartic acid and L-AP 4, with and without amiloride (a sodium channel antagonist). Taste threshold values were 1 – 4 mM for NMDA and aspartic acid and 0. 5 – 2. 5 µM for L-AP 4. None were affected by 30 µM amiloride. Rats could readily distinguish between <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> of MSG and NMDA but they had difficulty discriminating between <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> of aspartic acid and MSG. Rats could also easily distinguish between 10 – 100 mM MSG and 0. 01 – 5 mM L-AP 4. However, in two separate experiments error rates increased significantly when L-AP 4 concentrations were between 10 – 100 mM, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>tastes</b> of L-AP 4 and MSG were similar at these concentrations...|$|R
