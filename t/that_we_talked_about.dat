Loeb felt that this made the season unquestionably [...] "the series' biggest" [...] with the [...] "most ambitious story yet". He added that [...] "one of the things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> is, S.H.I.E.L.D. always looked out for the weird, the unusual, {{the things that were}} and could be a problem for the public," [...] and Marvel realized that Ghost Rider's abilities, which are more mystical than anything seen in the series to date, opened up [...] "a quarter of the universe that we haven't really {{spent a lot of time}} exploring ... what happens if our very real, our very grounded agents who are very much a family have to take on something that is as bizarre and powerful and unique as Ghost Rider." [...] Bell added that the producers would have been willing to give an entire season of the show to a Ghost Rider arc if the season was 13 episodes or less, but 22 episodes seemed too long to [...] "feel like one flavor".|$|E
2500|$|On October 29, 2001, White House {{spokesman}} Scott Stanzel [...] "disputed {{reports that}} the anthrax sent to the Senate contained bentonite, an additive that ha been used in Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's biological weapons program". Stanzel said, [...] "Based on the test results we have, no bentonite has been found". The same day, Major General John Parker at a White House briefing stated, [...] "We do know that we found silica in the samples. Now, we don't know what that motive would be, or why it would be there, or anything. But there is silica in the samples. And that led us to be absolutely sure {{that there was no}} aluminum in the sample, because the combination of a silicate, plus aluminum, is sort of the major ingredients of bentonite." [...] Just over a week later, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Ridge in a White House press conference on November 7, 2001, stated, [...] "The ingredient <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> before was silicon." [...] Neither Ross at ABC nor anyone else publicly pursued any further claims about bentonite, despite Ross's original claim that [...] "four well-placed and separate sources" [...] had confirmed its detection.|$|E

I became Man in her imagination, the protagonist of the world. At first I displayed the modest worthy desire for respectable service that Harbury had taught me, but her clear, sceptical little voice pierced and tore all those pretences to shreds.

5000|$|Asked why Leia is {{not shown}} to be a Jedi in The Force Awakens (as she is in the Star Wars {{expanded}} universe works), Abrams told IGN, [...] "It was a great question, and one <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> quite a bit, even with Carrie Fisher. Why did she not take advantage of this natural Force strength that this character had. And one of the answers was that it was simply a choice that she made, that her decision to run the Rebellion, and ultimately this Resistance, and consider herself a General, as opposed to a Jedi. It was simply a choice that she took". He also added, [...] "I {{would like to think that}} there really isn't much of a ticking clock, and it's never too late ... clearly we've seen, and we do again, that she still is Force strong. And it's something that I think is an intrinsic piece of her character.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{have criticized}} Professor Siegel for being bullish {{on the stock}} market back in 2000. In a BusinessWeek {{interview}} in May 2000 when asked about the stock market, he replied:"Seven percent per year average real returns on stocks is what I find over nearly two centuries. I don't see persuasive reasons why it should be any different from that over the intermediate run. In the short run, it could be almost anything."That being said, Professor Siegel was spot on when he also said in the same interview:"I have voiced my concern about the technology sector, and I sometimes advise people to shade down from that sector relative to its percentage in the & Poor's 500-stock index. I really am concerned with these companies that have p-e ratios of 90, 100, and above. I still think stocks, as a diversified portfolio, are the best long-run investment. I will say that indexed bonds at 4% are an attractive hedge at the present time. To get a 4% real rate of return, although it's not as high as 6.5% to 7% <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> in stocks, as a guaranteed rate of return is certainly comforting against any inflation." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} written {{to pay tribute}} to the memory of my friend Ralph Kleinman. In 1962, I became aware of the {{original}} ideas in Ralph's early work when I was an engineering student in applied mathematics in Delft under supervision of professor Rein Timman. Ralph had just nished his doctor's thesis and Timman asked me to apply the same approach to a problem in the eld of transonic ows. Although we rst met in 1978 at the memorial meeting dedicated to Rein Timman, Ralph inuenced my early scientic interest. After we met our contact intensied, I stayed a few months in Newark and in Delft Ralph knocked on my door many times, mostly when I expected him to be far away. Luckily he always appeared before lunch time, so we could have a long conversation over a light lunch. It even could happen <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> mathematics. The last time Vicky and Ralph were in Delft, my student Lisette just nished her doctor's thesis on the topic of this paper. Therefore I have chosen this material. 1 Potential theory for ship motions In literature a variety of methods to compute the rst order potentials can be found.
