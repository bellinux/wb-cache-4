These results not only contrast with the assumption of constant <b>transition</b> <b>probabilities</b> on which many regime-switching models are built, but also provide new insights on the determinants of the state-dependent <b>transition</b> <b>probabilities</b> of regime switching. ...|$|R

40|$|Absolute <b>transition</b> <b>probabilities</b> {{have been}} {{measured}} for 38 lines from 5 levels in Fe II. The branching ratios for the transitions which depopulate each level {{were determined by}} observations of the relative line intensities in a hollow cathode discharge. The relative <b>transition</b> <b>probabilities,</b> which are proportional to the branching ratios, were normalized by measurement of the lifetime of the upper level using a beam-foil, time-of-flight technique. The lifetime is the reciprocal of {{the sum of the}} <b>transition</b> <b>probabilities.</b> Our <b>transition</b> <b>probabilities</b> are compared to values from five other measurements, the most comprehensive of which are those of Warner. The work of Warner is shown to contain a significant error which comes from his use of the, now discredited, <b>transition</b> <b>probabilities</b> of Corliss and co-workers for Fe I in the determination of the temperature of his source. A method for correcting the values published by Warner is given.
