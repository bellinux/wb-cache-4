5|$|Samantha {{takes the}} {{children}} to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different skin colors. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has black spots and Lisa's skin has white spots. Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are witches. When Samantha finds the two girls polka-dotted, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa {{will continue to be}} sisters. Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.|$|E
5|$|To further {{interest}} the case, House manipulates the team, Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Chase (Jesse Spencer), by swapping {{his own blood}} sample, leading them to believe he too has syphilis, perhaps the cause for his misanthropic personality and unfriendliness. He then pretends to get a nicer personality, but gets less able as a doctor as he pretends to take the penicillin they prescribe him, and everyone falls for House's trick (which he has confided to Wilson). Meanwhile, Foreman believes he isn't getting the respect he deserves from Kutner, Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Thirteen (Olivia Wilde), when he <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their performance reviews, which he believes is due to House frequently humiliating him. House replies {{that if he did}} not humiliate and taunt Foreman, he would not be strong and able enough to handle the rest of the team.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} things he wants to do before death.|$|E

5|$|Xander's dream {{begins when}} he wakes on Buffy's couch. After excusing himself {{to use the}} restroom, he finds himself the object of an {{attempted}} seduction by Joyce. In the restroom, he starts to unzip, then realizes that the bathroom {{is attached to a}} large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike – unaffected by daylight – tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they invite him to join them. He <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, only to end up in the basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but who suddenly switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the Apocalypse Now scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz. Throughout the sequence Xander finds himself in his basement again and again, chased by an unseen pursuer, who is revealed as the First Slayer when she tears his heart out.|$|E

This has the player {{capturing}} posts, but the player must do them in a specific order – one team works out from their base needing to capture 1 through 5 while the other team starts out from their home and needs to snag 5 through 1. King of the Hill has players capturing a hill, spawned on the map to score points. They must stay in the hill to score points while the enemy team <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader {{observed}} that [...] "Raimi <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a Sergio Leone, and though The Quick and the Dead is highly enjoyable in spots, it doesn't {{come across as}} very convincing, perhaps because nothing can turn Sharon Stone into Charles Bronson." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt that [...] "The Quick and the Dead plays like a crazed compilation of highlights from famous westerns. Raimi finds the right look but misses the heartbeat. You leave the film dazed instead of dazzled, as if an expert marksman had drawn his gun only to shoot himself in the foot." ...|$|E

Crosby, who led {{the tournament}} in scoring with 10 points, helped Team Canada win the championship, and was named the Most Valuable Player. He joined Bobby Orr and Wayne Gretzky as the only players to win the Conn Smythe, Hart Memorial Trophy and World Cup MVP. Team [...] coach Mike Babcock {{described}} Crosby as a serial winner, [...] "He's that high-end competitor. He's a good leader because he <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it right all the time.

500|$|Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, writing [...] "There {{is hardly a}} thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and {{sometimes}} I was unreasonably pleased." [...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E
500|$|Seeley and Norton {{both had}} heavy workloads {{when they began}} Revival, and the {{complexity}} of the story meant they needed to cut back on other projects. Because Seeley was excited to write about [...] "real people" [...] instead of typical heroes or archetypes, Revival is set in Seeley's boyhood home of Wausau, Wisconsin. Several of the unusual crimes in the first arc are based on actual events from the town, including the killing of the zebra-horse in the first issue. This setting meant religion would need to {{play a significant role in}} the plot because Wausau is a [...] "very religious... predominately Christian" [...] place. Seeley deliberately references Biblical events throughout the comic, but <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with subtley because it's [...] "easy to do it way overdone".|$|E

500|$|Joe Bernardi of Paste put Ziggurat in a {{lineage of}} iOS games where the player <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a fun thing {{as much as}} {{possible}} before dying, including Canabalt, Bit Pilot, and Super Crate Box. He connected Ziggurat mechanics to Rogers's longstanding interest in [...] "infinite mode" [...] without external rewards, and praised the charge time mechanics as [...] "excellent" [...] and the perfect awkward length to confuse muscle memory. [...] Leray of TouchArcade praised its attention to detail, especially in the character sprites. Paste Bernardi called Action Button's design restraint [...] "admirable" [...] and lauded the game's balance. He noted its [...] "extremely focused shallowness" [...] as defining, like a Dorito, and called it [...] "one of the best iOS games [...] ever played". Reviewing for ActionButton.net, indie developer Adam Saltsman called Ziggurat [...] "French New Wave action videogame fan art".|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy X: Will is an {{original}} audio drama {{included in the}} release, playing during the ending credits. It features multiple characters from the games, alongside two new characters: the shy summoner Kurgum, and his obnoxious companion, Chuami, who narrates. The two are sent to recruit Yuna to investigate a case of unauthorized [...] "Beckoning" [...] (talking to the dead) in the Moonflow region. What they discover, however, is far more serious: a mass overflow of unsent (dead people taking corporeal forms). Following this ominous phenomenon, Sin also returns, terrorizing the world once again. Forced to prepare for another battle, Yuna breaks up with Tidus. Kurgum <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> same with Chuami, only to discover she never had any feelings for him. A confused Tidus consults with Lulu, who chastises him for his naivete and reminds him that Sin's return means anything else can also return. [...] Unlike Chuami, Tidus understands her and renews his oath of dedicating himself to Yuna. The story ends with Yuna's public announcement of her intention to battle Sin.|$|E
500|$|Four filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Do-Over" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him how {{he will be able to}} get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his employee ID card. Jack tells her you can do anything if you walk with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows. In the third scene, Liz and Bev talk to NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to-door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the [...] "do over".|$|E

500|$|In March 2009, Morrissey {{appeared}} as corrupt police detective Maurice Jobson in Red Riding, the Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace's Red Riding novels. Morrissey {{already knew the}} directors of the films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, or wanted to work with them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, [...] "I think he sets out to be a good cop, he <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a 'bit' corrupt is like being a 'bit' pregnant. You either are or you're not." [...] He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy (2009). As a self-confessed [...] "Beatles geek", Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon's childhood.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kenny {{suffers from}} a bout of [...] "explosive diarrhea", which spreads {{to others in the}} town, {{including}} the adults protesting Terrance and Phillip. Despite objecting to the show, the adults themselves laugh and make jokes at their own real-life toilet humor. Carol proclaims that if Cartoon Central does not take the show off the air, the protesters will kill themselves, and they start using a slingshot to send themselves flying into the building. With the adults out of town for the protest, the boys are free to watch Terrance and Phillip at their leisure. Grandpa Marvin continues asking Stan to kill him, and demonstrates how terrible his life is by locking Stan in a room and forcing him to listen to a song in the style of Enya's [...] "Orinoco Flow". Now convinced that his life is excruciating, Stan finally agrees to kill his grandpa, and <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by rigging a cow on a pulley and dropping it on him. Just as the boys are about to do it, Death himself arrives, but starts chasing after the boys instead of Grandpa Marvin.|$|E
500|$|Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed {{was more}} {{positive}} about the episode, commenting that the episode's emphasis is on Homer's parenting, like many other season three episodes, and [...] "contrary to popular opinion, Homer is actually a good father who <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> good by his children." [...] He thought the racing sequences featured [...] "good animation and direction", but considered {{the highlight of the}} episode to be the clip from the film McBain that Homer watches in the video store. Meyers gave the episode a 4/5 rating. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, who listed the episode as one of his favorites from season three, said that [...] "on the surface, 'Saturdays of Thunder' essentially just rehashes" [...] the theme of the previous episode, [...] "Lisa's Pony", in which Homer tries to be a better father for Lisa. Jacobson commented that [...] "Saturdays of Thunder", however, [...] "simply seems funnier than 'Lisa's Pony'. The soapbox derby elements provide lots of great gags. [...] offers a great episode." [...] Like Meyers, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide thought the highlight of the episode was the McBain video.|$|E
