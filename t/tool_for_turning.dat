50|$|The company {{introduced}} the highly efficient Corliss valve gear into the United Kingdom from the United States in about 1864 and was closely identified with it thereafter; William Inglis {{being responsible for}} promoting the high speed Corliss engine. About 1881 Hick, Hargreaves received orders for two Corliss engines of 3000 hp, the largest cotton mill engines in the world. Hargreaves and Inglis trip gear was first applied to a large single cylinder 1800 hp Corliss engine at Eagley Mills near Bolton and the company received a Gold Medal for its products at the 1885 International Inventions Exhibition. Mill gearing was a speciality including large flywheels for rope drives, one example of 128 tons being 32 ft in diameter and groved for 56 ropes. Turbines and hydraulic machinery were also manufactured. Many of the tools were to suit the specialist work, with travelling cranes to take 15 to 40 tons in weight, a large lathe, side planer, slotting machine, pit planer and a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> four 32 ft rope flywheels simultaneously. The workshops also featured an 80ton hydraulic riveting machine. For the ease of shipping and transportation, Soho Iron Works had its own railway system, traversed by sidings of the London North Western Railway (LNWR). Inglis, who lived in Bolton was a neighbour of LNWR's chief mechanical engineer, Francis Webb.|$|E

It reduces the contention overheads by allowing a station gains the channel to transmit multiple frames back-to-back in a burst. Existing analytical models of the CFB scheme have primarily been presented under the assumption of saturated traffic loads. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive analytical model for evaluating the throughput, end-to-end delay, and loss probability of the CFB scheme under unsaturated conditions. The proposed model is validated against extensive ns 2 simulation experiments. Numerical results demonstrate {{the efficiency of the}} CFB scheme for improving the performance of WLANs with unsaturated stations. Moreover, the impacts of TXOP limit and the number of stations on the network performance are investigated.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a new method {{for the growth of}} small diamond crystals at very high temperatures and pressures directly from a carbon melt. A prototype "Supercell" has been developed for this purpose. This system is capable of high rate crystal growth in relatively large working volumes. The resulting high quality diamond crystals will be incorporated into a triphasic diamond/titanium carbide/titanium composite tool, with an oriented diamond crystal at its tip. High pressure is needed to prevent degradation of diamond at high temperature, and to ensure the formation of a crack & composite structure. After grinding and polishing, the composite material will be joined to a steel holder, thus forming a diamond-tipped <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> and smoothing of a mirror surface. A properly oriented single-crystal diamond cuts and smoothes much better than a conventional polycrystalline diamond crystal. This is because the hardness depends on crystallographic orientation-the difference corresponds to 60 - 100 GPa on the Knoop scale. Our goal is to achieve surface roughness of about 1 nm, which will be accomplished by precision cutting and smoothing. The hardness of the functionally-graded diamond/titanium carbide/titanium composite tool varies from 100 GPa at its tip to 15 GPa at its base. Previous work has shown that the mass of machined material using an oriented-diamond tool is much larger than that for a standard diamond-metal composite tool...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{market of}} turning tools is coped {{majority}} by hard metal tools with CVD coating.

Results indicate that the best coatings <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> of difficult to machine materials as austenitic stainless steels are nACo® and AlTiN coatings, since they offer the best performance.

Fieldworks Explorer [FLEx]), as well as tools for creating time-aligned annotations (e. g. ELAN). However, methods for sharing these new data formats online lag far behind. While good options exist for lexical data (e. g. Webonary, Lexique Pro), there is no <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> a project created in the FLEx software into an online interlinearized corpus. We present here a tool in development which does precisely that. FLEx databases can be searched using regular expressions and individual lines from a text can be linked to audio and video media. The tool can furthermore bring together linguistic data in diverse formats (from ELAN, Praat, Fieldworks, Toolbox, Shoebox) for a single query and allow for queries over multiple language projects. We discuss the benefits of this program in relation to several ongoing fieldwork projects that are being used to evaluate it. These projects present several interesting challenges. In one, we attempt to create a unified database from several centuries of documentation during which the language showed considerable change. Similarly, in the second project we create a unified database for two lexically, syntactically and phonologically distinct dialects of the same language and show how an interlinearized database facilitates searching across dialects. Finally, in the third project, we show how video data can be integrated into an online FLEx database, a feature which is still lacking in the FLEx software itself. By way of conclusion, we show the audience how to upload their own data (either privately or publicly) and experiment with the tool’s features. Ultimately, the open source program will be available for anyone interested in hosting their own installations...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe member {{countries}} of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) have called for an integrated approach to development. Despite making significant macroeconomic progress in the 1990 s, the Latin American economies {{reached the end of}} the decade with relative poverty levels above those of 1980, while labour market conditions have worsened in most countries. To achieve development with equity, it is essential to apply a gender perspective to public-policy formation, as a technical-analytical instrument to accompany the overall ethical-political goal. For the United Nations, and hence for ECLAC, gender mainstreaming is the process of examining the implications for women and men of all types of planned public actions, including legislation, policies and programmes in any area. 'It is also a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> men's and women' interests and needs into an integrated dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, social and economic domains'. The purpose of this diagnostic study is to describe how and to what extent the region's governments have built this concern for gender equity into economic and especially labour market policies. The study is expected to help implement agreements and resolutions arising from regional conferences (Regional Programme of Action for the Women of Latin America and the Caribbean, 1995 - 2001; and the Santiago and Lima Consensuses) and global agreements (the Beijing Platform for Action; the commitments of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations), with regard to institutionalizing the gender perspective and Women's rights in public policies. This is a pioneering study focusing on a number of formal aspects that have been identified as potential indicators of the extent of gender mainstreaming in economic and labour policies and programmes. These include commitments assumed; institutional mechanisms adopted; new legal provisions; programmes implemented; and technical and financial resources made available. The indicators analysed here reflect the results achieved on gender mainstreaming in the region's countries during the 1990 s, but do not consider the processes that have led to their achievement. The latter have either been addressed in other studies or are still awaiting analysis. The results of this analysis have been made available to governments and other interested parties, as a contribution to implementing and enhancing what are increasingly effective mechanisms and strategies for achieving the goal of gender mainstreaming in all public policies and interventions — and hence, development with social and gender equity...|$|E

The cutting forces at play are determined using lathe tool dynamometer and plotted on a MCD (Merchant’s Circle Diagram). The cutting tools are also subjected to tests to determine tool life, wear and work hardening. It is found that the performance and tool life of SS 440 C is better and cost effective compared to existing tools.
