50|$|Many of the National Football League {{teams that}} used the Run & Shoot {{in the early}} 1990s used <b>true</b> <b>wide</b> {{receivers}} in all four receiving positions. The type of running back used varied from a smaller back who could catch passes to a big, bruising running back who could run with power. The frequent passing plays run out of this formation tend to spread out the defense's players. If repeated pass plays work, the defense is not as prepared for running plays; running the ball between the offensive tackles, or just off-tackle, is now possible {{and more likely to}} succeed.|$|E
50|$|The NFL did {{not start}} keeping {{statistics}} until —when they did that year, Herber finished as the top passer in the league with 639 yards and nine touchdowns. He won the passing title again in 1934 with 799 yards and eight touchdowns. But Herber reached his peak as a pro starting in 1935 {{with the arrival of}} Don Hutson, the league's first <b>true</b> <b>wide</b> receiver, who changed the game with his graceful moves, precise patterns, and superb hands. Herber loved to throw the ball long and was a perfect fit for Hutson's talent. Hutson's first NFL reception was an 83-yard touchdown pass from Herber on the first play of the game when the Packers beat the Chicago Bears, 7-0. In 1936, Herber and Hutson rewrote (temporarily) the NFL passing-receiving record book. Herber tossed a record 177 passes for a record 1,239 yards, and 11 touchdowns. Hutson set new records with 34 catches, 526 yards receiving, and eight touchdowns, all marks he would soon improve. Green Bay finished 10-1-1 and went to the NFL title game, which they won 21-6 over the Boston Redskins at the Polo Grounds in New York. In that game, Green Bay passed for 153 yards and Herber threw two touchdowns, one to Hutson.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of two young M-dwarfs, RX J 0942. 7 - 7726 (M 1) and 2 MASS J 09424157 - 7727130 (M 4. 5), that were found only 42 arcsec apart in a survey for pre-main sequence stars surrounding the open cluster eta Chamaeleontis. Both stars have congruent proper motions and near-infrared photometry. Medium-resolution spectroscopy reveals that they are coeval (age 8 - 12 Myr), codistant (100 - 150 pc) and thus almost certainly form a <b>true</b> <b>wide</b> binary with a projected separation of 4000 - 6000 AU. The system appears too old and dynamically fragile to have originated in eta Cha and a traceback analysis argues for its birth {{in or near the}} Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. RX J 0942. 7 - 7726 AB joins a growing group of wide binaries kinematically linked to Sco-Cen, suggesting that such fragile systems can survive the turbulent environment of their natal molecular clouds while still being dispersed with large velocities. Conversely, the small radial velocity difference between the stars (2. 7 ± 1. 0 km/s) could mean the system is unbound, a result of the coincidental ejection of two single stars with similar velocity vectors from the OB association early in its evolution.

40|$|In {{this review}} paper states {{that there is}} a rapid {{advancement}} in wireless communication technology providing the network services anywhere and anytime. 4 G communication systems are being developed to solve the various problems the current communication systems (3 G, 2. 5 G) are facing. 4 G will be an intelligent technology that will reduce the number of different technologies to a single global standard. Based on the study, 4 G mobile technologies is in a determining and Standardization stage. Since 4 G is still in the cloud of the sensible standards creation, ITU and IEEE form several task forces to work on the possible completion for the 4 G mobile standards as well. 3 GPP LTE is an Evolution standard from UMTS, and WiMAX is another candidate from IEEE form. These technologies have different characteristics and try to meet 4 G characteristics to become a leading technology in the future market. Under these circumstances, this paper will present about the current trends and its underlying technologies to implement the 4 G mobile technology. This paper also shows some of the possible scenarios that will benefit the 4 th generation technology. Recently, we have witnessed the roll out of LTE (Long Term Evolution, or so called 4 G) services from major US telcos, such as VERIZON, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc. These broadband wireless services claim to surpass current 3 G cellular networks, paving the way to <b>true</b> <b>wide</b> area mobility, multimedia services while on-the-go and greater interactivity.

60|$|Now, it {{does not}} matter in the least whether the prophet, when he spoke these words, knew that they would apply to the Lord Jesus Christ. We have no need {{whatsoever}} to suppose that he did: for scripture gives us no hint or warrant that he did; and if we have any real or honest reverence for scripture, we shall be careful to let it tell its own story, and believe that it contains all things necessary for salvation, without our patching our own notions into it over and above. Wise men are generally agreed that those old prophets did not, for the most part, comprehend the full meaning of their own words. Not that they were mere puppets and mouthpieces, speaking what to them was nonsense--God forbid!--But that just because they did thoroughly understand what was going on round them, and see things as God saw them, just because they had God's Eternal Spirit with them, therefore they spoke great and eternal words, which will be true for ever, and will go on for ever fulfilling themselves for more and more. For in proportion as any man's words are <b>true,</b> and <b>wide,</b> and deep, they are <b>truer,</b> and <b>wider,</b> and deeper than that man thinks, and will apply to a thousand matters of which he never dreamt. And so in all true and righteous speech, as in the speeches of the prophets of old, the glory is not man's who speaks them, but God's who reveals them, and who fulfils them again and again.|$|R
