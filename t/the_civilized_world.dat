25|$|Turks, as an ethno-linguistic group, {{have been}} {{influenced}} by the Shahnameh since advent of Saljuqs. Toghrul III of Seljuqs is said to have recited the Shahnameh while swinging his mace in battle. According to Ibn Bibi, in 618/1221 the Saljuq of Rum Ala' al-Din Kay-kubad decorated the walls of Konya and Sivas with verses from the Shahnameh. The Turks themselves connected their origin not with Turkish tribal history but with the Turan of Shahnameh. Specifically in India, through the Shahnameh, they felt themselves to be the last outpost tied to <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> <b>world</b> by the thread of Iranianism.|$|E
25|$|Figures {{such as the}} Hebrew prophet Elijah and Khidr, Muslim prophet {{of eternal}} life, Cernunnos, Sylvanus, Derg Corra, Green George, Jack in the green, John Barleycorn, Robin Goodfellow, Puck, and the Green Knight all share aspects of the Green Man's nature; {{it has also been}} {{suggested}} that the story of Robin Hood was born of the same mythology. A more modern embodiment is found in Peter Pan, who enters <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> <b>world</b> from Neverland, clothed in green leaves. Even Father Christmas, who was often shown wreathed in ivy in early depictions, has been suggested as a similar woodland spirit.|$|E
25|$|On September 29, 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan disputed Treaty of Lausanne. He said “We {{gave away}} the islands (in the Aegean) through the Treaty of Lausanne,”, “The islands, which if we care to shout (from the western Asia Minor coast) we’ll {{be heard on}} the other side (the islands), we gave away with Lausanne. What will now happen with the {{continental}} shelf? What will happen with the airspace and land? We’re still fighting for all of these". This caused displeasure in Athens. A Greek Foreign Ministry source remarked that “everyone should respect the Treaty of Lausanne,” noting that it is “a reality in <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> <b>world</b> which no one, including Ankara, can ignore.”, added that the Turkish leader’s comments were likely geared for domestic consumption.|$|E

Nevertheless {{it is easy to}} perceive that almost all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in the same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say, that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a philosophical method, they are in possession of one, common to the whole people. To evade the bondage of system and habit, of family maxims, class opinions, and, in some degree, of national prejudices; to accept tradition only as a means of information, and existing facts only as a lesson used in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason of things for one's self, and in one's self alone; to tend to results without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance through the form; – such are the principal characteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Americans... most of the operations of the mind, each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own understanding alone.|$|E
25|$|During the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch – {{using their}} {{expertise}} in doing business, cartography, shipbuilding, seafaring and navigation – {{traveled to the}} far corners of the world, leaving their language embedded {{in the names of}} many places. Dutch exploratory voyages revealed largely unknown landmasses to <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> <b>world</b> and put their names on the world map. The Dutch came to dominate the map making and map printing industry by virtue of their own travels, trade ventures, and widespread commercial networks. As Dutch ships reached into the unknown corners of the globe, Dutch cartographers incorporated new geographical discoveries into their work. Instead of using the information themselves secretly, they published it, so the maps multiplied freely. For almost 200 years, the Dutch dominated world trade. Dutch ships carried goods, but they also opened up opportunities for the exchange of knowledge. The commercial networks of the Dutch transnational companies, i.e. the VOC and West India Company (WIC/GWIC), provided an infrastructure which was accessible to people with a scholarly interest in the exotic world. The VOC's bookkeeper Hendrick Hamel was the first known European/Westerner to experience first-hand and write about Joseon-era Korea. In his report (published in the Dutch Republic) in 1666 Hendrick Hamel described his adventures on the Korean Peninsula and gave the first accurate description of daily life of Koreans to the western world. The VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial island off the coast of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. Rangaku (literally 'Dutch Learning', and by extension 'Western Learning') is a body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave of Dejima, which allowed Japan to keep abreast of Western technology and medicine in the period when the country was closed to foreigners, 1641–1853, because of the Tokugawa shogunate's policy of national isolation (sakoku).|$|E
500|$|Through the {{overwhelming}} insistence {{of the blind}} pupils, Braille's system was finally adopted by the Institute in 1854, two years after his death. The system spread throughout the French-speaking world, but was slower to expand in other places. However, {{by the time of}} the first all-European conference of teachers of the blind in 1873, the cause of braille was championed by Dr. Thomas Rhodes Armitage and thereafter its international use increased rapidly. By 1882, Dr. Armitage was able to report that [...] "There is now probably no institution in <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> <b>world</b> where braille is not used except in some of those in North America." [...] Eventually even these holdouts relented: braille was officially adopted by schools for the blind in the United States in 1916, and a universal braille code for English was formalized in 1932.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy criticized Chang's {{accusation}} of [...] "Western indifference" [...] and [...] "Japanese denial" [...] {{of the massacre}} as [...] "exaggerated", commenting that [...] "the Western world in fact neither then nor later ignored the Rape of Nanking", [...] "nor is Chang entirely correct that Japan has obstinately refused to acknowledge its wartime crimes, let alone express regret for them." [...] Chang argues that Japan [...] "remains to this day a renegade nation," [...] having [...] "managed to avoid the moral judgment of <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> <b>world</b> that the Germans were made to accept for their actions in this nightmare time." [...] However, according to Kennedy, this accusation has already become a cliché of Western criticism of Japan, most notably exemplified by Ian Buruma's The Wages of Guilt (1994), whose general thesis might be summarized as [...] "Germany remembers too much, Japan too little." [...] Kennedy pointed out that a vocal Japanese left has long kept the memory of Nanking alive, noting the 1995 resolution of Japan's House of Councillors that expressed [...] "deep remorse" [...] (fukai hansei) for the suffering that Japan inflicted on other peoples during World War II and clear apologies (owabi) for Imperial Japan's offenses against other nations from two Japanese Prime Ministers.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the nascent}} Caliphate {{regarded}} {{itself as the}} heir of the Sassanid (and to a lesser extent, Byzantine) tradition and [...] "civilizational consciousness", the Arab caliphs also adopted the notion that, {{in the words of}} the historian Gerald Mako, it was their duty [...] "to protect the settled, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> <b>world</b> from the northern barbarian". To this imperative was added the Muslim concept of division of the world into the [...] "House of Islam" [...] (Dar al-Islam) and the [...] "House of War" [...] (Dar al-Harb), to which the pagan Turkic nomads were consigned. The two armies consequently represented two different military philosophies. While the Umayyad armies disposed of a sizeable cavalry contingent, both light and heavy, their mainstay was the infantry, to the extent that in battle the Arab cavalry was often limited to skirmishing during the initial phases, before dismounting and fighting on foot. The Khazars on the other hand, although they had adopted elements of the civilizations of the south and possessed towns, remained a largely tribal and semi-nomadic power. Like their Central Asian counterparts, they practiced a highly mobile form of warfare, relying on their highly skilled and hardy cavalry. As the historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship writes, [...] "the Khazars were to prove difficult opponents for the Muslims, perhaps partly because their state was not highly organized and thus did not have a center whose fall would bring about a sudden collapse and rapid surrender". The eastern Caucasus range became the main theatre of the Arab–Khazar conflict, with the Arab armies aiming to gain control of Derbent (known in Arabic as Bab al-Abwab, [...] "Gate of Gates") and the Khazar cities of Balanjar and Samandar, whose location has yet to be established with certainty by modern researchers. Both of the latter are referred to as Khazar capitals by different Arab writers, and may have functioned as winter and summer capitals respectively. It was only later, under the impact of the Arab attacks, that the Khazars moved their capital further north, to Atil on the mouths of the Volga.|$|E
