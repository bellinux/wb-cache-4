The U.S. State Department and British Government believed the tape to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In season five, while filming Lez Girls, she is {{promoted}} as the director. Jenny hires Adele Channing (Malaya Rivera Drew) as her personal assistant. Jenny then starts {{a relationship with}} the film's biggest star, Niki Stevens (Kate French). While on a camping trip, Jenny and Niki make a private sex tape. Adele then steals <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> makes numerous copies. Niki, who is a closeted lesbian and needs to stay in the closet for the sake of her career, is shocked when Adele reveals her plans to send the tapes to the media if Jenny doesn't hand the director's job to her. She stands down and asks Niki to join her; they split up when she doesn't join her. Shane later sleeps with Niki, leaving Jenny heartbroken.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E
5|$|In Las Vegas Rachel {{falls in}} {{with a group of}} skaters who live {{together}} and play in a band, after becoming intrigued by one of the boys who wears a shirt with a cassette on it. Mr. Will finds her and pleads with her to confess to having sex with someone else so that he can return to their community. Rachel becomes romantically involved with Clyde, one of the skaters, and one night he offers to marry her, saying that together they can look for the man on the tape, who Rachel thinks is the father of her child. When Clyde and Rachel break into his parents' house looking for food and money, Clyde's father calls the police and Mr. Will is arrested while Rachel flees. Remembering one of her mother's bedtime stories, she impulsively follows a red Mustang and discovers that its owner, Tim, is the man who recorded <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>and</b> is, in fact, her biological father.|$|E

5|$|The novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was {{published}} in 1996. Before its publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof {{as a candidate for}} a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened to <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.|$|E

40|$|YBaCuO-coated {{conductors}} offer {{great potential}} {{in terms of}} performance and cost-saving for superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). A resistive SFCL based on coated conductors {{can be made from}} several tapes connected in parallel or in series. Ideally, the current and voltage are shared uniformly by <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> when quench occurs. However, due to the non-uniformity of property of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relative positions of <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> <b>the</b> currents <b>and</b> the voltages of <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> are different. In this paper, a numerical model is developed to investigate the current and voltage sharing problem for the resistive SFCL. This model is able to simulate the dynamic response of YBCO <b>tapes</b> in normal <b>and</b> quench conditions. Firstly, four tapes with different Jc 's and n values in E-J power law are connected in parallel to carry the fault current. The model demonstrates how the currents are distributed among <b>the</b> four <b>tapes.</b> These four tapes are then connected in series to withstand the line voltage. In this case, the model investigates the voltage sharing between <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> Several factors that would affect the process of quenches are discussed including the field dependency of Jc, the magnetic coupling between <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relative positions of <b>the</b> <b>tapes...</b>|$|R

25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> <b>and</b> thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E
500|$|The vocal {{tracks were}} taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991. This {{was the first}} time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was {{involved}} in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, [...] "We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>and</b> take it back to the top." [...] On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record.
