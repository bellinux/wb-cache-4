5|$|The roman {{designs of}} Garamond which are his most imitated {{were based on}} a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by {{engraver}} Francesco Griffo. This was first used in the book De Aetna, a short work by poet and cleric Pietro Bembo which was Manutius' first printing in the Latin alphabet after a long series of publications of classics of Greek literature that won him an international reputation. Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed De Aetna as something of a pilot project, a small book printed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>standard</b> than Manutius' norm. Among other details, this font popularised the idea that in printing the cross-stroke of the 'e' should be level instead of slanting upwards to the right like handwriting, something imitated in almost all type designs since.|$|E

500|$|This {{test has}} both an {{objective}} and subjective element. There is an objective baseline {{of care that}} every trustee, {{depending on the size}} and responsibility of their office, to exercise [...] "such care and skill as is reasonable in the circumstances". This codifies the common law and reflects company and insolvency law. It indicates that a professional trustee would be held <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>standard</b> than a family trustee. The subjective element requires a court to exercise greater scrutiny if a trustee had any special skills, which takes the trustee's ability above the objective baseline. So if a trustee had a special accountancy qualification that trustee would be expected to exercise a greater than normal degree of care over the trust's accounts.|$|E

500|$|On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport {{was closed}} for all {{scheduled}} traffic by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a not conforming with safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was forced to reroute all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following an investment of NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, scheduled services could commence. The municipality had ambitions to upgrade the airport <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>standard,</b> which would allow it to serve charter aircraft weighing more than [...] and with more than nine passengers. The plans were abandoned after 11 neighboring municipalities rejected giving grants for the necessary technical upgrades. Notodden Municipality instead started a program to increase {{the popularity of the}} airport by targeting companies in the neighboring municipality of Kongsberg to encourage use of the airport, instead of going to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Another NOK250,000 was invested from 1 October 2004 to keep meet safety requirements. Starting in October 2004, security control was introduced. In September 2007, the Bergen Air Transport bought a new hangar at Notodden, giving it ample space for expansion, and new arrival and departure facilities.|$|E

2500|$|In 1822, Florida was {{formally}} organized as the Florida Territory. No longer impeded {{by an international}} border, Americans began traveling to Florida.

Although travel to the Florida peninsula was arduous, St. Augustine became a popular destination. Visitors often stayed for several months.
