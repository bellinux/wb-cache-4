500|$|After graduating, Garran {{began to}} study for the Bar examination. He was {{employed}} for a year with a firm of Sydney solicitors, {{and the next year}} served as associate to Justice William Charles Windeyer of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Windeyer had a reputation for being a harsh and inflexible judge, particularly in criminal cases, where he was said to have [...] "a rigorous and unrelenting sense of the retribution that he believed criminal justice demanded, [...] a sympathy verging on the emotional for the victims of crime." [...] Garran however offered a different view, saying that [...] "those who knew him well knew that under a brusque exterior he was <b>the</b> <b>kindest</b> of men", and his reputation had to some degree been created by misrepresentation. In 1891, Garran was admitted to the New South Wales Bar, where he commenced practice as a barrister, primarily working in equity.|$|E

He was <b>the</b> <b>kindest</b> man and he enjoyed life so much". Reviewing his career in The Guardian, Adrian Turner considered that [...] "we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain"; {{he also said that}} Terry-Thomas was [...] "a national treasure". Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that [...] "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; Adair wrote that [...] "the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness". Terry-Thomas's friend Jack Lemmon called him [...] "a consummate professional... he was a gentleman, a delight to be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much—he made it look simple".|$|E

It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in <b>the</b> <b>kindest</b> way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
