40|$|A 63 -year-old female was {{admitted}} to the hospital because of collapse. She had no history of cardiovascular disease. Prior to admission she used co-trimoxazole, paracetamol, calcium tablets and 50 mg <b>terodiline</b> (Mictrol) daily because of bladder instability. Electrocardiography showed QT prolongation and polymorphous ventricular tachycardia with torsades de pointes. During admission she developed ventricular fibrillation, needing defibrillation. After withdrawal of <b>terodiline</b> and treatment with isoprenaline the symptoms and all ECG abnormalities disappeared. In this case <b>terodiline</b> was suspected of having been the causative agent. <b>Terodiline</b> shows structural resemblance to the anti-arrhythmic agent prenylamine, a known cause of torsades de pointes. Recently <b>terodiline</b> has been temporarily withdrawn from the worldwide market in order to investigate the causal relationship between this drug and cardiac arrhythmia and conduction disturbances...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] <b>Terodiline,</b> an antimuscarinic {{and calcium}} {{antagonist}} drug, {{was used to}} treat detrusor instability but was withdrawn in 1991 after provoking serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with increases in the corrected QT interval (QTc). This research was performed to relate drug induced electrocardiographic changes in asymptomatic recipients to plasma concentrations of the R(+) and S(-) <b>terodiline</b> enantiomers. SETTING [...] Urological and geriatric clinics and wards. SUBJECTS [...] Asymptomatic patients taking <b>terodiline</b> in stable dose. METHODS [...] Electrocardiograms (50 mm/s) were collected from patients while they were taking <b>terodiline</b> and compared with ECGs obtained before or after <b>terodiline.</b> QT interval, heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc), and QT dispersion (QTd) were measured. Drug induced electrocardiographic changes were related to plasma concentrations of R(+) and S(-) <b>terodiline.</b> RESULTS [...] During <b>terodiline</b> treatment mean QTc and QTd were prolonged (491 (43) and 84 (35) ms 1 / 2) compared with measurements made off therapy (443 (33) and 42 (17) ms 1 / 2, paired t tests, P < 0. 002 and P < 0. 01 respectively) in the 12 patients in sinus rhythm. The mean (95 % confidence interval) drug induced increases were 48 (23 to 74) ms 1 / 2 for QTc and 42 (13 to 70) ms 1 / 2 for QTd. These increases correlated with total plasma <b>terodiline</b> (QTc: r = 0. 77, P < 0. 006, QTd: r = 0. 68, P < 0. 025) and with plasma concentrations of both <b>terodiline</b> enantiomers. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Terodiline</b> increases QTc and QTd in a concentration dependent manner. It {{is not clear whether}} this is a stereoselective effect and, if so, which enantiomer is responsible. The results suggest that drug induced torsade de pointes is a type A (concentration dependent) adverse drug reaction...|$|E
40|$|In 25 {{neurological}} {{patients with}} detrusor hyperreflexia <b>terodiline</b> {{reduced the number}} of total micturitions during daytime. Bladder capacity was increased and amplitude of the bladder contractions was reduced. An increase in residual urine was also observed. Mild anticholinergic side-effects were measured on pupillary motility and on heart rate variation. It is concluded that <b>terodiline</b> is a useful alternative in treatment of patients with detrusor hyperreflexia...|$|E
40|$|The cardiac {{electrophysiological}} {{effects of}} S-oxybutynin, a single-enantiomer drug under evaluation {{for the management}} of urinary incontinence, have been investigated and compared with those of <b>terodiline,</b> an incontinence agent withdrawn following reports of QT lengthening and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Membrane currents were recorded from whole-cell configured guinea-pig and rabbit ventricular myocytes, and action potentials were recorded from guinea-pig and rabbit papillary muscles. L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,L), rapidly-activating K+ current (IKr) and slowly-activating K+ current (IKs) were unaffected by submicromolar S-oxybutynin and inhibited by higher concentrations; IC 50 values were 17. 8 [*]μM for ICa,L, 12 [*]μM for IKr, and 41 [*]μM for IKs. <b>Terodiline</b> IC 50 values were somewhat lower for ICa,L (15. 2 [*]μM) and IKs (30 [*]μM), but 24 fold lower in the case of IKr (0. 5 [*]μM). The durations of action potentials in guinea-pig and rabbit papillary muscles driven at 1 [*]Hz were unaffected or moderately shortened by 0. 1 – 100 [*]μM S-oxybutynin, but lengthened by <b>terodiline.</b> <b>Terodiline</b> (⩽ 10 [*]μM) also depressed maximal upstroke velocity. The action potential plateau shortened by an average of 23 % when control rabbit papillary muscles were driven at 0. 4 [*]Hz instead of 1 [*]Hz. Plateau shortening was significantly smaller in the presence of drugs (30 [*]μM S-oxybutynin, 3 and 30 [*]μM <b>terodiline),</b> suggesting that they suppress the transient outward current (Ito) involved in rate-dependent shortening. In experiments on rabbit ventricular myocytes, 3 and 30 [*]μM S-oxybutynin inhibited Ito by 9 ± 2 % and 35 ± 3 %, respectively, whereas 3 and 30 [*]μM <b>terodiline</b> inhibited the current by 31 ± 3 % and 87 ± 3 %, respectively. The results indicate that S-oxybutynin has relatively weak non-specific effects on cardiac ion channels, and that clinically relevant submicromolar concentrations are unlikely to have terodiline-like proarrhythmic actions on the myocardium...|$|E
40|$|Prolongation of the QT {{interval}} and malignant ventricular arrhythmia {{have been observed}} in patients administered <b>terodiline</b> for urinary incontinence. Since this adverse reaction might be caused by inhibition of delayed-rectifier K+ current (IK), we investigated whether clinically relevant (⩽ 10 [*]μM) concentrations of the drug modify IK in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. Myocytes superfused with normal Tyrode's solution were pulsed from − 40 [*]mV to more positive test potentials (V) for 0. 2 – 1 [*]s to elicit tail IK on repolarization and measure tail IK-V relationships. IKr was distinguished from IKs by its sensitivity to the selective blocker E 4031. Inhibition of IKr by 5 [*]μM E 4031 was completely occluded by pretreatment with 3 [*]μM <b>terodiline.</b> In addition, action potential lengthening by E 4031 in guinea-pig papillary muscles (29 ± 3 %) was abolished (3 ± 2 %) (P< 0. 001) by <b>terodiline</b> pretreatment. Inhibition of IKr by <b>terodiline</b> appeared to be voltage-independent, and {{the parameters of the}} Hill equation describing the inhibition were IC 50 = 0. 7 [*]μM and nH= 1. 6. High concentrations of the drug also affect IKs; in experiments with K+-free Tyrode's, 10 [*]μM <b>terodiline</b> inhibited tail IKs by 27 ± 3 % (n= 5) (P< 0. 001). These data suggest that QT lengthening at therapeutic concentrations of the drug (≈amp; 1. 5 [*]μM) is primarily due to inhibition of IKr. Inhibition of other K+ currents such as IKs is likely to be important at higher concentrations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Terodiline</b> {{was widely}} {{prescribed}} for urinary incontinence be-fore reports of adverse cardiac effects that included bradycar-dia, QT lengthening, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. The present study on guinea pig papillary muscles and ventricular myocytes was undertaken to {{gain insight into}} the cardioactive properties of the drug. Clinically relevant concentrations (, 10 mM) of <b>terodiline</b> lengthened the action potential duration by up to 12 %; higher concentrations shortened the duration in a concentration-dependent manner. The drug depressed maxi-mal upstroke velocity in a use-dependent manner; the IC 50 value was near 150 mM in muscles driven at 1 Hz, 60 mM at 3 Hz, 38 mM at 5 Hz, and 3 mM at 1 Hz in muscles depolarized with 14 mM K 1.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To compare <b>terodiline</b> with bladder {{retraining}} against placebo with bladder retraining in {{the treatment}} of detrusor instability in frail elderly patients. DESIGN [...] Randomised, double blind, parallel group study. Treatment lasted for six weeks. Frequency of micturition and episodes of incontinence recorded on diary chart by patients. SETTING [...] Incontinence clinic and a geriatric day hospital at two teaching hospitals. PATIENTS [...] 37 frail but ambulant patients, mean (range) age 80. 4 (70 - 89) years with urinary frequency and urge incontinence, due to detrusor instability. Two patients withdrew before the first assessment (one in each group) and one could not complete the diary chart (placebo group). INTERVENTIONS [...] 19 patients received bladder retraining and <b>terodiline</b> 25 mg daily and 18 bladder retraining and placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Change in urinary frequency and number of episodes of incontinence after six weeks' treatment. Patient's subjective evaluation of symptoms. RESULTS [...] Little difference was found in the results of treatment with <b>terodiline</b> and placebo. The change in episodes of incontinence per 24 hours was no different in the two groups (95 % confidence interval - 0. 6 to 1. 2; p = 0. 75) and the difference between treatments in the change in frequency of micturition per 24 hours (- 0. 2) was not significant (- 1. 1 to 1. 2; p = 0. 76). Ten patients taking <b>terodiline</b> thought they had improved compared with seven receiving placebo; this difference was not significant. CONCLUSION [...] Although the number of patients in each group was small and may have been insufficient to detect a drug effect, the possible benefit of <b>terodiline</b> is likely to be small...|$|E
40|$|<b>Terodiline,</b> an anticholinergic/antispasmodic drug {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} urinary incontinence, is presently restricted due to adverse side effects on cardiac function. To characterize its effects on cardiac L-type Ca 2 +-channel current carried by Ca 2 + (ICa,L) and Ba 2 + (IBa,L), concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 100 [*]μM were applied to whole-cell-configured guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. Although sub-micromolar concentrations of <b>terodiline</b> had no effect on ICa,L at 0 [*]mV, 100 [*]μM drug reduced its amplitude to ca. 10 % of pre-drug control. The estimated IC 50 (15. 2 [*]μM in K+-dialysed cells, 12. 2 [*]μM in Cs+-dialysed cells; 0. 1 [*]Hz pulsing rate) is eight times higher than reported for ICa,L in bladder smooth muscle myocytes. <b>Terodiline</b> affected ICa,L in a use-dependent manner; block increased when the pulsing rate was increased from 0. 1 to 2 – 3 [*]Hz, and when holding potential was lowered from − 43 [*]mV. The drug accelerated the decay of ICa,L at 0 [*]mV in a concentration-dependent manner, and slowed the recovery of channels from inactivation. <b>Terodiline</b> reduced peak IBa,L more effectively than peak ICa,L, and markedly accelerated the rate of inactivation of the current. The results are discussed in terms of mechanisms of Ca 2 + channel block and relation to the therapeutic and cardiotoxic effects of the drug...|$|E

40|$|Drug-induced QT {{interval}} prolongation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for the withdrawal of drugs from the market. In the past decade, at least nine drugs, i. e. terfenadine, astemizole, grepafloxacin, <b>terodiline,</b> droperidol, lidoflazine, sertindole, levomethadyl and cisapride, have been removed from the market or their use has been severely restricted because of drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Therefore, this irregularity is a major safety concern in the case of drugs submitted for regulatory approval. The most common mechanism of drug-induced QT interval prolongation may be drug-related inhibition of the human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel, which subsequently results in prolongation of the cardiac action potential duration (APD). hERGAPDbase is a database of electrophysiological experimental data documenting potential hERG channel inhibitory actions and the APD-prolongation activities of chemical compounds.
