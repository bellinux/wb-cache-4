5|$|It is {{possible}} that many <b>transient</b> <b>phenomena</b> might not {{be associated with the}} Moon itself but could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported <b>transient</b> <b>phenomena</b> are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E

A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using a rapidly rotating mirror to study <b>transient</b> <b>phenomena,</b> and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark. He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to {{a study of the}} speed of light. Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the above problems with <b>transient</b> <b>phenomena</b> reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows no discernible differences at these sites. This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as {{it is possible that}} outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but neither is it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Bright arcs and spots {{sporadically}} appear {{within the}} main ovals. These <b>transient</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{are thought to}} be related to interaction with the solar wind. The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail. The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval {{may be related to the}} boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps. The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet. The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral X-ray radiation consists of spectral lines of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena {{is that the}} vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for <b>transient</b> <b>phenomena</b> occurring at the same place on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same event, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} {{historical}} controversy over whether {{features on the}} Moon's surface change over time.

The Moon's appearance, like that of the Sun, can be affected by Earth's atmosphere: common effects are a 22° halo ring formed when the Moon's light is refracted through the ice crystals of high cirrostratus cloud, and smaller coronal rings when the Moon is seen through thin clouds.|$|E

40|$|Being a {{promising}} technology which is envisioned to pervade numerous {{aspects of human}} life, wireless sensor networks are attracting remarkable attention in research community. The typical wireless sensors are small low-power, resource-constrained devices subject to functional failures which {{could be due to}} power loss or even malicious attacks on the devices. As the projected applications for wireless sensor networks range from smart applications such as traffic monitoring to critical military applications such as measuring levels of gas concentration in battle fields, security in sensor networks becomes a prime concern. In sensitive applications, it becomes imperative to continuously monitor the transient state of the system rather than steady state observations and take requisite preventive and corrective actions, if necessary. Also, the network is prone to attack by adversaries who intend to disrupt the functioning of the system by compromising the sensor nodes and injecting false data into the network. So it is important to shield the sensor network from false data injection attacks. Through this work, we prove that in the presence of adversaries, {{it would be difficult to}} correctly observe the <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon</b> if sensors report just their readings. We develop a novel robust statistical framework to monitor correctly the <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon</b> while limiting the impact of false data injection. In this framework, each sensor does a lightweight computation and reports a statistical digest in addition to the current sensed reading. Through a series of carefully-designed inter-sensor statistical tests on both the readings and digests, we are able to achieve our goal of preserving the <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> We show a concrete realization of our statistical framework by developing a secure statistical scheme, called SSTF, to effectively monitor the <b>transient</b> <b>phenomenon</b> while being immune to false data injection attacks. SSTF is a two-tier system and the kernel of SSTF is our statistical framework, which is employed atop an enhanced version of the IHHAS security scheme. We present detailed theoretical analysis and in-depth simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSTF...|$|R
