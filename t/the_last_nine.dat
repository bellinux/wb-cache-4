He took 33 wickets at an average of just over 14 runs each, and against South Australia at Adelaide he repeated his feat against Somerset in 1934, taking <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> wickets of the first innings at a cost of 41 runs. This time, he followed up with five for 57 in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further refitting from 1939 to 1943. During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was anchored in Salvador as the main defense of the port, as it {{was too old to}} play an active part in the war. For <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August 2013, Chapman made a {{substitute}} appearance in Arsenal's 3–0 FA WSL win over Liverpool. The FA decreed {{she had not}} been properly registered and Arsenal were deducted three points.

5|$|During the season, {{the team}} scored 90 goals {{at an average}} of four goals per game, beat Walsall Town Swifts 12–0 to set a club record League victory which, , still stands, {{remained}} undefeated on their own ground throughout the season, and won <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> matches of the League season to take the Second Division title at their first attempt. Promotion to the First Division was not automatic, even for the champions, but depended on the results of test matches between the top three Second Division and bottom three First Division teams. Small Heath lost to Newton Heath, the 16th-placed First Division team, after a replay, so were not promoted, although the teams placed second and third were.|$|E
5|$|The abdication of Napoleon {{in early}} April 1814 brought the War of the Sixth Coalition to a close. Corfu, the longest-held French {{territory}} in the Adriatic surrendered and {{was added to the}} United States of the Ionian Islands under British protection. Many awards were presented in Britain for service in the Adriatic, Hoste, Maxwell and Fremantle among those knighted in the 1815 reforms to the knightly orders, as well as the recipients of a large amount of prize money for their captures in the theatre. The dearth of significant fleet actions in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> years of the war also increased public interest in actions such as that at Lissa, which were widely celebrated {{both before and after the}} peace.|$|E
5|$|The {{album is}} part of a larger Year Zero project which {{includes}} a remix album, an alternate reality game and a potential television or film project. The Year Zero alternate reality game expanded upon the album's fictional storyline by using media such as websites, pre-recorded phone messages, and murals. However, disputes arose between Reznor and Universal Music Group, the parent company of Interscope Records, over overseas pricing of the album. In October 2007, Reznor announced that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope, effectively ending the band's relationship with the label; thus Year Zero was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>Nine</b> Inch Nails studio album released on the Interscope label.|$|E

5|$|York Castle in {{the city}} of York, England, is a {{fortified}} complex comprising, over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> centuries, a sequence of castles, prisons, law courts and other buildings {{on the south side of}} the River Foss. The now-ruinous keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly referred to as Clifford's Tower. Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city of York, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued to be used as a jail and prison until 1929.|$|E
5|$|Despite the cup {{success and}} arrival of new signing Geoff Hurst, Stoke laboured to a 15th-place finish in 1972–73. Smith blamed the car crash and {{subsequent}} injury to Gordon Banks in October 1972 {{as the cause}} for the club's mid-season slump, which compounded an already poor start to the season. Any concerns over relegation disappeared though with six victories in the final eight league matches. After a poor start to 1973–74, Waddington signed Alan Hudson in January 1974 to help revive the club's fortunes. The defence also improved, as Smith helped to ensure only two goals were conceded in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> matches of the season as Stoke finished fifth. On 23 February 1974, Smith scored the winning goal against Leeds to end their opponent's 29-match unbeaten run. Leeds went on to have a £250,000 bid for Smith turned down by Stoke in the summer.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War on 4 August 1914, Palace had three players called up as Reservists before the season started. Former Palace players Ginger Williams and Joe Bulcock were amongst those killed in the conflict. In March 1915, The Admiralty, who had taken over the Palace and its grounds {{at the start of the}} war, ordered the club to leave. Palace chose to move to Herne Hill Stadium, but the 1918–19 season found Palace at a new ground. Croydon Common failed to return to business after the war, and it was to their ground, The Nest opposite Selhurst Station, that Crystal Palace now moved. Palace finished the season without a win in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> games, ending in seventh place, building on that position to finish third the following year.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime was a {{collaboration}} between Retro Studios and Nintendo EAD and R. The overall design was a collaborative effort, while the art and engineering was done entirely at Retro, and the music was handled in Japan. Retro Studios was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg. The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic. After establishing its offices in Austin, Texas in 1999, Retro worked on four GameCube projects. When Miyamoto visited Retro in 2000, he suggested a new Metroid game after seeing the prototype of a first-person shooter engine they had created. In 2000 and early 2001, three games in development at Retro were canceled, and in July 2001, an RPG, Raven Blade, was terminated, leaving Prime {{the only game in}} development. During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> months of development, Retro's staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach the deadline imposed by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|The Knicks in March {{replaced}} D'Antoni with Mike Woodson, who ran fewer pick-and {{rolls and}} more isolation plays. Lin had excelled running pick-and-rolls under D'Antoni. After the March 24 {{game against the}} Detroit Pistons he complained about a sore knee, and an MRI later revealed a small meniscus tear in the left knee. Lin opted to have knee surgery and missed {{the remainder of the}} regular season. He averaged 18.5 points and 7.6 assists during his 26 games as an everyday player. In the first 10 games, Lin averaged 24.6 points and 9.2 assists, shooting 49.7 percent from the field but with 5.6 turnovers. In the next seven games, he averaged 16 points and 7.7 assists with 3.9 turnovers. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>nine</b> games, Lin averaged 13.6 points and 5.9 assists and shot only 39.1 percent while dealing with his then-undisclosed knee injury.|$|E
