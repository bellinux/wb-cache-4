5|$|Although {{perhaps not}} as {{prolific}} as {{other areas of}} Greece in regards to technological innovations, there are some inventions that may have originated in Macedonia aside from siege engines and artillery. The rotary-operated olive press for producing olive oil may have been invented in ancient Macedonia or another part of Greece, or even as far east as the Levant or Anatolia. Mold-pressed glass first appeared in Macedonia in the 4thcenturyBC (although it could have simultaneously existed in the Achaemenid Empire); the first known clear, <b>translucent</b> <b>glass</b> pieces of the Greek world have been discovered in Macedonia and Rhodes and date to {{the second half of}} the 4thcenturyBC. Greek technical and scientific literature began with Classical Athens in the 5thcenturyBC, while the major production centers for technical innovation and texts during the Hellenistic period were Alexandria, Rhodes, and Pergamon.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} first floor and {{continuing}} to the third, black and white floor tiling is made of Vermont marble and limestone. The exception is {{the floor of the}} rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of <b>translucent</b> <b>glass.</b> The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors, they appear to form a bowl which mirrors the dome above. The doorknobs are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy (most of the original brass doorknobs have disappeared over time). The present doorknobs and hinges, locked for protection, display the state coat of arms. Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork, the wood is Michigan white pine that has been wood-grained to give the appearance of walnut.|$|E
25|$|The main {{auditorium}} projects a different character {{as compared to}} the building envelope’s ornamentality. A sequence of gradually lowered arches made of local wood, enhanced by panels with colorful motifs. These motifs were a combination of mangoes, bananas, and foliage painted by the brother of Juan Arellano, Arcadio. On top of the proscenium are figures symbolic of Music, Tragedy, Poetry and Comedy. Resembling bamboo stalks are the tapering lamps of <b>translucent</b> <b>glass</b> which surround the theater space. The focal point is the rectangular stage adorned with mango fruits and leaves motif.|$|E
5000|$|Reflecting {{elements}} such as light shelves, lighter wall colors, mirrored wall sections, interior walls with upper glass panels, and clear or <b>translucent</b> <b>glassed</b> hinged doors and Sliding glass doors take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside. The light can be from passive vertical windows or overhead skylights-tubes or active daylighting sources. In traditional Japanese architecture the Shōji sliding panel doors, with translucent washi screens, are an original precedent. International style, Modernist and Mid-century modern architecture were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial, commercial, and residential applications.|$|R

25|$|Probably {{the best}} known closed {{captioning}} option for film theaters is the Rear Window Captioning System from the National Center for Accessible Media. Upon entering the theater, viewers requiring captions are given a panel of flat <b>translucent</b> <b>glass</b> or plastic on a gooseneck stalk, which can be mounted {{in front of the}} viewer's seat. In the back of the theater is an LED display that shows the captions in mirror image. The panel reflects captions for the viewer but is nearly invisible to surrounding patrons. The panel can be positioned so that the viewer watches the movie through the panel, and captions appear either on or near the movie image. A company called Cinematic Captioning Systems has a similar reflective system called Bounce Back. A major problem for distributors has been that these systems are each proprietary, and require separate distributions to the theater to enable them to work. Proprietary systems also incur license fees.|$|E
500|$|Standing at , the Chicago Spire {{would have}} further {{transformed}} the always-growing Chicago skyline. Plans for the tower included 1,193 condominiums {{with each of}} the building's 150 stories rotated 2.4degrees from the one below it for a total 360degree rotation. In February 2008, prices for the condominiums were announced as ranging from $750,000 to $40 million USD. For supplemental structural support, each floor was to be surrounded by cantilevered corners and four concave sides. [...] Similar to the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) and John Hancock Center observation decks, the Chicago Spire design included a community room on the top floor offering residents a view of four U.S. states. [...] The design for the soaring four story lobby of the skyscraper included <b>translucent</b> <b>glass</b> walls framed by arching, steel-reinforced concrete vaults. The building {{has been described as a}} giant [...] "drill bit" [...] by the public and others in the media have likened it to a [...] "tall twisting tree" [...] and a [...] "blade of grass".|$|E
500|$|Much of this {{commentary}} was positive, reflecting an {{optimism about}} {{technology and the}} direction of urban life in general. Skyscrapers were seen {{as an expression of}} rational engineering, the perfect buildings for mankind to live in, as celebrated in artist Louis Lozowick's lithographs. Some other proponents of skyscrapers likened them to medieval cathedrals, symbols of the modern age. Poems depicted skyscrapers as objects of sublime, rational beauty, Ferris describing them as [...] "buildings like crystals, walls of <b>translucent</b> <b>glass,</b> sheer glass blocks sheathing a steel grill". At Chicago's Century of Progress exposition in 1933, skyscrapers and technology were portrayed as a solution for America's current and future problems. The French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier acclaimed New York in 1935 as being [...] "overwhelming, amazing, exciting, violently alive", but went on to complain that there were still too few skyscrapers, and those that had been built were not yet tall enough. Lewis Hine, employed to record the building of the Empire State Building, portrayed the skyscraper construction teams as courageous heroes, creating a genre of photography that continued up until 1941.|$|E
50|$|Reflecting elements, {{from active}} and passive {{daylighting}} collectors, such as light shelves, lighter wall and floor colors, mirrored wall sections, interior walls with upper glass panels, and clear or <b>translucent</b> <b>glassed</b> hinged doors and {{sliding glass doors}} take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside. The light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar light tubes or from active daylighting sources. In traditional Japanese architecture the Shōji sliding panel doors, with translucent Washi screens, are an original precedent. International style, Modernist and Mid-century modern architecture were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial, commercial, and residential applications.|$|R

2500|$|Parry also {{suggests}} the [...] "unusual, but not impossible" [...] idea that Cole's Goblet was a landscape artist's {{answer to the}} still life genre. Visiting {{the home of his}} patron Luman Reed, an avid art collector, Cole would have seen a still-life painting [...] "with Goblet and Lemon" [...] by the 17th-century Dutch artist Willem van Aelst. [...] The highlight of that painting is a <b>translucent</b> <b>glass</b> goblet. The similarities are basic, with both paintings having a vertical format and an off-center drinking vessel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} was designed {{in line with}} sustainable principles and has several distinctive architectural features. [...] "Carefully wrought but nonetheless striking", the library is formed of a [...] "slightly austere <b>translucent</b> <b>glass</b> box" [...] with an angled brise soleil and tiled side walls. [...] The [...] "lofty, noble" [...] interior [...] is open-plan, broken up only by white-painted splayed concrete columns. [...] The interior is lit by a two-storey louvre which forms the transition between the glazed façade and the interior. [...] The extensive use of solar and wind power, natural air circulation, rainwater harvesting and internal lighting which automatically adjusts to the light conditions make it [...] "one of the most energy efficient public buildings in the country".|$|E

2500|$|The south-facing {{entrance}} is fully glazed {{and creates a}} smooth transition from the square to the interior. [...] To the east, a [...] "slightly austere <b>translucent</b> <b>glass</b> box" [...] projects slightly and is topped by an angled brise soleil. Further to the east, the wing containing staff and conference rooms is faced with glazed blue tiles which imitate mathematical tiles—an 18th-century design element used frequently in Brighton but rarely found elsewhere. The west side is the only other clearly visible elevation (it faces Jubilee Street); the ground floor is continuously glazed, and above this layers of blue and green imitation mathematical tiles are interspersed with windows at irregular intervals. The tiles were glazed by hand in the local area. [...] Architecture critic Hugh Pearman praised their use [...] "at a time when every other building {{in the western world}} seems to have an off-the-peg terracotta skin".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{glass as}} a {{material}} {{is known for}} its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7). [...] Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass. [...] Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or pocking of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] This opacification occurs as water seeps through the subsequent cracks, causing the formation of opaque syngenite and gypsum crystals that block light from filtering through the previously <b>translucent</b> <b>glass</b> (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] As these crystals continue to grow, they pose an even greater danger to the glass, eventually breaking through the surface and dislodging the delicate paint layer, or even causing cracks (Rauch 2004, 4). [...] Glass plates can also darken or cloud {{as the result of the}} oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).|$|E
60|$|It came to {{pass that}} during the service the sun began to shine very brightly after several days of cloud and misty windy wet weather, and that {{brilliance}} and the warmth in it served to bring a butterfly out of hiding; then another; then a third; red admirals all; and they were seen through all the prayers, and psalms, and hymns, and lessons, and the sermon preached by the white-haired Rector, fluttering against the <b>translucent</b> <b>glass,</b> wanting {{to be out in}} that splendour and renew their life after so long a period of suspension. But the glass was between them and their world of blue heavens and woods and meadow flowers; then I thought that after the service I would make an attempt to get them out; but soon reflected that to release them it would be necessary to capture them first, and that that could not be done without a ladder and butterfly net. Among the women (ladies) on either side of and before me there were no fewer than five wearing aigrettes of egret and bird-of-paradise plumes in their hats or bonnets, and these five all remained to take part in that ceremony of eating bread and drinking wine in remembrance of an event supposed to be of importance to their souls, here and hereafter. It saddened me to leave my poor red admirals in their prison, beating their red wings against the coloured glass--to leave them too in such company, where the aigrette wearers were worshipping a little god of their own little imaginations, who did not create and does not regard the swallow and dove and white egret and bird-of-paradise, and who was therefore not my god and whose will as they understood it was nothing to me.|$|E
