The roof opens up over the platform and rail to avoid a piston effect and the style responds to the local environment. The station has become the new landmark of Hsinchu.|$|E
5|$|Through {{a series}} of miscommunications, Edward {{believes}} that Bella has killed herself by jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Distraught over her apparent suicide attempt, Edward travels to Italy and attempts to provoke the Volturi (powerful coven who act as vampiric overlords) to kill him by exposing himself as a vampire to humans. Alice, Edward's sister, and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive {{just in time to}} stop him. Alice looks on as Bella jumps into <b>the</b> <b>sunlight,</b> <b>and</b> into Edward, preventing him from committing suicide. Realizing that Bella is alive, Edward explains to Bella that he always loved her and only left to protect her. However, the Volturi determine that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire herself. Alice stops them from killing her by sharing her premonition, in which Bella has been transformed, with Aro, a Volturi elder who is able to read thoughts through touch. Soon after, they return to Forks and Cullens again settle themselves in Forks. Bella asks Edward to transform her and Cullens vote in favor of that much to Edward and Rosalie's dismay. Later, Jacob reminds Edward, the treaty Cullens and Quileutes made years before that they will not attack each other, as long as the Cullens do not feed on any humans, a necessity for Bella's transformation. The movie concludes with Edward telling Bella that he will change her into a vampire after she marries him.|$|E

25|$|Holy wells {{were often}} visited at Beltane, {{and at the}} other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; {{typically}} coins or clooties (see clootie well). The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was seen as being especially potent, as was Beltane morning dew. At dawn on Beltane, maidens would roll in the dew or wash their faces with it. It would also be collected in a jar, left in <b>the</b> <b>sunlight,</b> <b>and</b> then filtered. The dew was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, and help with skin ailments.|$|E
25|$|Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS): The VIMS is {{a remote}} sensing {{instrument}} that captures images using visible and infrared light {{to learn more}} about the composition of moon surfaces, the rings, and the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. It is made up of two cameras in one: one used to measure visible light, the other infrared. VIMS measures reflected and emitted radiation from atmospheres, rings and surfaces over wavelengths from 350 to 5100nm, to help determine their compositions, temperatures and structures. It also observes <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> starlight that passes through the rings {{to learn more about}} their structure. Scientists used VIMS for long-term studies of cloud movement and morphology in the Saturn system, to determine Saturn's weather patterns.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. Limites did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls. People within and beyond the limes travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the limes, patrolling legionaries could have kept track of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> was visible for miles around.|$|E

25|$|Of the Blue Colour of the Sky is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band OK Go. It was {{released}} on January 12, 2010 on Capitol Records in the USA and EMI in the UK, and re-released on the band's independent label Paracadute Records on April 1. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann and was recorded in a span of seven months at Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York. The album's name, lyrics, and concept are based on The Influence of the Blue Ray of <b>the</b> <b>Sunlight</b> <b>and</b> of the Blue Colour of the Sky, a pseudoscientific book published in 1876. Its style was noted as {{a significant departure from}} the power pop of their earlier albums. After the band's split with EMI and Capitol, Paracadute took over the promotional campaign and all distribution responsibilities. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics upon release and debuted at number 40 on Billboard 200 chart.|$|E

Described as a [...] "seven and a half minute epic", the video, directed by Matt Santoro and released in November 2009, opens with ferromagnetic fluid moving through an ambiguous, dark setting.

As the song reaches its crescendo, the box rises through the earth and breaks out of the surface into <b>the</b> <b>sunlight,</b> <b>and</b> its captive is freed.

500|$|Reagan {{signed the}} Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986. The act made {{it illegal to}} knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants, {{required}} employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982, and {{had lived in the}} country continuously. Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration. Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty, Reagan said, [...] "The legalization provisions in this act will go far {{to improve the lives of}} a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> <b>and,</b> ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans." [...] Reagan also said, [...] "The employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element. It will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here." ...|$|E

Back in his laboratory {{in the basement of}} his house, Neville treats the female without success. The next day, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female; by the time he manages to escape, the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam manage to kill them, but Sam is bitten in the fight. Neville brings Sam home and injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection and tries to attack him, Neville is forced to strangle her to death. Heartbroken and driven over the edge by loneliness by his dog's death, he ventures out and suicidally attacks a group of Darkseekers the next night. He kills a large number of Darkseekers but the rest overwhelm him and he is nearly killed, but is rescued by a pair of immune survivors, Anna (Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who have traveled from Maryland after hearing one of his broadcasts. They take the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a Red Cross evacuation ship from São Paulo and are making their way to a survivors' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville angrily argues that no such survivors' camp exists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{enclosed}} {{parabolic trough}} solar thermal system encapsulates the components within an off-the-shelf greenhouse type of glasshouse. The glasshouse protects the components {{from the elements}} that can negatively impact system reliability and efficiency. [...] This protection importantly includes nightly glass-roof washing with optimized water-efficient off-the-shelf automated washing systems. Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from {{the ceiling of the}} glasshouse by wires. A single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight. The mirrors concentrate <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure. Water is pumped through the pipes and boiled to generate steam when intense sun radiation is applied. The steam is available for process heat. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors as a result from exposure to humidity.|$|E

2500|$|Skeptical {{investigator}} Joe Nickell {{wrote that}} the [...] "dancing sun" [...] effects reported at Fátima were [...] "a combination of factors, including optical effects and meteorological phenomena, such as the sun being seen through thin clouds, causing it to appear as a silver disc. Other possibilities include an alteration in {{the density of the}} passing clouds, causing the sun’s image to alternately brighten and dim and so seem to advance and recede, and dust or moisture droplets in the atmosphere refracting <b>the</b> <b>sunlight</b> <b>and</b> thus imparting a variety of colors". However, Dr. Jose Maria de Almeida Garrett observed, [...] "It could not be confused with the sun seen through a fog (there was no fog at that moment)." [...] Nickell also suggests that unusual visual effects could have resulted from temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, or have been caused by a sundog, a relatively common atmospheric optical phenomenon. Nickell also highlights the psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, noting that devout spectators often come to locations where Marian apparitions have been reported [...] "fully expecting some miraculous event", such as the 1988 Lubbock apparition of Mary in Texas, the Mother Cabrini Shrine near Denver, Colorado, in 1992, and Conyers, Georgia, in the early to mid-1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Of the Blue Colour of the Skys {{accompanying}} booklet {{presents the}} album {{as a concept}} based on an unnamed passage from The Influence of the Blue Ray of <b>the</b> <b>Sunlight</b> <b>and</b> of the Blue Colour of the Sky by General A.J. Pleasonton. The title of this book, proposing that blue is the essential life force, was adapted for the album because of the parallels between Pleasonton's faith in the color blue and Kulash's faith in the music that arises from him organically without rational thought. Elements of the booklet compare the lyrics with the passage, with data gathered from {{the characteristics of the}} texts presented by different graphical means. The image on the album cover was constructed with a list of twenty-five themes (for example [...] "Unfounded or Wildly Broad Claims", [...] "Wonderment", and [...] "Light/Optics/Color"), each representing a specific color, assigned to each sentence in both the passage and the lyrics. If more than one theme is assigned to the same sentence, the colors are combined with additive mixing. With each sentence being represented by a colored line, the lines are arranged radially giving the impression of beams of multicolored light emanating from the center. Other data collected for presentation inside the booklet includes sentence length, parts of speech occurrences, syllable stress, and words common to both texts. Kulash, as the primary songwriter for the album, developed the concept and collected the data with Stefanie Posavec and Greg McInerny, who were credited with visualization and layout of the booklet.|$|E
