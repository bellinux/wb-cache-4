40|$|This macro-level {{research}} analyzed sequential {{changes in}} agricultural policies and evaluated their impacts among various groups of farmers classified {{based on the}} land ownership. All supply-side agricultural policies from their origins to current year were divided into four phases where, government supports for agriculture were changed from adverse circumstances support, to direct enormous support, to reform-embedded support, and finally to collaborative support with private sector and Non-government Organizations (NGOs). The changing policies favored all types of farmers among whose reform policies contributed more. The small farmers in the past were not benefited from government policies but <b>they</b> were <b>lately</b> <b>more</b> benefited from coherent policies emphasized {{on the development of}} land-poor farmers. ...|$|R

30|$|Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) {{have been}} among the key {{innovations}} in the automotive market for over a decade, since they promote traffic safety.

A plethora of ADAS exist in the market today, using common warning thresholds for all drivers. However, since we are not all driving the same way, by offering common systems for all the drivers, neither the acceptance nor the effectiveness levels of ADAS are optimal. This manuscript attempts to optimize the Collision Avoidance System (CAS) warning, through intelligent personalized algorithms.|$|R

Preparation of a dark roux is probably the most involved or complicated procedure in Cajun cuisine, involving heating fat and flour very carefully, constantly stirring for about 15-45 minutes (depending on the color of the desired product), until the mixture has darkened in color and developed a nutty flavor. The temperature should not be too high, as a burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable.|$|R
