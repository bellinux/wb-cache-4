50|$|A desire path (formally {{referred}} to as desire line in transportation planning, {{also known as a}} game <b>trail,</b> social <b>trail,</b> <b>herd</b> path, cow path, goat track, pig trail or bootleg trail) is a path created as a consequence of erosion caused by human or animal foot-fall or traffic. The path usually represents the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination. Width and erosion severity can be indicators of how much traffic a path receives. Desire paths emerge as shortcuts where constructed ways take a circuitous route, have gaps, or are non-existent.|$|R

50|$|An 1837 decree {{allowed the}} town of LaGrange to be platted, and land claimed all around it by the LaGrange brothers. Not much is known about this decree except that it allowed land to be claimed just by platting a town. The <b>trail</b> <b>herds</b> passing through LaGrange were a source of cattle for people who legally or {{illegally}} acquired land to graze them on. Stories abound of these early day residents but few can be documented. Most permanent type residents did not arrive as early as 1837, but after about 1860 {{a number of people}} came to Wyoming for various reasons. Quite a few took out homesteads at this time. In the early spring of 1889, S. J. Robb, a Wyoming cowboy, and Nels Robertson who owned a store in neighboring Banner County, formed a company to start a merchandising business. Kale LaGrange, owner and founder of the Miskimins ranch gave them inducements to locate on the present site of LaGrange, it being a part of the ranch. The town was named for him. A store building was built as was a home for the manager, S. J. Robb.

50|$|The 9-year {{period from}} 1875 to 1884 {{was a time}} of rapid {{transition}} on the plains of eastern Montana and Wyoming. In 1876 the Crows provided scouts for the United States military forces in the Great Sioux War of 1876. The defeat by the Sioux of George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 resulted in a concerted military backlash against the Sioux, and by 1877 and 1878 the hostile bands of Sioux had either fled to Canada, or they had surrendered and were confined to reservations along the Missouri River in the Dakotas. This initially left the Crows more secure in their use of the buffalo ranges on the eastern Montana and Wyoming plains, but in 1876 and 1877 federal forts were built across this area. With hostile Indian presence essentially neutralized, hide hunters came to harvest the northern buffalo herds. By 1882 the buffalo were gone from this area. Also, in 1880 the Northern Pacific Railroad began building eastward from Bismark, ND, and in 1882 they completed their northern transcontinental line, which passed up the Yellowstone River valley just as the last of the buffalo disappeared. Almost at once large Texas <b>trail</b> <b>herds</b> arrived in the Montana Territory to exploit the now empty open range on the vast plains of central and eastern Montana. These successive rapid changes in this 9-year period eliminated the herds of bison and reduced other wild game on which the Crow culture relied, and ended forever the Crow's nomadic way of life.|$|R

50|$|After the war, with Texas {{overflowing}} with surplus cattle {{for which there}} were almost no local markets, pressure for trailing became stronger than ever. In the spring of 1866 an estimated 200,000 to 260,000 longhorns were pointed north. Although some herds were forced to turn back, others managed to get through, while still others were delayed or diverted around the hostile farm settlements. James M. Daugherty, a Texas youth of sixteen, was one who felt the sting of the vigilantes. <b>Trailing</b> his <b>herd</b> of 500 steers north, he was attacked in southeastern Kansas by a band of Jayhawkers dressed as hunters. The mobsters stampeded the herd and killed one of the trail hands; (some sources say they tied Daugherty to a tree with his own picket rope, then whipped him with hickory switches.) After being freed and burying the dead cowboy, Daugherty recovered about 350 of the cattle. He continued at night in a roundabout way and sold his steers in Fort Scott at a profit.|$|R
50|$|Co-operation between {{wolves in}} a pack is most visible in their hunting strategy, and is highly effective. A wolf pack may <b>trail</b> a <b>herd</b> of elk, caribou or other large prey for days, looking for an animal that {{displays}} any sign of weakness, before making its move. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the pack heads towards their prey, chasing it down and then surrounding it. Once the attack begins the wolves have specific roles in the hunt, based on age, gender and social standing, {{as well as its}} particular experience and abilities. The youngest wolves frequently do nothing more than observe and learn from the sidelines. Speedy, lightly built females often take on herding roles, darting back and forth in front of prey, causing confusion and preventing escape. Slower but more powerful males are able to take down a large animal more aggressively and quickly.|$|R

25|$|Even {{before the}} famous Texas cattle drives after the Civil War, the trail {{was being used}} to drive herds of {{thousands}} of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats from the midwest to various towns and cities along the trails. According to studies by trail historian John Unruh the livestock may have been as plentiful or more plentiful than the immigrants in many years. In 1852, there were even records of a 1,500-turkey drive from Illinois to California. The main reason for this livestock traffic was the large cost discrepancy between livestock in the midwest {{and at the end}} of the trail in California, Oregon, or Montana. They could often be bought in the midwest for about 1/3 to 1/10 what they would fetch at the end of the trail. Large losses could occur and the drovers would still make significant profit. As the emigrant travel on the trail declined in later years and after livestock ranches were established at many places along the <b>trail</b> large <b>herds</b> of animals often were driven along part of the trail to get to and from markets.|$|R

40|$|Esta dissertação estuda a urbanização do sertão nordestino entre os séculos XVII e XIX, vinculada ao diálogo que chamamos de curral de reses e curral de almas. Curral de reses tece as questões do fenômeno urbano no {{interior}} do Nordeste açucareiro, no que dizia respeito ao papel exercido pela pecuária extensiva no povoamento, na posse da terra e no desenvolvimento de aglomerados urbanos criados ao longo dos caminhos elaborados pelo gado. As reses tangidas do litoral devassaram o hinterland nordestino, criando aqui, ali e além caminhos, desmistificando o desconhecido. Posteriormente, essas trilhas foram usadas pelas autoridades coloniais e clericais para erguer aldeamentos missioneiros - currais de almas -, visando o bem {{material e}} espiritual da Igreja e da Ordem de Cristo e a conversão dos nativos. Curral de almas busca esclarecer a ação da Igreja Católica, unida ao Estado português, no que cerce a fixação e congregação tanto do índio tapuia como dos sertanejos nômades (que v̈adiavamp̈elo território), primeiramente em aldeamentos missioneiros, depois em núcleos urbanos estrategicamente locados no território.

This dissertation analyzes the urbanization {{process in the}} Brazilian northeastern hinterland between the 17 th and the 18 th centuries as connected to the so called Curral de Reses (Cattle Corral) and Curral de Almas (SoulsĆorral). Curral de Reses (Cattle Corral) investigates the several aspects of urbanization in the sugar-producing Northeast, relating it {{to the role of}} extensive cattle ranges in the process of population growth, to the land ownership and to the development of hamlets alongside the <b>herding</b> <b>trails.</b> The <b>herds</b> pushed from the coast, broke through the Brazilian northeasterner hinterland, creating hither, thither and yonder new pathways, therefore demystifying the unknown. Later in time, these trails were used by colonial and clerical authorities to start missionary settlements - C̈urrais de Almas(̈SoulsĆorrals) - that aimed at the material and spiritual welfare of the Church and the Order of Christ and the conversion of the native peoples.

Working round to better vantage, he soon espied what had made Fox stand so stiff and bristling. A herd of elk were trooping up the opposite slope, scarcely a hundred yards distant. They had heard or scented him, but did not appear alarmed. They halted to look back. The hunter's quick estimate credited nearly two dozen to the herd, mostly cows. A magnificent bull, with wide-spreading antlers, and black head and shoulders and gray hind quarters, stalked out from the herd, and stood an instant, head aloft, splendidly significant of the wild. Then he trotted into the woods, his antlers noiselessly spreading the green. Others trotted off likewise. Wade raised his rifle and looked through the sight at the bull, and let him pass. Then he saw another over his rifle, and another. Reluctant and forced, he at last aimed and pulled trigger. The heavy Henry boomed out in the stillness. Fox dashed down with eager barks. When the smoke cleared away Wade saw the opposite slope bare except for one fallen elk.|$|R
