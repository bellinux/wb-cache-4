We find that turnover rates, overall, continued to decline through the 1980 s but that the long downward trend abated in the 1990 s as a result of term limits. The effects of term limits vary depending on the length of the term limit and the opportunity structure in the state. There is also a strong relationship between the presence of term limits and interchamber movement. In addition to term limits, professionalization levels, redistricting, the presence of multi-member districts, and partisan swings explain differences in turnover rates between states...|$|E

The study showed that employment costs did not vary greatly for this type of worker, the minimum cost being $ 62. 47 and the maximum, $ 69. 93. The Nursing Service Department contributed 86 per cent of the cost of the employment procedure. No single figure can be stated as the cost of employment of a graduate staff nurse.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To (a) {{describe}} {{differences in}} the outcome of cross sectional and longitudinal analysis on musculoskeletal complaints relative to age and work demands, and (b) to assess the entrance and drop out selection on musculoskeletal complaints among groups of employees relative to age and work demands. METHODS: A study population was {{selected on the basis of}} questionnaire data from periodical occupational health surveys of almost 45, 000 employees collected between 1982 and 1993. From all companies within this data base that participated twice in company wide surveys four years apart, male employees were selected, and stratified for age and work demands. There were several populations: follow up (participation in both surveys); drop out (participation only in the first survey); entrance (participation only at the second survey); and two cross sectional populations (all participants at each survey). Prevalences of back complaints and turnover rates were analysed. RESULTS: Reported back complaints in the cross sectional analysis declined over the oldest age groups in heavy physical work versus a small increase in the longitudinal analysis. The age group 50 - 9 and back complaints were identified as predictors at the first survey for not participating at the second survey. Neither age nor work demands at the first survey indicated drop out among those employees with back complaints at the first survey. The effects of entrance selection on estimated prevalences were small. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that musculoskeletal disorders lead to selection out of work, affecting the validity of both cross sectional and longitudinal epidemiological studies. In future studies analyses of <b>turnover</b> <b>figures</b> on musculoskeletal complaints relative to work demands and age are recommended...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} small {{rounding}} of net earnings numbers, {{also known as}} cosmetic earnings management, in an international context. Executives of companies are believed to exercise small (mostly upward) rounding of earnings figures {{in order to increase}} perception that the financial statement readers receive from earning figures. This kind of small rounding would lead to the occurrence of zeros and nines as second digit to deviate from the Benford's law, which gives the theoretical occurrence of digits in unmanaged earnings. Although not widely used in earlier literature the Benford's law offers very intuitive tool to investigate cosmetic earnings management especially in an international context. The data of this thesis consists of income statement figures of over 35 000 companies from 43 countries over the time period 2006 - 2014. On top of the financial figures this study uses the Governance Indicators which are governance measures for countries to investigate possible institutional determinants of cosmetic earnings management. Cosmetic earnings management appears to be worldwide phenomenon but countries do differ to the extent that companies residing in them exercise cosmetic earnings management. Out of the 43 sample countries Norway appears to be only one that doesn't show any signs of cosmetic earnings management. Using OLS regression as well as rank regression negative relationship is found between one of the cosmetic earnings management metrics and one of the Governance Indicators, the estimate for regulatory quality. This finding indicates that as the regulatory quality of a country improves cosmetic earnings management in that country increases. Other than this one negative relationship there doesn't appear to be widespread relationship between the levels of cosmetic earnings management and the Governance Indicators. Companies located in the United States appear to exercise more small rounding of <b>turnover</b> <b>figures</b> than rest of the sample countries...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a holistic}} study within {{a hotel in}} Dublin. The project aims to provide a deeper insight how organisations within the hospitality sector deal with the issues that arise surrounding staff turnover. The rationale behind undertaking this project was based predominantly on personal experience within the sector. Through this experience and also research it became evident that high staff turnover can reduce productivity and overall performance quality. With this in mind, potential solutions could be managed by delving deeper into the concept of job satisfaction and turnover, that could not only help this hotel but the entire industry. Through analysis of the research surrounding turnover, {{it appeared to be}} limited in terms of quantity especially in relation to the hospitality sector. There is not much work in this area of research with regard to Ireland, and with so many variances in Ireland’s economy in the recent past, this provided a few issues for the researcher. However, through the implementation of semi structured interviews the researcher aimed to achieve a deeper understanding and knowledge of turnover in this industry. In doing so, many theories and concepts came to surface. Organisations in this sector need to not only acknowledge good work through monetary rewards but also intangible rewards. By creating an environment that recognises and encourages strong workers, this hotel has saw improvements in their <b>turnover</b> <b>figures</b> in recent years. Also, this hotel seems to understand the fact that turnover {{is always going to be}} ever present. However, it appears that this hotel not only accepts this but embraces it, taking not only the negative consequences that arise but also the positives which come in the form of new ideas and improvements to the overall culture. By nurturing all new employees and providing them with a strong foundation to grow, then this is one way the organisation can develop upwards...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to shed light on the {{relationship}} between intellectual property (IP) strategies and firm growth. In brief, IP strategies are means of capturing returns on innovation investments. Employment effects and sales growth effects of innovations have been studied extensively in both theoretical and empirical economic literature but prior research has seldom included IP strategies into the analysis. There is little knowledge, whether there exists growth rate differences among firms that use different IP strategies and do patenting firms effectively demonstrate stronger growth than their non-patenting counterparts. Present study considers IP strategies as potential firm growth determinants. Available data enables studying relation between firm growth and four IP strategies (patents, secrecy, speed and complements) among innovative Finnish small businesses. The small business perspective is important because previous studies have suggested that the patent system favors large companies at the cost of smaller firms. The data consists of merged survey and financial statement data of 469 innovative Finnish small businesses. The surveys were carried out in the beginning of millennium and employment and <b>turnover</b> <b>figures</b> cover years 2001 - 2010 and 2001 - 2009 respectively. Findings provide evidence that between 2001 and 2008 the turnover growth rates of sample firms differed statistically significantly between firms, which utilized different IP strategies. During the period patenting firms had statistically significantly higher turnover growth rates than firms relying on secrecy-based strategies and firms, which reported not to use any IP strategies. However, the difference in turnover growth rates between patenting firms and firms using “Open”-strategies (speed and/or complements) was not statistically significant. The results indicate that patenting may have provided competitive advantage for innovative small firms during 2001 - 2008 but the advantage was not significant in comparison to firms, which relied on speed and complements...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The key {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to make sense of the information environment surrounding listed U. S. companies that have exactly one sell-side stock analyst covering them. Despite the large amount of stock analyst literature, this "One man consensus" setting has previously been left without academic attention. For small and illiquid listed companies that receive little attention from the investors, coverage from even one analyst might become decisively important, either in a good or bad way depending on their recommendation. Hence, this thesis studies the market reactions to the buy-hold-sell recommendation revisions issued by stock analysts who form the analyst consensus on their own. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The data set of this study covers all single analyst consensus recommendation revisions in the U. S. stock exchanges NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX between 1994 and the end of 2014. Market reactions for these revisions are analyzed in an event study context for short-term event windows, as well as in an Ordinary Least Squares regression with and without fixed effects. A more novel influential recommendation method is also applied, based on both cumulative abnormal returns and abnormal <b>turnover</b> <b>figures.</b> A control sample of multiple-analyst consensus revisions for the same companies is introduced for comparative analysis. Both the One man consensus sample and the control sample are separately examined for upgrades and downgrades, and implications are thoroughly discussed. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS Results from the event study and the regression analysis show that on average, markets react to single analyst upgrades and downgrades in a statistical significant manner. However, the influential recommendation tests reveal that the proportion of visibly strong reactions remains small. One man consensus upgrades tend to induce stronger short-term reactions than the control sample upgrades, whereas negative reactions to downgrades are more muted than in the control sample. The tests control for firm quarterly earnings announcement events that might otherwise provoke incorrect conclusions about stock analysts' influence. Provided evidence suggests that in most cases, analyst coverage even from only one person improves the information environment for listed companies...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to understand the main factors that explain turnover and retention at DOA Ukhahlamba District and to recommend to the District and Provincial management the appropriate strategy for retaining staff. To be able to achieve this aim, the following research objectives have been visited, namely: a) turnover trends, b) analysis of primary and external turnover factors and c) primarily retention factors. Data for analysing turnover trends was collected from the 2004 to 2007 DPSA and DOA annual reports. Primary data on labour turnover and retention factors was collected from 41 employees across different sections at DOA Ukhahlamba District by means of a questionnaire survey. The data was analysed using statistical methods, including frequency distribution, chi-square test and Pearson product-moment correlation. The findings have revealed that there is no clear pattern of turnover trends at DOA and DPSA, and DOA percentage <b>turnover</b> <b>figures</b> are low in comparison with those of the DPSA. In terms of organizational-specific factors, the top three primary turnover factors were identified, namely: a) communication within the organisation, b) leadership and the organisation and participation in decision making. The research results further revealed that communication within the organization had a significant impact with regard to race, but division, location, and grades did not. With regard to the external factors, research results identified the following most important external labour turnover factors arranged according to their importance, namely: lack of availability and quality of health care services and infrastructural development; lack of available sport and recreation facilities; crime in the area and people living in the neighbourhood; lack of educational opportunities available for the family, and geographic location of place of employment. The findings further revealed the top three retention factors, were strongly significantly correlated to each other, namely: resource availability, use of discretion in handling customer complaints, and the impact of the job on society. These are positively related to intention to stay. The implications these results to the management would require the review of the organisational Human Resource Management Policy and the introduction of Attraction and Retention Policy because at present its is non existence at DOA Eastern Cape. Research limitations: the study did not fully explore ethnicity when analysing the communication within the organisation as a labour turnover factor despite having an organisation that is diverse in nature, future academic research should focus more on labour turnover at management level and moderating variables to external labour turnover factors as there is little research done in this area. The factors identified for labour turnover and retention should be treated with caution as it may not be applicable to all sector Departments in the Eastern Cape and may be limited to Ukhahlamba District due to its geographic location. This study will contribute to the body of knowledge as it will serve as a guide to Eastern Cape DOA and other sector Departments in choosing factors to consider when designing their retention strategy in order to reduce labour turnover. To the academic researchers, the first three primary retention factors identified in the survey have not been seen before, grouped and rated amongst the top three retention factors which therefore means that the management support becomes more important than looking more on salary package as the first priority factor as revealed by most of the research literature consulted (Gustafson, 2002; Mobley, 1982; Mobley, 1979; Herzberg, 2003). This shows that labour turnover and retention factors will not be the same to all organisations, the location of the business and surrounding environment should be considered carefully when designing the appropriate policy and retention strategy of the organisation. ...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, {{turnover}} in regional parliament was studied, {{as well as}} life after leaving. Life after parliament encomposes post parliamentary careers and post parliamentary political activities. To give an answer to several research questions that were formulated, turnover has been studied in the regional parliaments of Catalonia, Saxony, Flanders, Wallonia and Scotland. Both turnover at the elections and turnover during the legislative term were calculated. A post parliamentarian is defined as 'a member who left parliament {{and is no longer}} member of any parliament or government on the regional, national or European level'. Our research population consisted of 449 post parliamentarians (1999 - 2009). The latter received a postal survey in 2009 and 2010. The response rate was 37, 6 % or 169 respondents. To obtain more insight in the survey results, an in-depth interview was conducted with 55 respondents. Those who were still professionally active or unemployed were interviewed, since we were interested in their professional life after leaving. The data were analysed with SPSS and NVivo. TurnoverThe highest <b>turnover</b> <b>figures</b> were found in Flanders and Wallonia, where {{more than half of the}} Members of Parliament (MPs) left at election time. In the remaining three regions, less than half left parliament (between 20, 2 % and 45, 2 %). Of those who left at election time, only one third was still an electoral candidate. The majority (56, 6 %) left voluntarily while 27, 4 % left involuntarily and 16, 1 % had mixed feelings. 82, 1 % of those who left during the legislature left voluntarily while 14, 3 % had mixed feelings. The reasons for leaving parliament were subdivided into four categories: natural turnover, push factors, pull factors and involuntary departure. One fourth (of those who left at election time) left because of retirement (natural turnover), while push factors where responsible for 22 % of the turnover. The most important push factor, dissatisfaction, was only checked as the most important reason for leaving by one out of ten respondents (10, 2 %), but turned out to have a greater influence as one in four mentioned it when considering all reasons for leaving. Pull factors accounted for 12, 7 % of the turnover. Only 7, 6 % left parliament because of another profession (new or old job, local political mandate) which is an indication of the attractiveness of parliament while MPs did not leave in large numbers for another job. Another push factor is the tension between work and family life which was only checked by 5, 1 % as the most important reason of leaving, but turned out to be more important since 24 % mentioned it when considering all reasons. Finally, 38, 9 % checked an involuntary reason for leaving. The most obvious reason, electoral defeat, was only seen as the most important reason for leaving by 9, 3 % of the respondents. Party deselection (because of a conflict or electoral reasons) turned out to be much more important (27, 1 %). When considering all reasons for leaving party deselection was ticked by 42, 4 % of the respondents which shows the important influence of the political party in making or breaking a political career. When further examining the reasons for leaving, the most remarkable result was the fact that women seemed more vulnerable for party deselection than men. Post parliamentary careersOf the respondents who left at election time, 39, 6 % retired, while 25, 2 % took up a new job. 12, 9 % returned to their old job and 8, 6 % returned fulltime to the old job that they kept while being a parliamentarian. 12, 1 % had a local mandate as their main activity afterwards. Finally, 1, 4 % of the respondents were unemployed at the time of the survey. The professional sector before and after parliament were compared: 43, 5 % was employed in the same sector as before parliament. The analysis also showed that not everybody who had the right to return to their previous occupation, actually used it. Career transitions were calculated and showed that the studied political careers were still more traditional than transitional. The relative attractiveness of the parliamentary mandate and the first main occupation afterwards was also studied. Almost half didn't find their first occupation afterwards more or less attractive than being a parliamentarian, while 24, 2 % thought it was (much) less attractive. 63 % of those who returned to their old profession thought it was easy, while 37 % experienced difficulties. Respondents experienced difficulties because their knownledge was not up-to-date anymore, because they had to rebuild their network or regain their clientele. These are mostly non-political problems and can also be experienced by returners in other professional contexts. Those who had a right to return to their previous occupation seemed to experience less problems, probably because there are regulations that have to be followed. The common image that the political party provides a 'cushion' to fall back on for failed MPs has to be put into perspective, as only 14, 7 % of the respondents were active in the political sector afterwards and only a few received a job offer from their political party. Parties didn't seem to have an outplacement policy, but the majority of the respondents also did not expect it. Moreover, the categorisation of post parliamentary careers showed that the majority had retirement, a previous occupation or a local mandate waiting for them, and therefore they were in no need of help from the political party. Only one fourth of the respondents had to find a new job at the moment of leaving parliament. However, their search for work was often not easy, since half experienced it as problematic. The political colour and general negative image of politicians was disadvantageous, and employers often had the idea that they would return to politics at the next election. However, the search for work was not negative for all of them: several received job offers, looked for jobs themselves, reoriented themselves or became self-employed. The parliamentary expertise (insight in the political system, expertise in certain domains, skills and network) wasexperienced as an added value by many respondents while 51, 7 % saw a substantive connection with their occupation afterwards. Contacts from the network built during the parliamentary mandate helped 40 % of the respondents in their search for work, while 26, 7 % worked for one of those contacts afterwards. Half of those who had to search for a new occupation, found one within half a year. When considering these findings, one can conclude that the resettlement arrangement in some regions seems to be too generous at the moment and that they could be adjusted. However, one also has to consider that even when having an occupation, one can experience further consequences of the end of the political career (the political colour, less clients, lower salary). The resettlement grants were used for several purposes: to cover a period of unemployment, to have a sabbatical, to work for free for an organisation or the political party or to rebuild or start a self-employed activity. The second and third purpose does not seem to correspond with the initial intention of the resettlement grant. Another common idea is that parliamentarians end up in high functions outside of politics afterwards and use the parliament as a springboard. This image was put into perspective in this research since only 15, 6 % of those with a new job afterwards experienced it as a step up. 43, 8 % experienced it as a step back. However, it is not because one takes a step back in their career, that the new function is an unattractive one. In sum, only a few MPs seem to obtain high profile jobs afterwards and it seems that the education and earlier work experience is more a determining factor than the parliamentary expertise. Of course also the political party, the notoriety and the other political mandates of the MP play a role when obtaining a high-profile job. Post parliamentary political activitiesThe re-election ambition of the research population was modest since only 11, 8 % were an electoral candidate again at parliamentary elections after leaving. Moreover, the majority had an ineligible place on the list to support the political party. Of the respondents, only 7, 1 % had the ambition to be re-elected in a parliament. Those without further re-election ambition had changed priorities, expected a negative effect on their current professional activity or didn't think the political party would still be interested in them as an electoral candidate. Post parliamentary political activities were subdivided into three categories: the political party, a local political mandate and the membership of an assocation of former MPs. 10, 2 % left their political party after leaving and two chose to join another one which resulted in 91 % of the respondents belonging to a political party at the time of survey. 85, 9 % of them still participated in party activities and 71, 9 % spent time on these activities, daily to a couple of times a month. In sum, they still seemed very much involved with their political party. 45, 5 % had a local mandate afterleaving parliament but only a fewstill showed the ambition to stand for re-election. 58, 6 % were member of the official association of former MPs (while not considering Scotland). When considering all three activities, only five respondents (or 3 %) were not involved in any of them. In sum, only a few turned their backs on politics, despite the high number of respondents who left because of party deselection.

40|$|This work {{provides}} a descriptive overview of Russian markets for financial derivatives. Available {{figures for the}} exchange-traded and over-the-counter-traded derivatives in Russia show that the Russian derivatives markets experienced enormous growth rates since the financial crisis in 1998. Starting from a very low level, turnover of exchange-traded derivatives in Russia rose from 2000 to 2006 on average 168 percent per year and reached a total turnover of EUR 102 billion in 2006. Among futures, equity futures, followed by currency futures, are the most traded exchange-traded derivatives in Russia. Turnover of exchange-traded derivatives on interest rates, bonds or even commodities represent {{only a very small}} fraction of the total <b>turnover.</b> Available <b>figures</b> for the Russian OTC foreign exchange derivatives market suggest for the period between April 2004 and 2007 an annual turnover growth rate of 47 percent. Foreign exchange swaps in RUR against USD and in USD against EUR and other currencies were the most popular OTC foreign exchange derivatives in April 2004 and 2007.

40|$|Interregional {{migration}} is analyzed {{with respect to}} its short-run responsiveness to economic fluctuations and its efficiency as a spatial labour market allocation mechanism. Using a space-time analytical framework, in-migration to four fast growing States of the United States is analyzed over the period 1958 - 1975. It is shown via a time-series model, employing a Koyck-distributed lag methodology, that short-run in-{{migration is}} in fact responsive to economic fluctuations. Both employment and <b>turnover</b> variables <b>figure</b> prominently in this regard. By a cross-sectional analysis it is also shown that in-migrants to fast growing States do not necessarily come from depressed or low-growth regions. Thus, interregional migration {{may not be an}} efficient allocator of labour across the aggregate spatial system in the short or long run. N. B. Professor Clark was based at the John F.

40|$|International audienceFor {{historical}} reasons, {{many large}} industrial sites {{have their own}} power generation units, either because the site was isolated when it was built or because the local network was not reliable enough to ensure regular production. This can apply to energy-intensive industries like refineries or LNG plants in the Oil & Gas sector, but also to mining plants, metal industries and chemical plants. These generation assets are usually operated in a suboptimal way, the only concern being {{the safety of the}} process. The focus of this work is to determine how industrial plant operators can make optimal use of these assets, considering interactions with the electricity markets. Based on the mathematical description of this optimization problem, a model achieving a double target is introduced. First, to develop a standard architecture that can be easily translated from one case to another. Then, to assess the maximum expected savings and the induced strategy.

40|$|AbstractFor {{historical}} reasons, {{many large}} industrial sites {{have their own}} power generation units, whether {{it is because the}} site was isolated when built up or the local network wasn’t reliable enough to ensure a regular production. This can apply for energy-intensive industries like refineries or LNG plants in the Oil & Gas sector, but also mining plants, metal industries or chemical plants for instance. These generation assets are usually operated in a suboptimal way, the only concern being the safety of the process. The gist of this work will be to determine an optimal use of these assets for the industrial plant operator, considering interactions with the electricity markets. Laying on the mathematical description of this optimization problem, a model was built up following a double target. First, to develop a standard architecture that would easily be translated from one case to the other. Then, to assess how high the expected savings could go and what would the induced strategy be. This model has been applied to a refinery case study, where the expected earnings rose up to 8 M€ per year. It accounts for 1 % of the <b>turnover.</b> The <b>figures</b> obtained show that this is a relevant business concept. Following this trend, other energy-intensive case studies are being considered, from cement plant to paper plant...|$|R

Improving its SEC Tournament seeding by two spots for the second straight year under Anderson, Arkansas finished fifth in the league standings at 10-8 while reaching the 20-win plateau (22-12) {{for the first time since}} the aforementioned 2007-08 campaign. Highlighting the 22-win season was the program’s first-ever season sweep of SEC rival Kentucky and a 5-1 mark against teams that advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament and NIT. The Arkansas faithful saw signs of the Coach Nolan Richardson-era style of play that Anderson teaches, as the Razorbacks led the SEC in scoring (80.1), assists (15.3), steals (8.4) and <b>turnover</b> margin (+5.5), <b>figures</b> that all ranked in the top 30 in the nation. Individual development was also critical to Arkansas’ improvement in 2013-14, as 6'10" [...] Bobby Portis became the sixth freshman in program history to earn All-SEC honors as a freshman, snagging a spot on the All-SEC second team, SEC All-Freshman squad and USBWA All-District VII team.|$|R

The development of previous years is also shown in a sufficiently categorized form. The tables mainly refer {{to the results of}} the Association's own findings on production, domestic sales, and the exports of motor vehicles, especially classified according to types. These data are completed by statistics pertaining to the automotive industry which stem from the official findings of the Federal Statistical Bureau (production <b>figures,</b> <b>turnovers,</b> employees, cost structure, exports etc.) and the Federal Bureau for Moto Vehicles (new registrations, owner changes, numbers, deletions etc.). Statistical data relating to the infrastructure of roads, traffic performance power, fuel consumption, car maintenance costs, and the development of accidents - which are {{only a few of the}} important topics - complete the informative view at the motor vehicle industry.

40|$|The {{valuation}} of synergy {{is vital to}} the success of any merger, however, given current valuation methodologies and the complexity of the task; it is also the most challenging element of merger and acquisition pricing. Conventional valuation methods assume that sales figures and market share of the acquiring company are easily transferable within the new entity. Current synergy practices also assume amalgamating various corporate functions will produce significant cost reductions. The key component missing from current methodologies is the failure to analyze every corporation as a complex system containing various elements and relations. If such a delicate system is segmented due to a merger, the outcome measured in <b>turnover</b> and profit <b>figures</b> can not be accurately forecasted by simply aggregating key financial figures. The goal {{of this article is to}} go beyond the simplicity of current methods in order to develop a methodology better suited for evaluating synergy effects. This new approach integrates elements from both the framework of knowledge management and the sociological theory of systems and elements. The alternative methods proposed in this article will simultaneously deliver creative and innovative solutions to enhance the success of mergers and acquisitions. These new proposals also help to clarify the short comings plaguing traditional methods which inevitably lead to the destruction of shareholder wealth. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the transport of}} a passive scalar through the turbulent-turbulent interface between two decaying isotropic turbulent flows with different kinetic energy. Although the concentration of a passive substance exhibits a complex behaviour that shows many phenomenological parallels with the turbulent velocity field, the statistical properties of passive scalar turbulence are in part decou­pled {{from those of the}} underlying velocity [1, 2]. In our numerical experiment, the passive scalar is initially uniform in each of the two isotropic regions. The interaction of the two isotropic flows generates a high scalar variance region in the centre of the mixing layer and two intermittent scalar fronts arise at the margins of the mixing layer. The velocity field instead presents one front only which is placed in the part of the field where the kinetic energy is lower [3, 4] or, in case the ener­gy is uniform but the correlation is varying, where the integral scale is lower [5]. In {{the central part of the}} mixing layer, between the two intermittent fronts, the spectrum of the scalar fluctuation shows a full range of scales just after one eddy <b>turnover</b> time (see <b>figure</b> below). Moreover, the scalar spectrum shows a more prominent inertial range region than the velocity spectrum - a wider range with a scaling exponent closer to - 5 / 3 - a feature which has been observed also in ho­mogeneous flows at moderate Reynolds numbers, see [6, 7]. This feature is preserved for about ten eddy turnover times, during which the scalar variance decays slower than the velocity fluctuatio...|$|R
