5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, about <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted {{to one of the}} boxes of clothes.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} {{can also}} be a risk to child safety in another way; parents can get addicted to games and neglect their children.

25|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide.

25|$|Bereavement, while {{a normal}} part of life, carries a degree of risk when severe. Severe {{reactions}} affect approximately 10% to 15% of people. Severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event. Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations. Some researchers have found an increased risk of marital breakup following <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> for example. Others have found no increase. John James, author of the Grief Recovery Handbook and founder of the Grief Recovery Institute, reported that his marriage broke up {{after the death of his}} infant son.|$|E
25|$|There is one {{additional}} theory {{that explains the}} occurrence of the reminiscence bump: the life script account. A life script refers to the series of culturally important transitional events {{that are expected to}} occur in a certain order at various points during the life span. During early adulthood one starts to make important decisions and have influencing experiences on his or her identity. The memories during this time period are therefore more significantly remembered because they are what has essentially determined and influenced their life script (Habernas & Bluck, 2000). A life script typically has the majority of expected transitional experiences occur during early adulthood (Gluck & Bluck, 2007), and usually include includes positive experiences such as marriage, the birth of a baby, or buying a house. Events that deviate from the life script are typically sad and traumatic. These events, such as <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> are not culturally expected and often do not show a peak of recall at any specific point during the life span. Life scripts act as a way to structure memory and lead to the expectation that the happiest and the most important life events form the reminiscence bump. Contrary to the recall of happy events, the recall of sad events remains stable across the life span and does not exhibit a bump in recall.|$|E

500|$|Although {{hinted at}} {{indirectly}} in some poems, Riley wrote very little on serious subject matter, and actually mocked attempts at serious poetry.

500|$|A foetus, {{even at a}} late {{stage of}} pregnancy, is not {{protected}} by the law of homicide (rather, other offences have been created to prevent the proscribed harm).

This was confirmed in 1998 in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 1994), even where the foetus is viable and could have survived if born before the offence was committed. The confused rationale appears to match the complicated moral and biological distinction on which it is based; there is huge social significance placed upon birth and thus the law is unlikely to change [...] Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights {{has not yet been}} interpreted to conflict with the English law.
