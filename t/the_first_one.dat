50|$|Millions {{of years}} later, many younger races {{had begun to}} evolve on {{thousands}} of worlds and <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Ones</b> realized {{that in order for}} these new sentients to succeed, the ancient races would have to move on.

Several of <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Ones</b> decided to stay behind and shepherd the younger races until they were fit to control their own destiny. The primary caretakers were the Vorlons and, surprisingly enough, the Shadows.|$|R
