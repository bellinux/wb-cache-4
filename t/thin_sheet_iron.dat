5000|$|Potts is {{associated}} with improvements to the sadiron (a/k/a sad iron and sad-iron) that she made {{from the age of}} 19. The old English word of sad before the [...] "iron" [...] meant heavy, dense, and solid. Potts's patented double-pointed shaped clothes iron was made of hollow rather than solid metal. The flat iron's bottom was of thick iron and the sides were <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> of <b>iron.</b> The hollow iron was poured and filled with material that was a poor conductor of heat, such as cement or clay. Since her father was a plasterer by trade she experimented on filling some with a type of plaster of Paris. The advantage of these materials was that they did not radiate heat up like the predecessor old-style conventional solid metal clothes irons. Her patent claimed it retained heat longer and as a result would need less reheating.|$|R

5000|$|After the {{introduction}} of Archer's collodion process a number of photographers experimented with materials other than glass {{to use as a}} base for collodion positives. Around 1853 Adolphe Alexandre Martin (1824-1896) a French teacher, put forward the idea of using <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> of enamelled <b>iron</b> and in 1854 a Liverpool photographer suggested photographs on dark-coloured leather. In the early 1850s, Mayall worked on producing a substance that resembled ivory and could hold photographic images on its surface. He hoped {{he would be able to}} produce photographs that closely resembled the portrait miniature on ivory. In October 1855, Mayall filed a patent for his [...] "Artificial Ivory for receiving photographic pictures." [...] (British Patent No 2381) A mixture of powdered bone or ivory and albumen was worked into a paste and combined with gelatine. The 'artificial ivory' mixture was rolled out in thin slabs and specially prepared to receive photographic images.|$|R
50|$|Laminated {{magnetic}} cores {{are made}} of stacks of <b>thin</b> <b>iron</b> <b>sheets</b> coated with an insulating layer, lying {{as much as possible}} parallel with the lines of flux. The layers of insulation serve as a barrier to eddy currents, so eddy currents can only flow in narrow loops within the thickness of each single lamination. Since the current in an eddy current loop is proportional to the area of the loop, this prevents most of the current from flowing, reducing eddy currents to a very small level. Since power dissipated is proportional to the square of the current, breaking a large core into narrow laminations reduces the power losses drastically. From this, {{it can be seen that}} the thinner the laminations, the lower the eddy current losses.|$|R

40|$|Taussig (1915, p. 151) himself {{suggested}} that “the {{same sort of}} growth [in iron and steel] would doubtless have taken place eventually, tariff or no tariff; but not so soon or on so great a scale. ” 2 Such assertions require substantiation, and if true the question then becomes one of whether it proved worthwhile to impose protective tariffs {{in order to establish}} domestic production of a product in advance of when it otherwise would have arisen. This paper investigates such issues by focusing on a segment of the iron and steel industry that has been heralded as possibly the best example of infant industry protection. The experience of the tinplate industry, which produces <b>thin</b> <b>sheets</b> of <b>iron</b> or steel that have been coated with tin, is unique on several dimensions:! Unlike most manufacturing industries, tinplates did not receive significant tariff protection after the Civil War, apparently due to a mistaken interpretation of the tariff code. Left without adequate protection, there was virtually no domestic production prior to 1890. ! The McKinley tariff of 1890 substantially raised the duty on imported tinplate to encourage the entry and growth of domestic producers. The act also contained an unusual provision in which the tariff would be completely eliminated in six years if, by that time, domestic production did not amount to at least one-third of imports. ! The tariff succeeded in promoting domestic production and output rapidly expanded...|$|R
