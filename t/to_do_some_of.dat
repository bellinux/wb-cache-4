She also claimed she was instructed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Prince Harry's coursework to enable him to pass AS Art. As evidence, Forsyth provided secretly recorded conversations with both Prince Harry and her Head of Department, Ian Burke. An employment tribunal in July 2005 found {{that she had}} been unfairly dismissed and criticised Burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story. It also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the Head Master for not reviewing the case independently.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club {{named the}} series the 27th best {{television}} series of 2014, noting that, [...] "The ongoing sixth season has ventured into {{even more dangerous}} emotional territory: parenthood. Coupled with deep dives {{into the history of}} Ooo and the increasing visual confidence of episodes like the surreal, breathtaking 'Food Chain,' Adventure Time appears ready to use its considerable heft and years of laying narrative foundations <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> TV's finest storytelling about grappling with the past and accepting the responsibilities of adulthood." [...] The site selected [...] "Food Chain" [...] and [...] "Breezy" [...] as stand-out episodes from 2014, and it later named the season finale [...] "The Comet" [...] one of the best TV episodes of 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{condition}} of the swing bridge at Bathpool caused a change in policy. There were objections to the plan {{to replace it with}} a fixed bridge with limited headroom, and the planning application was deferred. By 1983, a six-year plan to restore the canal was fully costed, and it was adopted by the British Waterways Board, the County Council, Sedgemoor District Council and Taunton Deane Borough Council in the following year. The scheme was supported by the West Country Branch of the Inland Waterways Association, who offered the services of the Waterway Recovery Group, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the work. The swing bridges at Crossways, Boat and Anchor, and Fordgate were rebuilt, and by 1987, [...] of canal were available for navigation. After some teething problems, it was decided that many {{of the rest of the}} accommodation bridges would be raised to give [...] of headroom, rather than rebuilding them as swing bridges. Restoration of the bridges at the Taunton end continued during the early 1990s, and the canal was finally re-opened in 1994.|$|E

500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. Smith wished River Song's entrance to be a shocking surprise to the audience. A stunt double was used for some shots of the scene where River flies out of the Byzantium airlock, but Kingston wished <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> it herself. The scene was filmed on a greenscreen with Kingston hooked up on wires that pulled her up and backwards as a wind machine was blown to create the effect of the airlock. Kingston said she [...] "absolutely loved" [...] filming the scene. For the scene in which sand pours out of Amy's eye as she rubs it, an eye patch containing sand that would be released when Gillan rubbed it was placed over her eye.|$|E
500|$|Some of the coinage {{which had}} {{vanished}} from circulation during the Civil War {{and had been}} exported to South America continued {{to be used in}} [...] Chilean trade as nationals found their local coinage valued poorly with the American pieces. In 1866, the Chilean government instructed its representative in Washington to approach the U.S. State Department for permission to have their coinage dies made in America. [...] The Andrew Johnson administration was happy to oblige; Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch gave the Chileans a letter of introduction to Longacre in Philadelphia. [...] Longacre was engaged by the Chileans to redesign five silver and four gold coins, and he agreed, so long as permission from McCulloch was obtained for him to accept an outside fee. [...] McCulloch was initially agreeable, but Mint Director Pollock raised objection on the ground that government property should not be used to enable private gain. [...] Eventually, all parties reached agreement that Longacre could do the work at a total cost of $10,000 provided that he brought in an outside engraver <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the work under Longacre's supervision; the chief engraver selected Anthony C. Paquet, one of his former assistants. [...] Resistance at the Mint dissolved with Pollock's resignation over President Johnson's Reconstruction policies, and the dies and hubs (from which more dies could be made) were created beginning in November 1866, probably in-house at the Philadelphia Mint. [...] Longacre's designs for Chile were used until new ones were adopted in the 1890s.|$|E

Barry Newman learned from Loftin and was encouraged by the stunt coordinator <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his own stunts. In the scene before Kowalski crashes into the bulldozer, Newman drove and performed a 180-degree turn on the road himself without the director's knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1929, Stieglitz {{was told}} that the {{building}} that housed the Room would be torn down later in the year. After a last show of Demuth's work in May, he retreated to Lake George for the summer, exhausted and depressed. The Strands raised nearly sixteen thousand dollars for a new gallery for Stieglitz, who reacted harshly, saying it was time for [...] "young ones" [...] <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the work he had been shouldering for so many years.

2500|$|During the 1950s, {{students}} {{adopted a}} star-hexagon-square {{structure for the}} bonfire. [...] Through at least the late 1980s, it was a tradition {{for the number of}} tiers to equal the year of the first-year class, i.e., in 1985 the first-year class was the Class of 1988, and the bonfire was 88 tiers high. [...] On or about the bonfire of the Class of 1990 the College put a cap on the height of the bonfire, as the increasingly tall structure was increasingly dangerous, and following the bonfire accident at Texas A in 1999, the school hired professionals <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the building; nevertheless the night still remains a highlight of the school year.|$|E

2500|$|Reports of the {{collapse}} of this part of the Union line caused great consternation at Grant's headquarters, leading to an interchange that is widely quoted in Grant biographies. An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed to be waiting for such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time.

2500|$|In England and Wales, {{the strict}} {{separation}} between the duties of solicitor and barrister was partially broken down, with the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 removing the monopoly of barristers to act as advocates and granting solicitors rights of audience in specified circumstances. Solicitors came frequently {{to appear in the}} lower courts and, subject to passing a test and thereby obtaining Higher Rights of Audience, increasingly in the higher courts such as the High Court of Justice of England and Wales and the Court of Appeal. While the independent bar continued to exist in a largely unchanged state, a few firms of solicitors employed their own barristers and solicitor advocates <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their court work. The rules preventing barristers from being directly instructed were revised to allow direct instruction [...] by certain organizations such as trade unions, accountants, and similar groups. Additionally, barristers who have completed the Bar Council's [...] "Public Access" [...] course can take instructions directly from members of the public under the Public Access Scheme.|$|E
2500|$|Gail Stevens came {{on board}} to oversee casting globally. Stevens had worked with Boyle {{throughout}} his career and was well known for discovering new talent. Meredith Tucker was appointed to cast out of the US. The film-makers then travelled to Mumbai in September 2007 with a partial crew and began hiring local cast and crew for production in Karjat. Originally appointed {{as one of the}} five casting directors in India, Loveleen Tandan has stated, [...] "I suggested to Danny and Simon Beaufoy, the writer of Slumdog, that it was important <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> it in Hindi to bring the film alive [...] They asked me to pen the Hindi dialogues which I, of course, instantly agreed to do. And as we drew closer to the shoot date, Danny asked me to step in as the co-director." [...] Boyle then decided to translate {{nearly a third of the}} film's English dialogue into Hindi. The director fibbed to Warner Independent's president that he wanted 10% of the dialogue in Hindi, and she approved the change. Filming locations included shooting in Mumbai's megaslum and in shantytown parts of Juhu, so film-makers controlled the crowds by befriending onlookers. Filming began on 5 November 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Cook {{aimed to}} write the stories for the comic to be {{something}} that she herself would enjoy [...] "as a Pony fan and an all-ages writer", and planned to continue {{in the spirit of the}} show, avoiding the feel of a [...] "freebie Barbie comic" [...] that would otherwise be packaged with toys. She further stated that she wanted to write an all-ages book, something that parents can share and read with their children. Like the show, she had included pop cultural references that adults will get, but does not try to shoehorn these in. She used the first four-story arc as a means for herself to get comfortable in writing for the characters, thus bringing back an established villain as the antagonist for the first story. Cook does plan to introduce new characters and settings in later issues. She noted that the first story include dark and scary elements, but she does not consider them any darker than the show itself. At the 2013 San Diego Comic Convention, Cook commented that in considering how dark to take the stories, [...] "My personal gauge is Dark Crystal. If it’s darker than the Skeksis sucking the life out of a Podling, I don’t go there." [...] Though normally Cook would write and draw her own comics, her work in the My Little Pony comic was her first foray into writing out a script and directing others to draw out the art. She expressed pleasure at working with Price has they have worked well together in the past. However, Cook does continue <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the art; the first issue contains a short two-page comic written and drawn by herself.|$|E
