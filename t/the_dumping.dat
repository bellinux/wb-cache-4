40|$|In July 2008, a {{self-employed}} construction contractor (the victim) sustained fatal injuries when he {{was crushed}} against the cab of a <b>dump</b> truck by <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> body at a residential construction site. At {{the time of the}} incident, the victim was using <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> truck to deliver soil to the site and then grading the soil with a backhoe. The victim worked alone and there was no witness to the incident. The incident was initially reported by the property owner who arrived on site at approximately 5 : 00 PM and found both <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> truck and <b>the</b> backhoe idling. The property owner saw that the victim was crushed between the back of the cab and the front of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> body that was in the down position. With <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> body down, <b>the</b> width of the space was 7 inches. <b>The</b> <b>dump</b> body movement was controlled by a dump lever located inside the cab.

By the end of the century, the reclamation of the surrounding marshes and <b>the</b> <b>dumping</b> of ballast by passing ships had accelerated the natural processes and the anchorage was ruined. The surrounding region was also less strategically important than it had once been: towns like Winchelsea and Rye were in decline, peace had been made with France in 1558 and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England.|$|E

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. <b>The</b> <b>dumping</b> began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for <b>the</b> <b>dumping</b> of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

40|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are alkaline metals commonly occurring in natural environ-ment. In clean groundwater their content usually does {{not exceed the}} value of 100 mg⋅dm- 3 (Na) and 90 mg⋅dm- 3 (K). Leakage waters of unsealed or improperly sealed refuse dumps constitute a potential grave source of water environment contamination. In the initial years of refuse <b>dumping</b> <b>the</b> leakage may contain up to 2, 500 mg⋅dm- 3 of sodium and up to 3, 100 mg⋅dm- 3 of potassium. The leakage from “old ” dumps contains up to 3, 700 mg⋅dm- 3 sodium and up to 1, 580 mg⋅dm- 3 potassium. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to demonstrate the character and the dynamics of the changes in sodium {{and potassium}} concentrations in the leakage waters of <b>the</b> Maœlice Re-fuse <b>Dump</b> in Wrocaw and in the groundwater in the adjacent areas. Since sand-gravel deposits lie in the base of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> and <b>the</b> groundwater level is fairly high, contact oc-curs between the groundwater and <b>the</b> <b>dumped</b> waste as well as contamination transfer. Only part of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> has a sealing and a drainage carrying the leakage to a tank. In the late 1990 s the exploitation of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> was terminated and rehabilitation started with a view to limiting the access of the water to <b>the</b> refuse <b>dump.</b> <b>The</b> paper presented the results of the research covering the period from 1995 to 2007 on sodium and potassium contents in the groundwater coming to <b>the</b> <b>dump,</b> in <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> leakage and in the groundwater coming out of <b>the</b> <b>dump.</b> <b>The</b> research has shown that both the concentrations and the proportions between sodium and potassium contents in the groundwater coming to <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> stayed within <b>the</b> natural ranges, exceeding them only in 2000 - 2001.

This paper {{presents}} the results of the research which was conducted in <b>the</b> Kariotiškės Garbage <b>Dump</b> in 2006 - 2008. Research method: visual ethnography. Research was conducted in collaboration with Mindaugas Survila, a film maker and operator. Collected data: field notes, photos, audio and video tapes, etc. Research participants: about 30 people who worked and lived in <b>the</b> Kariotiškės <b>Dump</b> during its closing. A few general features of life in <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> are briefly introduced by the author: Work. Work there entails picking trash (metals, glass and plastic) and selling it to “recyclers”. What attracts people to <b>the</b> <b>dump?</b> (1) <b>The</b> possibility to earn fair money. (2) The possibility to find useful things. (3) The possibility to be successful and have special findings. Income. It depends on 4 factors: age, sex, work and success. The average income of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> people can vary from a few tens to a few hundreds of litas per day. Housing. There are some several types of typical houses or slums. Construction: (1) houses built on the earth, (2) houses dug in the earth. Heating: (1) houses with a stove, (2) houses without a stove. Size: (1) one-room houses, (2) two-room houses,(3) houses with belongings. All the houses are built and equipped using the material found in <b>the</b> <b>dump.</b> Clothing. There are 3 sources to get clothing: (1) to pick from the “Charity Car”, (2) to find in <b>the</b> <b>dump,</b> (3) to buy in the shops. Meals. There are 3 sources to get food: (1) to find in <b>the</b> <b>dump,</b> (2) to buy in the nearby villages, (3) to buy in the shop in the nearby town. Alcohol. Drinking alcohol {{plays an important role in}} the everyday lives of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> people. It forms the biggest part of their expenses. Relations. <b>The</b> <b>dump</b> people mostly live in pairs. There are some groupings of pairs (some pairs communicate among themselves more than other pairs). However, <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> people do not form a strong community. Their identity relates mostly with the nearest group. Relations with society. <b>The</b> <b>dump</b> people have <b>the</b> closest relations with (1) their relatives, (2) the official workers of <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> and (3) people from the nearby villages. The society groups which most often come to <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> include (1) <b>the</b> police, (2) the medical service, (3) volunteers and charity workers, (4) the hunters for inadvertently thrown away things and (5) others (journalists, students, artists, etc.). People who worked and lived in <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> of Kariotiškės had different lifestyles. However, they were bound together by the same living territory, similar work and common worries.
