After his father died, Fleischer moved with his mother <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Trondheim. His {{childhood}} home was one characterized by Christianity, simplicity and frugality.|$|E

General Lei wanted his son <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a Christian and American environment. The young son, named James Cadbury Lei, {{became a part of}} the family, and in return, General Lei contributed funds to {{construct}} a small hospital near Canton in Honam Island.|$|E
25|$|In a study {{performed}} at Örebro University, mothers {{of young children}} were interviewed to study attitudes on swedishness, multiculturalism and segregation. It concluded that while many expressed values as ethnic diversity being an enriching factor, but when in practice it came to choosing schools or choosing district to move to, ensuring the children had a access to a school with robust Swedish majority as they don't wanted their children <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a school as a minority and getting a good Swedish language learning environment.|$|E

25|$|With all {{the focus}} on veterans, the {{children}} are left <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> sometimes harsh, usually very strict environments with no recognition and no help. With enormous differences between military children and civilian children, one might think {{that there would be}} inquiry into the effects, yet few can be found readily available. Mary Edwards Werstch writes about her experiences, as well as the experiences of those she has interviewed, in her book Brats: Growing up inside the Fortress. Pat Conroy also sheds light on the difficult circumstances of growing up in his book (later a movie), The Great Santini.|$|E
500|$|For {{his eighth}} birthday, Stevens {{received}} a new basketball hoop. [...] "It’s {{so much fun}} to dream in your driveway," [...] he later remarked. [...] "That’s where my friends and I hung out. It {{was a lot of fun}} <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> that era." [...] When a friend, Brandon Monk, had a basketball court installed in his back yard, Stevens [...] "appeared instantaneously." [...] He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for grilled cheese sandwiches over to Monk's house, so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the commission's vote in January, the {{boardroom}} was crowded with people who held some kind of interest in the issue. Busloads of churchgoers arrived {{from as far away as}} Homestead and picketed outside; there was no corresponding organized show of support for the ordinance. Inside the boardroom, supporters and opposers took the entire allotted time to speak. Bryant reflected most of those opposing the law, telling the Dade County Commission, [...] "The ordinance condones immorality and discriminates against my children's rights <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a healthy, decent community". The few members of the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays who were present were stunned, as was Ruth Shack, at the number and force of the hundreds of protesters who filled the commission room, and held placards and pickets outside. But the ordinance passed by a 5-3 vote.|$|E

500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a family of love, but one where my mother always reminded me that what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{was educated}} at Monk's Walk School, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Dixon's parents split up when Dixon was four and Dixon's father moved away, {{resulting}} in Dixon later describing her family life as [...] "very dysfunctional". Between {{the ages of}} eight and ten, Dixon witnessed her mother suffer domestic violence from her partner; she only spoke publicly about the issue 21 years later, in 2010. Dixon created a documentary for the BBC, Don't Hit My Mum, regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: [...] "When I think about that time, I don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember any fun times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it. The negative times and the scary times have blocked anything that was good... I believe that every child has the right <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an environment where they feel secure and fearless going into the world, and I didn't really feel that".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
50|$|Mumford {{attributes}} {{the development of}} his laid back style of pop, funk, rock, and reggae <b>to</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Allenhurst, where his primary pastimes were surfing, skateboarding in the empty Allenhurst pool, and hanging out on the boardwalk or by the lagoons. <b>Growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an urban environment, Mumford says he also leaned towards hip hop music, and has at times incorporated it into his music.|$|R

500|$|When first {{built in}} 1869, Sri Temasek was the {{residence}} of the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements (later Colonial Secretary/Chief Secretary of Singapore). All holders of the position had resided in Sri Temasek from 1869 to 1959. It is currently designated as the official residence of the Prime Minister of Singapore since 1959, though none {{of the past and}} present holders of the post, Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Hsien Loong, have lived in it as a family home. In the 1998 book Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas, Lee Kuan Yew said that when he became Prime Minister in 1959 he and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek with their three children, who were then aged seven, five and two, because the couple [...] "did not want them <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs". The family did stay there in 1965 for a short time for security reasons when Singapore was expelled from Malaysia. Apart from that, according to a 2000 Straits Times interview with Kwa, the Lee children often played in the grounds of the house in the evening while their father played golf or made use of the practice tee and putting green.|$|E
500|$|The pro-Church accounts, by contrast, {{described}} a boy very much resolved {{to stay where}} he was, and horrified by his mother's exhortations {{to return to the}} Judaism of his ancestors. In this narrative, the main reason for the Mortaras' grief was not that their son had been taken, but that he now stood <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Christian faith. According to La Civiltà Cattolica, Marianna flew into a rage on seeing a medallion hanging from Edgardo's neck bearing the image of the Virgin Mary, and ripped it off; one article {{went so far as to}} claim the Jewish mother had done this with the words: [...] "I'd rather see you dead than a Christian!" [...] Some of the Church's critics had charged that by keeping Edgardo, it was violating the commandment that a child should honour his father and mother—La Civiltà Cattolica countered that Edgardo still loved his family despite their religious differences and indeed, after being taught by the priests to read and write, had chosen to write his first letter to his mother, signing it [...] "your most affectionate little son". Louis Veuillot, the ultramontane editor of the L'Univers newspaper and one of the Pope's staunchest defenders, reported after meeting Edgardo in Rome that the boy had told him [...] "that he loves his father and his mother, and that he will go to live with them when he is older... so that he can speak to them of Saint Peter, of God, and of the most Holy Mary." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike some {{programs}} that advance {{the age of}} a newborn over {{a short period of}} time, I Love Lucy at first allowed the Little Ricky character <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> real time.

However, for the 1956-57 season, Little Ricky suddenly aged by two years, becoming a young school-age boy from 1956 to 1960. Five actors played the role, two sets of twins and later Keith Thibodeaux, whose stage name when playing Ricky Ricardo, Jr. was Richard Keith.
