Besides, <b>the</b> users’ <b>charging</b> behaviors are affected by many factors. For example, the residual energy of battery decides the travel distance of EV and if an EV has more residual energy, <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> willing is lower. Because EV users don’t have much willing to change their charging time and place just as in <b>the</b> past, <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> habit may also affect <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> decision.
