5|$|A {{nurse at}} Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed {{years after the}} patient's release from the asylum that the woman had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> was another {{daughter}} of the Tsar, Anastasia, {{in the autumn of}} 1921. However, the patient herself could not recall the incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim, or weave it into their narrative.|$|E

While attending a Vogue fashion dinner in New York City in November, Baz Luhrmann’s wife, Catherine Martin, <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> had the part. In May 2012, she was a co-chair, alongside Anna Wintour, for the Gatsby-themed 2012 Met Ball Gala.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-four {{hours after}} his arrest, King {{was allowed to}} see local {{attorneys}} from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home {{after the birth of}} their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E

5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

25|$|Besant {{began to}} {{question}} her own faith. She turned to leading churchmen for advice, going to see Edward Bouverie Pusey, {{one of the leaders}} of the Oxford Movement within the Church of England.

Besant returned to Frank to make a last unsuccessful effort to repair the marriage. She finally left for London.|$|E
25|$|Dickinson {{returned}} to the small screen in March 1974 for an episode of the critically acclaimed hit anthology series Police Story. The guest appearance proved to be so popular, NBC offered Dickinson her own television show, which became a ground-breaking weekly series called Police Woman; {{it was the first}} successful dramatic TV series to feature a woman in the title role. At first, Dickinson was reluctant, but when producers <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> could become a household name, she accepted the role. They were right.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} scandal {{occurred}} on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured {{the services of}} a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> could make money by working for him—she understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that she could not see behind her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a lettre de cachet (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, excluding Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The lettre de cachet would later prove disastrous for the marquis.|$|E
25|$|In Trust, Truth and Traffic, Naomi has {{embarked}} on {{her career as a}} free lance event planner, and she has even managed to spot her probable new client. Naomi is trying her best to convince her possible new client. She is also faced with a problem when TA, Naomi's physics class partner, informs her that she has to pass his physics class, if she wants to pass the sophomore year. It turns out the TA is hurt, as Naomi has never invited him to any of the parties she has thrown in the past year. Later on, Naomi decides to help Liam make Vanessa’s party a success, so she can invite the TA to the party, and score a few brownie points. At the party, Naomi tells TA that she would rather work hard to get good marks on her project, than him favoring her in any way. In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> would not hire her without her having any professional experiences.|$|E

She came ninth in the 3000m at the 2014 European Team Championships then made her debut for England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, running a {{personal}} best of 32:33.35 minutes to come {{fourth in the}} 10,000m (beaten only by Kenyan opposition). Her third and final international outing that year was her most successful. At the 2014 European Cross Country Championships she ran in the senior race for the first time. Aiming for a top ten placing, she ran hard from the front and was rewarded with a silver medal after losing a close finish to team mate Gemma Steel. The two shared in the women's senior team title. As the top-ranked British indoor runner over 3000m, she was initially invited by British Athletics to compete at the 2014 IAAF World Indoor Championships {{at the start of}} the year. However, the governing body then <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> was ineligible, not having obtained permission to miss the trials event.
