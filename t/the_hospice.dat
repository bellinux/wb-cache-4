5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E
5|$|Hospice Medical Director: <b>The</b> <b>hospice</b> medical director, a physician, often {{provides}} the most support to the clinical staff providing care to the patient and family. The medical director may also provide medical care if the primary physician is unavailable or if the patient {{does not have a}} primary care provider. <b>The</b> <b>hospice</b> medical director is also required under Medicare to recertify patients.|$|E
5|$|In early 1847, Jean-Baptiste Bourgault, {{owner of}} the Wolfe Street premises, {{notified}} Cadron-Jetté and <b>the</b> <b>Hospice</b> that he was evicting them, citing concern for his reputation. After exhaustive enquiries, a new premises was located {{on the corner of}} Sainte-Catherine and Saint-André streets, provided by John Donegani, a Montreal businessman, at a rent of 60 dollars a year. On April 26, 1847, <b>the</b> <b>Hospice</b> moved to the new site.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hospices</b> de Beaune are {{a charity}} {{based in the}} town, {{consisting}} of the Hôtel-Dieu hospital and <b>the</b> <b>Hospices</b> de la Charité. <b>The</b> <b>Hospices</b> are funded by their endowment of 55ha of vineyards on the Côte d'Or, and the auction of their wines on the third Sunday in November sets a benchmark for prices for that vintage.|$|R

5000|$|Having founded <b>the</b> <b>Hospices</b> de Beaune {{with his}} wife in 1443, in 1452 Rolin {{established}} a new religious order, [...] "Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune". He ordered the painting of an altarpiece, The Last judgement by the Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden for <b>the</b> <b>hospices.</b>|$|R
5|$|On July 26, 1846, Bishop Bourget {{unilaterally}} {{opened the}} noviciate of the Saint-Pélagie Community, {{and placed the}} assembled female staff of <b>the</b> <b>Hospice</b> as novices within that program. This effectively established <b>the</b> <b>Hospice</b> de Saint-Pélagie as a religious community, of which Bourget proclaimed Sophie Raymond to be the superior. It also allowed for women to join the community as postulants, {{with the aim of}} eventually taking religious vows. Bourget designated himself spiritual and canonical director of the novitiate, and delegated a priest, the Abbé Antoine Rey, to be Director of <b>the</b> <b>Hospice.</b> Later that year at the direction of Coadjutor Bishop Jean-Charles Prince (later Bishop of Saint-Hyacinth) the Wolfe Street premises were expanded through the acquisition of the first floor adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>hospice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once {{a patient}} is {{enrolled}} in hospice, <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> becomes the insurance payor for that patient for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if {{a patient is}} on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> is responsible for all care related to the heart failure. However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E
5|$|Should {{a patient}} be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> would continue to provide care to the patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and routine care is that <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E

5|$|A typhus {{epidemic}} swept Montreal in late 1847 and Montreal's religious communities, including Cadron-Jetté and {{the staff}} of <b>the</b> <b>hospice,</b> were called upon by Bishop Bourget to assist in combating it. The hospice's chaplain and director, Antoine Rey, and its midwife, Madame Montrait, were among the nine priests and 13 Religious Sisters of Montreal who {{were killed by the}} disease. One of the hospice's penitents also died due to the disease. Bishop Bourget subsequently named Father Venant Pilon as Rey's replacement as Director of <b>the</b> <b>Hospice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. <b>The</b> <b>hospice</b> aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. <b>The</b> <b>hospice</b> aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. <b>The</b> <b>hospice</b> is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hospice's</b> {{facilities}} include nine specialist children's bedrooms, eight family {{rooms for}} parents and siblings, six bedrooms in an adjoining unit for teenagers and young adults - Whitby Lodge - sitting rooms, playrooms, a multi-sensory room, Jacuzzi, library and a music room. <b>The</b> <b>hospice's</b> 6 acre landscaped gardens incorporate socially-inclusive outdoor play areas with wheelchair swings, a roundabout, water play area, and adventure trail.|$|R

50|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the {{development}} of new services, including <b>the</b> Day <b>Hospice,</b> Family Support Team, Therapy Team and Prospect@Home service, each reflecting <b>the</b> <b>hospice's</b> belief that care for people who are dying is about so much more than just their final days.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and <b>the</b> <b>Hospice</b> Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, and as long as <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by <b>the</b> <b>hospice.</b> As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by <b>the</b> <b>hospice.</b> Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E
5|$|Such late {{admission}} {{is inconsistent with}} the process of hospice, which is to alleviate patient distress over a period of time, based on time for patients and family members to develop relationships with <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> team.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> {{philosophy}} {{is that the}} care is patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed care is integral and interwoven throughout the care which is provided. Related Medicare regulations reflect this philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The altarpiece was {{commissioned}} in 1443 for the Hospices de Beaune by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, {{and his wife}} Guigone de Salins, who is buried {{in front of the}} altarpiece's original location in <b>the</b> <b>hospice.</b> It is one of van der Weyden's most ambitious works, equal to his Prado Deposition and lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald. It remains in <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> today, although not in its original position. It is in poor condition and was moved in the 20th century to shield it from sunlight and better protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors it receives annually. It has suffered from extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of dirt. In addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated so both can be shown simultaneously; traditionally, the shutters would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hospice</b> {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hospice</b> team is {{required}} by Medicare to meet every 14 days. During this team meeting, patient needs are discussed and planned {{for the next two}} weeks.

5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} {{him was that}} he was killed while attempting a rescue; however, this is untrue. Barry retired to Bern, Switzerland and after his death his body was passed into the care of the Natural History Museum of Bern. His skin has been preserved through taxidermy although his skull was modified in 1923 to match the Saint Bernard of that time period. His story and name have been used in literary works, and a monument to him stands in the Cimetière des Chiens near Paris. At <b>the</b> <b>hospice</b> one dog has always been named Barry in his honor and since 2004 the Foundation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard has been set up to take over the responsibility for breeding dogs from <b>the</b> <b>hospice.</b>|$|E
