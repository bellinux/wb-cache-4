As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers <b>to</b> <b>root</b> <b>for,</b> and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|Napoli added {{their second}} Serie A title in 1989–90, {{defeating}} Milan by two {{points in the}} title race. However, this was surrounded by less auspicious circumstances as Napoli were awarded two points for a game, when in Bergamo, an Atalanta fan threw a 100 lira coin at Alemão's head. A controversial set of events set off at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, when Maradona made comments pertaining to North–South inequality {{in the country and}} the risorgimento, asking Neapolitans <b>to</b> <b>root</b> <b>for</b> Argentina in the semi-finals against Italy in Naples.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{small groups}} of bluespotted ribbontail rays follow the rising tide onto sandy flats <b>to</b> <b>root</b> <b>for</b> small benthic {{invertebrates}} and bony fishes in the sediment. When the tide recedes, the rays separate and withdraw to shelters on the reef. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of up to seven young. This ray is capable of injuring humans with its venomous tail spines, though it prefers to flee if threatened. Because of its beauty and size, the bluespotted ribbontail ray is popular with private aquarists despite being poorly suited to captivity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as it faces widespread habitat degradation and intensive fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} network {{version of}} the U.S. Millionaire and the subsequent primetime specials were hosted by Regis Philbin. When the syndicated version was being developed, the production team {{felt that it was}} not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting, as the show recorded four episodes in a single day, and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host: it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing <b>to</b> <b>root</b> <b>for</b> them. Rosie O'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position on this new edition, but declined the opportunity almost immediately. Eventually Meredith Vieira, who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version, was named host of the new syndicated edition.|$|E

25|$|On October 9, 2011, at Héroes Inmortales, Octagón shocked AAA {{by turning}} on the {{promotion}} by attacking Dr. Wagner Jr. after his match with El Hijo del Perro Aguayo. La Parka entered the ring to seemingly confront his longtime partner, but then also attacked Wagner along with Octagón, Aguayo, Konan Big and Silver King, joining La Sociedad. At the first post-Héroes Inmortales television tapings on October 21, Parka blamed his turn on AAA for bringing back L.A. Park after his 15 years of loyal service, and the promotion's fans for choosing <b>to</b> <b>root</b> <b>for</b> both Park and Cibernético over him during his past two rivalries. On December 1, Parka and Park put their past differences aside, when they teamed {{together for the first}} time, defeating Dr. Wagner Jr. and Electroshock in a tag team main event. On March 18, 2012, at Rey de Reyes, La Parka, Dark Dragon and Tito Santana were defeated by Cibernético, Billy el Malo and Escoria in what was billed as the final chapter in the rivalry between Parka and Cibernético. After the match, Octagón turned on Parka, attacking him with Dragon and Santana, which led to Los Bizarros returning to the ring and chasing them away. After initially trying to save his alliance with La Sociedad, La Parka officially turned tecnico and rejoined AAA on April 30.|$|E

During his high school baseball career, Granderson batted [...]369 with 11 home runs and 88 runs batted in (RBI), and was named an All-State selection his senior year. Granderson wore #14 at T.F.

The closest comparison you can draw in terms of our own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces.

The role was a defining performance in Nicholson's career and was considered to overshadow Batman's, with film critic Roger Ebert saying that the audience must sometimes remind themselves not <b>to</b> <b>root</b> <b>for</b> the Joker.
