60|$|With {{respect to}} what I {{have called the}} in direct action of changed conditions, namely, through the {{reproductive}} system of being affected, we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of this system being extremely sensitive to {{any change in the}} conditions, and partly from the similarity, as Kolreuter and others have remarked, between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even when the male and female unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in their native country! This is generally, but erroneously attributed to vitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered that a very trifling change, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds. I cannot here give the details which I have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, {{with the exception of the}} plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, breeding freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I may add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions--for instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches--showing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{economic}} factors affecting the auditor’s independence when management wishes to mislead investors. By {{means of a}} single person decision-theoretic model, we show that, {{in the absence of}} transaction costs, audited financial statements are unlikely to be biased. However, when transaction costs in the form of legal costs are introduced, bias is likely to occur. By means of a game-theoretic model, we also examine two areas of information asymmetry and the economic factors involved causing a ‘rogue auditor’ compared with a ‘professionally correct’ auditor <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> independently. We also examine the implications of this both at the micro and public policy level and whether the ‘bad auditors’ will drive out the ‘good auditors’. We find that the ‘good corporations’ have an incentive to drive out the ‘bad auditors’. However, whilst investors have negligible information about audit quality, scandals such as Enron and Arthur Andersen are likely to occur. 43 page(s...|$|E

Intention is generally defined in terms of foresight of particular consequences and a desire <b>to</b> <b>act</b> or <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> so that those consequences occur.

40|$|Human {{trafficking}} {{in the form}} of forced prostitution and labor has long existed in Iraq, as has forced marriage and domestic servitude within the family, tribe and community. Since the 2003 invasion and subsequent civil war, Iraq has increasingly been a source of trafficking victims who are transported to neighboring countries, as well as a destination for foreign workers who are at risk of trafficking and come to Iraq from the Philippines, Nepal, Bangladesh and other countries where poverty is widespread. Furthermore, internal conflict and breakdown in law and order has resulted in a rise in kidnapping and trafficking from one location to another within Iraq. The Iraqi Constitution prohibits forced labor, kidnapping, slavery, slave trade, {{trafficking in}} women or children, and the sex trade, and the Government of Iraq ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ("CEDAW"). However Iraqi government officials have overwhelmingly <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>to</b> prevent abuses and to punish offenders. Iraq has not passed anti-trafficking legislation, allowing traffickers to continue to operate with impunity. Research and preliminary investigations leading to the production of this report indicate that Iraqi women and girls are being subjected to the following types of trafficking: 1) exploitation of prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation; 2) forced labor or services; 3) slavery or practices similar to slavery; and 4) servitude. There are also credible reports of trafficking-related practices such as forced participation in criminal activity. Because of the nature of trafficking, quantitative measurement is inexact even in developed nations with functioning judicial and law enforcement sectors. In Iraq, measuring the scope of trafficking is far more difficult. However, there is ample evidence of established patterns and practices of trafficking, leading to a strong likelihood that hundreds of women have been trafficked {{over the last five years}} in the Kurdistan region, and thousands elsewhere in Iraq and in neighboring regions. In accordance with the Iraqi Constitution as well as international treaty obligations, Iraq must develop an effective national and regional counter-trafficking strategy. A comprehensive approach to combating trafficking must include prevention strategies, protection of trafficking victims, and prosecution of traffickers. This is a difficult time for Iraqis as they struggle with ongoing violence and war, as well as ongoing political restructuring in which many issues have yet to be determined. However it is also an opportune time to address trafficking and other serious human rights violations, as Iraq's national and regional governments work to strengthen the rule of law. Addressing problems of trafficking and other forms of gender-motivated violence is integral to this process of reform...|$|R
