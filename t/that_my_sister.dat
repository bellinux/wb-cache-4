60|$|I should observe, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> Sophia was {{considered}} {{by all the}} servants a paragon of perfection.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{explanation}} {{seems to}} me to be reasonably simple," [...] Annabel said coldly. [...] "You seem to forget <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> is--married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I am not {{thinking}} of Lord Keith. To speak it out, I cannot believe <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> has heart enough in this to justify her." ...|$|E
5000|$|Patrick Fitzwilliam: (angry) <b>That's</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister!!</b> (Punches {{a hole in}} the wall) ...|$|R
50|$|On June 4, 2010, the Layne Staley Fund {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>My</b> <b>Sister's</b> Machine will be reuniting for the Layne Staley Tribute, held on August 21 of <b>that</b> year. <b>My</b> <b>Sister's</b> Machine {{has continued}} to play shows into the 2010s.|$|R

6000|$|... "Did {{you speak}} {{from your own}} observation," [...] said she, [...] "when you told him <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> loved him, or merely from my {{information}} last spring?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have taken}} a box at a music-hall," [...] he announced. [...] "I believe <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> may join us there. I hope it will amuse you?" ...|$|E
60|$|I did not {{relish the}} idea of going into such a place, and I knew <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> Kate and the Widow Canby would be horrified when they heard of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{will never}} forgive you,--never. And God will never forgive you. I {{did not think}} it {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister's</b> child should have been so false to me." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} now <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister's</b> suspicions were correct, {{and that there}} was some very {{intimate}} connection between the presence of the three Orientals and the mysterious peril which hung over the towers of Cloomber.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay!" [...] {{chimed in}} Norman, [...] "I hear men talking of Henny, and Loo, and the like; and you can't think how glad I have been <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> {{could not be}} known by any absurd word!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “And so I {{told the}} great lady in grey. I told her <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> {{had given it}} to me and that surely God would not let her take it away again.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... --I must go, he {{said softly}} and benevolently, I have a strong suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> {{intended}} to make pancakes today for the dinner of the Donovan family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it so, Macumazahn? Oh, then I {{have heard}} of her, though, as it chances, I have never met her before. No wonder <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> Nandie is jealous, for she is {{beautiful}} indeed." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was sure}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister's</b> cry could mean but one thing-- that the tramp {{had made a}} raid on the house. I was {{thoroughly}} alarmed, and ran with all possible speed {{in the direction of}} the dining-room, from whence the sound proceeded.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Judith, and it's so {{written in}} the Bible, though father {{sometimes}} called her Jude. <b>That's</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> Judith. Thomas Hutter's daughter--Thomas Hutter, whom you called the Muskrat; though he was no muskrat, but a man like yourselves--he {{lived in a house}} on the water, and that was enough for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She was killed, Master," [...] Zaki said sorrowfully. [...] "I thought {{possibly}} {{it would}} be so. The Dervishes did not carry off old women. They killed them, and the little children. I had never hoped to see her again; but I did think, when we entered Omdurman, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> might be here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Husband, and {{therefore}} I leave for Egypt {{as soon as}} may be. It seems <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> is dead, this year past, and the holy Tanofir has no one to hold his cup." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{may as well}} go on with {{it since}} I have begun it,’ my mother says, so slyly <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> and I shake our heads at each other to imply, ‘Was there ever such a woman!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know; he {{does not}} seem to be in any hurry. I believe that he has said <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> may {{continue}} to live there if she pleases. But of course she cannot do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not so, my dear fellow. I can't {{explain the}} thing exactly, but it's I that owe the money, and I must pay it. But it's no good talking of that. Well, you see, Anty <b>that's</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> has this {{property}} all {{in her own}} hands. But you don't drink your punch," [...] and Barry mixed his third tumbler.|$|R
6000|$|But when King Mark {{heard this}} he went forth from that place {{and into his}} own chamber. And when he had come there he fell down upon his knees and cried out aloud: [...] "Alas, alas, that this should be! Rather, God, would I lose my entire kingdom than <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister's</b> son should come to his death in this wise!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Friday or Saturday,' said Tom. 'Now look here! I am {{not sure}} that I can do you the good turn I want to do you - <b>that's</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> you know, in your room - but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there's no harm done. So I tell you what. You'll know our light porter again?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I will go," [...] she promised, with a queer little smile. [...] "It {{is against}} my husband's orders, and I {{am not sure}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> will be {{particularly}} glad to see me. But I will go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{gave you}} to {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> and myself differed in our political opinions; but we have an impartial umpire in my father, who loves his own countrymen, and he loves the British,--so he takes sides with neither." ...|$|E
60|$|Weeks passed away, {{and still}} I heard nothing, except <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> {{continued}} to be ill. One day I privately {{wrote a letter to}} Uncle George, asking him, in my childish way, to come and tell me about Caroline's illness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course. Do let {{me bring}} him, Fee,' entreated Lance; 'he is no end of a chap--captain of our form almost always--and such a brick at cricket! I told him I'd show him the potteries, and your press, and our organ, and everything--and {{it is such a}} chance when we are all at home! I shall get the fellows to believe now <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> beat all theirs to shivers.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{imagine my}} distress, sir, and the {{condition}} of my conscience," [...] pursued the lady, [...] "when I tell you <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister's</b> husband's sister is a very old friend of mine--and, indeed, so was this German. The two are a very attached young couple, and, being childless, are quite wrapped up in each other. I have come to you, feeling it my duty to secure his internment." ...|$|R
60|$|Louis looked quite shocked. He {{surprised}} me inexpressibly by declaring <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister's</b> foreign husband was dressed superbly, and looked {{the picture of}} prosperity. Under these circumstances my first impression altered to a certain extent. I now {{took it for granted}} that the Count had matrimonial difficulties of his own to contend with, and that he had come, {{like the rest of the}} family, to cast them all on my shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father would}} {{naturally}} never consent to it. As {{soon as he}} hears {{of what has happened}} he will forbid it absolutely. Kindly dismiss from your mind entirely the idea <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> will ever be permitted to marry you, Mr. Winfield." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{remains to}} help me to manage the farm. There is no chance {{for him in the}} present exasperated state of my father's mind. He unhappily extends his indignation against England to Englishmen, and vows <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> Bertha shall never wed Charlie Considine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel great}} {{confidence}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> {{will never be}} the slave of superstition," [...] said Endymion. [...] "Her mind is too masculine for that; she will remember that the throne she fills has been already once lost by the fatal influence of the Jesuits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, suspicions, if {{you think}} the word more appropriate. I fear much, very much, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>sister</b> and poor Tom Graham were lost in the last storm--" ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the brother}} who told Deronda {{of this new}} {{condition}} added to their life. [...] "I am become calm in beholding him now," [...] Ezra ended, [...] "and I try to think it possible <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister's</b> tenderness, and the daily tasting a life of peace, may win him to remain aloof from temptation. I have enjoined her, and she has promised, to trust him with no money. I have convinced her that he will buy with it his own destruction." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{dinner that}} the woman served was {{not as good as}} <b>that</b> which <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> Kate helped to prepare at the Widow Canby's, but it was {{wholesome}} food, and my sharpened appetite made it disappear rapidly.|$|R
