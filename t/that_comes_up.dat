25|$|Skillet {{formed in}} 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee {{progressive}} rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor {{encouraged them to}} form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains {{that it was a}} joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet {{to come up with something}} unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} {{published}} in The Times in October 1969, John Russell Taylor praised {{the concept of}} the film as [...] "quite ingenious" [...] but suggested that the title and pre-release marketing had revealed too much of the plot for the film to sustain the interest of its audience. Commenting in New York magazine in November, Judith Crist introduced Doppelgänger as [...] "a science-fiction film <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> with a fascinating premise three-quarters of the way along and does nothing with it." [...] She praised the production as being [...] "nicely gadget-ridden" [...] and raising questions on the conflict between politics and science, but criticised the editing. Variety magazine cited a confusing plot, and related the crash of the Dove module to the coherence of the scriptwriting in its declaration that, [...] "Astronauts take a pill to induce a three-week sleep during their flight. Thereafter the script falls to pieces in as many parts as their craft." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] was {{directed}} by Pete Michels and written by Donick Cary, Tim Long and Ron Hauge. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on Halloween,1999. [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] was conceived and written by former staff writer Cary. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Cary said that {{he came up with}} the segment after watching the 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer. [...] "I had just seen the movie and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'" [...] he said. While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to Grampa, who would chase Homer inside a roller disco. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders. Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote {{the last quarter of the}} segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf. In order to dispose of Ned Flanders' corpse, Homer throws his body into Flanders' house. After he is finished, he says [...] "That's the end of that chapter", a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life. [...] "That's just something <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> a lot in my life is when no matter if it's a good or a bad thing, just move on" [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|The {{whole problem}} of {{knowledge}} has constantly been that {{of bringing the}} one and the many together. When man looks about him and within him, he sees {{that there is a}} great variety of facts. The question <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> at once is whether there is any unity in this variety, whether there is one principle in accordance with which all these many things appear and occur. All non-Christian thought, if it has utilized the idea of a supra-mundane existence at all, has used this supra-mundane existence as furnishing only the unity or the a priori aspect of knowledge, while it has maintained that the a posteriori aspect of knowledge is something that is furnished by the universe.|$|E

2500|$|The E key's main {{component}} is 月, and its shortcut character is 有. [...] It {{is associated with}} the following components: 月, 用, 彡, 乃, the bottom of 衣 (i.e., without 亠), the top of 孚 (i.e., without 子), the bottom part of 家 (i.e., without the roof radical), the bottom of 良 (i.e., without the 白), and the bottom of 舟 (i.e., without the little dot on the top). In this case, E's shortcut character does not even begin with a left-falling stroke, but merely prominently figures a component belonging to E. 彡 is featured on this character, as it is the third character in the zone (counting from T, see above). [...] A particular distortion <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> often is the use of E in 且 and in characters containing it: Wubi thinks of this component as 月 + 一.|$|E
2500|$|RDF {{is being}} used to have a better {{understanding}} of road traffic patterns. [...] This is because the information regarding traffic patterns is [...] on different websites, and RDF is used to integrate information from different sources on the web. Before, the common methodology was using keyword searching, but this method is problematic because it does not [...] consider synonyms. This is why ontologies are useful in this situation. But one of the issues <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> when trying to efficiently study traffic is that to fully understand traffic, [...] concepts related to people, streets, and roads must be well understood. Since these are human [...] concepts, they require the addition of fuzzy logic. This is because values that are useful [...] when describing roads, like slipperiness, are not precise concepts and cannot be measured. This would imply that the best solution would incorporate both fuzzy logic and ontology.|$|E
2500|$|The fertile octogenarian is {{a fictitious}} {{character}} <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> when applying the rule against perpetuities. The rule presumes that anyone, even an octogenarian (i.e., someone between 80 and 90 years of age) can parent a child, regardless of sex or health. [...] For instance, suppose that a will devises {{a piece of}} land known as Blackacre [...] "to A for her life, and then to the first of A's children to reach 25 years of age." [...] A is, at the time the will is probated, an 85-year-old woman. In applying the rule against perpetuities, an imaginative lawyer will argue (and a court must accept under the common law rule itself) that A could have a child in her 86th year and then in her 87th year all of A's other children could die, then in her 88th year A herself could die. [...] Because the interest will not vest until her new child reaches 25 years of age, which cannot happen until more than 21 years after A and her other children (together who form the [...] "lives in being" [...] to which the rule refers) have all died, the rule against perpetuities makes the entire gift [...] "to the first of A's children to reach 25 years of age" [...] void. [...] A will hold Blackacre for life, and then the property will revert to the person whose will transferred it to A in the first place. (Actually, it will go to that person's estate, since the will was probated only after his death.) ...|$|E
