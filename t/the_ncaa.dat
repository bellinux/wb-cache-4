5|$|The first NCAA Tournament was {{organized}} by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46–33 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament, control of the event was given to <b>the</b> <b>NCAA.</b> In {{the early years of}} the tournament, it was considered less important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a New York City-based event. Teams were able to compete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did so—Utah in 1944, Kentucky in 1949, and City College of New York (CCNY) in 1950—won <b>the</b> <b>NCAA</b> Tournament. The 1949–50 CCNY team won both tournaments (defeating Bradley in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to accomplish this feat. By the mid-1950s, <b>the</b> <b>NCAA</b> Tournament became the more prestigious of the two events, and in 1971 <b>the</b> <b>NCAA</b> barred universities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were invited to <b>the</b> <b>NCAA</b> Tournament.|$|E
