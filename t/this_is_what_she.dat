25|$|Polyandrous {{relations}} are disapproved of inmost expressions of Hinduism.There {{is at least}} one reference to polyandry in the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata. Draupadi married the five Pandava brothers, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> chose in a previous life. This ancient text remains largely neutral to the concept of polyandry, accepting this as her way of life. However, in the same epic, when questioned by Kunti to give an example of polyandry, Yudhishthira cites Gautam-clan Jatila (married to seven Saptarishis) and Hiranyaksha's sister Pracheti (married to ten brothers), thereby implying a more open attitude toward polyandry in Vedic society.|$|E
500|$|For writing Ibuki, Zubkavich was {{nominated}} for a Joe Shuster Award. He said that, compared to Sakura, [...] "Ibuki's a more complex character, more flawed. She's a great ninja but she isn't even sure <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants out of life. (...) Sakura's never-give-up attitude may be more of a classic anime archetype, but I feel Ibuki's a character more people can empathize with." [...] He added, [...] "Ibuki’s personality has been limited to game endings and oh-so brief lines of dialogue from her victory quotes, so expanding upon those with this focused story is an honour and a challenge." [...] In a poll by Omar Dogan on his DeviantArt website, most of voters wanted to see Ibuki [...] "wearing something cute", and precisely something in the Harajuku-style Lolita fashion. Dogan's own favourite part of the story was [...] "the part where Ibuki and Oro battle." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the time}} Mudge came to Columbia, the American Library Association {{asked her to}} update Guide to Reference Books, which was desperately needing a {{supplement}} {{to go along with}} the original edition. [...] She edited the guide through four editions over 20 years. [...] This was an important book at that time to show new librarians what resources were available. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is best known for. She also wrote articles for the Library Journal, worked on editing and creating bibliographies, dictionaries and other reference materials. Quite often her writings were assisted by Minnie Earl Sears, a colleague and companion. [...] Some of Mudge's writings are still found at Columbia University.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{powerful}} argument hooks discusses is one {{in which}} she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit into the tiny boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been socialized to mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught {{that the most important thing}} she can do is change herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into men and women who are convinced that lies are the way to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, [...] "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love" [...] (hooks). Another central argument in hooks's All About Love is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone. This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is arguing throughout her book.|$|E

6000|$|... "An {{outrageous}} {{piece of}} business," [...] he said, [...] "to treat a daughter in this way; {{to put a}} schoolmate over {{her head in the}} family! It is shameful! And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was coming to tell me?" ...|$|E
60|$|About {{six weeks}} after--just {{as he was}} going out to his work one morning--a neighbour, that used to mind women when they were ill, came up to him, and kept step by step {{with him to the}} field, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> told him.|$|E

6000|$|She {{turned into}} the writing-room, and taking off her gloves she wrote a letter. Her pretty fingers were {{innocent}} of rings, and her handwriting was a little shaky. Nevertheless, {{it is certain that}} not a man passed through the room who did not find an excuse to steal a second glance at her. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wrote:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|When {{this good}} M.

6000|$|Hemmingway shivered. Yes, she was {{not only}} conscious, but spoilt already. He pictured to himself the uncouth gallantries of the settlement, the provincial badinage, the feeble rivalries {{of the young men}} whom he had seen at the general store.

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now passing through, and--as all highly {{organized}} natures {{like her}} own are, especially in youth, {{very sensitive to}} those more exquisite vibrations of pain and happiness that leave minds of a coarser fibre comparatively unmoved--it may {{be taken for granted}} that she was suffering sufficiently acutely.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{not afraid}} of him! And, besides, I believe he has bolted. I called at his house yesterday, and his servant said they hadn't heard a word from him.'

6000|$|This {{young girl}} kept a scrap-book {{when she was}} alive, and used to paste obituaries and {{accidents}} and cases of patient suffering in {{it out of the}} Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head.

6000|$|Phyllis {{looked up}} in amazement. The girl to whom the hand had belonged {{was sitting at the}} next table, but her head was turned away, and she seemed to be only {{concerned}} in watching the door.

60|$|She had, however, been {{released}} stealthily {{a day before}} her time, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had done. She had asked that--of all improbable people!--Sir Isaac's mother should meet her, the biggest car {{had come to the}} prison gates, and she had gone straight down with Mrs. Harman to her husband--who had taken a chill and was in bed drinking Contrexéville water--at Black Strand.|$|E
60|$|She could {{scarcely}} believe in her good fortune, {{especially when she}} remembered {{the description of the}} man which one of the staff had given. He was gruff, vulgar, ill-tempered; the chief ought to be kicked for letting her go near him! <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> told. She laughed softly to herself.|$|R
6000|$|So <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{meant by}} another {{turn of the}} screw! She had made a public {{imbecile}} of me. Now she would brand me as a criminal.

6000|$|... "Thank you, Captain Niel," [...] {{answered}} Bessie, {{looking at}} him in a bewitching little way she well knew how to assume, [...] "thank you, but I think I had rather not go out walking."

[...] "It {{seems to me that}} of all the women that ever lived my Aunt Stanbury is the most prejudiced, the most unjust, and the most given to evil {{thinking}} of her neighbours. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has thought fit to write to you, mamma." [...] Then Priscilla read her aunt's letter, which was as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{she saw the}} Flounder, after glancing {{about to}} make sure that she was alone, enter the chapel, {{carrying}} the child, and heard her bolt the door after her. Now Bridget, as she said afterwards, grew very frightened, she knew not why, and, acting on impulse, ran to the chancel window and, climbing on to a wheelbarrow that stood there, looked through it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And so, as she {{dare not}} shatter their ideals, and perhaps {{cause them to}} plunge into excesses, moral or doctrinal, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has done.

6000|$|One day, about a {{week after}} their piece of good luck, a maid brought a letter for Miss Lydia to her room. The {{postmark}} showed that it was from New York.

60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw: Ranged {{against the}} wall of the second prison, and {{opposite}} to her, were three priests holding candles in their hands, whereof the light shone upon their sullen, cruel faces, and the snake's head tattooed on their naked breasts. In front of these men stood two other priests, and between them was Leonard bound and gagged.|$|R
