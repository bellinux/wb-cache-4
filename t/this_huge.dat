At seeing <b>this</b> <b>huge</b> vessel, pandemonium broke out amongst the townspeople; they visited the floating castle and sought out drunken sailors in taverns and pubs, buying, stealing, pinching and fighting for the takings. Local fishermen as well ventured aboard, further depleting the cargo.|$|E
5|$|One of Speer's first {{commissions}} after Troost's {{death was}} the Zeppelinfeld stadium—the Nürnberg parade grounds seen in Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda masterpiece Triumph of the Will. <b>This</b> <b>huge</b> work {{was able to}} hold 340,000 people. Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, {{many of whom were}} overweight. Speer surrounded the site with 130 anti-aircraft searchlights. Speer described this as his most beautiful work, and as the only one that stood the test of time.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} venom {{is thought to}} have {{provided}} the catalyst for the rapid diversification of snakes in the Cenozoic period, particularly to the Colubridae and their colonization of the Americas. Scholars suggest that the reason for <b>this</b> <b>huge</b> expansion was the shift from a mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey. Snake venoms attack biological pathways and processes that are also targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, calcium channel blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and cone snails, thus suggesting that venom exhibits convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|Waste {{management}} including sewage treatment, the linked {{processes of}} deforestation and soil degradation, {{and climate change}} or global warming are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a mega city like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. <b>This</b> <b>huge</b> waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of Kubwa Community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the canals, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows, etc.|$|E
5|$|Much of Galveston's {{success as}} a tourist {{destination}} {{was the result of}} E. Sid Holliday, who became the publicity and convention director of the Galveston Chamber of Commerce in 1925 and later became its head. The Chamber helped promote the legitimate face of Galveston's tourism and business community (though it cooperated heavily with the criminal enterprises). Legitimate amusements such as an amusement park that included a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster (the Mountain Speedway), in addition to the beaches and up-scale shopping districts (notably the Strand) drew visitors, including those less interested in the city's illegal attractions. One of the most spectacular efforts by the Chamber, though not one of the city's greatest successes, was the Pleasure Pier (originally known as the Brantly Harris Recreational Pier). <b>This</b> <b>huge</b> pier (later converted to the Flagship Hotel), built in the 1940s and used by the military {{until the end of the}} war, featured restaurants, rides, and an amphitheater.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} debates arising during the 1970s was over the theory of punctuated equilibrium. Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould proposed that there was a pattern of fossil species that remained largely unchanged for long periods (what they termed stasis), interspersed with relatively brief periods of rapid change during speciation. Improvements in sequencing methods resulted in a large increase of sequenced genomes, allowing the testing and refining of evolutionary theories using <b>this</b> <b>huge</b> amount of genome data. Comparisons between these genomes provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of speciation and adaptation. These genomic analyses have produced fundamental changes in the understanding of the evolutionary history of life, such as the proposal of the three-domain system by Carl Woese. Advances in computational hardware and software allow the testing and extrapolation of increasingly advanced evolutionary models and the development of the field of systems biology. One of the results has been an exchange of ideas between theories of biological evolution and the field of computer science known as evolutionary computation, which attempts to mimic biological evolution for the purpose of developing new computer algorithms. Discoveries in biotechnology now allow the modification of entire genomes, advancing evolutionary studies to the level where future experiments may involve the creation of entirely synthetic organisms.|$|E

5|$|The trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a {{set back}} for his health but he soon {{recovered}} and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the Chronologia, {{a list of all}} significant events {{since the beginning of the}} world compiled from his literal reading of the bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed. Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3965 years before the birth of Christ. <b>This</b> <b>huge</b> volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.|$|E

25|$|The Amazon River is {{the widest}} and second longest river (behind the Nile) in the world. <b>This</b> <b>huge</b> river drains {{the greater part}} of the world's rainforests. Another major river, the Paraná, has its source in Brazil. It forms the border of Paraguay and Argentina, then winds its way through Argentina and into the Atlantic Ocean, along the {{southern}} coast of Uruguay.|$|E
25|$|A large {{electric}} current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow {{away from the}} strike point to the surrounding area. <b>This</b> <b>huge</b> surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along {{the surface of the}} ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself. Electricity takes every path available to it.|$|E
50|$|The M&KR {{found itself}} {{straddling}} {{the centre of}} the iron smelting industry, but aligned and engineered for carrying coal to Kirkintilloch, and not connected to the developing ironstone and coal pits. <b>This</b> generated <b>huge</b> potential, but also considerable challenges as the needs of the dominant industries developed.|$|R
50|$|The main use of coin was to pay Rome's soldiers. In the 1st century BC, {{the wages}} of a legion were around 1,500,000 denarii, and more when Caesar raised the pay. With around 30 legions in active service in the Empire, <b>this</b> {{required}} <b>huge</b> sources of silver.|$|R

In 1969, Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: Guy Mollet refused {{to give him the}} support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. Georges Pompidou faced the centrist Alain Poher in the second round.|$|E
25|$|About 500 warriors {{armed with}} guns {{went to the}} Pyang region of the Kuba Kingdom where they built a stockade. They summoned the local chiefs and demanded sixty slaves as well as herds of goats, baskets of food and 2,500 balls of rubber. When the chiefs refused to pay <b>this</b> <b>huge</b> tribute the stockade gate was closed and the chiefs were massacred. The Zappo Zaps then killed, looted and burned villages {{throughout}} the Pyang country.|$|E
25|$|Bonthe District {{has one of}} the world's largest {{deposits}} of titanium ore (rutile) in the world. Sierra Rutile Limited, owned by a consortium of US and European investors, began commercial mining operations in Bonthe in early 1979. Due to poor mining policy, the region has little to show for <b>this</b> <b>huge</b> economic potential. There are no good roads, water supply or electricity. Bonthe District continues to suffer from one of the worst environmental degradation episodes in living memory.|$|E

25|$|Just North of the town, is {{the ancient}} Lake Agassiz beach ridge. About 10,000 years ago, <b>this</b> <b>huge</b> inland lake, the {{remnants}} of glaciers, began to drain in present-day Manitoba. Left behind were the gravel and sand deposits that were once the beaches of the former lake. These ridges mark {{the northern edge of}} the Red River Valley, and offer a different geological atmosphere. Many local gravel pits are found in this region.|$|E
25|$|Most of this Huì {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time in rural zones near metropolitan areas, where families shared work (in the parcels they owned and in the industrial workshops at the same time). For instance, in 1989 in Changhua, small enterprises produced almost 50% of the world's umbrellas. The State attracted foreign companies in order to obtain more capital and to get access to foreign markets, but the big foreign companies got contracts with <b>this</b> <b>huge</b> net of small sized, familiar and national companies, which were a very important percentage of the industrial output.|$|E
25|$|The city of Kandahar in Afghanistan {{is said to}} {{have been}} named after Gandhara. According to H.W. Bellow, an {{emigrant}} from Gandhara in the 5th century brought this name to modern Kandahar. Faxian reported that the Buddha's alms-bowl existed in Peshawar Valley when he visited around 400 (chapter XII). In 1872 Bellow saw <b>this</b> <b>huge</b> begging bowl (seven feet in diameter) preserved in the shrine of Sultan Wais outside Kandahar. When Olaf Caroe wrote his book in 1958 (Caroe, pp.170–171), this relic was reported to be at Kabul Museum. The present status of this bowl is unknown.|$|E
