This problem gets the more challenging the weaker the desired <b>transition</b> <b>couples</b> to the control field, and the denser the system's spectrum is.

40|$|The ac Stark {{shift in}} the {{presence}} of spontaneous decay is typically considered to induce an effective dephasing with a scattering rate equal to Γ_s |Ω|^ 2 /Δ^ 2, where Γ_s is the spontaneous decay rate, Ω is the laser <b>transition</b> <b>coupling,</b> and Δ is the detuning. We show that under realistic circumstances this dephasing rate may be strongly modifed due to non-Markovian behavior. The non-Markovian behavior arises due to an effective modification of the light-atom coupling {{in the presence of}} the ac Stark shift laser. An analytical formula for the non-Markovian ac Stark shift induced dephasing is derived. We obtain that for narrow laser linewidths the effective dephasing rate is suppressed by a factor of Q^ 2, where Q is the quality factor of the laser.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of a weak probe field in hybrid optomechanics with a single three-level (Λ-type) atomic system. We report that, {{in the presence of}} optomechanical coupling and two <b>transition</b> <b>coupling</b> parameters of three-level atom (TLA), there occurs three distinct multiple EIT windows in the probe absorption spectrum. Moreover, the switching of multiple windows into double and single EIT windows can be obtained by suitably tuning the system parameters.

Based on our analytical and numerical work, we explain the occurrence of slow and fast light (superluminal) regimes, and enhancement of superluminal behaviour in the probe field transmission.

The {{results indicate that}} rogue wave excitation can exist on a stripe phase background for which there are cosine and sine wave background in the two components respectively. The rogue wave peak can be {{much lower than the}} ones of scalar matter wave rogue waves, and varies with the wave period changing. Both rogue wave pattern and rogue wave number on temporal-spatial plane are much more abundant than the ones reported before. Furthermore, we prove that the rogue wave number can be n (n+ 1) / 2 +m (m+ 1) / 2 (where m,n are arbitrary non-negative integers), in contrast to n(n+ 1) / 2 for scalar nonlinear Schrödinger equation described systems.

40|$|We {{simulate}} 2 -flavour lattice QCD at finite isospin {{chemical potential}} mu_I, for temperatures {{close to the}} finite temperature transition from hadronic matter to a quark-gluon plasma. The mu_I dependence of the <b>transition</b> <b>coupling</b> is observed and used to estimate the decrease in the transition temperature with increasing mu_I. These simulations are performed on an 8 ^ 3 times 4 lattice at 3 different quark masses. Our estimate {{of the magnitude of}} the fluctuations of the phase of the fermion determinant at small quark-number chemical potential mu, suggest that the position of the small mu and small mu_I transitions should be the same for mu_I= 2 mu, and we argue that the nature of these transitions should be the same. For all mu_I m_pi and a small isospin (I_ 3) breaking term lambda, we do find evidence of a critical endpoint which would indicate that, for lambda= 0, there is a tricritical point on the phase boundary where the pion condensate evaporates, where this phase transition changes from second to first order.
