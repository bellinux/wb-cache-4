40|$|This work in {{progress}} paper discusses how the time factor of mobile commerce drives a change in delivery mechanisms and bargaining power among firms involved in event ticketing. By archival research and twelve semi-structured interviews, a conceptual framework, a case study, and analysis are provided. By combining concepts of mobility, bargaining, and value chain innovation, a novel approach is provided for m-commerce analysis. The event ticketing industry is a first mover in m-commerce involving what we call “meso-payments” (€ 5 -€ 100). This firm-level and technology coordination could be assumed to take place through a so-called “structured dialogue”. However, negotiating with mobility for ticketing doesn’t come without a price: increasing demands from users for convenient purchasing and delivery are combined with higher expectations of interactivity. This challenges the position of traditional distributors and opens up for new competition from mobile carriers and on-line data base owners. M-commerce offered by these new actors could also lead to dynamic prices supporting a shift in ticketing purchase behaviour. Key elements of our model are supported by the event <b>ticket</b> <b>case</b> study. It is likely that our conclusions regarding m-commerce {{and its effect on}} negotiations within event ticketing could be generalised into other industries...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is {{currently}} affecting {{more people in}} the World than any other disease and no single measure of control through the use of drugs seems effective. This study examined the temporal variation in the occurrence of malaria infection in Kano Municipal L. G. A. Secondary sources were used to generate data for the study. Relevant information was extracted from the bed head <b>ticket</b> (<b>case</b> files) of all in-patients of the health institutions in the study area. And information relating to socio demographic characteristics of patients and temporal pattern (i. e. annual, seasonal, and monthly variation) of malaria in the study area were extracted and analyzed, including 16, 601 recorded hospital malaria cases of in patients between 2001 and 2005. The disease was found to affect females (54 %) more than males (46 %) and children in age 0 - 5 and 6 - 10 years accounted for 18. 6 % and 15. 1 % respectively. Seasonally, the disease was found to be more rampant in dry seasons (mid-September to mid-May) than in the wet season (mid-May to mid-September) accounting for 63. 58 % and 36. 42 % respectively. The result of statistical test shows that there is no significance difference in the occurrence of the disease between dry season and wet season at 5 % level of significance (P ≤ 0. 05). The trend of the occurrence was found to be increasing annuall...|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} ticketing was developed {{within the scope}} of the Go!Card project. It is used as a test object for the techniques for the development of secure smartcard applications that are developed in the Go!Card project. The electronic <b>ticketing</b> <b>case</b> study deals with an e-commerce scenario for the electronic sale of railway or flight tickets. The customers buy their tickets from a server that transmits the signed and encrypted tickets to the customer, where they are loaded on the customers smartcard. Then the smartcard decrypts and verifies the tickets and stores them. The tickets are checked and obliterated offline by the train's conductor using a portable computer.

50|$|Each of {{the towns}} and fifteen of the villages have Justice Courts. These courts mostly hear routine traffic <b>ticket</b> <b>cases,</b> {{especially}} from the New York State Thruway and the Palisades Interstate Parkway. They also handle drunk driving charges, lower-level criminal misdemeanor matters, and they will occasionally perform arraignment on felonies (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases, which, considering the population density and highways in the county, is not surprising.|$|R
50|$|In {{contract}} law, <b>ticket</b> <b>cases</b> are {{a series}} of cases that stand for the proposition that if you are handed a ticket or another document with terms, and you retain the ticket or document, then you are bound by those terms. Whether you have read the terms or not is irrelevant, and in a sense, using the ticket is analogous to signing the document. This issue is an important one due to the proliferation of exclusion clauses that accompany tickets in everyday transactions.|$|R

If the person wishes to plead not guilty or otherwise contest the charges; he or she is required to appear in court on the predetermined date on the citation, where they may make their case to the judge, or negotiate with the prosecutor before they are called to appear in front of the judge. The person may also request for Trial By Written Declaration in the following states: California, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Louisiana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon, and Wyoming.With Trial By Written Declaration, the person {{does not have to be}} present in the court room; he or she may just explain the reason to defense for the case.The Officer will also be required to turn in his or her declaration. The Judge will then make a decision based on the declarations and evidences from both sides. At the conclusion of the written trial the accused is allowed to request a new, in person, hearing if he is not satisfied with the outcome of the written trial by filing a Trial DeNovo.|$|R

40|$|Cognitive work {{analysis}} {{has been applied}} {{in the design of}} numerous sociotechnical systems.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the process provide promising early evidence that the toolkit fulfils the evaluation criteria identified for its success, with opportunities for improvement also highlighted...|$|R

3000|$|... “If necessary, {{implement}} additional monitoring to {{look for}} future related activity” After identifying attack patterns and the compromised node profile, we should add proper monitoring alarms to cover those patterns and profiles. As an example, if the compromised compute worker starts to request {{a large number of}} IP addresses after its infection, this pattern should be saved and monitored on other compute workers. So, if we experience a compute worker with the same profile and behavior, that worker node will flagged as possibly infected. In our monitoring tools, the administrator can define a threshold for different parameters; if the current profile of the system violates the threshold, graphs will be drawn with a different color to notify the user. We can also add other monitoring tools to generate the <b>ticket</b> in <b>case</b> of a matching profile.|$|R

25|$|In January 2010, {{in a move}} to {{encourage}} the use of the go card, TransLink changed the fare structure by increasing the price of paper tickets to make the go card cheaper than paper <b>tickets.</b> In some <b>cases</b> the increase was as much as 40%. Although more users were using the go card than before, the move created another issue given the limited number of train stations selling the go card at the time. Some users could not buy the go card and had to continue to use paper tickets with higher fares. In response, TransLink confirmed more stations would begin selling the go card.|$|R

To support model-driven implementation of adaptive workflows, the BPMN meta-model is extended to represent adaptive features and to support reuse of workflow activities across multiple alternative implementations of workflow execution variants. To illustrate the approach, a prototype of the dynamic luggage registration and online <b>ticket</b> re-registration in <b>case</b> of flight cancellation CFM system is developed...|$|R
