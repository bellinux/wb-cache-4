30|$|The mining {{technology}} {{is the same as}} the traditional mining. Backfilling and mining work in parallel. Backfill proceeds from the tail to the head of the backfilling conveyor. After the material is accumulated to a certain height the next unloading hole is open and a machine rammer presses a <b>tamping</b> <b>slab</b> to tamp the material. This process would be repeated until the material has been sufficiently tamped and in general, it takes two or three cycles. The first round of backfilling would pause after the face has been fully filled. The backfilling conveyor then moves forward toward the head of the back beam and the compactor pushes all of the material that remains under the backfilling conveyor back and above till solid material reaches the roof. In this way, the material is being pushed toward the roof and compacted. Finally, close the unloading holes to back fill the space below the conveyor headpiece. After the first back filling cycle is completed, the conveyor would be pushed to the end of the back beam to start another cycle.|$|E
40|$|The GRP 5000 is a track {{measuring}} trolley {{capable of}} collecting track geometry data and performing clearance analyses based on laser scanning technology. The obtained laser data {{can also be}} used for as-built documentation, and the track recording functionality makes applications such as surveying, <b>tamping</b> assistance and <b>slab</b> track construction possible. The accuracy, huge data amount and time efficiency by which the system operates sets a new standard in railway surveying, and outdates traditional methods of manual and visual inspection. This thesis is a case study of the GRP 5000 with several objectives: a functional and technical description of the system is given; the accuracy of the system is evaluated, showing overall good values except for one of the sensors used; comparisons are made to other railway surveying techniques, such as track recording vehicles, manual devices and other track recording trolleys; possible improvements are pointed out, both based on comparison results as well as testing results. Finally, new and innovative ways of using the trolley, such as offtrack usage, {{as well as for the}} obtained laser data, such as GIS, maintenance aspects and CFD aspects, are examined...|$|R
