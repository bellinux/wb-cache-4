This paper reports a proof-of-concept research into the use of a pulse laser to fuse such yarns at discrete points at regular intervals along its length to impart cohesion at required frequencies. Pulse frequency and duration, hence the heat intensity, are varied to determine a suitable range of operating conditions. Results from a range of polyester and nylon yarns show that fusing <b>textured</b> <b>filament</b> yarn to create nips is feasible using a pulse laser as an alternative to intermingling by air jets. The multifilament yarn is also modeled to compute the heat flow in the yarn when heated by a pulse laser. This model can be used, as a tool to estimate the heat energy required to fuse a given textured yarn...|$|E

Sao realizados ensaios numa texturizadeira {{industrial}} simulando diferentes niveis dos fatores D/Y e numero de discos. Analises estatisticas sao apresentadas e comprovam a influencia dos fatores nas caracteristicas de frisagem com nivel de confianca de 5 %. Verifica-se que a combinacao de D/Y elevado com numero de discos elevado aumenta os valores dos parametros de frisagem do fio texturizado.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 With the {{increased}} production {{and use of}} double knit fabrics made from <b>textured</b> <b>filament</b> polyester, homemakers have become concerned over procedures for care that can be successfully {{carried out in the}} home. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine what effects wash water temperatures and drying methods have on the dimensional stability and surface appearance of filament polyester double knit fabrics. Changes in general physical properties, dimensional change, and surface appearance of four fabrics were studied after ten launderings at three wash water temperatures with two drying methods. Shirts made from two fabrics were worn by nursery school children, laundered ten times, and rated for pilling and snagging. All filament polyester double knit fabrics in this study shrank more when washed in hot water and when dried in the tumble dryer than when washed in warm or cool water and horizontally screen dried. Shrinkage was continuous after five and ten launderings, although at a decreasing rate. All four fabrics had better appearance when laundered in warm or cool wash water and when tumble dried after ten launderings than when washed in hot water and horizontally screen dried. Data indicated that resistance to pilling as tested in the Random Tumble Pilling Tester and snagging on shirts worn and laundered ten times were more dependent upon fabric characteristics and wearing conditions than on laundering conditions. Fabrics won consumer acceptance by parents of nursery school children who participated in the wear study...|$|E
40|$|Knowing the {{processes}} {{that take place in}} the macromolecular and morphological structure following repeated mechanical stresses, during the technological processing of chemical fibres and yarns is mostly important for the specialists in the field. This aspect is also motivated by the fact that, due to the viscoelasticity of the thextile fibres, during stresses, especial the tensile ones, with small forces but repeated at short times, fatigue appears represented by structural changes, difficult to be noticed, and in the most severe cases of stress destruction occurs. During the fatigue process in the fibre there are several non homogeneous deformations especially in the microcavities and areas where the structure has imperfections. Thus, modified isolated structures will be obtained, representing the primary destruction of the fabric by forming micro-fissures that progress rapidly by propagation, affecting the fibre in several areas, and in the end it results in the tearing of the fibres. The action of the mechanical forces upon the fibre triggers several chemical reactions that result in the breaking of the chemical bonds and the birth of free macroradicals, the concentration of which will depend on the intensity of stresses. These aspects of the fatigue process will influence correspondingly the fibre's physicochemical and chemical properties. This paper reports the experimental results regarding the effect of some cyclical stresses with constant force on the main properties of the <b>textured</b> <b>filament</b> yarn made of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) with a fibrillar matrix structure, of 110 / 32 dtex. ...|$|E
