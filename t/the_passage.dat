30|$|Eight reading <b>passages</b> were <b>the</b> main {{instructional}} {{materials used in}} the present research. <b>The</b> <b>passages</b> were selected from different internet sources and texbooks (e.g., Interchange 2, third edition by Richards, Hull, and Proctor (2005); Select Readings, pre-intermediate, second edition, by Lee and Gundersen (2002); the sources were either at pre-intermediate or intermediate proficiency level. All <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> included several examples of the target structures. Since <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> were taken from different sources, the reseacher checked their difficulty level using the Flesch–Kincaid readability formulae. The Flesch-Kincaid reading ease score of <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> ranged from 60 to 70, this range indicaes that the selected passeges were easily understood by the participants of the study who were at lower intermediate level.|$|R

50|$|The east-west {{orientation}} of <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> at Knowth suggests astronomical alignment with the equinoxes. The alignment at Knowth {{does not occur}} today. This {{is due to a}} number of factors. First of all, <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> were discovered by later settlers and were, to some extent, destroyed or incorporated into souterrains. In this way the original entrances to <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> were distorted or destroyed, making it difficult to establish if an alignment ever existed. Further, the recent excavations (1962 onwards) under George Eogan resulted in the erection of a concrete slab wall inside the mounds west entrance, restricting any investigation into the possible alignments. It seems likely that <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> were intended to align. Also, the alignments of ancient monuments can change due to Milankovitch cycles.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study considered the readability indexes of reading passages in English textbooks taught at Iranian senior high schools. For measuring the readability indexes of <b>the</b> <b>passages,</b> 30 English passages were {{fed into the}} computer and Flesch readability indexes of <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> were estimated. This study also examined students’ prior knowledge-interest levels to see to what extent students were interested or had background knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> in their English textbooks. 120 participants including 60 males and 60 females {{took part in the}} study and completed a Likert-type scale questionnaire. Other issues that were analyzed in the study were the association between students’ interest level and their background knowledge level, and the relationship between students’ interest- background knowledge levels with the readability indexes of <b>the</b> <b>passages.</b> <b>The</b> results of the study indicated that the readability indexes of <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> in high school English textbooks did not accord with Flesch readability standard. The results also showed that students mostly had an average and a low level of interest and background knowledge regarding reading passages in their English text books. The findings of the study revealed a significant relationship between students’ interest level and their background knowledge level. This study also showed an insignificant relationship between students’ interest level and the readability indexes of <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> in books two, three and four while based on Flesch readability formula there was a significant relationship between these two variables in book one. The results of {{the last part of the}} study revealed an insignificant relationship between students’ background knowledge level and the readability indexes of <b>the</b> <b>passages.</b> </p...|$|R

A few days after <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> of the storm, the government of Newfoundland appealed to the federal government for federal disaster relief fund; the government later approved.

Up until 295 BC, the Samnites and the Kelts had been Rome's chief rivals, but that year, at the Battle of Sentinum, the Romans defeated the combined armies of the Samnites and the Kelts. This battle was followed by the complete submission of both the Samnites and the Kelts to the Romans, and the emergence of Rome as the unchallenged mistress of Italy.|$|E
