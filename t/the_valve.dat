5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b> Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|All {{parallel}} thread valves are sealed using an O-ring at {{top of the}} neck thread which seals in a chamfer or step in the cylinder neck and against the flange of <b>the</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{failure modes}} {{that are a}} hazard while filling include valve thread failure, which can cause <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> to blow out of the {{cylinder}} neck, and filling whip failure.|$|E
500|$|All brachiopods have {{adductor}} {{muscles that}} are {{set on the}} inside of <b>the</b> pedicle <b>valve</b> and which close <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> by pulling on the part of <b>the</b> brachial <b>valve</b> ahead of <b>the</b> hinge. These muscles have both [...] "quick" [...] fibers that close <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> in emergencies and [...] "catch" [...] fibers that are slower but can keep <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> closed for long periods. Articulate brachiopods open <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> by means of abductor muscles, also known as diductors, which lie further to the rear and pull on the part of <b>the</b> brachial <b>valve</b> behind <b>the</b> hinge. Inarticulate brachiopods use a different opening mechanism, in which muscles reduce the length of the coelom (main body cavity) and make it bulge outwards, pushing <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> apart. Both classes open <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> to an angle of about 10Â°. The more complex set of muscles employed by inarticulate brachiopods can also operate <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> as scissors, a mechanism that lingulids use to burrow.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>valves</b> include <b>the</b> hydrophilic <b>valve,</b> <b>the</b> hydrophobic <b>valve,</b> <b>the</b> syphon <b>valve</b> and sacrificial valve.|$|R
25|$|At 07:00 JST on 12 March, Prime Minister Naoto Kan asked Daiichi {{director}} Masao Yoshida why {{his workers}} were not opening <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> to release rising steam pressure within the reactor. Yoshida answered {{that they could}} not open <b>the</b> electrical <b>valves</b> because of <b>the</b> power failure and the radiation was too high to send workers to manually open <b>the</b> <b>valves.</b> Nevertheless, with <b>the</b> pressure and temperatures continuing to rise, at 09:15, TEPCO sent workers to begin manually opening <b>the</b> <b>valves.</b> <b>The</b> high radiation slowed the work and <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> were not opened until 14:30.|$|R
5|$|Pulmonary, or pulmonic {{stenosis}} is {{an often}} congenital narrowing of the pulmonary valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants. Treatment of this cardiac abnormality can require surgery, or non-surgical procedures like balloon valvuloplasty (widening <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> with a balloon catheter).|$|E
5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
50|$|In this species, <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> {{are greatly}} inequal and plano-convex in shape: <b>the</b> right <b>valve</b> is highly convex, and <b>the</b> left <b>valve</b> is {{correspondingly}} concave, an arrangement unusual within the scallop family. <b>The</b> <b>valves</b> are front-back symmetrical, however, and the ears are equal, convex, and rectangularly truncated.|$|R
5000|$|Characteristic of this genus is {{the unusual}} [...] "hammer-shaped" [...] outline of <b>the</b> <b>valves.</b> <b>The</b> shells are nearly equivalved, but the hinge line is {{extremely}} long {{and is at}} nearly a right angle {{to the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>valves,</b> which grow ventrally. The viscera of the organism are arranged in an oval-shaped patch near the umbones of <b>the</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> mitral <b>valve</b> and <b>the</b> aortic <b>valve</b> are in <b>the</b> left heart; <b>the</b> tricuspid <b>valve</b> and <b>the</b> {{pulmonary}} <b>valve</b> are in <b>the</b> right heart.|$|R
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder threads {{may be in}} {{two basic}} configurations: Taper thread and {{parallel}} thread. These thread specifications are detailed in a previous section. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the cylinder. Improperly matched neck threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder valves must {{be closed}} whilst in transit and checked {{that there are}} no leaks. Where applicable, {{protective}} valve caps and covers should be fitted to cylinders before transporting. Cylinders should not be transported with equipment attached to <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> outlet (regulators, hoses etc.).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> poppet <b>valve</b> {{was also}} used on the American Pennsylvania Railroad's T1 duplex locomotives, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> commonly failed because the locomotives were commonly operated in excess of 160 km/h, and <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> were not meant for the stresses of such speeds. <b>The</b> poppet <b>valves</b> also gave <b>the</b> locomotive a distinctive [...] "chuffing" [...] sound.|$|R
50|$|At lower engine speeds, the {{position}} of the camshaft is moved so <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> are opened later, as this improves idling quality and smooth power development.As the engine speed increases, <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> are opened earlier: this enhances torque, reduces fuel consumption and lowers emissions.At high engine speeds, <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> are opened later again, because this allows full power delivery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{camshaft}} (or camshafts, {{depending on}} the design employed) is located above <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> within <b>the</b> cylinder head, and operates either indirectly or directly on <b>the</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
5|$|Excess heat can {{be removed}} by {{immersion}} of the cylinder in a cold water bath while filling. However, immersion for cooling can also {{increase the risk of}} water contaminating <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> orifice of a completely depressurized tank and being blown into the cylinder during filling.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. <b>The</b> <b>valve</b> provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> of <b>the</b> heart do {{not receive}} any {{dedicated}} blood supply, defensive immune mechanisms (such as white blood cells) cannot directly reach <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> via <b>the</b> bloodstream. If an organism (such as bacteria) attaches to a valve surface and forms a vegetation, the host immune response is blunted. The lack of blood supply to <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> also has implications on treatment, since drugs also have difficulty reaching <b>the</b> infected <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|Poromya granulata is a dull-white {{coloured}} shell with dome-shaped {{valves and}} grows to about 18 mm long. <b>The</b> <b>valves</b> are thin and fragile, subequivalve and subequilateral. They are roughly oval in shape with a rounded anterior margin and a subtruncated, sloping posterior margin. The umbones are prominent. The surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> have faint concentric sculpture lines and {{are covered in}} rows of fine granulations. The margins are smooth and the ligament is mostly internal. <b>The</b> right <b>valve</b> has a single cardinal tooth and <b>the</b> left <b>valve</b> has a ridge-like lateral tooth and a socket for the cardinal from <b>the</b> right <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> inside of <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> is nacreous and the pallial line has a broad, shallow sinus.|$|R
50|$|The {{appearance}} and {{form of the}} hooded oyster is very variable. The shape is sometimes nearly circular {{or it may be}} oblong or roughly oval, often with an irregular outline. In the Mediterranean, it grows to 4 to 6 cm, but achieves double that size in the Pacific Ocean. <b>The</b> <b>valves</b> are thick and solid. <b>The</b> lower <b>valve</b> is convex and has no sculpturing near the umbo, which is fixed to the substrate. <b>The</b> upper <b>valve</b> is flat and smaller than <b>the</b> lower <b>valve.</b> It may have wide, sometimes spiny, ribs but is sometimes quite smooth. The margins of <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> are pleated and fit together neatly. The ligament is internal and there are no teeth on the hinge joint. <b>The</b> right <b>valve</b> has some small denticles on its margin which fit into grooves in <b>the</b> left <b>valve</b> margin. A single large adductor muscle holds <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> together, which leaves a large, kidney-shaped scar on the inside of each <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> colour is purplish-brown on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>valves.</b> <b>The</b> inside is white rimmed with black. This oyster could be confused with the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), but is distinguished by having a crenulated margin.|$|R
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> is off, {{the threads}} of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing face of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> and the O-ring groove in the regulator. These are {{more reliable than}} A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableIn recent years, <b>the</b> poppet <b>valve</b> {{has begun}} to serve more {{versatile}} purposes. Before now, <b>the</b> poppet <b>valve</b> was mainly used for emergency release <b>valves</b> while <b>the</b> spool <b>valve</b> was more widely used. <b>The</b> poppet <b>valve</b> has several advantages over <b>the</b> spool <b>valve.</b> <b>The</b> poppet <b>valve</b> forms a tighter seal with the housing to prevent leakage of the hydrolic fluid flowing through the system. <b>The</b> poppet <b>valve</b> is smaller and weighs less than <b>the</b> spool <b>valve</b> and {{will be able to}} give a faster response time. The problem with <b>the</b> poppet <b>valve</b> is that it is under high pressure that needs to be equalized to keep the poppets in balance. Our goal is to build <b>the</b> poppet <b>valve</b> so it works as well as <b>the</b> spool <b>valve</b> and {{can be used in a}} wider range of applications.

50|$|Endocardial cushion defects are {{associated}} with abnormalities of <b>the</b> atrioventricular <b>valves</b> (<b>the</b> mitral <b>valve</b> and <b>the</b> tricuspid <b>valve).</b> These include <b>the</b> cleft mitral <b>valve,</b> and <b>the</b> single atrioventricular <b>valve</b> (a single large, deformed valve that flows into both the right ventricle and the left ventricle).|$|R
5000|$|When the {{adductor}} muscles relax, <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> of <b>the</b> shell {{are automatically}} pulled open {{to some extent}} by a ligament, which joins <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> together and which is usually located on the hinge line between the umbos of the shell. The resiliency of the ligament is what causes <b>the</b> <b>valves</b> of <b>the</b> bivalve mollusk to open when the adductor muscles relax.|$|R
5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, on the edge of <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water {{into and out of the}} mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close <b>the</b> <b>valve</b> of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|E
