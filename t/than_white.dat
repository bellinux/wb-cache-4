Distant residence increases even more the black-white wage gap because of more tiredness and higher commuting costs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tested a}} methodological explanation {{for a double}} paradox in psychiatric epidemiology: a lower prevalence of major depression in Blacks <b>than</b> <b>Whites</b> in the US, coupled with equal {{and higher levels of}} psychological distress in Blacks. The first paradox is a lower prevalence of major depression in Blacks <b>than</b> <b>Whites.</b> The second paradox is the discordant results from comparing Blacks and Whites on depression and distress. These are paradoxes from the vantage points of, respectively, dominant theory and conceptual and empirical understandings of the relationship between disorder and distress. The idea that Blacks in the US express depression and distress more somatically <b>than</b> <b>Whites</b> has been in the literature for decades. If true, it could explain the double paradox. A formal diagnosis of major depression requires endorsing a screening symptom, either sad mood or anhedonia, which are both psychological rather than somatic symptoms. To the extent Blacks express depression more somatically <b>than</b> <b>Whites,</b> depression could be disproportionately undercounted in Blacks due to a lower likelihood of Blacks endorsing a screening symptom, adjusting for underlying levels of depression. Measures of distress share symptom content with the diagnostic criteria for depression but typically do not require endorsing screening symptoms. Thus, if Blacks do somatize depression and distress more somatically <b>than</b> <b>Whites,</b> the depression algorithm may produce a greater undercount of depression in Blacks <b>than</b> <b>Whites,</b> whereas a similar undercount would not occur with distress measures. Accordingly, both paradoxes could be explained. This dissertation has three main parts. In part one, the double paradox is documented in a systematic literature review. Using data from two nationally representative household samples, parts two and three test whether Blacks express depression and distress, respectively, more somatically <b>than</b> <b>Whites,</b> whether this accounts for a lower likelihood of Blacks endorsing a screening symptom, and if (part two only) this explains the Black White depression paradox. The systematic review provides robust evidence of the double paradox. Parts two and three reveal slightly higher levels, respectively, of depression and distress somatization in Blacks <b>than</b> <b>Whites.</b> However, the underlying structure of these small differences provides no evidence of a broad somatization hypothesis in Blacks. Moreover, no evidence is found that the somatization difference inhibits Blacks' endorsement of screening symptoms. One unexpected finding points to subsequent steps to take towards resolving the double paradox...|$|R

The Eurasian rock pipit's dusky, rather <b>than</b> <b>white,</b> outer tail feathers are also a distinction from all its relatives.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 90 - 102) The {{present study}} was designed to test self-hate in three ethnic groups; blacks, whites and chicanes. Self-hate was studied from three perspectives; ethnic esteem (one's descriptions of one's ethnic group), self-esteem (one's feelings about oneself), and ethnic identification (one's preference for and identification with one's own ethnic group). A modified version of the Adjective Check List (ACL) was used to measure ethnic esteem. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was used to measure self-esteem. The Ethnic/Racial Identity Scale was used to measure ethnic identification. The results showed whites to have greater ethnic esteem than blacks (p<. 01). Blacks were found to have greater self-esteem <b>than</b> <b>whites</b> (p<. 01). More blacks identified with their own ethnic group <b>than</b> did <b>whites</b> and chicanes (p<. 005).

The riot, between Chinese immigrant miners and white immigrant miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing labor dispute over the Union Pacific Coal Department's policy of paying Chinese miners lower wages <b>than</b> <b>white</b> miners. This policy caused the Chinese to be hired over the white miners, which further angered the white miners and contributed to the riot.

His last season with Melbourne was 2008, {{in which he was}} dropped {{for the first time in}} his Melbourne career, despite returning to some of his best form. His average number of disposals per match (18.5) was the highest of any season in his career. His long-time understudy Mark Jamar assumed White's position as the premier ruckman at Melbourne, allowing Paul Johnson to play the second-ruckman role. It was the first time in 20 years that anyone other <b>than</b> <b>White</b> or Jim Stynes had been the first-choice ruckman at Melbourne for an extended run of matches. Coach Dean Bailey said that 2008 was the most difficult season that White and team-mate Adem Yze had experienced at the club—the side finished bottom and won just three games. Bailey praised both White and Yze on their professionalism and attitude at the end of the season—the pair's last at Melbourne. White played 15games in 2008—his lowest total in a season with Melbourne. He finished his career at Melbourne in Round 22 against Richmond, kicking two goals and having 17possessions. He received 53Brownlow votes throughout his career—47 with Melbourne and six with Fremantle. He reached double-figures in Brownlow votes on three occasions, with his highest being the 15 votes he received in 2004. He received his final Brownlow vote in Round 7, 2008, in Melbourne's win over Fremantle. He received Brownlow votes in nine of his 14AFL seasons.|$|E
