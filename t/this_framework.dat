40|$|Abstract – Monte Carlo {{simulations}} are extensively used in wide {{of application}} areas. Although the basic framework {{of these is}} simple, they can be extremely computationally intensive. In this paper we present a software framework partitions a generic Monte Carlo simulation into two asynchronous parts: (a) a threaded, GPU-accelerated pseudo-random number generator (or producer), and (b) a multi-threaded Monte Carlo application (or consumer). The advantage {{of this approach is}} that <b>this</b> software <b>framework</b> can be directly used in most any Monte Carlo application without requiring application-specific programming of the GPU. We present an analysis of the performance of <b>this</b> software <b>framework.</b> Finally, we compare this analysis to experimental results obtained from our implementation of <b>this</b> software <b>framework...</b>|$|R
