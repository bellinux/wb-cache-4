After using the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing for the eight different POP-Q points, the p value for statistical significance regarding these points was lowered from 0.05 to 0.006 (alpha 0.05). Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 18.0 (SPSS inc., Chicago, IL).|$|R
5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. <b>Testing</b> <b>to</b> confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, remote {{cameras in}} the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} photographs of OR-7 along with a female wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for DNA <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> determine {{the relationship of the}} pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E
40|$|We studied 2 {{groups of}} {{patients}}. One group of 10 patients had a photosensitive eruption to piroxicam. Another group of 24 patients had positive patch <b>test</b> reactions <b>to</b> thimerosal and thiosalicylic acid {{and had never}} taken piroxicam or tenoxicam. Patients were patch tested with thimerosal 0. 1 % pet., thiosalicylic acid 0. 1 % pet., salicylic acid 2. 0 % pet., piroxicam 1 and 5 % pet. and tenoxicam 1 and 5 % pet. Photopatch tests were also performed with piroxicam and tenoxicam. All 10 patients with photosensitivity to piroxicam had positive patch <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> thimerosal and thiosalicylic acid and 9 of them had positive photopatch <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> piroxicam. 20 out of 24 patients with positive patch <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> thiosalicylic acid also had positive photopatch <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> piroxicam. All the patients tested with salicyclic acid were negative. Out of the 29 patients with positive photopatch <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> piroxicam, none reacted to tenoxicam. In countries with {{a high incidence of}} contact sensitivity to thimerosal/thiosalicylic acid, the use of piroxicam should be avoided and replaced by tenoxicam, a drug without reported photosensitivity...|$|R

5|$|Maintenance of the Phantoms was {{undertaken}} by No.482 Squadron and No.3 Aircraft Depot, {{both of which}} were located at Amberley. In addition to routine servicing, these units modified the Phantoms' AN/APQ-120 radars during early 1971. In response to problems detected during maintenance, RAAF technical personnel checked all the aircraft for defects to their emergency flap system in September 1971 and used X-ray <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> detect any cracks in their stabilators during early 1972.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed red flags, indicate {{the need for}} further <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The {{presence of}} a red flag does not mean that there is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with red flags have no serious underlying problem. If no red flags are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} {{the lifting of the}} Soviet {{moratorium}} in August 1961, and after another failed Anglo-American attempt to have the Soviet Union agree to an atmospheric-test ban, the US restarted testing on 15 September 1961.

5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E
5|$|Following the Belgian Grand Prix on 27 August, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a four-day testing {{session at the}} Monza circuit and concentrated on optimising their car set-ups for low downforce. Jos Verstappen set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of Pedro Diniz. Coulthard was quickest on the second day. Fisichella suffered a high speed crash going into the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. He visited Rome to undergo a medical examination and was diagnosed with an inflamed tendon in his right ankle, but was cleared to race having been advised to take five days of rest. Jacques Villeneuve set the quickest times {{on the third day}} as rain shortened the team's running. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane suffered a high speed accident at the Ascari chicane, forcing <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> be stopped. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the fourth and final day of testing.
