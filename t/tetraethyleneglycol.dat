40|$|Thermal {{discoloration}} {{of cellulose}} (Avicel PH- 101 and Whatman No. 42 filter paper) was studied in N 2 at 160 – 280 °C with glycerol-treated and NaBH 4 -reduced samples, {{to understand the}} role of the reducing end. Thermal discoloration of glycerol-treated Avicel PH- 101, in which some of the reducing ends were converted into glycosides (non-reducing ends), was suppressed compared with the original cellulose, and the level of suppression was directly related to the extent of glycosylation of the reducing ends. The stabilization efficiency of glycerol-treated Whatman No. 42 filter paper suggested that the reducing ends newly formed by reduction of the degree of polymerization (DP) (to about 200) during heat treatment contributed to the discoloration. The important role of the reducing ends in thermal discoloration was supported by the stabilization of Avicel PH- 101 by reduction with NaBH 4 (giving a reducing end content that was 2 % of that of the original cellulose). Thermally induced discoloration was also inhibited by heating cellulose in suspension in the polyether <b>tetraethyleneglycol</b> dimethylether, which has been reported to inhibit the thermal degradation of reducing sugars...|$|E
40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} {{behavior of}} reducing monosaccharides was compared {{in the presence}} and absence of <b>tetraethyleneglycol</b> dimethylether (TEGDE), a polyether (N 2 / 150 – 250 °C). The pyrolytic pathways changed drastically in TEGDE. Glucose started to decompose at > 160 °C under the neat conditions, and polysaccharides, anhydrosugars (levoglucosan and 1, 6 -anhydroglucofuranose), a colored substance and char were the major products. However, glucose was completely stabilized against decomposition in TEGDE and instead converted into fragmentation products including formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, 1, 3 -dihydroxyacetone, erythrose and erythrulose at higher temperatures. The total yield of the fragmentation products reached a 74. 9 wt% at 250 °C. An aldose–ketose isomerization and retro-aldol fragmentation including a six-membered cyclic transition state were suggested as the principle mechanisms. Several other polyethers gave similar results. This unique property of polyether {{can be explained by}} the basicity of the ether oxygen which acts as a proton acceptor for the hydroxyl groups in the sugar. This H-bonding between the polyether and glucose may prevent inter- and intramolecular H-bonding (H-donation to the oxygen atoms) of glucose, which results in stabilization against transglycosylation and dehydration reactions. Such inter- and intramolecular H-bonding (H-donation) may also be involved in the thermal decomposition of the melt sugar as an activation (acid catalysis) mechanism...|$|E

During heating, one passes a region of phase separation in the micellar phase (L- 1 ' + L- 1 ") where the initial micelles rapidly fuse into larger aggregates forming the concentrated L- 1 phase (L- 1 ") with a structure of branched cylindrical micelles, a so-called "living network". The static correlation length of the micelles are increasing with increasing concentration, from ca. 10 nm to 80 nm in the concentration range of 0. 0001 g/cm(3) - 0. 0035 g/cm(3). The overlap concentration was determined to 0. 0035 g/cm(3). When the temperature reaches the L- 1 ' + L-alpha region the network particles transform into bilayer vesicles with a z-average apparent hydrodynamic radius {{in the order of}} 200 nm depending on the composition.

The focus was on the water emulsification failure boundary (wefb) where the aqueous phase forms spherical droplets. The temperature shifts of the wefb, which were caused by the presence of the salt(s), are directly related with the shift of the clouding points of the corresponding oil-free systems. The location of the wefb is affected in a complex manner by the pH (the lower the pH the higher the temperature at which the wefb occurred), the ionic strength and by specific salting-in or salting-out effects of the electrolyte ions. The desired overlap of the wefb of the microemulsions containing the metal salt(s) and the reducing agent, respectively, could be achieved by adding NaOH to the C 12 E 4 -based microemulsions and by titrating 1 -octanol to the Brij 30 -based microemulsions, respectively...|$|E

Irgacure 184 {{was used as a}} photosensitive initiator. The surface of these particles is enriched with MA which is linked by a chelating complex to the initial ZR component. The TEGDMA component is used to introduce more flexibility in the organic inorganic network and to reduce polymerization stresses.

40|$|Non-aqueous {{electrolytes}} play {{a prominent}} role in the redox reactions of the oxygen electrode in the non-aqueous Li-air battery. In all electrolytes the initial O 2 reduction reaction (ORR) product is superoxide, O 2 −, whose stability is determined by the Lewis acidity of the ion-pairing cations present in the medium as governed by the Hard Soft Acid Base (HSAB) theory. Our results suggest that depending on the basicity of the solvent as measured by its Donor Number (DN), the superoxide will be stabilized to varying lengths of time before transforming to O 22 − via a chemical or an electrochemical reaction. Organic solvents decrease the Lewis acidity of Li+ through the formation of solvates, Li+(solvent) n. As a result, high DN solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which decrease Li+ acidity more than low DN solvents, provide longer life-time for the soft base O 2 − by forming the ion pair, Li+(DMSO) n–O 2 −. In low DN solvents such as 1, 2 -dimethoxy ethane (DME) and <b>tetraethyleneglycol</b> dimethyl ether (TEGDME), the LiO 2 rapidly decomposes to the peroxide, Li 2 O 2. As the ionic bond strength between the O 2 reduction product and the conducting salt cation becomes stronger, its rechargeability becomes poorer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{series of}} oligorotaxanes R and R ′ that contain −CH 2 NH 2 +CH 2 − {{recognition}} sites in their dumbbell components have been synthesized employing template-directed protocols. [24]Crown- 8 rings self-assemble by a clipping strategy around {{each and every}} recognition site using equimolar amounts of 2, 6 -pyridinedicarboxaldehyde and <b>tetraethyleneglycol</b> bis-(2 -aminophenyl) ether to efficiently provide up to a [20]rotaxane. In the R series, the −NH 2 +− recognition sites are separated by trismethylene bridges, whereas in the R ′ series the spacers are p-phenylene linkers. The underpinning idea here {{is that in the}} former series, the recognition sites are strategically positioned 3. 5 Å apart from one another so as to facilitate efficient [π···π] stacking between the aromatic residues in contiguous rings in the rotaxanes and consequently, a discrete rigid and rod-like conformation is realized; these noncovalent interactions are absent in the latter series rendering them conformationally flexible/nondiscrete. Although in the R ′ series, the [3]-, [4]-, [8]-, and [12]rotaxanes were isolated after reaction times of < 5 − 30 min in yields of 72 − 85 %, in the R series, the [3]-, [4]-, [5]-, [8]-, [12]-, [16]-, and [20]rotaxanes were isolated in < 5 min to 14 h in 88 − 98 % yields. It follows that while in the R ′ series the higher order oligorotaxanes are formed in lower yields more rapidly, in the R series, the higher order oligorotaxanes are formed in higher yields more slowly.

40|$|Strong {{and weak}} anionic polystyrene/divinylbenzene ion {{exchange}} resins were investigated both as iodophores and as iodine/iodide ion removing agents in blood disinfection applications. Resin-iodine complexes were prepared, but no significant iodine release was observed in either distilled water or isotonic saline solution. However, all ion-exchange resin were able to remove almost quantitatively both iodine and iodide ions from water solutions. Crosslinked styrene/divinylbenzene resins are excellent adsorbents of polyaromatic viruscides, although their hydrophobicity is responsible for poor wettability in physiological fluids. Surface modification with hydrophilic reagents appeared a very promising strategy to overcome this drawback. A Merrifield–type chloromethylated resin and a highly crosslinked mesoporous resin (Lewatit 1064) with large surface area and content of unreacted vinyl groups were selected as starting materials. The Merrifield resin was modified by reaction of pendant chloromethyl groups with triethyleneglycol, <b>tetraethyleneglycol,</b> and β-cyclodextrin. Conversion of Lewatit double bonds into hydrophilic moieties was attempted by radical grafting of N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone, maleic anhydride, 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate, acrylamide, and different PEG methacrylates. Addition of 2 -mercaptoethanol and epoxidation were also investigated. All modified Merrifield resins showed a very low efficiency in the uptake of acridine viruscide, inspite of the huge increase of both wettability and water uptake. On the other hand, all modified Lewatit samples removed very quickly and almost quantitatively the viruscide from aqueous solutions, although only a few samples resulted very hydrophilic.

While BTA 1 (comprising 3 apolar side chains) shows helical columnar packing via threefold ?-helical type intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the solid state {{and up to}} high dilutions in alkane solution (10 - 5 M), helical columnar order is only preserved for asymmetric BTA 2 (comprising 1 polar and 2 apolar side chains) in the solid state and in a concentrated alkane solution (10 - 2 M). The association constant Kass is reduced {{by a factor of}} 107 by introducing one polar tetraEG chain into the BTA. A further {{increase in the number of}} polar tetraEG chains attached to BTA core results in the complete loss of intermolecular hydrogen bond formation in the solid state and in solution. Moreover, for the polar BTAs 3 - 4, comprising 2 or 3 polar tetraEG chains, no self-assembly in water occurs because of the lack of hydrophobic shielding. We propose that tetraEG side chains interfere with the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, weakening the stacking behaviour of these asymmetric derivatives and drastically lowering the association constant due to competing intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. In contrast, one methoxyethyl unit does not affect the stability of the aggregation of BTAs (Kass = 3 × 107 M- 1) showing that more than one EG unit is required to disrupt the self-assembly of BTAs...|$|E

The synthesis and characterization of metal-mediated AuNPs systems using pendant ligands on the AuNP such as 11 -diethylenetriamine-undecane- 1 -thiol, 11 -Mercapto-undecanoic acid [2 -(2 -amino-ethylamino) -ethyl]-amide, Bis(11 -oxo-nicotinic acid, undecine) disulfide, and 11 -mercaptoundecanoic acid, and using Cu(II) to mediate the formation of supramolecular AuNP systems with sizes of 200 nm – 3 µm, are presented. The use of polymers to trap and organize AuNP within polymeric frameworks is discussed.

Twenty-five specimens were prepared for each of 5 different composite resins (Filtek Z 250, Filtek P 60, Quadrant LC, Grandio and Filtek Supreme). Specimens were divided into 5 groups and different polishing procedures, including polishing discs (Pd), polishing discs then diamond polishing paste (PdP), polishing discs then a liquid polishing system (Biscover) (PdB), and combinations of these (PdPB) were used. Unpolished specimens served as the control (C). The specimens were stored for 48 h in a coffee solution. The color of all specimens was measured before and after exposure with a colorimeter, and total color change (DE*) were calculated. The data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA and the means were compared by Tukey HSD test (a= 0. 05). The lowest color difference was observed in the groups PdP and C, while the highest color difference was observed in PdPB, and PdB. When comparing the five different restorative materials, no significant difference was observed between FiltekP 60 and FiltekZ 250, and these materials demonstrated significantly less color change than Quadrant LC and the nanohybrid materials (Grandio, Filtek Supreme).

40|$|Objectives: Specific {{functional}} monomers as {{contained in}} self-etch adhesives {{have been documented}} to chemically bond to hydroxyapatite (HAp). In addition to this chemical bonding potential, also the etching (demineralization) potential of these acidic monomers is important for smear-layer dissolution and to provide surface micro-retention. The etching efficacy of functional monomers is commonly determined by measuring the pH. However, the pH of adhesive solutions cannot be accurately determined. Better is to measure the actual HAp-dissolving capacity, taking into account also the potential of functional monomers to deposit stable monomer-calcium salts. In this study, we investigated the etching efficacy of functional monomers by measuring the calcium concentration using ICP-AES {{and the amount of}} monomer-Ca salt formation using NMR. Methods: The functional monomers 2 -methacryloyloxyethyl dihydrogen phosphate (2 -MEP), 6 -methacryloyloxyhexyl dihydrogen phosphate (6 -MHP), 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10 -MDP), 2 -methacryloxyethyl phenyl hydrogen phosphate (phenyl-P), 4 -methacryloxyethyl trimellitic acid (4 -MET), glycerol phosphate dimethacrylate (GPDM), and 10 -methacryloyloxy <b>tetraethyleneglycol</b> dihydrogen phosphate (MTEGP) were investigated. 1. 0 g functional monomer was used to prepare a 15 wt% monomer/ 45 wt% ethanol/ 40 wt% water solution that was subsequently mixed with 0. 2 g of HAp for 1 hr. [Ca] and [P] of the initial and supernatant liquid were measured using ICP-AES. The precipitation of monomer-Ca salts was confirmed with XRD and analyzed using 31 P MAS NMR. Results: ICP-AES revealed the highest [Ca] produced by phenyl-P, followed in order by 2 MEP = MTEG-P > GPDM > 6 -MHP > 10 -MDP > 4 -MET. Only 10 -MDP formed 10 -MDP_Ca salt, indicating that 10 -MDP released more Ca from HAp than was measured by ICP-AES. Although 10 -MDP seemed to have etched HAp less as appeared from the lower [Ca] measured, part of the released Ca was consumed to form 10 -MDP_Ca salts. Conclusions: The high bonding potential of 10 -MDP-based adhesives is suggested to result from a combined etching and chemical bonding potential. status: submitte...|$|E

The objectives and synthetic pathways towards monomer and polymer formation are evaluated and the best methods are highlighted as being versatile and promising for the synthesis {{of a wide range of}} main chain azopolymers. As a result of their intricate design, the polymers are capable of response to irradiation by means of reversible trans-to-cis photo-isomerization of the azo-linkages. The extent of the photo-switchability in various solvents is evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and the structural changes upon isomerization are resolved with 1 H NMR analysis. The choice of the calix[4]arene and crown ether units as major chemical components enables interaction of the polymers with low molar mass guests (evidenced by titration experiments monitored by means of 1 H NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy). This supramolecular activity is shown to be influenced by the photo-stationary state of the polymers in the case of poly(azocalix[4]arene) s and thus a serial photo-tuning of the extent of the host-guest interaction is possible. For the poly(azodibenzo- 18 -crown- 6 -ether) s addition of guests leads to phase separation of the polymers from certain solutions. By incorporating <b>tetraethyleneglycol</b> monomethyl ether chains into the lower rim of the calixarene units, thermo-responsive behaviour could be induced onto the poly(azocalix[4]arene) framework. Lower critical solution (LCST) type transitions in water and upper critical solution (UCST) type transitions in alcohols were observed, which are strongly dependent on the degree of polymerization, concentration and choice of solvent. The latter was also demonstrated for the poly(azodibenzo- 18 -crown- 6 -ether) s. In both cases, the UCST type behaviour may be influenced by irradiation. The reversible trans-to-cis photo-isomerization decreases the demixing temperature of the solutions proportionally to the trans content of the samples. Thermal relaxation reverts the isomerization and the cloud point values from prior to irradiation are regained. For the tegylated poly(azocalix[4]arene) s the isomerization may also be induced in the phase separated state, leading to dissolution of the polymers, as the UCST value is shifted. This may be done locally in a thin 1 mm quartz cuvette, yielding areas of translucency in the polymer dispersion upon irradiation and a possible photo-writing application. The thermo-responsive properties of the crown ether polymers may also be influenced by the addition of barium ions, which act as dynamic intermolecular crosslinkers increasing the cloud point values. These polymers are also shown to be solvatochromic and pH-sensitive...|$|E
