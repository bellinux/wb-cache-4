The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. Due {{to the success of the}} show, the New York Daily News reported that Nickelodeon picked up SpongeBob SquarePants for an eighth season on December 14, 2009, during the year which the show was celebrating its tenth anniversary on television. Brown Johnson, president of animation for Nickelodeon and MTVN Kids & Family Group, announced the renewal of the series.

Audiences of all ages have fallen in love with this show and we're delighted to be serving up additional original episodes <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>viewers</b> for many years." ...|$|E
500|$|According to NFL {{spokesman}} Brian McCarthy, [...] "Our {{system was}} late {{to obscure the}} inappropriate gesture and we apologize <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>viewers.</b> The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show. There was a failure in NBC's delay system. The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans". McCarthy said that the gesture was not made during rehearsals, and M.I.A. improvised it on stage. The Federal Communications Commission received 222 complaints about the rapper's gesture, and Rolling Stone reported that the commission might [...] "punish" [...] the NFL and NBC despite their apologies. Any fine imposed on the NFL would be charged to M.I.A., since the rapper had signed a contract [...] indemnifying the league against FCC fines. A year later, {{it was reported that}} the NFL had filed a $1.5 million arbitration claim against M.I.A. for [...] "breach of her contract and flagrant disregard for the values that form the cornerstone of the NFL brand and the Super Bowl". Her lawyer, Howard King, filed a counterclaim calling the NFL's action [...] "hilarious in light of the weekly felonies committed by its stars". M.I.A. enlisted the help of fans in documenting objectionable actions by the NFL to refute the league's claim of damage to its reputation.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} gained widespread {{attention from}} the media after M.I.A. extended her middle finger to the camera {{near the end of}} her verse instead of singing the word [...] "shit". Media criticized M.I.A. for the gesture and compared the incident to Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction. People said, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna herself expressed her disappointment during an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She felt that it was a [...] "teenager... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do during the show, since it was [...] "out of place". Brian McCarthy, spokesman for the NFL said, [...] "Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>viewers.</b> The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show.

[...] McCarthy also clarified that the gesture was not revealed during rehearsals, M.I.A. improvised it on stage.

500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{brought back}} the [...] "Cortexiphan kids", {{introduced}} {{in the first two}} seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted {{the end of the season}} to be a [...] "beautiful culmination of everything" [...] while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but [...] "Over There" [...] marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: [...] "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line." [...] Wyman said that the parallel universe [...] "is a reminder <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>viewers</b> that your life is what your choices are." [...] The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible." [...] Pinkner later elaborated, [...] "We're interested in world building and all that stuff is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." [...] They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{component}} of the NAVIRE Viewer, which is an application to allow a user to virtually navigate in a remote scene in real-time from a collection of pre-captured panoramic views. The work presented in this paper concerns viewpoint interpolation which is essential to achieve smooth and realistic viewpoint transition while the user is moving from one panorama <b>to</b> another. <b>Our</b> <b>viewer</b> achieves real-time interpolation between panoramas by using a precalculate flow field between a pair of images, and by applying a view morphing algorithm to generate virtual viewpoints in-between existing views. A GPU implementation of the viewpoint interpolation algorithm has been developped allowing to generate virtual viewpoints at a rate of up to 300 panoramas per seconds...|$|R
