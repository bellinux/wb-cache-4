5|$|Only a {{few days}} after this {{election}} result, the declaring of independence by Kosovo on February 17, 2008 spurred off widespread unrest in Serbia, during which the embassy of the United States was evacuated and then torched by a mob. One man of Serbian nationality was killed inside of the embassy during <b>the</b> <b>unrest.</b> Serbia temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Washington, D.C., but the U.S. embassy in Belgrade was closed only for several days. Ambassador Cameron Munter said that no degrading of relations were expected regardless of <b>the</b> <b>unrest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the 1967 Detroit riot, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead {{an investigation into the}} cause of <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> and interview civil rights leaders for the Kerner Commission.

5|$|On 11October Valckenier unsuccessfully {{requested}} that officers control their troops {{and stop the}} looting. Two days later the council established a reward of two ducats for every Chinese head surrendered to the soldiers as an incentive for the other ethnic groups {{to assist in the}} purge. As a result, ethnic Chinese who had survived the initial assault were hunted by gangs of irregulars, who killed those Chinese they found for the reward. The Dutch worked with natives in different parts of Batavia; ethnic Bugis and Balinese grenadiers were sent to reinforce the Dutch on 14October. On 22October Valckenier called for all killings to cease. In a lengthy letter in which he blamed <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> entirely on the Chinese rebels, Valckenier offered an amnesty to all Chinese, except for the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>unrest,</b> on whose heads he placed a bounty of up to 500 rijksdaalders.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} 1522 brought no {{clarification}} on the issues. Not only did <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> between Zurich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Zurich's Confederation {{partners in the}} Swiss Diet. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Zurich. The city council felt obliged {{to take the initiative}} and find its own solution.|$|E
5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. He had some of the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through which two 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Puglia {{had been}} {{assigned}} to patrol the Dalmatian coast. On 11 July 1920, men from the ship became involved in <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> in Split. During a violent confrontation with a group of Croats, the ship's captain and a sailor were shot and killed. Puglia was sold for scrapping on 22 March 1923. While the ship was being dismantled, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini donated the ship's bow section to the writer and ardent nationalist Gabriele D'Annunzio, who had it installed at his estate as part of the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the British and French {{intervened in}} the Russian Civil War; this {{included}} a major naval deployment to the Baltic Sea, which included Waldeck-Rousseau. Shortly after arriving, her crew mutinied due to poor living conditions {{and a desire}} to return to France. <b>The</b> <b>unrest</b> was quickly suppressed, and Waldeck-Rousseau joined the effort to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. In May 1929, the ship was sent to French Indochina to serve as the flagship of the Far East squadron. She remained there until May 1932, when she returned to France, where she was decommissioned and hulked. Waldeck-Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 194144.|$|E
5|$|An International Express Mail Agreement and {{regulations}} were signed between the United States and Solomon Islands governments in Honiara and Washington, D.C. on 19 April and 27 June 1991, {{coming into effect}} on 1 August 1991. On 6 November 1998, a peace agreement was signed in Honiara between the United States and Solomon Islands governments. However, since the late 1990s, Honiara has been the centre of ethnic violence and political unrest in the country. The area around Honiara was the battle ground of rival factions during <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> {{as a result of}} the dominance of Malaitans, who were outsiders, and the local Guadalcanal islanders.|$|E

5|$|As Hammurabi was {{assisted}} {{during the}} war in the south by his allies from the north such as Yamhad and Mari, the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest. Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> and soon after crushing Eshnunna. Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although {{it is possible that the}} 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. <b>The</b> <b>unrest</b> caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E

5|$|At the war's outset, FRELIMO {{had little}} {{hope for a}} {{conventional}} military victory, with a mere 7000 combatants against a far larger Portuguese force. Their hopes rested on urging the local populace to support the insurgency, in order to force a negotiated independence from Lisbon. Portugal fought {{its own version of}} protracted warfare, and a large military force was sent by the Portuguese government to quell <b>the</b> <b>unrest,</b> with troop numbers rising from 8,000 to 24,000 between 1964 and 1967. The number of local soldiers recruited for the Portuguese cause rose to 23,000 in the same period. 860 Special Forces operatives were also being trained in Commando Instruction Centres by 1969.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw {{sustained}} pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in {{the capital}} of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. In March, martial law was declared and Saudi troops were called in. Despite the hard crackdown and official ban, the protests continued. According to the International Federation for Human Rights, at least 80 people were killed during <b>the</b> <b>unrest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chinese media {{coverage}} of the Ürümqi riots was extensive, and was compared favourably to that of <b>the</b> <b>unrest</b> in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications were immediately cut off. In the weeks that followed, official sources reported that over 1,000 Uyghurs were arrested and detained; Uyghur-run mosques were temporarily closed. The communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of January 2010. By November2009, over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during the riots. Nine were executed in November 2009, and by February 2010, at least 26 had received death sentences.|$|E
