50|$|A <b>Tee</b> <b>connector</b> is an {{electrical}} connector that connects three cables together. It is {{usually in the}} shape of a capital T. It is usually used for coax cables and the three connector points can be either female or male gender, and could be different or the same standard, such as F type BNC or N type.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present work was to develop and {{optimize}} a continuous flow interface to improve the poor concentration detection limits of capillary electrophoresis which are one of its main limitations. The question was how the flow rate, applied voltage, interface and capillary dimensions and conductivities of background electrolyte and sample solution affect the electrokinetic sample injection in a continuous sample flow interface. Optimizing these parameters has the potential to perform near quantitative injection from large sample volumes in a short time. This can lead to the improvement of a variety of existing techniques that aim at lowering the concentration detection limits of CE. The injection voltage and flow rate have been optimized and their effect on the injected sample amount has been investigated using a <b>tee</b> <b>connector</b> in a commercial capillary electrophoresis instrument. The effect of sample injection from both flowing and static sample volumes was investigated. Using a <b>tee</b> <b>connector</b> interface with flowing sample injection, four times more analyte could be injected into the capillary than in a static system. Theoretical simulations along with experiments were performed to investigate the effect of flow rate and injection voltage on the injected sample. The results confirmed that more analyte could be injected into the capillary in a flowing sample interface due to depletion of the ions from the flowing stream indicating near quantitative injection of all of the ions. Significant enhancement in the proportion of sample ions that are injected when injecting from a flowing sample stream has been demonstrated and this work is the only to compare electrokinetic injection of the same sample volume, under the same conditions with the only difference being whether the sample stream was flowing or static. After having established the influence of the flow rate and injection voltage on the injected sample amount a mathematical model of the continuous sample flow interface was developed. The aim was to investigate the influence of the interface dimensions on the depletion flow rate, which is the maximum flow rate at a given voltage at which > 90...|$|E

Basic shapes such as 90 degree elbows and <b>Tee</b> <b>connectors</b> are used, but more complex and specialized connectors are implemented as well, enabling a more diverse set of constructions than with just the simple shapes.|$|R
40|$|During fuel combustion, {{mercury in}} the form of Hg 0 and Hg 2 + is emitted to the atmosphere. Effective {{reduction}} of mercury emission requires the application of speciation systems for emission control and research. To study the speciation of mercury in flue gas a portable and continuous system was constructed. The speciation system is based on the wet method of Hg 2 + transformation to Hg 0. The main part of the system is the Nippon Instrument Corporation EMP- 2 WLE- 8 set. In order to operate in flue gas from coal burning the Nippon Instrument Corporation set was equipped with the following devices: fly ash filter, steel probe, transfer line, and the <b>tee</b> <b>connector.</b> The portable, continuous system was successfully tested in the laboratory and during the industrial tests in Poland and the Czech Republic. The described system was also used to determine mercury in the process gases (low-temperature pyrolysis of coal). The results of mercury speciation in flue gas were compared with Durag HM 1400 TRX system. Web of Science 154514...|$|E
40|$|Current on-line {{solid-phase}} extraction methods {{combined with}} HPLC for shortening the clean-up operation are {{not suitable for}} simultaneously detecting compounds that have {{a wide variety of}} hydrophobicities. To solve these problems, we designed a new on-line sample preparation system. The system consists of an eluting pump, a mixing <b>TEE</b> <b>connector,</b> a 10 -port 2 -position valve and a solid-phase extraction precolumn. The eluate from the precolumn is diluted with a weak solvent from the HPLC at the TEE connection to load low hydrophobic compounds onto the analytical column. The proposed on-line sample preparation system was successfully applied to the simultaneous analysis of 21 pesticides in river water using LC/TOF-MS. In this method, the recoveries from river water samples were 67 to 126 % (mean 83 %), the reproducibility (CV%) was in the range from 1. 1 to 11 % (mean 5. 6 %), the calibration curve was linear in the range from 1 ppb to 500 ppb (r > 0. 999) and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were in the range from 0. 0034 ppb (daimuron) to 3. 3 ppb (oxine-copper). 2006 Â© The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry...|$|E
