5|$|The Buccaneers {{won their}} first playoff game in team history by holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards, while running back Ricky Bell {{recorded}} 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. Bell's 38 rushing attempts set a playoff record, tied later by John Riggins in Super Bowl XVII, while the Eagles' Wilbert Montgomery {{was held to}} 35 yards on 12 attempts. The Buccaneers' opening drive resulted in a Bell touchdown, and a Neil O'Donoghue field goal gave the Buccaneers an early 10–0 lead. Wally Chambers forced a Montgomery fumble that was recovered by Randy Crowder on the 4-yard line and led to Bell's second touchdown run, giving the Buccaneers a 17–0 second-quarter lead. Trying to extend that lead before halftime, Doug Williams hurried a pass <b>that</b> <b>wound</b> {{up in the hands}} of Eagles linebacker Jerry Robinson at the Tampa Bay 11-yard line. This set up Ron Jaworski's touchdown pass to Charles Smith. After the Eagles narrowed the gap to 17–10 on a Tony Franklin field goal, a series of Lee Roy Selmon sacks of Jaworski killed the Eagles' rally. A 9-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles completed the Buccaneers' scoring. It was only in the final minutes of the game that the Eagles were able to put together a long drive, ending in a touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael. The Buccaneers held the ball for over 36 minutes of the game. The Buccaneers' defensive strategy revolved around stopping Carmichael and Montgomery. At one point, when Leroy Harris was gang-tackled following a short reception, the entire Buccaneer defense was penalized for unnecessary roughing. The Buccaneers' hard-hitting play intimidated the Eagles' receivers into dropping 10 passes. Going into the matchup, the Eagles were expected to have edges in playoff and quarterback experience. Jaworski was the third-rated quarterback in the NFC, while Williams had the lowest rating of all NFC starting quarterbacks. The game represented a rematch of old coaching rivals, McKay of USC and Dick Vermeil of UCLA. The game was the Buccaneers' first on national television. Word of the upset spread as far as Iran, where the hostages were surprised to learn of the Buccaneers' contention for the Super Bowl.|$|E

25|$|Films such as Valley of the Dolls (1967), Mommie Dearest (1981) and Burlesque (2010) gained camp status {{primarily}} due to the filmmakers' {{attempting to}} produce a serious film <b>that</b> <b>wound</b> up unintentionally comedic. Award-winning actresses, like Patty Duke in Valley of the Dolls and Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest, gave such over-the-top performances that the films became camp classics, especially attracting fanfare from male gay audiences.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationale}} for IORT is {{to deliver a}} high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is <b>that</b> <b>wound</b> fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2014, Phish {{embarked}} on a 25-show tour including stops <b>that</b> <b>wound</b> a path from Massachusetts to the Midwest, and from the Mid-Atlantic to Georgia. For the third consecutive year, Phish played a three-night run of shows at Saratoga Performing Arts Center over the 4th of July holiday. Phish also made their first visit to Randall's Island in New York City. August 2014 ended with three performances at Dick's Sporting Goods Park, firmly establishing the annual Colorado pilgrimage as a Labor Day tradition for Phish fans. This tradition was upheld with three-night runs over the holiday in following years, bringing {{the total number of}} shows at this venue (and on this same weekend, taboot) to 18 as of September 4, 2016. The 2014 Fall tour included stops in Oregon, Washington, California, and ended in Las Vegas, Nevada, where Phish once again debuted new music on Halloween. The October 31, 2014 performance at MGM Grand Las Vegas featured a second set consisting of ten original songs inspired by a 1964 novelty record from Walt Disney Studios, Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House. 2014 ended with a three-set show on New Year's Eve in Miami, Florida, followed by three more nights of performances to ring in 2015.|$|E

500|$|The {{compilation}} album received universal critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{gave the}} collection five stars and {{compared it to}} Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, saying that although {{they had the same}} length, they were [...] "different listening experiences". He also noted that the more recent tracks [...] "help push The Singles away from teen pop and toward pure dance-pop bliss. [...] It does result in a stronger overall listen, since there are no slow patches here, just a parade of relentless hooks and rhythms <b>that</b> <b>wound</b> up defining the sound of a decade". Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy also gave the album five stars stating that [...] " [...] perfectly captures the career of one of the best singles artists of the last ten years. Running from '...Baby One More Time' to 'Radar', you get a single-disc timeline that shows a progression in style and substance from school uniform-wearing pop ingénue to sultry motorik saucepot. [...] The only arguable weak link is the Madonna-featuring 'Me Against the Music', but in this context what once looked like a respectful passing of the baton now seems like an unconditional surrender of pop Queendom to its rightful heir." [...] The reviewer also noted the impact on popular culture and pop music of Spears, highlighting [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Stronger".|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, McCotter {{was criticized}} in the Des Moines Sunday Register for a {{statement}} he made during a sermon about child rearing.

In it, McCotter said, [...] "When you discipline, this verse indicates, as others do, {{that you want to}} do it so it wounds. Now, when you say ‘wounds,’ it doesn’t mean that you have a bloody mess on your hands necessarily. It doesn’t mean that you have a child ‘wounding’ like he has a broken leg....

2500|$|At {{the time}} he wrote [...] "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" [...] in early 1940, Borges was little known outside of Argentina. He was working in a local public library in Buenos Aires, and had a certain local fame as a {{translator}} of works from English, French and German, and as an avant garde poet and essayist (having published regularly in widely read Argentinian periodicals such as El Hogar, {{as well as in}} many smaller magazines, such as Victoria Ocampo's Sur, where [...] "Tlön..." [...] was originally published). In the previous two years he had been through a great deal: his father had died in 1938, and on Christmas Eve 1938, Borges himself had suffered a severe head wound in an accident; during treatment for <b>that</b> <b>wound,</b> he nearly died of a blood infection.|$|E
2500|$|The Angola State Farm, now Louisiana State Penitentiary, began {{operations}} in the early 1900s. [...] Its location was formerly the site of several 19th Century plantations on the east bank of the Mississippi River in West Feliciana Parish. [...] The addition of Route 124 created a state-maintained access road from the prison to the main highway through the area, State Route 3, which became part of US 61 later the same year. [...] Route 124 followed the existing Tunica Trace, an old Native American pathway <b>that</b> <b>wound</b> through the area's hilly terrain. [...] A straighter path connecting more directly with the important town of St. Francisville was plotted and added to the state highway system in 1928 as State Route 325.

2500|$|CBS simply made far {{too high}} of a bid (especially for a network <b>that</b> <b>wound</b> up {{frustrating}} fans with {{its lack of}} regular season coverage) and sustained a shortfall in advertising revenue. Perhaps it is somewhat ironic that back in , CBS Sports president Neal Pilson said of ABC's then ongoing contract with Major League Baseball [...] "Three years ago, we believed ABC's package was overpriced by $175 million. We still believe it's overpriced by $175 million." [...] Whereas from 1976 to 1989, ABC split the television contract with NBC, and therefore logically, split the financial risks, CBS in sharp contrast, aggressively negotiated exclusive postseason rights. In December 1988, Arthur Watson, the president of NBC Sports, criticized CBS saying [...] "We {{made every effort to}} keep it. Regretfully, someone bid far more than was responsible. Everybody evaluates things differently. That bid was beyond our reach. Let them explain that bid." ...|$|E
