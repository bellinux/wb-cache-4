5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded in <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> command-and-control server, {{and used to}} encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on ground speed), a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E

Flight 1 became airborne at 10:07 AM EST. Following American Airlines procedures and Departure Control instructions, the aircraft initiated a left <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> heading of 290. In {{the course of the}} turn, at 1,600 feet, the Boeing banked too far, flipped past 90 degrees, and began an upside-down, nose-first descent in a nearly vertical dive.|$|E
5|$|Despite losing {{much of its}} {{convection}} over land, Hudah {{maintained a}} well-organized cloud structure once in the Mozambique Channel on April3. As a result of moving back over warm waters, the system began to re-intensify, and attained moderate tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on April4. Meanwhile, a large central dense overcast developed, and Hudah began to track west-southwestward as opposed to its previous westward trajectory. Despite computer forecast models suggesting that Hudah would continue westward, the storm instead <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> southward drift, giving it time to strengthen in the Mozambique Channel. This {{was the result of}} a mid-latitude trough weakening the nearby subtropical ridge. By 1800UTC on April5, Hudah was upgraded back to tropical cyclone intensity. A banding eye began to appear on satellite imagery, though it remained generally unstable, and a large banding feature formed over the western half of Hudah. The nearby trough later weakened in intensity, causing the tropical cyclone to move north-northwestward towards the Mozambique coast on April7. It was at this time that Hudah reached a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160km/h (100mph). The tropical cyclone accelerated northwards throughout the day, eventually making its final landfall near Pebane, Mozambique at 0600UTC on April8 as a slightly weaker storm. Once inland, Hudah rapidly weakened, and was no longer tracked by the MFR by 0000UTC on April9. The JTWC issued its final warning on the system six hours later, as the remnants of Hudah moved through northeastern Mozambique, producing spotty convection.|$|E
5|$|On August28, Iris {{moved away}} from the Lesser Antilles, and at 1800UTC re-attained {{hurricane}} status as it began a steady motion to the north-northwest. By that time, there was uncertainty in its future track due to the possible interactions among Iris, Humberto to the northeast, Tropical Storm Karen to the southeast, and the remnants of Tropical Storm Jerry to the west. In addition, after Tropical Storm Luis formed on August27, there were four active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic. A few days later, there were three simultaneous hurricanes, which is a rare event, when Luis attained hurricane status. On August30, Iris turned to the northeast while it began interacting directly with Tropical Storm Karen. Over the next few days, the smaller tropical storm moved around the larger circulation of Iris, potentially causing the hurricane to move erratically. Iris' intensity did not change significantly during that time, and it maintained strong outflow but a weak eyewall. An eastward-moving trough bypassed the storm to the north, causing the motion to become nearly stationary. A building ridge to the northeast caused Iris to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> northwest drift on September1. By that time, the eye had become distinct and well-organized, and at 0600UTC that day, Iris attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) to the southeast of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|Stuart painted George Washington in {{a series}} of iconic portraits, each of them leading in <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> demand for copies, and keeping Stuart busy and highly paid for years. The most famous and celebrated of these likenesses is known as The Athenaeum and is {{currently}} portrayed on the United States one dollar bill. Stuart, along with his daughters, painted a total of 130 reproductions of The Athenaeum. However, he never completed the original version; after finishing Washington's face, he kept the original version to make the copies. He sold up to 70 of his reproductions for a price of US$100 each, but the original portrait was left unfinished at the time of Stuart's death in 1828. The painting was jointly purchased by the National Portrait Gallery and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1980, and was on display in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. in late 2014.|$|E
