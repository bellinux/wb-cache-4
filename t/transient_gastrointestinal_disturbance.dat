40|$|Excessive {{weight gain}} {{occurred}} in a patient who was taking sodium valproate and phenytoin. The sodium valproate was therefore withdrawn but the rapid weight loss that ensued led to phenytoin intoxication. Hence a retrospective analysis was conducted of 100 children with epilepsy treated with sodium valproate. Fit control improved in 77 and was best in children with generalised epilepsy. None of the reported severe side effects, such as acute liver disease and pancreatitis, were encountered. Milder but troublesome side effects, however, occurred in 65 patients. The commonest was increased weight gain, which occurred in 44 cases. Others were <b>transient</b> <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbances</b> (20), lassitude (nine), transient hair loss (six), transient enuresis (seven), and aggressive behaviour (four) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ciclosporin is a calcineurin {{inhibitor}} that {{is currently}} registered {{for the treatment of}} canine atopic dermatitis. The most common adverse effects include mild, <b>transient</b> <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Single case reports of opportunistic infections due to Nocardia spp., Neospora spp. and papillomaviruses have also been reported. Hypothesis/Objectives: Clinicians {{should be aware of the}} potential risk of systemic immunosuppression and subsequent infection with Nocardia spp. in dogs receiving ciclosporin. Animals: Cutaneous nocardiosis in two dogs receiving ciclosporin therapy for management of canine atopic dermatitis. Methods: Histopathology, PCR for Nocardia spp. and computed tomography. Results: One dog developed disseminated nocardiosis due to Nocardia brasiliensis and a second dog developed localized cutaneous nocardiosis due to a novel Nocardia species subsequent to ciclosporin administration at the recommended dose rate for the management of canine atopic dermatitis. The second case was receiving a combination of ciclosporin and ketoconazole, and serum trough ciclosporin levels were elevated. Conclusions and clinical importance: Clinicians should be aware of the potential risk of systemic immunosuppression and subsequent infection with Nocardia spp. in dogs receiving ciclosporin. Measurement of serum ciclosporin levels may be useful in identifying those individuals which are at risk of opportunistic infections...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide- 1 {{receptor}} agonists (GLP- 1 RAs) are injectable agents {{used for}} the treatment of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. The interest for this pharmacological class is rising with the development of once weekly compounds and the demonstration of a potential reduction in cardiorenal outcomes. Areas covered: The paper describes the main pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of dulaglutide, a new once-weekly GLP- 1 RA. Dulaglutide was extensively investigated in the phase- 3 AWARD program, which demonstrated its safety and efficacy when compared to placebo or active glucose-lowering agents in patients treated with diet alone, metformin or sulfonylurea monotherapy, oral dual therapies and basal insulin. In both Caucasian and Japanese patients, comparative trials showed better glucose control with dulaglutide, with a minimal risk of hypoglycemia and weight loss, but at the expense of an increased dropout rate due to side effects, mostly <b>transient</b> <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Dulaglutide proved its non-inferiority versus liraglutide and the safety and tolerance profile {{is similar to that of}} other GLP- 1 RAs. Expert opinion: The once-weekly formulation and the combined positive effects on both glucose control and weight improves patient satisfaction despite nausea. Dulaglutide must prove its capacity to reduce cardiovascular and diabetic complications in the ongoing prospective REWIND trial. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBlood transfusions {{represent}} a main component of supportive care in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). To avoid organ {{damage caused by}} transfusion-dependent iron overload, an adequate iron chelation therapy is required. Recently, a new oral iron chelator deferasirox (ICL 670, Exjade®) has become available. A {{study was conducted to}} demonstrate the efficacy and tolerability of deferasirox in transfusion-dependent iron-overloaded patients with MDS. The efficacy of deferasirox was monitored by changes in serum ferritin, bone marrow iron, and liver iron concentration (LIC), as determined by T 2 *-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Twelve patients with MDS of different subtypes (median age 76  years, range 53 – 91) were enrolled. Deferasirox administered in a once-daily dose of 20 – 30  mg/kg for 12  months was effective in reducing median ferritin concentration from 1, 515  µg/L (range 665 – 6, 900) to 413  µg/L (range 105 – 3, 052). Within the first 4  weeks of treatment before the continuous decline of ferritin levels, the values markedly rose in eight of 12 patients. The median LIC declined from 315 to 230  µmol/g ([*]=[*] 0. 02) at the end of study, accompanied by a reduction of bone marrow siderosis. The most common adverse events were mild and <b>transient</b> <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbances,</b> skin rash, nonprogressive transient increases in serum creatinine and urine β 2 -microglobulin, and a temporary reduction of the creatinine clearance. The renal parameters normalized after end of treatment. No hematologic toxicities were observed. Deferasirox proved to be effective in transfusion-dependent iron overload in MDS by mobilizing iron deposits in liver and at least stabilizing iron stores in bone marrow...|$|R

40|$|Grass eating {{behaviour}} in {{the domestic}} dog {{may be related to}} gastrointestinal distress. To explore this theory, the current study observed grass eating behaviours in dogs fed a standard diet with and without supplementation of a fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS). The FOS diet temporarily induced loose, watery stools to Simulate a mild <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbance.</b> During both FOS Diet and Standard Diet periods, dogs were presented with couch (Cynodon dactylon) and kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) grasses, and the time spent eating grass and the number of grass eating and vomiting events was recorded. Our study found that dogs spent significantly more time eating grass when fed the standard diet and producing normal stools than when they were fed the FOS diet and producing loose stools, suggesting that dogs do not use grass to self-medicate a diarrhoeal <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbance.</b> However, this does not preclude that other forms of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbance</b> may be self-medicated by grass eating behaviours. Importantly, dogs did not use grass as an emetic, as there were only two vomiting events and 374 grass eating events observed. Alternatively, the reduction in grass eating may be attributable to a feeling of satiety caused by the fermentation of FOS. For further clarity, future research should examine the effect of other <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbances,</b> such as constipation (hard, dry stools) or nausea, on grass eating behaviour {{in the domestic}} dog.

We aimed to predict the occurrence of these <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbances</b> with rivastigmine therapy for optimal drug choice and improved compliance. Materials and methods: Thirty patients with mild-to-moderate AD (scores 10 – 22 on the Mini-Mental State Examination) were administered a rivastigmine 18 mg patch with domperidone 30 mg (RWD) and without domperidone (RWOD; n = 15 each) for 20 weeks. <b>Gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbances</b> were evaluated using a frequency scale for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (FSSG), Bristol stool form scale, laboratory data (hemoglobin, albumin, total cholesterol), body weight, and amount of food intake. Results: After 12 weeks, FSSG scores {{were higher in the}} RWOD group compared to baseline scores; however, no significant differences were noted between the RWD and RWOD groups. We then subdivided each group based on high and low baseline scores; the RWOD high-score (≥ 4) subgroup showed increased FSSG after 12 weeks compared with the baseline score. In both RWD and RWOD groups, the low-score (≤ 3) subgroups showed no changes during the dose-escalation phase. Conclusion: For AD patients with higher FSSG scores at baseline, domperidone was effective in preventing rivastigmine-related <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Keywords: Alzheimer&# 39;s disease, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, domperidone, gastroesophageal reflux disease, <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>disturbance,</b> rivastigmin...|$|R
