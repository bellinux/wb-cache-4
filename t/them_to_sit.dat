5|$|In 1845 King's {{established}} a Military Department to train officers for the Army and the British East India Company, and in 1846 a Theological Department to train Anglican priests. In 1855, King's pioneered evening classes in London; that King's granted {{students at the}} evening classes certificates of college attendance to enable <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> University of London degree exams was cited {{as an example of}} the worthlessness of these certificates in the decision by the University of London to end the affiliated colleges system in 1858 and open their examinations to everyone.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Law School offers rising third-year {{students}} the opportunity to obtain a dual degree from Sciences Po in Paris. Students who successfully complete this program earn a French law diploma (entitling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for the French bar exam) and a J.D. degree from Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Requirements {{of sitting}} in HKALE are {{independent}} from Form 6 admissions {{since they are}} managed by separate organisations. A student who passes all the minimum requirements for sitting in HKALE also meets all the requirements for applying for Form 6, but not vice versa. Schools may admit a student who failed in language subjects, providing that the school would bear the risk that he/she may not pass again in the following year, not allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for the HKALE.|$|E

50|$|Stemming {{from the}} Kaepernick controversy, before the {{beginning}} of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey tournament in Toronto, Canada, Team USA coach John Tortorella threatened his players that if any one of <b>them</b> were <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.|$|R
25|$|The {{youngest}} {{children were}} employed as ventilation tenters. Ventilation {{in the mines}} was controlled {{by a series of}} wooden doors across the passages, these children would sit in a niche dug out of the wall, opening and closing these doors to allow miners and tubs to pass. It was common for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the dark for up to 8 hours a day. Other young children were employed as pony tenters, they would feed and water the pit ponies in the underground stables.|$|E
25|$|King George III's reign is of {{particular}} note {{in the history of}} the Peerage. Increases to the Peerage during the time were totally unprecedented: almost four hundred peers were created during his reign. Lord North and William Pitt the Younger were especially liberal in dispensing peerage dignities, a device used to obtain majorities in the House of Lords. It became apparent that the representation of Scottish peers was inadequate: they had continued to elect but sixteen peers, while the number of British peers had increased tremendously. To account for this deficiency in representation, British hereditary peerages were granted to Scottish peers, thereby entitling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the House of Lords.|$|E
25|$|The replay {{was played}} {{in front of}} a small but very vocal Boro crowd who were fired up by an {{unfortunately}} worded letter from the club seemingly asking <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and be quiet in their last home game. The fans didn't have to wait long for a goal as in the fifth minute Stewart Downing curled an unstoppable free-kick over the wall and into the top-right hand corner of the net. Tuncay doubled the lead with a volley as West Ham's defense failed to clear the ball. The visitors dominated the possession but could not convert it to goals, and with Middlesbrough threatening on the counterattack, they couldn't afford to neglect their defensive duties. In the end, the 2–0 was enough to see Middlesbrough through to the last eight for the fourth consecutive season.|$|E

25|$|Stalin {{worked into}} the evenings, eating lunch at 4 or 5pm and dinner no earlier than 9pm; other senior {{political}} figures had to accommodate his unusual working patterns. He {{spent much time}} in the Kremlin cinema, where he enjoyed watching films with other high-ranking officials late at night; he had a particular fondness for the Western genre. Stalin enjoyed alcoholic beverages, and at dinner parties and other social events would encourage those around him to join in, hoping that in a drunken state they would reveal secrets. He enjoyed practical jokes, for instance by putting a tomato on the seat of Politburo members and waiting for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on it, and encouraged singing at social events. As an infant, Stalin had displayed a love of flowers, and later in life he became a keen gardener. His dacha in the Moscow suburb of Volynskoe was surrounded by a 50-acre park, with Stalin devoting much attention to its agricultural activities. Stalin was also an accomplished billiards player.|$|E
25|$|Boro's defense {{remained}} solid when Wigan {{came to the}} Riverside Stadium, {{but continued}} to struggle in attack. A line-up unchanged from the midweek FA Cup draw with West Ham was forced into a change midway through the first half. Summer departure Lee Cattermole's strong-but-fair challenge on Didier Digard forced the midfielder off with injuries to both legs that would likely rule him out {{for the remainder of}} the season. Neither side could muster enough chances for a goal and the game ended 0–0. Middlesbrough's dire run stretched to fourteen games without a win, with only one goal in nine games. A letter from the club's Safety Officer, Sue Watson, was handed out to supporters in block 53A. It was intended to ask supporters to refrain from constantly standing and to stop banging on the plastic sheeting on the back of the stand, but its bad wording caused much anger among fans who interpreted it as asking <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and be quiet. The club was forced to apologise to the fans and clarify the confusion.|$|E
25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E

[...] Before speaking, Pausch received a long standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students.

500|$|Determined {{to improve}} his family's behavior, Homer {{attempts}} to get <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> at the table properly, which goes awry as the family prefers to eat while watching TV. When Marge, Bart and Lisa claim there's nothing wrong with them, he decides to prove to them {{that there is something}} wrong. He takes them {{on a tour of the}} neighborhood, peeking through living room windows to observe how happy families spend time together. The rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior along with unnecessarily spying on their neighbors and retreat quickly back to the safety of their own home. Depressed by the outing, he stops by Moe's Tavern for a drink. After getting into a fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Dr. Monroe guarantees [...] "family bliss or double your money back." [...] This gives Homer an idea {{to improve his}} family's behavior.|$|E

50|$|Sada Jinja in Matsue is {{the home}} to Sada Shin Noh, a sacred dance {{comprising}} a series of purification rituals related to {{the changing of the}} rush mats within the shrine. The mats are held by dancers who then offer <b>them</b> <b>to</b> deities <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> upon. Diverse dance forms are performed on a stage in the shrine accompanied by singing, flute and drums. The performance art is transmitted from generation to generation by the community. In November 2011, Sada Shin Noh was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Other important shrines include Yaegaki Jinja, Kamosu Jinja, and Miho Jinja, and there are the ruins of Izumo Kokubunji, an Historic Site.|$|R

2500|$|The first Parliament of Australia quickly {{moved to}} {{restrict}} immigration to maintain Australia's British character, and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose {{for its first}} Christmas recess. The Colonial Secretary in Britain had however {{made it clear that}} a race-based immigration policy would run [...] "contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire". The Barton Government therefore conceived of the [...] "language dictation test", which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> a test in [...] "any European language". Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow [...] "aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof". There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude [...] "Kanaka" [...] laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was [...] "veiled slavery" [...] {{that could lead to a}} [...] "negro problem" [...] similar to that in the United States, and the Bill was passed.|$|E
2500|$|Bu Zhi and Wei Jing {{settled in}} Kuaiji Commandery (會稽郡), where they {{encountered}} an influential landlord, Jiao Zhengqiang (焦征羌), who allowed his retainers to behave lawlessly. As Bu Zhi and Wei Jing feared that Jiao Zhengqiang would seize {{the plot of}} land on which they farmed, they decided to offer him some of their produce as tribute. When they arrived at his residence, he was asleep {{so they had to}} wait outside. After some time, Wei Jing became impatient and wanted to leave, but Bu Zhi stopped him and said, [...] "We came here because we feared he would seize our land. If we come here to visit him and then leave without even meeting him, he might think that we're insulting him and we'll only end up antagonising him." [...] After a while, Jiao Zhengqiang woke up, saw them through the window, and instructed his servants to lay mats on the ground for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> outside while he remained indoors. Wei Jing was enraged but Bu Zhi remained calm and composed. When it was time for lunch, Jiao Zhengqiang feasted on tasty dishes and did not invite them to join him. Instead, he had scraps of food served to them in small bowls. Wei Jing, who received only vegetables and mushrooms, was so unhappy that he did not eat at all. In contrast, Bu Zhi finished all the food he got. They then bid farewell to Jiao Zhengqiang and left. Wei Jing later scolded Bu Zhi, [...] "How can you put up with this?" [...] Bu Zhi replied, [...] "We're of lowly status. He treated us in a manner befitting our status. What's there to be ashamed of?" ...|$|E
60|$|The old woman's solitary {{way of life}} favoured {{the growth}} of superstitions {{regarding}} her, for the Singletonians were not without their share of that comforting vanity which impresses the provincial mind {{with a sense of}} the high importance of its society, parish, and creed; and they could not imagine anyone preferring to keep away from <b>them</b> and <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> alone, without at once believing, as a necessary consequence, that the unappreciative ones must have dealings with Satan.|$|R
