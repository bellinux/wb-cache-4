5|$|In Ancient Roman times, tigers {{were kept}} in menageries and amphitheatres to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often {{provoked}} to fight humans and exotic beasts. Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> European castles as symbols of their owners' power. Tigers became central zoo and circus exhibits in the 18th century: a tiger could cost up to 4,000 francs in France (for comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year), or up to $3,500 in the United States where a lion cost no more than $1,000.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} {{balance of power}} was also shifting {{in favor of the}} Commonwealth because of the agreement with Russia in fall of 1656, motivated in part by the Tsardom's strategic interest in preventing a collapse of the Polish–Lithuanian state and uncontrolled expansion of Sweden. Not giving up its own claims and gains in the east, Russia moved against the Swedish forces in Livonia, which also facilitated their removal from Lithuania. This new situation forced Charles Gustav to alter his plans of conquering all of Poland and to propose a territorial partitioning scheme, under which the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was to be eliminated altogether and he would be able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> least some of Sweden's prospects.|$|E
25|$|Würzburg C {{featured}} lobe {{switching to}} improve aiming accuracy. The C model was aimed by sending the signal {{out of one}} of two slightly off-centre feed horns {{in the middle of the}} antenna, the signal being switched rapidly between the two horns. Both returns were sent to an oscilloscope display, slightly delaying the signal from one of the horns. The result appeared as two closely separated blips which the operator attempted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> the same height on the display. This system offered much faster feedback on changes in target position, and changes in signal strength due to changes in reflection off the target affected both lobes equally, eliminating common reading errors. An almost identical system was used in the United States' first gun-laying radar, the SCR-268.|$|E

500|$|Herkimer's men {{eventually}} rallied, fighting {{their way}} out of the ravine to the crest just to its west. [...] John Johnson, concerned about the militia's tenacity, returned to the British camp and requested some reinforcements from St. Leger shortly before a thunderstorm broke out. [...] Another seventy men headed back with him toward the battle. [...] The thunderstorm caused a one-hour break in the fighting, during which Herkimer regrouped his militia on the higher ground. [...] He instructed his men to fight in pairs: while one man fired and reloaded, the other waited and then only fired if attacked. Ordered to fire in relays, the pairs were to try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> least one weapon loaded at all times, to reduce the effectiveness of the tomahawk attacks.|$|E
500|$|The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 allotted Italy an {{additional}} [...] of total capital ship tonnage, {{which could be}} used in 1927–1929, while other powers were observing the [...] "holiday" [...] in battleship construction prescribed by the treaty. France, which was given parity with Italy, also possessed 70,000 tons of capital ship tonnage. Both countries were put under significant pressure from the other signatories to use their allotted tonnage to build smaller battleships with reduced caliber main batteries. The first Italian design, prepared in 1928, called for a [...] ship armed with a main battery of six [...] guns in twin turrets. They opted for this design because this allowed three ships under the 70,000-ton limit. This would have allowed the Italian fleet <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> least two units operational at any given time. Protection and radius of action were sacrificed for speed and heavy armament, though the Italians did not value range, as they operated primarily in the confined waters of the Mediterranean.|$|E
500|$|Much of Einarr's {{story in}} the sagas appears {{to be derived from}} the five skaldic verses {{attributed}} to Einarr himself and it is not certain that this account Einarr's conquest is historically accurate. Though the Historia Norvegiæ, written {{at the same time as}} the sagas but from a different source, confirms that Rognvald's family conquered the islands, it gives few details. The scene in the sagas where Einarr's father scorns him is a literary device which often figures in Old Norse literature. After Hallad's failure in [...] Orkney the dialogue between the father and his sons has been interpreted as being about Rognvald's desire to cement his own position as Earl of Møre and an allusion to the early history of Iceland, where the sagas were written. Thorir is [...] a compliant son who Rognvald is happy <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> home. Hrolluag is portrayed as a man of peace who will go to Iceland. [...] Einarr is aggressive and a threat to his father's position so can be spared for the dangers of Orkney. In the Landnámabók version the equally aggressive Hrolfr is also present, and his destiny is anticipated to be in conveniently far-away Normandy.|$|E

500|$|The {{bombardment}} of Iwo Jima continued until the Battle of Iwo Jima on February19, 1945. The island was attacked {{at least once}} each day by the Seventh Air Force's B-24s between December8, 1944, and February15, 1945, and several of these aircraft were shot down. Cruiser Division 5 also conducted naval bombardments on December24 and 27 as well as January5 and 24. In the last of these attacks the heavy cruisers were joined by the battleship [...] US aircraft also mounted small-scale night attacks to disrupt Japanese repair efforts. In addition, the USAAF continued to attack the other Pacific islands within range of the Marianas until July 1945. While the attacks on Iwo Jima damaged the island's airfields, the Japanese managed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> {{least one of them}} operational at all times, and none were closed for more than a single day. The need to repair damage to the airfields forced the Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima to divert labor from building defensive positions, however. The combination of heavy losses over Saipan and damage to the airfields on Iwo Jima caused the Japanese to break off their attacks against the Marianas on 2January. Few Japanese aircraft visited Iwo Jima starting in January, and due to their losses in the Philippines Campaign, the IJAAF and IJN lacked the long-ranged aircraft needed to resume attacks on the Marianas in early 1945.|$|E

In effect, Nilsen was not guilty of [...] "malice aforethought". Upon cross-examination, Allan Green largely focused upon the degree of awareness shown by Nilsen and his ability to make decisions. Dr. Gallwey conceded that Nilsen was intellectually aware of his actions, although he stressed that, due to his personality disorder, Nilsen did not appreciate the nature of his actions.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April 1988 the Afghan and Pakistani governments {{signed the}} Geneva Accords, and the Soviet Union and the United States signed as guarantors; the treaty {{specifically}} {{stated that the}} Soviet military had to withdraw from Afghanistan by 15 February 1989. Gorbachev later confided to Anatoly Chernyaev, a personal advisor to Gorbachev, that the Soviet withdrawal would be criticised for creating a bloodbath {{which could have been}} averted if the Soviets stayed. During a Politburo meeting Eduard Shevardnadze said [...] "We will leave the country in a deplorable situation", and further talked about the economic collapse, and the need <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> least 10 to 15,000 troops in Afghanistan. In this Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, supported him. This stance, if implemented, would be a betrayal of the Geneva Accords just signed. During {{the second phase of the}} Soviet withdrawal, in 1989, Najibullah told Valentin Varennikov openly that he would do everything to slow down the Soviet departure. Varennikov in turn replied that such a move would not help, and would only lead to an international outcry against the war. Najibullah would repeat his position later that year, to a group of senior Soviet representatives in Kabul. This time Najibullah stated that Ahmad Shah Massoud was the main problem, and that he needed to be killed. In this, the Soviets agreed, but repeated that such a move would be a breach of the Geneva Accords; to hunt for Massoud so early on would disrupt the withdrawal, and would mean that the Soviet Union would fail to meet its deadline for withdrawal.|$|E
2500|$|During late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, the band moved {{recording}} and production over to Montreal, Quebec, at the Golden Ratio Studios, where they worked with Canadian music producer Damian Taylor, {{who had previously}} worked with American rock band The Killers on their 2011 album Battle Born, and as a creative companion to Icelandic musician Björk. An initial version of the album with 13 tracks was tracked {{at the end of}} April 2015, however, the creative process continued when additional songs were written and recorded for the album. Numerous delays pushed the recording and production of the album well into 2015, despite an open declaration early in that year, by Mandagi, that the album would be soon completed. By then, the band had collaborated with European producer Pascal Gabriel, co-writer and producer of various Marina and the Diamonds and Goldfrapp tracks, British songwriter and producer Justin Parker, known for his work with American recording artist Lana Del Rey, and American producer Ben H. Allen, who had previously produced albums for art rock acts Animal Collective and Deerhunter. Ultimately, in October 2015, 32 months after the band started production, amassing over 40 song ideas in the process, the album's production entered the audio mixing phase. Mandagi expressed dissatisfaction with the album's lengthy recording process, though insisted that he and the band were, in contrast, satisfied with the outcome and the final product, stating, [...] "sometimes it was ok, sometimes it was a bit trying but you know nothing good comes easy we just had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> it.
