5|$|TypeIa supernovae {{are thought}} to be {{potentially}} the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi (see below). Recent estimates predict that a TypeII supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs (26light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone layer, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> candidates closer than about 500 light years.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> thing as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock {{the door of the}} same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue is the impact of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E

25|$|The axiom {{implies that}} no set {{is an element}} of itself, and that there is no {{infinite}} sequence (an) such that ai+1 {{is an element of}} ai for all i. With the axiom of dependent choice (which is a weakened form of the axiom of choice), this result can be reversed: if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> infinite sequences, then the axiom of regularity is true. Hence, the axiom of regularity is equivalent, given the axiom of dependent choice, to the alternative axiom that there are no downward infinite membership chains.|$|E
25|$|Some men drink alcohol. Sometimes this is {{imported}} Australian or New Zealand beer; {{more often}} it is home-brew, hopi, made with water, sugar or mashed fruit, and yeast.

Drinking is usually done secretively; a group of men gather and drink until they are drunk. Such gatherings sometimes result in drunken quarrels and assaults.|$|E

While the law lays out the fiduciary duties of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties.

25|$|The {{recursion}} is {{initiated by}} setting R and X {{to be the}} empty set and P to be the vertex set of the graph. Within each recursive call, the algorithm considers the vertices in P in turn; if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> vertices, it either reports R as a maximal clique (if X is empty), or backtracks. For each vertex v chosen from P, it makes a recursive call in which v is added to R and in which P and X are restricted to the neighbor set N(v) of v, which finds and reports all clique extensions of R that contain v. Then, it moves v from P to X to exclude it from consideration in future cliques and continues with the next vertex in P.|$|E
