50|$|Car washes {{often use}} these triplex-style plunger pumps (perhaps without {{pulsation}} dampeners). In 1968, William Bruggeman significantly reduced {{the size of}} the <b>triplex</b> <b>pump</b> and increased the lifespan so that car washes could use equipment with smaller footprints. Durable high pressure seals, low pressure seals and oil seals, hardened crankshafts, hardened connecting rods, thick ceramic plungers and heavier duty ball and roller bearings improve reliability in triplex pumps. Triplex pumps now are in a myriad of markets across the world.|$|E
50|$|Mud pumps come in {{a variety}} of sizes and {{configurations}} but for the typical petroleum drilling rig, the triplex (three piston/plunger) mud pump is the pump of choice. Duplex mud pumps (two piston/plungers) have generally been replaced by the <b>triplex</b> <b>pump,</b> but are still common in developing countries. Two later developments are the hex pump with six vertical pistons/plungers, and various quintuplex's with five horizontal piston/plungers. The advantages that these new pumps have over convention triplex pumps is a lower mud noise which assists with better Measurement while drilling (MWD) and Logging while drilling (LWD) decoding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} of water-based reciprocating triplex piston pump {{was conducted to}} propose a low cost solution for the substitution of the traditional oil hydraulics to water hydraulics. Triplex pumps used in this investigation as the water hydraulics require continuous pumping. These pumps are capable of handling {{a wide range of}} fluid types, including corrosive fluids, abrasive fluids, and slurries containing relatively large particulates. Thus, an evaluation of the <b>triplex</b> <b>pump</b> using a simple simulation process that focuses on the volumetric efficiency has been conducted in order to understand its ability in energy-efficient system. In this paper, the results of a simulated study of a positive displacement triplex piston pump are presented. The result concludes that the use of water is relatively efficient if the slip factor is maintained to 0. 003, with the system pressure is set from 10 to 40 bar...|$|E
40|$|Slot-cutting {{tests were}} made in a 3. 5 in. OD steel pipe {{representative}} of the proposed liner of the twin gravel-packed horizontal drainholes used in this Method, for the following purposes: (1) To determine the force required to punch through the liner wall {{in order to achieve}} its full penetration with a cutting wheel, (2) To select the most effective profile for the cutting wheel. The results of these tests, made at UC-Berkeley indicated that, with four cutting wheels, as included in the tool design presented in the Fourth Quarterly Report, the total force required was nearly 60, 000 lb. In view of the limited tool diameter, the creation of such a large force with a single piston required a hydraulic pressure which would exceed the capability of the <b>Triplex</b> <b>pump,</b> most commonly available in the oil fields. A re-design of the 4 -wheel slot-cutting tool with two tandem pistons was done, but revealed a high degree of complexity, related to the difficulty of providing a high-pressure fluid path in the thin housing wall from the hydraulic cylinder above the first pair of arms to a cylinder for the tandem piston located below the first pair of cutter arms and operating the second pair of arms. By reducing the number of cutting wheels from 4 to 3 a single piston driver was sufficient and could result in a tool much simpler to build and to maintain in the Field. The re-designed 3 -wheel slot-cutting tool is presented here. It is currently under construction at UC-Berkeley. A second test program will follow, when this simplified modular tool has been assembled. The objective of this second series of tests is to determine the required characteristics of the opposing spring, or Belleville rings stack which, in the new design, is used for retraction of the cutters, rather than for their extension...|$|E
50|$|<b>Triplex</b> plunger <b>pumps</b> use three plungers, {{which reduces}} the {{pulsation}} of single reciprocating plunger pumps. Adding a pulsation dampener on the pump outlet can further smooth the pump ripple, or ripple graph of a pump transducer. The dynamic {{relationship of the}} high-pressure fluid and plunger generally requires high-quality plunger seals. Plunger pumps with {{a larger number of}} plungers have the benefit of increased flow, or smoother flow without a pulsation dampener. The increase in moving parts and crankshaft load is one drawback.|$|R

The valve seat of the pump, which is made from 42 CrMo 4, was corroded on its exterior surface and plowed on its seal face. Since this failure, the pump could not work in its operating pressure. By evaluation and numerical simulation of the pump, results indicate that the failure occurred because of crevice corrosion and cavitation corrosion on seat surface and seal face, respectively. The reason to cause the corrosion was clarified and corresponding measures were put forward. Hence, the pump works in a normal condition...|$|R

A more detailed pulsation analysis of the cylinder nozzles of the discharge resonators showed that standing wave type resonance with the same frequency as measured during actual operation was present, leading to large pulsation-induced forces. The problem was resolved by implementing recommendations of the study: installation of orifice plates at the inlets of the discharge dampeners. Piping designs and its structural J-hanger supports were reviewed and modified to countermeasure the influence on hydraulic pulsation forces and mechanical vibrations, leading to acceptable cyclic stresses...|$|R

40|$|Through mid-December 1992, {{long-term}} {{flow testing}} of the Phase I 1 Hot Dry Rock (HDR) reservoir at Fenton Hill, NM has been conducted for an aggregate of 24 weeks at near-optimum aseismic injection conditions. This period of flow testing, which began on April 9, 1992, included several reservoir shut-ins due to equipment problems and an intervening lower-injection-rate Interim Flow Test lasting about 6 weeks. With the exceptions noted above, {{the majority of the}} flow testing for that period was conducted at an average injection rate of 7. 2 l/s and at pressures up to 27. 3 MPa. However, this high level of injection pressure has not produced any discernible reservoir microseismicity, indicating that we have been operating the reservoir at pressures below the threshold for fracture extension. The permeation loss from the boundaries of the reservoir at these elevated pressures has averaged about 0. 7 l/s, a very low rate of water loss considering the very large volume of fractured rock (about 16 x 10 6 m&sup 3;) comprising the pressure-stimulated reservoir region. Temperature logging across the 350 -m production interval, centered at a depth of about 3500 m, indicates that there has been no measurable drop in the mixed-mean reservoir production temperature {{at the top of this}} interval since the time of our first temperature log in mid July.

40|$|An {{advanced}} mud {{system was}} designed and key components were built that augment a coiled tubing drilling (CTD) rig that is designed specifically to drill microholes (less than 4 -inch diameter) with advanced drilling techniques. The mud system was tailored to the hydraulics of the hole geometries and rig characteristics required for microholes and is capable of mixing and circulating mud and removing solids while being self contained and having zero discharge capability. Key components of this system are two modified <b>triplex</b> mud <b>pumps</b> (High Pressure Slurry Pumps) for advanced Abrasive Slurry Jetting (ASJ) and a modified Gas-Liquid-Solid (GLS) Separator for well control, flow return and initial processing. The system developed also includes an additional component of an advanced version of ASJ which allows cutting through most all materials encountered in oil and gas wells including steel, cement, and all rock types. It includes new fluids and new ASJ nozzles. The jetting mechanism does not require rotation of the bottom hole assembly or drill string, which is essential for use with Coiled Tubing (CT). It also has low reactive forces acting on the CT and generates cuttings small enough to be easily cleaned from the well bore, which is important in horizontal drilling. These cutting and mud processing components and capabilities compliment the concepts put forth by DOE for microhole coiled tubing drilling (MHTCTD) and should help insure the reality of drilling small diameter holes quickly and inexpensively with a minimal environmental footprint and that is efficient, compact and portable. Other components (site liners, sump and transfer pumps, stacked shakers, filter membranes, etc [...] ) of the overall mud system were identified as readily available in industry {{and will not be}} purchased until we are ready to drill a specific well...|$|R
40|$|The valve {{and seat}} in modern mud pumps {{for oil and}} gas well {{drilling}} are expendable pump parts. New types of valve with a damper chamber without rubber or polyurethane seal and with metal-to-metal contact area and heavy-duty load bearing capacity have been elaborated [1]. Lighter weight body of plate characterizes this design. In comparison with the valve of ordinary construction a valve with a damper chamber contains additional struc-tural elements, which in the moment of setting on of the plate forms the chamber of the pro-moted pressure between a seat and plate. It is considered that application of damper cham-ber will decrease the shock loadings or “hammer-effect ” at the setting of plate. However, for development of reliable working construction it is necessary to resolve next basic problems: – to calculate the optimum size of clearances in damper chamber, – to define speed of landing of plate at the entrance in a damper chamber, – to overcome hydroabrasive wear in the clearances of damper chamber as a result of high speeds of mud flow. It is possible to resolve first two problems by the mathematical model of work of mud pump valve with a damper chamber. For possibility of resolving of mathematical model it is necessary to define the coefficient of discharge in valve by the computer design of fluid flow, as a nonlinear function depending on the height of getting up of plate above a seat. The computer three-dimensional parametric model of valve with a damper chamber has been developed for the valve assembly No. 7 of <b>triplex</b> single action <b>pump.</b> A paramet-ric model gives a possibility to change the height of getting up of plate H and the geometri-cal parameters of seat and plate and clearances in damper chamber.

40|$|Modern {{bottom-hole}} assemblies {{are equipped}} with various sensors which measure the geological and directional information of the borehole while drilling. It is very crucial to get the measured downhole information to the surface in real {{time in order to}} be able to monitor, steer and optimize the drilling process while drilling. The transmission of the information to the surface is most commonly carried out by coded pressure pulses (the technology called mud pulse telemetry) which propagate through the drilling mud inside the drill string towards the surface. However, hardly any specific experimental research on the hydraulic data transmission can be found in the literature. Moreover, it is essential to use a reliable model/simulation tool which can more accurately simulate the pressure pulse propagation in fluids inside drill strings under various drilling operation conditions in order to improve the performance of the data transmission process. The aims of this study are to develop and test a laboratory experimental setup, a simulation model and a novel method for detecting and decoding of measurement while drilling pressure pulse propagation in fluids inside drill strings. This thesis presents a laboratory experimental setup for investigating the process of data transmission in boreholes by mud pulse telemetry. The test facility includes a flow loop, a centrifugal pump, a positive mud pulser or alternatively a mud siren, pressure transducers at four different locations along the flow loop and a data collection system. Moreover, it includes an “actuator system” for the simulation of typical noise patterns created by the common duplex or <b>triplex</b> mud <b>pumps.</b> This laboratory setup with great capabilities opens the way for testing and developing new concepts for data transmission. A theoretical model using ANSYS CFX 11 (Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) commercial code) was successfully developed to simulate dynamic pressure pulse transmission behavior in the fluid inside the flow loop. The collected laboratory data which simulate various data transmission processes in boreholes were used to verify and calibrate the theoretical method. A pretty good agreement is achieved between the predicted and measured pressure pulses at different locations along the flow loop for positive pulses with various durations using different flow rates and for continuous pressure pulses using different carrier frequencies. A novel approach (continuous wavelet transformation) for detecting and decoding the received continuous pressure pulses in a noisy environment was applied to various simulated drilling operation conditions for data transmission in boreholes in the laboratory. The concept was registered at the German Patent and Trade Mark Office (DPMA) for a patent in 2011. The results indicate that the continuous wavelet transformation can be used to clearly identify and better detect the continuous pressure pulse periods, frequencies and discontinuity positions in the time domain compared to the conventional method (Fourier transformation). This method will contribute to the possibility of transmitting the data at higher rates and over longer distances. A concept for developing an innovative pulser using electrical discharge or acoustic sources for inducing pulses keeping the drill strings fully open (eliminating the problem of plugging the pulser by pumped lost circulation materials) and without any mechanical moving parts (eliminating the failure related to the pulser moving parts) was also registered at the German Patent and Trade Mark Office (DPMA) for a patent in 2012. With this pulser, it is expected that it would be possible to transmit the data over longer distances and at higher rates. Realizing the concept of the new pulser and using continuous wavelet transformation for detecting and decoding the pulser signal are recommended for future work...|$|R
40|$|Maurer Technology Inc. (MTI) {{formed a}} joint-industry {{partnership}} {{to fund the}} development of a hollow sphere dual-gradient drilling (DGD) system. Phase I consisted of collecting, compiling, analyzing, and distributing information and data regarding a new DGD system for use by the oil and gas industry. Near the end of Phase I, DOE provided funding to the project that was used to conduct a series of critical follow-on tests investigating sphere separation in weighted waterbase and oilbase muds. Drilling costs in deep water are high because seawater pressure on the ocean floor creates a situation where many strings of casing are required due to the relatively close spacing between fracture and pore pressure curves. Approximately $ 100 million have been spent {{during the past five years}} on DGD systems that place pumps on the seafloor to reduce these drilling problems by reducing the annulus fluid pressure at the bottom of the riser. BP estimates that a DGD system can save $ 9 million per well in the Thunderhorse Field and Conoco estimates it can save $ 5 to $ 15 million per well in its deepwater operations. Unfortunately, previous DGD development projects have been unsuccessful due to the high costs ($ 20 to $ 50 million) and reliability problems with seafloor pump systems. MTI has been developing a simple DGD system concept that would pump hollow glass spheres into the bottom of the riser to reduce density of the mud in the riser. This eliminates the requirement for seafloor pumps and replaces them with low cost mud pumps, shale shakers, and other oilfield equipment that can be operated on the rig by conventional crews. A $ 1. 8 million Phase I joint-industry project funded by five service companies and three operators showed that hollow spheres could be pumped well, but difficulties were encountered in separating the spheres from a polymer mud supplied by Halliburton due to the high viscosity of this mud at the low shear rates encountered on oilfield shale shaker screens. As a result, an excessive amount of this polymer mud flowed across the screen with the beads instead of through the screen. At the completion of the Phase I project, it was concluded that the hollow sphere system would not work effectively with the polymer mud tested. ExxonMobil and Shell engineers proposed that additional sphere separation tests needed to be conducted with weighted oilfield waterbase and oilbase muds to determine if the DGD system would work with these muds. The DOE agreed to provide a $ 200, 000 grant for these tests. The DOE-funded tests, described in this report, showed that the spheres could be pumped with conventional oilfield centrifugal and <b>triplex</b> mud <b>pumps</b> and separated effectively from both oilfield waterbase and oilbase muds using conventional oilfield shale shakers and hydrocyclones. As a result of the success of these DOE tests, this DGD system is ready for full-scale field testing, first on land wells and later in the offshore environment. Maurer Technology Inc. is currently proposing a Phase II project to oil companies to further develop this DGD concept. This project would be funded by four to eight operators. If Phase II tests are successful, Noble plans to commercialize this system with a service company partner that will market and operate the DGD system on Noble's and other drilling contractors' rigs...|$|R
