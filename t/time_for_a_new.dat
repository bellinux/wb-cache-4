5|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was a triple threat match, a match {{involving}} three wrestlers, for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H, and Edge. The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but {{participated in the}} 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Triple H won the tournament. Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. The next night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship, but Edge and Lita (Edge's girlfriend) interrupted Triple H's segment. Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot, that he won at WrestleMania 21, and defeating Cena at the event, after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber, a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. Cena, however, reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble, when he defeated Edge. Edge claimed that it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> opponent for the WWE Championship, after stating that at WrestleMania, Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena. All three men had a series of Handicap matches, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after tucking Cena's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat, a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree, Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU, and Edge executing a shoulder block takedown on Triple H and pinning him. It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash.|$|E
25|$|Who’s the Dupe? and Albina {{encountered}} {{difficulties in}} production. The new manager of Drury Lane, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, shelved The Runaway {{for most of}} the 1777 season. Miffed, Cowley sent Albina to Drury Lane’s rival theatre in London, Covent Garden, but it met with no better reception there, and the script alternated between the theatres for the next two years. Meanwhile, Sheridan agreed to produce Who's the Dupe? but delayed its 1779 première until late spring, an unprofitable <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> play to open.|$|E

While Haile agreed that a sub 2:04 was possible, he stated that the conditions would need to be perfect for such a time. The event was held on 18 January 2008, and was won by Haile in a time of 2:04:53, making it the second fastest marathon in history. However the early pace had been too fast and he was unable to continue at that speed, resulting in a time 27 seconds short of his own world record.|$|E

25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of Conway's Game of Life was helped by its coming into being just in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> generation of inexpensive computer access which were being {{released into the}} market.

For many, Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have {{gone so far as}} to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.|$|E

500|$|Sinnock reused {{the reverse}} for the Franklin half dollar, first struck in 1948, {{the year after}} his death. Mint and other {{publications}} gave credit for both coins' designs only to Sinnock until Don Taxay published his An Illustrated History of U.S. Commemorative Coinage in 1967, disclosing Lewis's involvement. Taxay referred to [...] "the Mint's... final, deliberate misattribution of the artist who designed the half dollar" [...] and wrote, [...] "perhaps after these forty years, it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> credit line". Bowers noted, [...] "Lewis and Sinnock should share the credit." [...] R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins (2015 edition) notes the involvement of both men, and values the half dollar at $90, with the quarter eagle beginning at around $450, though higher-graded coins may sell for more.

500|$|After {{missing the}} entire 1955–56 season, {{he came out}} of {{retirement}} to play half of the 1956–57 season to help the Leafs who were short on players due to injuries and were struggling to make the playoffs. Kennedy returned November 27 to train himself back into shape after the Leafs had won only one game in their last 11. He scored 22 points in 30 games, but the Leafs finished out of the playoffs. He shared the captaincy with Jim Thomson. A highlight of the season was March 16, 1957, when the Maple Leafs scored 14 goals against the New York Rangers and Kennedy got four assists in what is still the Leafs' all-time record for goals in a single game. When it became clear the team was not going to make the playoffs, he sat out the last two games so the management could have a look at a young Frank Mahovlich. Kennedy said, [...] "It was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> generation to lead the team." [...] Mahovlich had practiced with Kennedy the previous day and, in expressing regret at never having played in a game with Kennedy said, [...] "Teeder Kennedy's last practice was my first." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to this renewed German thrust against Bastogne, Eisenhower released two new divisions on 28 December, the 87th Infantry and the 11th Armored. [...] These units joined the 101st Airborne Division in the corps lineup just in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> offensive on 30 December to shrink the bulge created in the allied line. The Americans began their attack at 7:30 that morning, which, coincidentally, was the exact time that the Germans, under General der Panzertruppen (Lieutenant General equivalent) Hasso von Manteuffel scheduled an attack of their own. The 11th Armored Division had difficulty meeting its objectives (for reasons {{not related to the}} strength of the Germans), but the 87th Division fought well in the snow, sleet and deepening cold. [...] On 3 January the new 17th Airborne Division relieved the 11th Armored Division, and the corps stretched along a crude 15-mile line due west of Bastogne, with the 101st continuing to hold the city. For the next two weeks the corps moved steadily north in heavy, sometimes even desperate, fighting, and on 16 January they met units from First Army pushing south at Houffalize. [...] Over the following twelve days the combined force pushed the Germans back eastward across the Our River, returning the Allied line to its original position before the 16 December battle began, eliminating the bulge created in the Allied line on 16 December.|$|E

500|$|A {{new set of}} the {{interior}} of the TARDIS was also designed, which Moffat estimated was three times bigger than the previous set. Moffat did not decide to create the new interior specifically for the new Doctor, but the brief to the set designer was to create a design that would suit Smith's Doctor. Though he loved the old set, Moffat thought it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> one to [...] "surprise people", and believed that the spirit of a new era was to change everything. Piers Wenger said that it took [...] "quite {{a long time to get}} the design right" [...] and they were careful not to make it too futuristic-looking, as [...] "futuristic" [...] meant nothing to the Doctor. The set was designed by Edward Thomas. The previous TARDIS interior was shown at the beginning of [...] "The Eleventh Hour"; the Time Rotor on console had to be rebuilt due to the explosion special effects that were used in The End of Time. In [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the sonic screwdriver is destroyed, and a new version, featuring a green light and metal claws, was created. Smith liked to keep the prop with him at all times [...] "twirling it around and flicking it" [...] which resulted in him breaking four of them. The noise made by the screwdriver was added in post-production using a synthesizer. Moffat described the changes as starting with a [...] "clean slate" [...] which made sense after the previous cast and crew had left.|$|E

[...] Finney tested the canoe {{in a series of}} sailing and paddling experiments in Hawaiian waters. At the same time, ethnographic research in the Caroline Islands in Micronesia brought to light the fact that traditional stellar navigational methods were still very much in everyday use there. The building and testing of proa canoes (wa) inspired by traditional designs, the harnessing of knowledge from skilled Micronesians, as well as voyages using stellar navigation, allowed practical conclusions about the seaworthiness and handling capabilities of traditional Polynesian canoes and allowed {{a better understanding of the}} navigational methods that were likely to have been used by the Polynesians and of how they, as people, were adapted to seafaring.
