25|$|Engraved {{portrayals of}} U.S. presidents {{were the only}} designs found on U.S. postage from 1847 until 1869, with the one {{exception}} of Benjamin Franklin, whose historical stature was {{comparable to that of}} a president, although his appearance was also an acknowledgement of his role as the first U. S. Postmaster General. During this period, the U.S. Post Office issued various postage stamps bearing the depictions of George Washington foremost, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, the last of whom first appeared in 1866, one year after his death. After twenty-two years of issuing stamps with only presidents and Franklin, the Post Office in 1869 issued a series of eleven postage stamps that were generally regarded by the American public as being abruptly different from the previous issues and whose designs were considered at the time to be a break from the tradition of honoring American forefathers on the nation's postage stamps. These new issues had other nonpresidential subjects and a design style that was also different, one issue bearing a horse, another a locomotive, while others were depicted with nonpresidential themes. Washington and Lincoln were to be found only once in this series of eleven stamps, which some considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>below</b> <b>par</b> in design and image quality. As a result, this pictographic series was met with general disdain and proved so unpopular that the issues were consequently sold for only one year where remaining stocks were pulled from post offices across the United States.|$|E

25|$|Born in Colchester, Essex, Napier is a fast-medium bowler, whose stock {{delivery}} reaches between 85mph-90mph. Napier has {{displayed a}} slower ball in Twenty20 games which has proved hard to spot. As a batsman, Napier can {{be among the}} most deadly not only in domestic cricket but in world cricket also. He has twice hit 16 sixes in an innings, once in a Twenty20 match, and once in a County Championship match. His fielding has <b>been</b> known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> slightly <b>below</b> <b>par,</b> but it can <b>be</b> put down <b>to</b> the fact that Napier is very injury prone and he cannot afford to throw himself around.|$|R
5000|$|The {{response}} to the first Liberty Bond was unenthusiastic and although the $2 billion issue reportedly sold out, it probably had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done <b>below</b> <b>par</b> because the notes traded consistently <b>below</b> <b>par</b> on the street. One reaction <b>to</b> this <b>was</b> <b>to</b> attack bond traders as [...] "unpatriotic" [...] if they sold <b>below</b> <b>par.</b> The Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange conducted an investigation of brokerage firms who sold <b>below</b> <b>par</b> to determine if [...] "pro-German influences" [...] were at work. The board forced one such broker to buy the bonds back at par and make a $100,000 donation to the Red Cross. Various explanations were offered for {{the weakness of the}} bonds ranging from German sabotage to the rich not buying the bonds because it would give an appearance of tax dodging (the bonds were exempt from some taxes).|$|R
40|$|Text in EnglishLegislation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the provision of public and national library services. However, in Zambia libraries that perform the functions of public and national libraries are operating without a legislative mandate. As a result, there is a fragmentation of library services as there is no single institution which performs all the functions of a national library service. Although several efforts were made before to enact national library service legislation, no Act of Parliament has been passed to date (2014). This study sought to provide empirical evidence to refine our insight of the benefits of having national library service legislation and the consequent implications of not having any legislation in the provision of library services. Quantitative data was collected through questionnaire administration to public library staff; interviews with senior government officials, and executive members of the ZLA and ZALICO; and document analysis on text from grey literature. The existence of the statistical significance of association between “Importance of library legislation” and “Provision of library services in Zambia” was measured and confirmed using Pearson chi-square χ 2. Public library facilities, services and collections in Zambia were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>below</b> <b>par,</b> and it was concluded that this was due to lack of library legislation. The study recommends that appropriate legislation that puts together the functions of public and national libraries under one institution be enacted in Zambia as soon as possible. It is also recommended that further research be undertaken to investigate the current status of library facilities, services and collections in selected neighbouring countries where library legislation has been passed.

50|$|The United States had no {{national}} paper money until 1862 (greenbacks used {{to fund the}} Civil War), but these notes <b>were</b> discounted <b>to</b> gold until 1877. There was also a shortage of U.S. minted coins. Foreign coins, such as Mexican silver, were commonly used. At times banknotes were as much as 80% of currency in circulation before the Civil War. In the financial crises of 1818-19 and 1837-41, many banks failed, leaving their money <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redeemed <b>below</b> <b>par</b> value from reserves. Sometimes the notes became worthless, and the notes of weak surviving banks were heavily discounted. The Jackson administration opened branch mints, which over time increased the supply of coins. Following the 1848 finding of gold in the Sierra Nevada, enough gold came to market to devalue gold relative to silver. To equalize {{the value of the}} two metals in coinage, the US mint slightly reduced the silver content of new coinage in 1853.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} it being the second city of Northern Ireland (and it being the second-largest city in all of Ulster), road and rail links <b>to</b> other cities <b>are</b> <b>below</b> <b>par</b> for its standing. Many {{business}} leaders claim that government investment {{in the city and}} infrastructure has been badly lacking. Some have stated that this <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> its outlying border location whilst others have cited a sectarian bias against the region west of the River Bann due to its high proportion of Catholics. There is no direct motorway link with Dublin or Belfast. The rail link <b>to</b> Belfast has <b>been</b> downgraded over the years so that, presently, it is not a viable alternative to the roads for industry to rely on. There are currently plans for £1 billion worth of transport infrastructure investment in and around the district. Planned upgrades to the A5 Dublin road agreed as part of the Good Friday Agreement and St. Andrews Talks fell through when the government of the Republic of Ireland reneged on its funding citing the recent economic crisis.|$|R

50|$|A {{review by}} IGN staff {{concluded}} that the game's depth, potential and lasting appeal were its strong points but poor design decisions detracted from its playability.

50|$|Nevertheless, {{among the}} {{inconsistencies}} is, first and foremost, why would an experienced captain such as FitzStephen allow his crew to get drunk, especially when ferrying such an august group of nobles.
