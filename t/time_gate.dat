5|$|Returning to the Temple of Hylia, Link is {{followed}} by Groose and the two {{end up on the}} Surface together. Link then has to defeat the Imprisoned, a monstrous form of Demise attempting to reach the Sealed Temple, after the old woman shows him a second dormant <b>Time</b> <b>Gate.</b> With the Imprisoned defeated, Link sets out to strengthen the Goddess Sword by passing trials set by the ancient Goddesses and using their gifts to find Sacred Flames to purify and strengthen the blade so the <b>Time</b> <b>Gate</b> can be awakened. Returning to find the Imprisoned attempting to break free, Link reseals it with help from Groose. Activating the <b>Time</b> <b>Gate</b> and traveling to the past, he finds Zelda and learns that she is the mortal reincarnation of Hylia: Hylia could not kill Demise and was too weakened from their battle to fend him off again, so she created the Goddess Sword and reincarnated as a mortal to find someone who would fulfill her duty by using the Triforce to wish Demise's destruction, as only mortals can use the artifact. Zelda then seals herself inside a crystal to strengthen the seal on Demise, after granting her power to the Goddess Sword, evolving it into the true Master Sword.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a <b>Time</b> <b>Gate</b> on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the <b>time</b> <b>gate,</b> and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E
5|$|Their party expands {{to include}} Ayla and Frog after they visit the prehistoric era to repair Frog's sword. They return to AD 600 to {{challenge}} Magus, believing {{him to be}} the source of Lavos; after the battle, a summoning spell causes a <b>time</b> <b>gate</b> that throws Crono and his friends to the past. In prehistory, the group battle the Reptites and witness the origin of Lavos. They learn that Lavos was an alien being that arrived on the planet millions of years in the past, and began to absorb DNA and energy from every living creature before arising and razing the planet's surface in 1999 so that it could spawn a new generation. In 12,000 BC, Crono and friends find that the Kingdom of Zeal recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. However Zeal's leader, Queen Zeal imprisons Crono and friends. Though Zeal's daughter Schala frees them, the Prophet, a mysterious figure who has recently begun advising the queen, forces her to banish them from the realm and seal the <b>time</b> <b>gate</b> they used to travel to the Dark Ages. They return next to AD 2300 to find a time machine called the Wings of Time (or Epoch), which can access any time period without using a <b>time</b> <b>gate.</b> They travel back to Zeal for the Mammon Machine's activation at the Ocean Palace. Lavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine, and the Prophet reveals himself to be Magus and tries to kill the creature. Crono stands up to Lavos but is vaporized by a powerful blast, after which Lavos destroys the Kingdom of Zeal.|$|E

Crono's mother accidentally enters the <b>time</b> <b>gate</b> at the fair before it closes, {{prompting}} Crono, Marle, and Lucca to {{set out in the}} Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky. Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.|$|E

At {{some point during the}} events of XIII-2, Sazh is sucked through a rip in time, is {{separated}} from Dajh and ends up in Serendipity, a palace in the Void Beyond. While there, he meets Chocolina and learns of the fate facing the world from Serendipity's owner. Reuniting with Dajh and deciding to fight no matter what the future holds, they go through a <b>time</b> <b>gate</b> and help Serah and Noel in their battle against Caius. Sazh then helps Hope save Fang and Vanille from the crystal pillar before Cocoon falls. In Lightning Returns, Sazh has set up his home in the Wildlands. After Dajh's soul is lost and his body falls into a coma, Sazh becomes tormented by his seeming failure to protect his son.

5|$|In the present, knight-in-training Link passes {{his final}} exam despite the {{attempted}} interference {{of his class}} rival Groose, who considers himself a romantic rival for Link's childhood friend Zelda. After passing the exam and on a celebratory flight together, Zelda is whisked away below the clouds by a dark tornado. After recovering back on Skyloft, Link is led to the island's statue of Hylia by Fi, {{the spirit of the}} Goddess Sword residing within the statue. Link draws the sword, showing himself to be the prophesied hero who will finally destroy Demise. Opening a way to the Surface, Link is guided by Fi to the Sealed Temple, where he meets an old woman who tells him to track Zelda: this leads Link across the regions of Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano, and the Lanayru Desert. While he catches up with Zelda, he is prevented from returning her to Skyloft by Impa, a young woman guarding and guiding Zelda. Link is also confronted by Ghirahim, a self-proclaimed Demon Lord working towards freeing Demise. At the Temple of Time in the Lanayru Desert, Link defends Zelda and Impa from Ghirahim, giving the two time to depart through a <b>Time</b> <b>Gate</b> into the past which Impa destroys as they pass through.|$|E
40|$|How to {{simulate}} the decay pattern is crucial during lifetime inversion while utilizing intensity images acquired at increasing delays in <b>time</b> <b>gated</b> fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy(FLIM) method. A relatively novel understanding of fluorescence decay pattern theory and stimulation algorithms of <b>time</b> <b>gated</b> FLIM method have been analyzed in this paper comprehensively. Main lifetime computing algorithms can be classified as exponential pattern retrieve and polynomial fitting procedure. Especially, a novel lifetime computing method based on bi-exponential decay has been discussed. In experiment, we have validated the proposed algorithms utilizing synthetic images.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of new technology, the {{manufacture}} of high-frequency antennas and RFIC's has become feasible. This has led to smaller and smaller antennas in the mm-wave frequency range. The traditional techniques used for antenna characterization may be problematic for small probe-fed antennas. To counter these problems, radiation pattern retrieval (RPR) method has been developed. RPR {{is dependent on the}} reflection coefficients obtained from placing a reflective load in the near-field of the antenna. RPR method is implemented using inversion algorithm. Multiple reflections can cause errors in RPR as it considers only the first reflection from reflective load. To address this issue, <b>time</b> <b>gating</b> method is investigated. The purpose of this thesis is to study radiation pattern retrieval for on-wafer antennas, especially to improve RPR method using multiple reflection mitigation, implemented using <b>time</b> <b>gating.</b> To experimentally test this hypothesis, a 4 x 4 patch array is designed for 77 GHz. A reflective copper strip is placed at 90 mm or 120 mm distance from the antenna. The width of the strip is 30 mm and 60 mm and it is moved in 1. 95 mm steps from - 39 mm to + 39 mm offset positions. A VNA measures the $S_{ 11 }$ at each position which is Fourier transformed into its time domain signal, <b>time</b> <b>gated</b> and then transformed back to the frequency domain. The new $S_{ 11 }$ is used to observe the effects on the radiation pattern. The copper strip configurations with different widths and distance help test the repeatibility of the experiment. <b>Time</b> <b>gating</b> is estimated to remove unwanted reflections, however, inconclusive results suggest the need for exhaustive study of the inversion algorithm and RPR model. More qualitative study of multiple reflection reduction techniques would give a deeper insight in their effect on radiation pattern retrieval...|$|R
5|$|Link {{locates the}} Triforce on Skyloft and {{uses it to}} destroy Demise. With Demise dead, Zelda is freed, but Ghirahim arrives and kidnaps Zelda: though Demise is dead in the present, Ghirahim intends to use Zelda as a {{sacrifice}} to resurrect him in the past. Link pursues Ghirahim into the past and fights through his army. He then defeats Ghirahim, who {{turns out to be}} the spirit of Demise's sword, but is unable to prevent Zelda's soul from being used to reincarnate Demise's humanoid form. Groose guards Zelda's body while Link challenges Demise to single combat: Link triumphs, absorbing Demise's essence into the sword, but not before Demise curses Link and Zelda's descendants to be haunted by his reincarnated rage. To complete the sword's seal, Link drives it into a pedestal in the Sealed Temple, with Fi accepting eternal slumber as a result. Groose, Link and the revived Zelda return to their time while Impa remains behind and destroys the <b>Time</b> <b>Gate,</b> as she is a person of that time period and must watch over the Master Sword. In the present, the old woman greets them one last time before she dies and vanishes, revealing that she was Impa. The game ends with Zelda deciding to remain on the Surface to watch over the Triforce: she and Link together establish the kingdom of Hyrule.|$|E

However, as the fight rages, Botan notes that the gate that links them to the past is starting to close despite the battle. Before Saiki can act, he is ambushed by Ash Crimson, who steals his power. It is revealed then that, while Ash was enlisted by Saiki to obtain the Three Sacred Treasures to power the <b>time</b> <b>gate,</b> Ash {{had no intention of}} helping Saiki. Ash is suddenly overtaken by Saiki's persona, who then attempts to cross the <b>time</b> <b>gate</b> in Ash's body. The winning team pursues him into the <b>time</b> <b>gate</b> and the final battle of The King of Fighters XIII begins inside the <b>time</b> <b>gate.</b> Saiki is defeated in the gate but persists on crossing over to the past, believing it means nothing since he can return to the past and then cross the gate again to attempt his plan anew. However, Ash halts his attempt and allows the gate to close, leaving Saiki trapped in the present. Furthermore, Ash reveals that he is a descendant of Saiki. By locking Saiki out of the gate, he denies Saiki's existence in the past and forces his own existence to cease. As Ash vanishes from the living world, the flow of time resumes. In the epilogue of the Story Mode, in the dimensional rift, a spear appeared in front of Shroom and Rimelo, two members of Those From The Past who faced Kyo in the opening of the game (Console version).
