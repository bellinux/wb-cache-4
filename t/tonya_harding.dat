50|$|<b>Tonya</b> Maxene <b>Harding</b> (born November 12, 1970) is {{a former}} American figure skater. She was a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion. In 1991, she won the U.S. Figure Skating Championships and placed second in the World Championships. Harding was the second woman (and the first American woman) to {{complete}} a triple axel jump in competition. In 1994, she was banned for life from the U.S. Figure Skating Association after pleading guilty to hindering the prosecution following the attack on fellow skater Nancy Kerrigan.|$|R
5000|$|In her 2008 autobiography, The <b>Tonya</b> Tapes, <b>Harding</b> {{states that}} she wanted to call the FBI to reveal what she knew, but refused when Gillooly {{allegedly}} threatened her with death following a gunpoint gang rape by him and two other men she did not know. He subsequently changed his name to Jeff Stone and called the allegations [...] "utterly ridiculous." [...] Eckhardt, who legally changed his name to Brian Sean Griffith following his release from jail, died of natural causes at age 40 on December 12, 2007.|$|R
25|$|Brown {{followed}} with another satire, Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women, which lampooned {{the violence of}} ice skater <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> toward rival Nancy Kerrigan, {{as well as that}} of widely publicized castrator Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{episode of}} Mystery Science Theater 3000 {{featured}} the movie Soultaker. The star/writer of the movie, Vivian Schilling, {{was the target}} of numerous <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> references in the MST3k episode due to their physical resemblance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> {{was born}} on November 12, 1970 in Portland, Oregon to Alan and LaVona Harding (née Golden). Harding was raised in Portland, and began skating at age three. As a youth, Harding also hunted, drag raced, and learned car {{mechanics}} from her father. Her mother, who struggled to help support the family {{while working as a}} waitress, hand-sewed Harding's skating costumes for competitions.|$|E
25|$|Lipinski's {{decision}} to turn pro {{coincided with a}} change in the business climate for the skating industry. After the 1998 Olympics, many of the professional skating competitions that had sprung up {{in the aftermath of the}} 1994 <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> spectacle were converted to a pro-am format or discontinued entirely as audiences lost interest. Lipinski did not want to compete in the new pro-am events, and not long after she turned professional, she broke an existing $1.2 million contract to appear in made-for-TV events sponsored by the USFSA. Instead, she skated only in the remaining all-pro competitions, which were primarily team events such as Ice Wars. Her most notable individual victory came at the 1999 World Professional Figure Skating Championships; at age 17, she became the youngest person to win that event.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Kwan {{finished}} second to <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> at the U.S. Championships, which ordinarily would have placed {{her on the}} U.S. team to the 1994 Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. That place was instead given to 1993 national champion Nancy Kerrigan, who had been sidelined by an assault and battery (eventually connected to Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly) after a practice session at those championships. The 13-year-old Kwan went to Norway as an alternate but did not compete. Kerrigan and Harding both dropped out of eligible competition before the 1994 World Championships. Because of this (and teammate Nicole Bobek not making out of the qualifying round), Kwan had the sole responsibility to ensure two entries for the U.S. at the 1994 World Championships by placing in the top ten. Kwan had an unusual mistake in the short program and placed eleventh in {{that portion of the}} competition, but skated a strong freestyle program and finished eighth overall.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{more than}} 24 {{million people in}} Great Britain watched ice dancing pair Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean earn {{unanimous}} 6.0s for presentation, the only perfect score in Olympic skating history, which was ranked the 8th greatest sporting moment in a UK poll. In the 1993 National Sports Study II, considered by the Associated Press as the largest study of spectator sport popularity in America, ladies' figure skating was the second most popular spectator sport in America, just behind NFL football out of over 100 sports surveyed. The 1993 study found that three figure skaters — Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming, and Scott Hamilton — were among the eight most popular athletes in the United States, out of over 800 athletes surveyed. Dorothy Hamill was statistically tied with Mary Lou Retton as the most popular athlete in America. The <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> scandal in 1994 increased interest in figure skating. The {{first night of the}} ladies' figure skating competition in the 1994 Winter Olympics achieved higher TV Nielsen ratings than that year's Super Bowl and was the most watched sports television program of all-time, to that date.|$|E
500|$|... "Headline News" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Lou Carlozo of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that the}} song [...] "provided savage laughs {{at the expense of}} <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> and John Bobbitt." [...] Roch Parisien of Allmusic cited the song as one of the three stand-outs from Yankovic's second greatest hits volume, and called it a [...] "rib-tickler". Tina Maps of The Milwaukee Journal wrote a positive review and felt that the musical parody was a [...] "dead-on skewering of the Crash Test Dummies' 'Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm". Not all reviews, however, were so positive; an article that appeared in The Commercial Appeal noted that while the video for [...] "Headline News" [...] had some [...] "cute bits and unusual cameos", it was [...] "not as clever as many of Yankovic's past efforts" [...] and that [...] "the current events included here are already dated".|$|E

Humans escaping an unsavable Earth in rockets is {{a reference to}} the 1951 film When Worlds Collide. In a scene in the segment, several celebrities, including actor Mel Gibson and former Major League Baseball player Mark McGwire, can be seen waiting in line for the first rocket. They both guest starred as themselves in two earlier episodes from the season. Others in the line include businessman Bill Gates, director Ron Howard, former President Jimmy Carter, scientist Stephen Hawking, rock musician Paul McCartney, basketball player Michael Jordan and ice skater Michelle Kwan. Those on the doomed ship include actors Pauly Shore and Tom Arnold, politicians Ross Perot and Dan Quayle, singer Courtney Love, TV presenters Rosie O'Donnell and Laura Schlessinger, film director Spike Lee, reverend Al Sharpton and figure skater <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1986 the IOC {{had voted}} to {{separate}} the Summer and Winter Games {{and place them in}} alternating even-numbered years. This change became effective for the 1994 Games, held in Lillehammer, Norway, which became the first Winter Olympics to be held separately from the Summer Games. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia made their Olympic debuts. The women's figure skating competition drew media attention when American skater Nancy Kerrigan was injured on 6 January 1994, in an assault planned by the ex-husband of opponent <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding.</b> Both skaters competed in the Games, but the gold medal was won by Oksana Baiul. She became Ukraine's first Olympic champion. [...] Johann Olav Koss of Norway won three gold medals, coming first in all of the distance speed skating events. Russia won the most gold medals with 11 overall, closely followed by Norway with 10. Juan Antonio Samaranch described Lillehammer as the best Olympic Winter Games ever in his closing ceremony speech.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Kerrigan {{was created by}} Blizzard Entertainment's Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with her physical appearance designed by Metzen. Kerrigan was not originally {{intended to be a}} major character, and was only meant to appear on a single level. Initially based around the character Tanya Adams in the , Kerrigan was named after Nancy Kerrigan, who at the time was involved in a feud with <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding.</b> However, Kerrigan's character grew on the developers, who decided to give a far greater role to the throw-away character. Kerrigan's self-proclaimed title is the [...] "Queen of Blades", which is gradually introduced to other characters {{to the point where it}} is synonymous with her. Chris Metzen has explained that it was meant to be an honorific title; a blade is a weapon designed to rip enemies to pieces, making the title fitting for Kerrigan, who evolved to be the greatest agent of the Zerg Overmind.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Michael Buffer, the American boxing promoter Don King is featured prominently in [...] "Damien" [...] as Satan's promoter. Parker {{said he and}} Stone decided to spoof King only because [...] "it's just sort of who annoyed us that week. It's so random ... {{there is no point}} to who we're ripping on. It's definitely nothing personal." [...] Nancy Kerrigan, the Olympic figure skater attacked on orders of fellow skater <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> at the 1994 Winter Olympics, is referred to in a pep talk Stan gives Jesus. Stan wrongfully claims Kerrigan won the gold medal until Kyle reminds him she won the silver; Parker said this was done because he felt the perception of Kerrigan was extremely high among Americans considering she only actually achieved second place. During that same pep talk, Stan tells Jesus, [...] "You know, someone once said, 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man.'" [...] Although Stan says this was a quote from Jesus himself, it was actually a line from the 1996 film, [...] [...] "Damien" [...] also includes a reference to singer Nancy Sinatra, the daughter of legendary crooner Frank Sinatra. Mr. Garrison, while discussing great singers of the baroque period, {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass".|$|E
500|$|On December 31, 1999, Dick Clark {{is celebrating}} New Year's Rockin' Eve in Springfield. Homer, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's Y2K {{compliance}} officer, declares that he fixed {{all the possible}} Y2K problems at the plant, including the computers. Unfortunately, Homer forgot to fix his own computer, {{and in the process}} sends a virus across the world. Chaos ensues, and widespread looting begins. Krusty's malfunctioning pacemaker apparently kills him in front of the family. Bart tearfully mourns his hero, but he perks up, after finding a note. The letter in Krusty's pocket states that a rocket (codenamed Exodus) is being populated with humanity's [...] "best and brightest", and will be launched in order to preserve human civilization on Mars. When they reach the shuttle, Homer fails to bluff his way on board by claiming to be the famous pianist from the film Shine but the armed guard recognizes Lisa as the ship's designated proofreader. Lisa is only able to take one parent with her, and quickly chooses Marge. Homer and Bart find a second, unguarded rocket and board just before it launches. They quickly notice that the spaceliner is filled with such notoriously obnoxious and mediocre celebrities as radio psychologist Dr. Laura, film director Spike Lee, skating champion <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding,</b> former vice president Dan Quayle, grunge rock singer Courtney Love, politician Ross Perot, civil rights activist Al Sharpton, actor Tom Arnold, MTV VJ Pauly Shore, and actress/talk show host Rosie O'Donnell. Although the craft is headed directly for the sun, Homer and Bart eject themselves from the spacecraft and die of explosive decompression, to their relief.|$|E

Stanhope later claimed on his podcast that the fight was fixed because <b>Tonya</b> <b>Harding</b> refused to [...] "fight a man".|$|E
