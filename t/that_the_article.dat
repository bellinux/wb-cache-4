5|$|On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website {{by stating}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> was sensationalist and misleading. Jellinek said that, of the 44 units the chain had, five were sold on eBay for $399.99, {{with a couple}} of units still in stock, and 35 were held for {{specific}} customers and sold at the MSRP. The remainder were given away. Some sites believe this may violate Nintendo's enforcement of the Wii's $249 retail price, and may prevent the store from receiving future products from Nintendo. Nintendo has refused to comment on the issue.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia {{report also}} found a failure in journalistic {{standards}} by either not making contact with the people they were publishing derogatory information about, or when they did, by not providing enough context {{for people to be}} able to offer a meaningful response. The report also states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E

25|$|In February 2015, Al Jazeera posted {{an article}} to its online edition, {{alleging that the}} Israeli {{government}} had opened dams in its southern region in order to intentionally flood parts of the Gaza Strip.

25|$|Falwell filed a $10 million {{lawsuit against}} Penthouse for {{publishing}} an article based upon interviews {{he gave to}} freelance reporters, after failing to convince a federal court to place an injunction upon the publication of that article.

25|$|On April 19, {{the editors}} of the World Economic Herald, a {{magazine}} close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by Yan Jiaqi, which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, Jiang Zemin demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page. Jiang then suspended Qin Benli. His decisive action earned accolades from party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.|$|E

"But {{there are}} not wanting other grounds for <b>the</b> {{suspicion}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> {{were placed in the}} thicket with the view of diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage. And, first, let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>articles.</b> Collate this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers. You will find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications sent to the evening paper. These communications, although various and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same point--viz., the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators of the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule as its scene. Now here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> were not before found by the boys, for <b>the</b> reason <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the date of the communications by the guilty authors of these communications themselves.|$|R
25|$|In 1995, a {{local court}} in Sibiu asked the Constitutional Court of Romania whether {{the article is}} constitutional. In order to {{formulate}} its answer, the Constitutional Court decided to ask the religious denominations, academy, parliament and civil society groups {{to discuss the issue}} of homosexuality. All the churches which answered to the request condemned homosexuality, the Senate rejected the charges <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> is contrary to the constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the academy announced that it will take time to analyse the issue, while the civil society asked for the ban to be removed.|$|E
25|$|In a 2008 media article, Starbucks' vice {{president}} of corporate social responsibility acknowledged that the company continued to struggle with environmental responsibility, as none of its cups were recyclable and stores did not have recycling bins. At the time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> was published, Starbucks gave customers who brought in their own reusable cup a 10-cent discount, in addition to using corrugated cup sleeves made from 85 percent post-consumer recycled fiber, which is 34 percent less paper than the original. During the same period, Starbucks entered into a partnership with Conservation International—pledging US$7.5 million over three years—to help protect the natural environment of coffee-growing communities in Mexico and Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|Article 370 allows its {{own death}} by {{permitting}} plebiscite. Article 370 was drafted while negotiations with Pakistan were still on. When Pakistan objected to Article 370 at the UN Commission Girija Shankar Bajpai, who was {{secretary general of}} Ministry of External Affairs, wrote to UNCIP in 1949 that Article 370 did not preclude plebiscite. Krishna Menon said to the UN Security Council in 1957 that if people of Kashmir voted to not stay with India then India’s duty at that time would be to adopt those constitutional procedures which would enable separation of Kashmir from India. That procedure is contained in clause 3 of Article 370, a presidential order to declare <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Article</b> 370 will cease to be operative.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Liberal Party submitted, on 12 December, to the Constitutional Court, two notices {{about the}} changes adopted Tuesday by the Chamber of Deputies to the Penal Code, one aimed at {{defining}} civil servant {{and the other one}} referring to the conflict of interest. Likewise, the High Court of Cassation and Justice notified the Constitutional Court on the same subject. The concerns expressed by about 50 PDL lawmakers were confirmed by the Constitutional Court of Romania. So, on 15 January 2014, the members of the Constitutional Court unanimously decided that the amendments to the Penal Code are unconstitutional. CCR judges decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> which removes the officials from the category of public servants breaches several articles of the Constitution concerning the rule of law, the equal rights of citizens and the Romanian State's obligation to fulfill in good faith its obligations in international treaties.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a Vril-Society was alleged in 1960 by Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels. In their book The Morning of the Magicians, they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi Berlin that {{was a sort of}} inner circle of the Thule Society. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.|$|E
25|$|The {{redevelopment}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} business environment and a better image of the downtown by residents throughout the county with 80% of county residents reporting they visit Downtown and 82% saying they have an improved view of Downtown according to a Siena Research Institute survey commissioned by Metroplex in 2008. On January 8, 2007 however, US News & World Report published an article in which the author discussed the city's industrial past, as home to General Electric and the American Locomotive Company, and then the city’s steady loss of thousands of GE jobs and the closure of the locomotive plant in the late 1960s as emblematic of Upstate New York's urban decline. Schenectady Mayor Brian Stratton responded in a letter to US News that was published in January 29-February 6 edition citing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> failed to note the $150 million invested in downtown over the previous three years, including the new movie theater, hotel, restaurants, offices, and Proctor's expansion. Redevelopment of Downtown Schenectady continues, especially along State Street near Proctor's Theatre, with the Metroplex Development Authority's purchase of the Foster Building at 508 State Street along with the neighboring parcels of 510 and 512 State Street and 204 Lafayette Street. The Foster Building is a former hotel on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
