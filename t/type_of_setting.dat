25|$|Obtaining precise {{number is}} {{difficult}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. One of the major reasons for the difference in statistical findings regarding homosexuality and bisexuality {{has to do with the}} nature of the research questions. Major research studies on sexual orientation are discussed. Most of the studies listed below rely on self-report data, which poses challenges to researchers inquiring into sensitive subject matter. More importantly, the studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex sexual experiences and attractions while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as homosexual or bisexual. Fewer research subjects identify as homosexual or bisexual than report having had sexual experiences or attraction to a person of the same sex. Several studies of sexual orientation in countries provide comparative perspectives. Tables comparing several U.S. cities' population numbers are also included. However, since many individuals may fail to report outside the heterosexual norm or define their sexuality in their own unique terms, it is difficult to fully grasp the size of the LGBT population. The type of survey being used and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> a subject is in while being surveyed may also affect the answer that the subject gives.|$|E

Caius was referring to a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> spaniel, most likely now extinct. The description of the work undertaken by this early pillar of the breed resembles the working behaviour of modern Irish Setters. Of this early dog, Caius went on to write: [...] "The most part of theyre skinnes are white, {{and if they are}} marcked with any spottes, they are commonly red, and somewhat great therewithall." [...] If this is the case, it is safe to assume the solid red colouring of today's Irish Setter came about by selective breeding practices.|$|E

The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets,</b> called essential <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> implicates, is proved to possess an orthogonality property, which implies that every CNF representation and every essential set must intersect. The latter property then leads to an interesting question, to which we give an affirmative answer for some special subclasses of Horn Boolean functions...|$|R

50|$|Date rape has a {{particular}} dynamic: the sexual assault happens on a date <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting.</b> Therefore, date rapes trials are considered inconclusive by nature and are charged with social concerns (e.g. gender roles, sexuality, body-shape). The criminal justice system urges the victim to describe the sexual assault in detail {{in order to be}} able to make a decision in court, ignoring the possibility that the trial can create a hostile environment and be a disturbing moment for the victim. Jurors’ personal beliefs and rape myth acceptance can be influential in their decision when it comes to evaluating the scenery, evidence, and making a sentence.|$|E
50|$|Burnish setting, also {{sometimes}} referred to as flush setting, shot setting, or gypsy setting (The term gypsy setting is used less often today because the word gypsy is seen as derogatory) is similar to bead setting, but after the stone is inserted into the space, instead of using a graver to lift beads, a burnishing tool is used to push the metal all around the stone. The stone will be roughly flush with the surface, with a burnished or rubbed edge around it. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> has a long history but is gaining a resurgence in contemporary jewelry. Sometimes the metal is finished using sandblasting, as it shows off the work very well.|$|E

50|$|In rare circumstances, such as {{extensive}} cutaneous injury, self-renewal subpopulations in {{the bone}} marrow are induced {{to participate in the}} healing process, whereby they give rise to collagen-secreting cells that seem to play a role during wound repair. These two self-renewal subpopulations are (1) bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and (2) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Bone marrow also harbors a progenitor subpopulation (endothelial progenitor cells or EPC) that, in the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting,</b> are mobilized to aid in the reconstruction of blood vessels. Moreover, it thought that, extensive injury to skin also promotes the early trafficking of a unique subclass of leukocytes (circulating fibrocytes) to the injured region, where they perform various functions related to wound healing.|$|E
50|$|Deindividuation {{refers to}} a {{decrease}} in self-awareness and self-evaluation {{as a result of}} being part of a group. Individuals who experience deindividuation seem to be influenced to a greater degree by identity cues. In a 1979 study by Robert D. Johnson and Leslie L. Downing, participants were instructed to give an electric shock to research assistants while wearing either a KKK disguise or a nurse's uniform. The results showed that the costumes worn by participants affected the shock level that they administered to the research assistants. Johnson and Downing stated that these findings supported the argument that deindividuation increases the influence that identity cues have on individuals. In virtual environments, deindividuation is believed to be driven by the level of anonymity that this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> provides for its users.|$|E
50|$|Translanguaging {{promotes}} {{a deeper understanding}} of subject matter, by discussing in one language and writing in another. Students will always reference what they already know from their first language when working with a second language. This helps students process the information and improve communication in their second language. When introduced in a Welsh bilingual classroom, translanguaging meant that the input and output languages were often switched. In this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting,</b> students are typically asked to read a text one language and discuss it either orally or in written form in their second language. In the case of the Welsh classroom, the languages used were Welsh and English. This led to an increase of Welsh speakers in primary schools in 2007, with 36.5% of the students being able to speak Welsh, compared to 1987 when only 24.6% of students spoke Welsh.|$|E
