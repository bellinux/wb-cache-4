[...] For PopMatters, Chris Conaton describes the album as sounding [...] "pretty much exactly like what you’d expect a Primus album to sound like... Green Naugahyde is a perfectly serviceable Primus record", noting that the album [...] "relies a little too much on the bands past material for inspiration, but with Lane on the drums, the songs have a lot of drive to them and Claypool and LaLonde are clearly having fun."Bill Murphy, for Relix, notes that [...] "for the first third of the album, LaLonde and Lane just seem to be warming up", but that the overall album is [...] "as accessible as it is willfully in-your-face, this is vintage Primus." ...|$|E

By developing and manufacturing concentrated solarcollectors with a complete runningcentral for producing steam intended for industrial purpose are they pushing the technology and industry forward. They have so far manufactured small volumes of pilot plants but will now have the ability to manufacture larger volumes. To accomplish that they will {{have to be able to}} speed up the manufacturing process regarding some of the processes in the manufacturing line. As a part of the first station in the line will they need a method to semi automatically bend the two longest edges of the collector. It is this method this thesis is all about. A functional prototyp is also a part of the desired result. Roll forming became the method of choice. After choosing method was a small research around the subject accomplished containing visits at companies and literature studying. The demands of the curvature of the bends were also more closely investigated to get a better grip of the demands on the roll forming mill. Rollforming is an effective way to change the profile of steel plates and strips. The higher rollspeed the faster rollforming. By calculating tension and elongation of the steel or by testing can the number of passes and the length of the mill be determined. In the part theory of the report is essential theory and rules regarding roll forming compiled for simple calculations and general understanding of some of aspects in roll and mill design. In the part method of the report is the work regarding planning and contructing the two hand made prototypes. Prototype one is manufactured for the purpose of testing stands, shafts and rolls. Derived from the results of testing prototype one is the final prototype constructed and made. The work is resulting in a final prototype containing two passes which is not producing the desired final bend angle but the function of the roll forming as a method can still be validated and presented. The steel strip is easily by hand dragged trough the mill and no defects or other problem were encountered. The final prototype is not fully meeting the demands of the final bend angle due to the short deadline it was made in. Two more passes are still needed do be added for the final angle. As a conclusion is roll forming as a method really suitable for this bending operation because of its simplicity, low cost, small physicall measurments and high forming speed...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho investiga a criatividade no contexto da inovação nas organizações. Em diversos campos da vida humana a criatividade tem sido uma questão relevante, em função da complexidade das soluções exigidas em situações e ambientes marcados pelas incertezas, ausência de modelos ou paradigmas e falência de outros. Na esfera dos negócios e das organizações é exatamente esta ambiência que caracteriza o cenário atual, onde predomina a demanda por inovação como fator competitivo. A criatividade surge, então, como força motriz para as inovações, fundamento de sua qualidade e fator diferencial frente aos desafios e problemas do cotidiano e dos negócios. Entendida como potencialidade sempre presente no ser humano, quando aliada à atitude e à ação empreendedora, a criatividade é capaz de contribuir para a inovação. A relação entre criatividade e inovação é aqui estudada, tendo como foco da análise a gênese de empreendimentos inovadores, pois, embora seja conhecida a necessidade de inovar, as organizações devem lidar permanentemente com a chamada ambidestria organizacional, caracterizada como a simultaneidade da manutenção e da inovação de seu negócio. Mesmo reconhecendo necessidade de inovação para garantir o sucesso dos negócios, sua implementação depende da legitimação por parte dos agentes de reconhecimento e sua viabilização, de contextos burocráticos, resistentes e cegos. A investigação foi apoiada em estudo empírico, que teve como sujeitos pessoas que tiveram projetos criativos recusados pelas organizações em que trabalhavam e que, sem abandonar suas idéias, criaram empresas próprias, revelando, nesse processo, a criatividade pessoal, a resiliência, o empreendedorismo e a causalidade pessoal. This thesis aims at {{investigating}} creativity {{within the}} context of innovation in organizations. Creativity is a relevant issue in several realms of human life if the requirements stemming from situations and environments characterized by uncertainties, lack or failure of paradigms and models are concerned. This is the prevailing status of innovation nowadays, a condition of competition. Creativity emerges as crucial element of innovation, rooting its quality and differentiating its outcomes. Understood as a potential ever present in human beings, creativity when aligned with entrepreneurship is enabled to contribute to innovation. Here, the relationship between creativity and innovation is scrutinized through the lens of the genesis of innovative entrepreneurship since the recognition of the need of innovation does not free organizations from the manning of the traditional and the new - organizational ambidextry. Although the recognition of innovation is required by the business effectiveness, its implementation relies on legitimacy on the part of organizational agents as well as its achievement faces bureaucracy, resistance and blindness. The analysis here carried out was supported by empirical data surveyed through individuals whose creative projects were rebuked by the enterprises where they had worked. Without giving up their ideas they settled their own enterprises to carry out their projects thus putting into light the creative process grounded on resilience, personal causation and entrepreneurship. In many of the fields of human life creativity has emerged more frequently as a relevant theme of study, due to the complexity of the solutions demanded in situations and environments characterized by uncertainty, absence of frameworks or paradigms and xi breakdown of others. In business and organizational sphere, <b>thats</b> <b>exactly</b> the ambience of present scenario, in which demand for innovation is prevalent as a competitive factor. Creativity comes up, then, as a requisite for innovation, differential element when facing challenges and problems of daily life and business. Assumed as a human potential always present, when allied to entrepreneurial attitude and action, creativity is capable to contribute to innovation. The relationship between creativity and innovation is studied, focused on the genesis of innovative enterprises, because, even knowing the necessity of innovate, organizations have to deal permanently with the so called organizational ambidestry, characterized by simultaneity of maintenance and innovation of the business. Even recognizing that innovation is necessary to guarantee success of business, organizations and society, implementation of any innovative process depend upon facing agents of recognition, in charge of identifying and authorizing it as a way of doing and of making in a certain environment and, for that, the tradition of taylorist and bureaucratic models of management is, sometimes, cause of blindness. The success threat is one of the contingent factors of their refusal of creative proposals, potentially innovative. This factor relates to organizational culture and its flexibility and openness to the new. Present investigation was supported by empirical study, with subjects whose projects were refused by organizations to which they worked for who, then, decided to create own organizations, revealing not only resilience, but, especially, personal causality...|$|E
