5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{new housing}} estates were built north-west of the town. This was {{followed}} by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s, which destroyed much of the old high street. There was speculation that the town's population could increase to around 55–60,000 by 1970. This did not happen: a decline in <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> industry in the mid-1960s led to a decrease in population, from a peak of 53,750 in 1961 to 47,962 in 1981.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.|$|E

25|$|The {{town was}} a major {{producer}} of linoleum after the formation of <b>the</b> <b>Linoleum</b> Manufacturing Company in 1864 by its inventor, Frederick Walton. Linoleum became the main industry {{of the town and}} {{was a major}} employer in the area until the 1960s. In 1876 about 220 and in 1911 about 350 people worked in the plant. By 1957 it employed some 300 people and in 1956 the factory produced about 2675 m2 of linoleum each week. The term 'Staines Lino' became a worldwide name but the factory was closed around 1970 and is the site is now occupied by the Two Rivers shopping centre, completed about 2000. A bronze statue of two lino workers in Staines High Street commemorates the Staines Lino Factory. The Spelthorne Museum has a display dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>Linoleum</b> Manufacturing Company.|$|E
25|$|An early {{scientific}} study of mercury poisoning was in 1923–6 by the German inorganic chemist, Alfred Stock, who himself became poisoned, together with his colleagues, by breathing mercury vapor that was being released by his laboratory equipment—diffusion pumps, float valves, and manometers—all of which contained mercury, and also from mercury that had been accidentally spilt and remained in cracks in <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> floor covering. He published {{a number of papers}} on mercury poisoning, founded a committee in Berlin to study cases of possible mercury poisoning, and introduced the term micromercurialism.|$|E
25|$|A {{housing crisis}} {{arose in the}} town {{at the end of}} the Second World War. New {{residential}} and private housing estates to the north-west, multi-storey flats and the redevelopment of areas such as Sinclairtown and Linktown occurred between the 1950s and 1960s. Several primary schools such as Valley, Fair Isle, Dunearn and Torbain were also built to serve these new estates (with Capshard being a latter addition in the early 1970s). Provision was given to new junior secondaries (Templehall and Balwearie); a new Catholic secondary (St Andrews) and the re-location of Kirkcaldy High School to Pathhead muir on the north side of the town. During the middle of the 1950s, construction began of a new hospital - on the site of the Fever hospital and sanatorium - to replace the cramped facilities of the cottage hospital situated to the east of the town. The late 1950s saw a new bus station open on a site north of the town centre to relieve the existing one on The Promenade (which continued to deal only with country routes until this was phased out in 1980). There was speculation that the town could grow around the 55,000 to 60,000 mark by 1970. This never materialised when the decline of linoleum in the mid-1960s - with the closure of <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> firm, Barry, Ostlere and Shepherd, shocking the town in particular - saw the population of the town fall. To try to combat this, deep mining was commissioned at Seafield in 1954 by the National Coal Board to help reduce the impact of job losses, it later closed in 1988, after a tug of war between the National Union of Mineworkers and the Conservative Government. Kirkcaldy harbour, which had once been vital to the town’s well being, suffered its own fate when it was closed permanently in 1992 to main traffic.|$|E

Many of these were Polish immigrants, and Linoleumville had become a Polish enclave. The plant closed in 1931 and residents overwhelmingly chose to rename the community Travis.|$|R

[...] The restoration included foundation work, resealing of walls, and repairs to the porch, doors, windows, and chimney.

Connolly refers to this in his 1983 song [...] "I Wish I Was in Glasgow" [...] with the lines [...] "I would take you there and show you but they've pulled the building down" [...] and [...] "They bulldozed it all to make a road". The flat had only two rooms: a kitchen-living room, with a recess where the children slept and another room for their parents. The family bathed in the kitchen sink, {{and there was no}} hot water.|$|E

He went on upstairs, and then it suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> might be. Apparently some subconscious element was at work. At any rate, he turned with his burden, went back to the hall, put down the syphon and whiskey, and bending down, touched the spot. Without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying blood.|$|E

It was like a scene in a motion picture play.|$|E

60|$|There were {{reasons why}} he wanted the money. Looking {{at him as he}} cantered over <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> at Bredin's, you would have said that his mind was on his work. But it was not so. He took and {{executed}} orders as automatically as the penny-in-the-slot musical-box in the corner took pennies and produced tunes. His thoughts were of Jeanne Le Brocq, his co-worker at Bredin's, and a little cigar shop down Brixton way which he knew was in the market at a reasonable rate. To marry the former and own the latter was Paul's idea of the earthly paradise, and it was the wealthy connoisseur, and he alone, who could open the gates.|$|E

Brakes ran in from {{surrounding}} villages. The market-place was full of women, the streets packed with men. It was amazing to see so many men everywhere in the streets. Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled with her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man--who was a gabey, but his wife was a bad 'un--laughed with the fish man--who was a scamp but so droll--put <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> man in his place, was cold with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man when she was driven--or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish; then she was coldly polite.|$|E

50|$|Linseed oil {{is used to}} bind wood dust, cork particles, {{and related}} {{materials}} {{in the manufacture of}} <b>the</b> floor covering <b>linoleum.</b> After its invention in 1860 by Frederick Walton, linoleum, or 'lino' for short, was a common form of domestic and industrial floor covering from the 1870s until the 1970s when it was largely replaced by PVC ('vinyl') floor coverings. However, since <b>the</b> 1990s, <b>linoleum</b> is on <b>the</b> rise again, being considered more environmentally sound than PVC. Linoleum has given its name to the printmaking technique linocut, in which a relief design is cut into the smooth surface and then inked and used to print an image. The results are similar to those obtained by woodcut printing.|$|R

60|$|The bareness of Mrs. Pearce's {{front room}} was fully {{displayed}} {{at ten o'clock}} at night when a powerful oil lamp stood on {{the middle of the}} table. The harsh light fell on the garden; cut straight across the lawn; lit up a child's bucket and a purple aster and reached the hedge. Mrs. Flanders had left her sewing on the table. There were her large reels of white cotton and her steel spectacles; her needle-case; her brown wool wound round an old postcard. There were the bulrushes and the Strand magazines; and <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> sandy from the boys' boots. A daddy-long-legs shot from corner to corner and hit the lamp globe. The wind blew straight dashes of rain across the window, which flashed silver as they passed through the light. A single leaf tapped hurriedly, persistently, upon the glass. There was a hurricane out at sea.|$|E
60|$|Burton {{stood for}} a moment upon the {{threshold}} of the office, looking around him. A new and peculiar distaste for these familiar surroundings seemed suddenly to have sprung into life. For the first time he realized the intense ugliness of this scene of his daily labors. The long desk, ink-splashed and decrepit, was covered with untidy piles of papers, some of them thick with dust; the walls were hung with seedy-looking files and an array of tattered bills; there were cobwebs in every corner, gaps in <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> floor-covering. In front of the office-boy--a youth about fourteen years of age, who represented the remaining clerical staff of the establishment--were pinned up several illustrations cut out from Comic Cuts, the Police News, and various other publications of a similar order. As Burton looked around him, his distaste grew. It seemed impossible that he had ever existed for an hour amid such an environment. The prospect of the future was suddenly hugely distasteful.|$|E
60|$|Even after Janet and Lise {{had gone}} to work the {{household}} never seemed to gain that margin of safety for which Hannah yearned. Always, when {{they were on the}} verge of putting something by, some untoward need or accident seemed to arise on purpose to swallow it up: Edward, for instance, had been forced to buy a new overcoat, <b>the</b> <b>linoleum</b> on the dining-room floor must be renewed, and Lise had had a spell of sickness, losing her position in a flower shop. Afterwards, when she became a saleslady in the Bagatelle, that flamboyant department store in Faber Street, she earned four dollars and a half a week. Two of these were supposed to go into the common fund, but there were clothes to buy; Lise loved finery, and Hannah had not every week the heart to insist. Even when, on an occasional Saturday night the girl somewhat consciously and defiantly flung down the money on the dining-room table she pretended not to notice it. But Janet, who was earning six dollars as a stenographer in the office of the Chippering Mill, regularly gave half of hers.|$|E
