40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> base and payout policy.

We show that undertaking an open market repurchase results in a signi cant reduction in the size of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> base. Consequently, we find that firms with small shareholder bases are less likely to undertake a repurchase (reduce <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> base even further) {{and are more likely to}} pay special dividends...|$|R

5|$|Railways {{arrived in}} the area in 1841, with the opening of part of the Bristol and Exeter Railway on 14 June, which {{eventually}} reached Exeter in 1844. In late 1846, the railway company attempted to buy the canal to prevent its use by rival railway companies. The sale was agreed in principle in June 1847, and was authorised by an act of Parliament passed on 30 June 1848. <b>The</b> <b>shareholders</b> received £7,372 in 1850, and the canal company was dissolved in 1851.|$|E
50|$|For example, if {{the farmer}} has one cow valued at $800, <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> may {{purchase}} a 1/25 undivided {{interest in the}} herd (or here, a single cow) for $32.00. The parties would execute a bill of sale transferring a 1/25 ownership stake in the cow from the farmer to <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> in exchange for $32.00. If the cow produces 30 gallons of milk per week, <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> may choose to receive up to 1 and a 1/5 gallons of milk per week (30 gallons of milk divided by 25 possible shares). If the cow is slaughtered, then <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> may also be entitled to 1/25 of the meat or {{the value of the}} meat. If the cow is shown at a competition and wins a prize, <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> may choose to receive up to 1/25 of the value of that award.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{payments}} etc. made by {{the company}} to an interposed entity, which then makes a payment etc. to <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> or an associate of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder,</b> would also be caught, if a reasonable person would conclude that the payment etc. was solely or mainly a part of an arrangement involving a payment etc. to <b>the</b> <b>shareholder.</b> But if a payment to the interposed entity is a dividend, then {{the amount of the}} dividend payment is exempt.|$|R
40|$|Shareholders {{have many}} legal rights, {{but they are}} not all of equal significance. This article will argue that two rights — the right to elect {{directors}} and the right to sell shares — are more important than any others, that these rights should be considered the fundamental rights of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder,</b> and that, as such, they deserve {{a great deal of respect}} and protection by law. The history of corporate law has been one of increasing flexibility for directors and decreasing rights for <b>shareholders.</b> Although <b>the</b> law seems to have coalesced around <b>the</b> norm of <b>shareholder</b> primacy, this is not necessarily reflected in the specific legal rights of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder.</b> <b>The</b> role of the director in the corporation is clearly defined, but the role of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> is not. This imbalance has led to the marginalization of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder.</b> A better understanding of the role of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> is needed. This article seeks to advance that understanding by means of an in-depth analysis of <b>shareholder</b> rights. <b>The</b> goal of this article is to establish that <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights to elect directors and to sell shares are indeed fundamental. It will do so by demonstrating the importance of these rights from a wide variety of perspectives, including two types of doctrinal analysis as well as the three major competing theories of the corporation. Because these two rights are important — indeed, the most important — rights from almost any point of view, they ought to be respected as the fundamental rights of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder...</b>|$|R

5|$|The crisis {{point for}} the UERL was the need to redeem the five-year {{profit-sharing}} secured notes on 30 June 1908. The UERL {{did not have the}} money. Speyer unsuccessfully tried to persuade the London County Council (LCC) to inject £5million into the UERL and used some of his own bank's money to pay-off disgruntled shareholders threatening bankruptcy proceedings.

5|$|After Icos's {{experimental}} drugs {{failed in}} clinical trials, Eli Lilly {{was in a}} prime position to purchase the company. In October2006, Eli Lilly announced that it had reached terms to acquire Icos for $2.1billion, or $32 a share. After receiving pressure from large institutional shareholders as well as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) suggesting the deal should be rejected, Lilly increased its offer to $2.3billion or $34 per share, a 6% increase. Again, resistance was voiced by some large shareholders, and ISS advised shareholders against accepting the new offer, which it still deemed insufficient.

40|$|In this paper, we {{will define}} and analyze {{shareholder}} value creation. To {{help us understand}} this concept better, we will use {{the example of a}} listed company, General Electric, between 1991 and 1999. To obtain <b>the</b> created <b>shareholder</b> value, we must first define the increase of equity market value, <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> value added, <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> return, and <b>the</b> required return to equity. A company creates value for its <b>shareholders</b> when <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> return exceeds <b>the</b> required return to equity. In other words, a company creates value in one year when it outperforms expectations. <b>The</b> created <b>shareholder</b> value is quantified as follows: Created shareholder value = Equity market value x (Shareholder return - Ke). <b>The</b> created <b>shareholder</b> value can also be calculated as follows: Created shareholder value = Shareholder value added - (Equity market value x Ke).

Akash and Kiara attempt to kill themselves, but are prevented from doing so by the Coast Guard. Still suicidal, Akash deliberately allows himself to be hit by a car, and Kiara falls on the bridge and breaks her neck. Their suicide attempts are unsuccessful, and they end up in hospital together. When they are discharged, Kiara takes Akash to her apartment because his house has been seized by the bank.|$|E
5|$|Capital to {{fund the}} scheme had been raised {{separately}} by the Wakefield and Leeds committees. A complicated restructuring of the finances in 1721 fixed the nominal capital at £26,700. Regular dividends at 7 per cent were paid to <b>the</b> <b>shareholders</b> from 1718, and the navigation was leased to various groups, who {{would be responsible for}} collection of tolls and repairs. The lease rose from £800 in 1704 to £2,600 in 1729, when receipts from each of the previous five years had averaged £6,016. The early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from Leeds, Wakefield, Halifax and Bradford, with wool and corn from Lincolnshire and East Anglia travelling in the opposite direction. By the 1720s there were also significant quantities of coal.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Briskin was {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} related to the control of MGM. As part of a battle between Joseph R.

However, the special board meeting which was held to appoint the two executives was held to be illegal by the Delaware Chancery Court, and the Mayer and Briskin appointments were overturned. The conflict continued on throughout the year, until MGM held a stockholders' meeting in October. During the meeting, <b>the</b> <b>shareholders</b> agreed to expand the board by adding ten new directors. Tomlinson's group was clearly routed, gaining only a single seat of the ten; that single seat was Briskin.|$|E
50|$|A {{previous}} system was utilised in the United Kingdom, called the Advance Corporation Tax (ACT). When a company paid a dividend, it {{was required to}} pay an amount of ACT, which it then used to offset its own taxes. The ACT was included in income by <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> resident in <b>the</b> United Kingdom or certain treaty countries, and treated as a payment of tax by <b>the</b> <b>shareholder.</b> To <b>the</b> extent that deemed tax payment exceeded taxes otherwise due, it was refundable to <b>the</b> <b>shareholder.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was {{an event}} that {{took place at the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, England when the actors who worked there, disapproving of the changes in the management, {{attempted}} to seize control. Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When <b>the</b> <b>shareholders</b> found out, they refused to admit the actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.|$|E
5|$|The act {{authorised}} {{an initial}} £75,000 {{to be raised}} to pay for construction, together with an option to raise a further £30,000, of which £20,000 should be raised by shares of £100 each among the initial subscribers, and £10,000 by mortgaging the future income of the canal. However, this amount proved insufficient, {{and there was also}} disagreement between <b>the</b> <b>shareholders</b> as to their liability to raise the additional £20,000. As a result, a second act was sought. This received the Royal Assent on 3 March 1797, and made clear the obligations of existing shareholders to pay the extra subscription, and also authorised an additional £24,000 to be raised. The second act also removed restrictions in the first act, and allowed the company to set whatever rates it chose for using the canal.|$|E
5|$|The canal made {{sufficient}} {{money to}} repay substantial debts in 1804 and 1805, after which dividends were paid to <b>the</b> <b>shareholders,</b> beginning at 2 per cent in 1806, rising to 5 per cent in 1815, and reaching their {{highest level of}} 8.6 per cent in 1839. The tolls brought in an income which remained below £9,000 until 1823, but then rose steadily to reach £13,079 in 1841. Traffic towards Grantham included coal and coke, lime, groceries and building materials. Some of it supplied villages {{along the line of}} the canal, and some of that which travelled the full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond Grantham. Downward traffic was largely agricultural produce, including corn, beans, malt and wool. Such produce was normally loaded at Grantham or Harby.|$|E

5|$|Theophilus {{first tried}} to work with Highmore and asked to run the {{operations}} of the theatre. However, he was turned down, which provoked him to stir the actors into a rebellion. Many of the actors were upset about the management changes and theatre's operations. Highmore did not have experience in theatre, refused to listen to actors' ideas, and cut their salaries in half. Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a good actor. The rebellious actors' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to <b>the</b> <b>shareholders,</b> who did not own the complex that they set their stage in. The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run.|$|E
5|$|Work resumed {{under the}} {{supervision}} of Priddy, but he was soon replaced by Edmund Lingard, who had been the engineer for the Coventry Canal. The canal was opened in stages as it was completed. It reached Chippenham Platt at the end of 1777, Ryeford in January 1779, and it was open throughout to the Wallbridge terminus on 21 July 1779. It had cost £40,930, which had been raised by calling £150 on each £100 share, by borrowing money from <b>the</b> <b>shareholders,</b> by running up debts, and by using the tolls from the parts of the canal which were already open. Traffic was around 16,000 tons per year, which enabled the company to repay the debts and to declare a first dividend of five per cent in 1786.|$|E
