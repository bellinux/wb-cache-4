50|$|Early speaker cable was {{typically}} stranded copper wire, insulated with cloth tape, waxed paper or rubber. For portable applications, common lampcord was used, twisted in pairs for mechanical reasons. Cables were often soldered {{in place at}} one end. Other terminations were binding posts, <b>terminal</b> <b>strips,</b> and spade lugs for crimp connections. Two-conductor ¼-inch tip-sleeve phone jacks came into use in the 1920s and '30s as convenient terminations.|$|E
50|$|Point-to-point and <b>terminal</b> <b>strip</b> {{construction}} {{continued to}} be used for some vacuum tube equipment even after the introduction of printed circuit boards. The heat of the tubes can degrade the circuit boards and cause them to become brittle and break. Circuit board degradation is often seen on inexpensive tube radios produced in the 1960s, especially around the hot output and rectifier tubes. American manufacturer Zenith continued to use point-to-point wiring in its tube-based television sets until the early 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of a <b>terminal</b> <b>strip</b> of a breadboard, one {{typically}} finds a notch running in parallel to the long side. The notch is to mark the centerline of the <b>terminal</b> <b>strip</b> and provides limited airflow (cooling) to DIP ICs straddling the centerline. The clips on the right and left of the notch are each connected in a radial way; typically five clips (i.e., beneath five holes) in a row {{on each side of the}} notch are electrically connected. The five rows on the left of the notch are often marked as A, B, C, D, and E, while the ones on the right are marked F, G, H, I and J. When a [...] "skinny" [...] dual in-line pin package (DIP) integrated circuit (such as a typical DIP-14 or DIP-16, which have a 0.3 in separation between the pin rows) is plugged into a breadboard, the pins of one side of the chip are supposed to go into row E while the pins of the other side go into row F on the other side of the notch. The columns are numbered 1 - 50 or whatever number of columns there are.|$|R

50|$|The Euroblock is a {{solderless}} connector {{that uses}} screw terminals to clamp connecting wires. Once the wires are installed, the entire assembly is plugged into a matching socket {{in the electronic}} device. Euroblocks are more convenient than the <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> they replace as the signal cables can be quickly disconnected from or connected to the electronic device, rather than unscrewing and re-screwing each wire individually.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of radio, amateurs nailed bare copper wires or <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> to a wooden board (often {{literally}} a board to slice bread on) and soldered electronic components to them. Sometimes a paper schematic diagram was first glued to the board as a guide to placing terminals, then components and wires were installed over their symbols on the schematic.

5000|$|Terminal strip construction, {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> (also called [...] "tag boards"). A terminal strip has stamped tin-plated copper terminals, each with a hole through which wire ends could be pushed, fitted on an insulating strip, usually made of a cheap, heat-resistant material such as synthetic-resin bonded paper (FR-2), or bakelite reinforced with cotton. The insulator has an integral mounting bracket, sometimes electrically connected to one or more of the stamped loops to ground them to the chassis.|$|E

40|$|The CB- 4 is {{designed}} as a connection point between a Watchman portable data collector and permanently installed transducers. Up to 12 transducers in four locations are supported. Permanently mounted transducers are typically used in places where the technician {{is not able to}} easily access the machine due to safety or other considerations. This application note covers installation and use of the CB- 4 remote sensor connection box. Each <b>terminal</b> <b>strip</b> of the CB- 4 represents a triaxial test location that is identified by the bar-code on the front panel. Setting up the test location in the EAV software is exactly the same as if the test location were accessible.

5000|$|The chassis was {{constructed}} first, from sheet metal or wood. Insulated <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> were then [...] riveted, nailed or screwed to the underside or {{interior of the}} chassis. Transformers, large capacitors, tube sockets and other large components were mounted {{to the top of}} the chassis. Their wires were led through holes to the underside or interior. The ends of lengths of wire or wire-ended components such as capacitors and resistors were pushed through the terminals, and usually looped and twisted. When all wires to be connected had been fitted to the terminal, they were soldered together (and to the terminal).|$|E
5000|$|An {{intermediate}} form of point-to-point construction uses <b>terminal</b> <b>strips</b> (sometimes called [...] "tag boards") or turret boards.

In soldering, an alloy of tin and lead, or later bismuth and tin, is melted and adheres to other, nonmolten metals, such as copper or tinned steel. Solder makes a strong electrical and mechanical connection. Note that if components are arranged on boards with tags or turrets {{at both ends}} and wires going to the next components, then the construction is correctly called tag or turret construction respectively, as the components are not going from point to point.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{laparoscopy}} is the consequence of advances made in the field of medical engineering. Each surgical specialty has different requirement of instruments. Laparoscopy was initially criticized owing to the cost of specialized instruments and possible complications due to these sharp long instruments. Also, it necessitated difficult hand eye coordination. Gradually, the technique gained recognition and respect from the medical fraternity since it drastically reduced many of the complications of the open procedure. Minimal access surgery has developed rapidly only after grand success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Computer aided designing of laparoscopic instruments is an important branch of medical engineering. It is now possible to control the access through microprocessor controlled laparoscopic instruments. New procedures and instruments are innovated regularly which makes it important for the surgeon to be familiar with the developments. Laparoscopy is a technologically dependent surgery and it is expected every surgeon should have reasonably good knowledge of these instruments.

40|$|Microglia {{actively}} {{survey the}} brain microenvironment and play essential roles in sculpting synaptic connections during brain development. While microglial {{functions in the}} adult brain are less clear, activated microglia can closely appose neuronal cell bodies and displace axosomatic presynaptic <b>terminals.</b> Microglia-mediated <b>stripping</b> of presynaptic <b>terminals</b> is considered neuroprotective, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. Using 3 D electron microscopy, we demonstrate that activated microglia displace inhibitory presynaptic terminals from cortical neurons in adult mice. Electrophysiological recordings further establish that the reduction in inhibitory GABAergic synapses increased synchronized firing of cortical neurons in g-frequency band. Increased neuronal activity results in the calcium-mediated activation of CaM kinase IV, phosphorylation of CREB, increased expression of antiapoptotic and neurotrophic molecules and reduced apoptosis of cortical neurons following injury. These results indicate that activated microglia can protect the adult brain by migrating to inhibitory synapses and displacing them from cortical neurons...|$|R

40|$|Zu Beginn der 70 er Jahre wurde für Adenosin- 5 '-triphosphat (ATP), das bereits lange als innerhalb der Zelle vorkommender Energieträger bekannt war, eine extrazelluläre Wirkung als Neurotransmitter postuliert. Es dauerte allerdings noch eine Reihe von Jahren, bis die von der Arbeitsgruppe um G. Burnstock aufgestellte Hypothese der "purinergen Nerven" und die damit verbundene Existenz von so{{genannten}} P 2 -Rezeptoren (früher purinerge Rezeptoren) allgemein anerkannt wurde. Heute besteht kein Zweifel mehr, dass ATP alle der unten genannten Anforderungen an eine als endogener Überträgerstoff innerhalb des vegetativen und zentralen Nervensystems fungierende Substanz erfüllt: • Synthese und Speicherung des entsprechenden Überträgerstoffes, • Freisetzung einer definierten Menge an Transmitter bei einem einlaufenden Aktionspotential, • Rezeptoren für die Reaktion mit dem Transmitter sowie • die rasche Inaktivierung des freigesetzten Neurotransmitters. [...] . More than 70 years ago, {{the effects}} of extracellular adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP), a newly identified and purified biomolecule at that time (Fiske and Subbarow, 1925; Lohmann, 1929) were observed by Drury and Szent-Györgyi (1929). Since then, many pharmacological {{studies were carried out}} with extracellular adenine nucleotides in various intact organ systems, isolated tissues, and purified cell preparations. Yet it was not until 1972 that Burnstock introduced the concept of "purinergic nerves" and suggested that ATP might fulfil the criteria generally regarded as necessary for establishing a substance as a neurotransmitter, summarised by Eccles (1964) : • synthesis and storage of transmitter in nerve <b>terminals</b> <b>Strips</b> of guinea-pig taenia coli (GPTC) were shown to take up large amounts of tritium-labelled adenosine when incubated with tritium-labelled adenosine, adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP), adenosine 5 '-diphosphate (ADP) and ATP. The nucleoside was rapidly converted into and retained largely as [3 H]-ATP (Su et al., 1971). • release of transmitter during nerve stimulation Spontaneous relaxation of GPTC as well as relaxations induced by nerve stimulation or nicotine, respectively, in the presence of compounds which block adrenergic and cholinergic responses were accompanied by a remarkable increase in release of tritium-labelled material from taenia coli incubated in [3 H]-adenosine (Su et al., 1971). • postjunctional responses to exogenous transmitters that mimic responses to nerve stimulation Burnstock et al. (1966) characterised ATP and ADP as the most potent inhibitory purine compounds in the gut and observed that {{the effects of}} ATP mimic more closely the inhibitory response of the taenia to non-adrenergic nerve-stimulation than to adrenergic nerve stimulation (Burnstock et al., 1970). enzymes that inactivate the transmitter and/or uptake systems for the transmitter or its breakdown products When ATP was added to a perfusion fluid recycled through the vasculature of the stomach, very little ATP remained, but the perfusate contained substantially increased amounts of adenosine and inosine, as well as some ADP and AMP (Burnstock et al., 1970). • drugs that can produce parallel blocking of potentiating effects on the responses of both exogenous transmitter and nerve stimulation Tachyphylaxis to ATP produced in the rabbit ileum resulted in a consistent depression of responses to non-adrenergic inhibitory nerve stimulation, whereas responses to adrenergic nerve stimulation remained unaffected (Burnstock et al., 1970). Lower concentrations of quinidine reduced and finally abolished relaxation of GPTC induced by noradrenaline (NA) and by adrenergic nerve stimulation. Using higher concentrations of the compound, relaxant responses of GPTC to ATP as well as to non-adrenergic inhibitory nerve stimulation were abolished (Burnstock et al., 1970). [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} smooth muscle strips cut out longitudinally or circularly from the terminal ileum about 5 cm from the ileo-coecal sphincter. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the functional role of M 1 muscarinic receptor subtype in the regulation of cholinergic contractions of the guinea-pig terminal ileum. Electrical field stimulation (EFS; 16 Hz) produced in vitro contractile responses of the guinea-pig <b>terminal</b> ileum muscle <b>strips</b> (longitudinal and circular muscle layer). Those contractions were inhibited by 1 μM tetrodotoxin (2 ± 2 % of the control response) and 1 μM atropine (1 ± 1 % of the control response), thus indicating the activation of intrinsic cholinergic nerves. Exogenous ACh (1 μM) induced contractions that were inhibited by 1 μM atropine, but not by 1 μM tetrodotoxin, indicating a direct effect on the smooth muscle. MCN- 343 specific agonist of M 1 receptor subtype (5 μM) induced contractions that were inhibited by 1 μM atropine and by 1 μM tetrodotoxin. M 1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (10 nM) had no effect on ACh - induced contractions but reduced EFS - induced contractions by 11 ± 3 % and MCN-A- 343 induced contractions by 17 ± 4 %. In conclusion, specific M 1 receptors modulate terminal ileum contractions by regulating the release of ACh from cholinergic nerves. M 1 receptors, present on cholinergic nerves, function as prejunctional facilitatory autoreceptors...|$|R
5000|$|The MV Twin Capes {{is one of}} the {{original}} three vessels of the 1970s fleet, christened in May 1975.

40|$|In the rat corpus cavernosum (CC), the {{distribution}} of immunoreactivity for neuronal and endothelial NO synthase (nNOS and eNOS), and the pattern of NOS-immunoreactive (-IR) nerves in relation to some other nerve populations, were investigated. Cholinergic nerves were specifically immunolabelled with antibodies to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter protein (VAChT). In the smooth muscle septa surrounding the cavernous spaces, and around the central and helicine arteries, the numbers of PGP- and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -IR terminals were large, whereas neuropeptide Y (NPY) -, VAChT-, nNOS-, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) -IR terminals were found in few to moderate numbers. Double immunolabelling revealed that VAChT- and nNOS-IR terminals, VAChT- and VIP-IR terminals, nNOS-IR and VIP-IR terminals, and TH- and NPY-IR terminals showed coinciding profiles, and co-existence was verified by confocal laser scanning microscopy. TH immunoreactivity was not found in VAChT-, nNOS-, or VIP-IR nerve fibres or <b>terminals.</b> An isolated <b>strip</b> preparation of the rat CC was developed, and characterized. In this preparation, cumulative addition of NO to noradrenaline (NA) -contracted strips, produced concentration-dependent, rapid, and almost complete relaxations. Electrical field stimulation of endothelin- 1 -contracted preparations produced frequency-dependent responses: a contractile twitch followed by a fast relaxant response. After cessation of stimulation, there was a slow relaxant phase. Inhibition of NO synthesis, or blockade of guanylate cyclase, abolished the first relaxant phase, whereas the second relaxation was unaffected. The results suggest that in the rat CC, nNOS, VAChT-, and VIP-immunoreactivities {{can be found in}} the same parasympathetic cholinergic neurons. Inhibitory neurotransmission involves activation of the NO-system, and the release of other, as yet unknown, transmitters...|$|R
