40|$|On {{the issue}} of {{regulating}} outbound telemarketing abuses, this paper proposes a new perspective of recognizing telephone lines as a property of consumers.

Becky repeatedly rebels against Roseanne and Dan's parental authority such as staying out late and breaking into the liquor cabinet with her friend Dana and getting drunk when Dan and Roseanne are out of town for the day. The reappearance of old biker buddy Ziggy (Jay O. Sanders) reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene first proves her talent for writing when she wins recognition for her poetry.

500|$|Sandi Mann concludes {{from her}} {{research}} that the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture will prevail, becoming used by more companies and countries.

A positive effect is that it is beneficial for business and for people who enjoy fake displays. A negative effect is that emotions incompatible with the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] culture are repressed, leading to what Mann terms the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome. [...] In an interview for the Wall Street Journal, an employee of a telemarketing company, was called a son of a bitch. Clenching his teeth, he responded [...] "Thank you very much, you have a nice day." [...] The stress of suppressing their feelings and faking cheerfulness caused people like the <b>telemarketer</b> to feel insincere and phony. Individuals affected by the [...] "Have a Nice Day" [...] syndrome must carry out emotional labor, which could lead to diminished self-esteem, depression, and cynicism.|$|E
