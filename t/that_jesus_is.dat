5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
25|$|Jews for Jesus {{takes the}} {{mainstream}} Christian positions <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Messiah, that his coming was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, and <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{the son of}} God, the second person of the Trinity. Jews for Jesus believes that their views of the Messiah are entirely compatible with the view of God presented in Jewish scriptures, and that {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity, fundamental to the Christian faith, is not entirely alien to Judaism.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Ecumenical Council {{is that of}} Chalcedon in 451, Patriarch of Constantinople presiding, 500 bishops, affirmed <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> truly God {{and truly}} man, without mixture of the two natures, {{contrary}} to Monophysite teaching.|$|E
50|$|The early {{centuries of}} Christian history also had {{groups at the}} other end of the spectrum, arguing <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> an {{ordinary}} mortal. The Adoptionists taught <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born fully human, and was adopted as Gods Son when John the Baptist baptised him because of the life he lived. Another group, known as the Ebionites, taught <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> not God, but the human Moshiach (messiah, anointed) prophet promised in the Hebrew Bible.|$|R
5000|$|Other critics {{preserved}} {{the unity of}} God by saying <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a man, but differentiated in being indwelt by the Spirit of God to an absolute and unique degree. They thus denied <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> God or a god. They became known as [...] "adoptionists", because they suggested <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> adopted by the Father to be his Son. This view was associated with Theodotus of Byzantium (the Shoemaker) and Artemon.|$|R

25|$|Messianic Judaism is {{a modern}} syncretic {{religious}} movement that combines Christianity—most importantly, the Christian belief <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Messiah—with elements of Judaism and Jewish tradition, its current form emerging in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Faith is {{a passive}} persuasion <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Messiah, and active works are not {{mandatory}} {{in terms of}} salvation. In other words, Jesus graciously provides eternal salvation as a free gift to {{those who believe in}} Him.|$|E
25|$|Free Grace Theology is {{distinguished}} by its soteriology or doctrine of salvation. Its advocates believe that God justifies the sinner on the sole condition {{of faith in}} Christ, not righteous living. Their definition of faith involves belief, trust, and conviction <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{the only way to}} salvation.|$|E
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a political national messiah, {{but the evidence}} for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|R
25|$|Buddy Cole speculates <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> homosexual.|$|R
2500|$|Some suggest <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> {{married to}} Mary Magdalene, {{or that he}} {{probably}} had a special relationship with her. However, Ehrman notes the conjectural nature of these claims as [...] "not {{a single one of}} our ancient sources indicates <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> married, let alone married to Mary Magdalene." ...|$|R
25|$|Following the Apostolic Age, {{from the}} 2nd century forward, several controversies {{developed}} {{about how the}} human and divine are related within the person of Jesus. Eventually in 451, {{the concept of a}} Hypostatic union was decreed, namely <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> both fully divine and fully human. However, differences among Christian denominations continued thereafter. See the article on Christology for details.|$|E
25|$|Other key {{examples}} include Bernardo Daddi's central {{panel in the}} De Carlo Triptych in which the Madonna is shown sitting in a very low chair, rather than on a cushion. Fra Angelico's representation of about 1430 (which includes two angels) is notable in <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> approached from above, focusing on his divinity. Giovanni di Paolo's depiction of about 1456 (see gallery below) represents a transition {{in the perception of}} nature, with the visual landscape forming itself around the seated Madonna.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ecumenical councils were convened in the 4th and 5th centuries {{to deal with}} these issues. The Council of Ehesus debated {{hypostasis}} (co-existing natures) versus Monophysitism (only one nature) versus Miaphysitism (two natures united as one) versus Nestorianism (disunion of two natures). The 451 Council of Chalcedon was highly influential and marked a key turning point in the Christological debates that broke apart the church of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th century. In Chalcedon the hypostatic union was decreed, namely <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> both fully divine and fully human, making this part of the creed of Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
50|$|Some Christian vegetarians, such as Keith Akers, argue <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> himself <b>was</b> a vegetarian. Akers argues <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> {{influenced}} by the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect. The present academic consensus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> not an Essene. There is no historical record of Jesus’ precise attitudes to animals, {{but there is a}} strand in his ethical teaching about the primacy of mercy to the weak, the powerless and the oppressed, which Walters and Portmess argue can also refer to captive animals.|$|R
25|$|The English writer Godfrey Higgins {{suggested}} {{in his book}} Anacalypsis (1836) <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a dark brown skinned Indo-Aryan from North India. In 1906 a German writer named Theodor Plange wrote a book titled Christ-an Indian? in which he argued <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> an Indian and that the Christian gospel had originated in India.|$|R
50|$|Adoptionism, {{sometimes}} called dynamic monarchianism, is a nontrinitarian theological doctrine which holds <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> adopted as the Son of God at his baptism, his resurrection, or his ascension. According to Epiphanius's {{account of the}} Ebionites, the group believed <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> chosen {{on account of his}} sinless devotion to the will of God.|$|R
25|$|There {{are some}} {{movements}} that combine elements of Judaism {{with those of}} other religions. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s, that incorporates elements of Judaism with the tenets of Christianity. The movement generally states <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Jewish Messiah, that {{he is one of the}} Three Divine Persons, and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Some members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism. Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Justification {{by faith}} alone (sola fide) {{states that it}} is by grace through faith alone that Christians receive {{salvation}} and not through any works of their own (see Ephesians 2:8, Romans 3:23). Open Brethren have {{a strong emphasis on}} the concept of salvation. The brethren teach that the consequence of human sin is condemnation to eternal death in hell. Christ's death on the cross paid sin's penalty and his resurrection is evidence that eternal life is available to any who will have it. The only requirements are that each individual willfully repents of sin, accepts the substitutionary payment of his own sin by faith in Christ's death, and declares <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> Lord (see John 3:14–18 and Acts 10:34–43).|$|E
25|$|Luke's {{understanding}} of Jesus – his Christology – {{is central to}} his theology. One approach to this is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, {{but are not limited}} to, Christ (Messiah), Lord, Son of God, and Son of Man. Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke's readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours. A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the promised Messiah. While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ's pre-existence or to the Christian's union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps he felt no need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.|$|E

5000|$|Psilanthropists {{argue against}} the virgin birth and contend <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "mere human". Psilanthropism existed among early Jewish Christian {{groups such as}} Ebionites who {{considered}} Jesus the Messiah, but rejected the apostle Paul as an apostate. However, in the 4th century the Nicene Creed rejected the teaching <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a mere human.|$|R
25|$|Christians believe <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a {{human being}} who was also fully God.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, the Irish Dominican {{priest and}} theologian Thomas L. Brodie (born 1943), holding a PhD from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome and a co-founder and former {{director}} of the Dominican Biblical Institute in Limerick, published Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery. In this book, Brodie, who previously had published academic works on the Hebrew prophets, argued that the Gospels are essentially a rewriting of the stories of Elijah and Elisha when viewed as a unified account in the Books of Kings. This view lead Brodie to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> mythical. Brodie's argument builds on his previous work, in which he stated that rather than being separate and fragmented, the stories of Elijah and Elisha are united and that 1 Kings 16:29–2 Kings 13:25 is a natural extension of 1 Kings 17–2 Kings 8 which have a coherence not generally observed by other biblical scholars. Brodie then views the Elijah–Elisha story as the underlying model for the gospel narratives.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish {{conception}} of the messiah (משיח mashiach in Hebrew) holds certain similarities to that of Christians, yet there are substantial differences. According to Jews, the Hebrew Scriptures contain {{a small number of}} prophecies concerning a future descendant of King David, who will be anointed (Hebrew: moshiach) as the Jewish people's new leader and will establish the throne of David in Jerusalem forever. In the Jewish view, this fully human and mortal leader will rebuild the land of Israel and restore the Davidic Kingdom. This subject is covered in the section on Jewish eschatology. Some Christians have a different understanding of the term messiah, and believe <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the messiah referred to in the Old Testament prophecies; that the kingdom in these prophecies was to be a heavenly kingdom, not an earthly one; and that Jesus' words and actions in the New Testament provide evidence of his identity as messiah and that the remainder of messianic prophecy will be fulfilled in the Second Coming. Other Christians acknowledge the Jewish definition of messiah, and hold that Jesus fulfills this, being 'fully man' (in addition to being 'fully God'), and believe that the Second Coming will establish the Kingdom of God on earth, where Jesus, as messiah and descendant from David, will reign from Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the Houston Press music blog {{compared}} {{several aspects}} of popular media and concluded <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> more popular than the Beatles.

500|$|Judaism {{rejects the}} idea of Jesus being God, or a {{mediator}} to God, or part of a Trinity. It holds <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> not the Messiah, arguing that he neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. Jews argue that Jesus did not fulfill prophesies to build the Third Temple (...) , gather Jews back to Israel (...) , bring world peace (...) , and unite humanity under the God of Israel (...) [...] Furthermore, according to Jewish tradition, there were no prophets after Malachi, who delivered his prophesies in the 5th century BC.|$|E
