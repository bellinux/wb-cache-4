40|$|The {{microscopic}} {{demonstration of}} the tubercle baciilus by the Ziehl-Neelsen technique has always entailed heavy demands on the time and concen-tration of the observer, {{but in recent years}} fluorescence microscopy has offered a means of greatly facilitating this task. The spontaneous fluorescence of M. tuberculosis under ultra-violet microscopy was first observed by Kaiserling (1917), but the use of fluorochrome staining is much more recent (Hagemann, 1937), and it is with this latter technique that this paper is concerned. <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> a high intensity light source and an appropriate system of filters. A blue filter eliminates the long wavelengths. The short wavelength rays elicit fluorescence from the stained preparation, and an orange eyepiece filter then allows only the fluorescence to reach the observer. The bacilli are seen as bright rods against a dark background, and are easily seen with low magnifications, permitting a much more rapid survey than with oil immersion objectives. For staining, Hagemann first employed berberine sul-phate, but later he reported superior results with auramine 0 (Hagemann, 1938), and this has be-come the standard fluorochrome for M. tubercu-losis.

40|$|A total {{pressure}} apparatus {{has been developed}} to measure vapour-liquid equilibrium data on binary mixtures at atmospheric and sub-atmospheric pressures. The method gives isothermal data which can be obtained rapidly. Only measurements of {{total pressure}} are made as a direct function of composition of synthetic liquid phase composition, the vapour phase composition being deduced through the Gibbs-Duhem relationship. The need to analyse either of the phases is eliminated. As such the errors introduced by sampling and analysis are removed. <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> that the pure components be degassed completely since any deficiency in degassing would introduce errors into the measured pressures. A similarly essential requirement was that the central apparatus {{would have to be}} absolutely leak-tight as any leakage of air either in or out of the apparatus would introduce erroneous pressure readings. The apparatus was commissioned by measuring the saturated vapour pressures of both degassed water and ethanol as a function of temperature. The pressure-temperature data on degassed water measured were directly compared with data in the literature, with good agreement. Similarly the pressure-temperature data were measured for ethanol, methanol and cyclohexane and where possible a direct comparison made with the literature data. Good agreement between the pure component data of this work and those available in the literature demonstrates firstly that a satisfactory degassing procedure has been achieved and that secondly the measurements of pressure-temperature are consistent for any one component; since this is true for a number of components, the measurements of both temperature and pressure are both self-consistent and of sufficient accuracy, with an observed compatibility between the precision/accuracy of the separate means of measuring pressure and temperature. The liquid mixtures studied were of ethanol-water, methanol-water and ethanol-cyclohexane. The total pressure was measured as the composition inside the equilibrium cell was varied at a set temperature. This gave P-T-x data sets for each mixture at a range of temperatures. A standard fitting-package from the literature was used to reduce the raw data to yield y-values to complete the x-y-P-T data sets. A consistency test could not be applied to the P-T-x data set as no y-values were obtained during the experimental measurements. In general satisfactory agreement was found between the data of this work and those available in the literature.

40|$|Recent {{issuances}} of sukuk {{were confronted}} with wide criticism from, both by Islamic scholars and investors. The {{part of the}} problems arise due to the agency relations in sukuk structures that have a distinctive nature with great complexity and various features. Due to the higher complexity of the responsibilities undertaken by the agent, greater exposure to agency costs results. This research aims to examine sukuk associated risks, agency costs and Sharia issues. Specifically, it analyses asset-backed sukuk structures from financial and Sharia viewpoints. This is achieved by adopting a case study strategy and inductive approach to examine the legal and financial issues arising in three different types of asset linked sukuk structures. The data is collected using content analyses of sukuk prospectuses, AAOIFI Sharia standards and publications issued by international agencies {{with the aim of}} enabling the study to achieve insights into the market. Furthermore, information is gathered from Sharia scholars using semi structured interviews to generate some specific information on the issues involved. The objectives of this study are to analyse three key issues: based on theoretical discussions identify the risks arising in securities in general and sukuk in particular; to carry out a comparative analysis of the principle/agent conflicts which arise in different cases of sukuk investment; and {{to determine the extent of}} adherence to Sharia rules. The dissertation discusses in depth the agency costs that arise in asset-backed sukuk structures. It determines how these costs are minimized and conflicts managed in the applications. Among the strategies and tools used to reduce agency costs is to apply the concept of co-ownership. Under this type of agreement between the originator and investors, the sukuk structure becomes more competitive and shows a better allocation of the risks. Although the issuance of sukuk are reviewed and approved by eminent scholars, they show different levels of contradictions with AAOIFI Sharia standards. The study identifies the status of different stipulations of different contracts in terms of Sharia requirements. The research then shows the extent to which the compatibility of the sukuk cases differ with key Sharia principles. The analysis found that the key requirements are mostly related to the guarantee, ownership, principle, return and maintenance costs. It found out that SEC sukuk are far away from the spirit of Sharia as most of <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> not fulfilled. Sadara sukuk show better harmonious with AAOIFI requirements because of their unprecedented feature involved in their structure, which highlighted some of the distinctive nature of sukuk. Zamzam sukuk achieved the best harmonious with Sharia among the three applications. This positive result is attributed to the real ownership to the investment, meaning that there is no guarantee for the principle or the return. The results show that there is a higher exposure to risks related to liquidity legality in sukuk cases than in conventional bonds. More importantly is that the credit risk in sukuk cases are higher than in bond investments. The three cases were more exposed to the credit risks since any loss in the assets has to influence both the distribution amounts and the purchase undertaking. The critical point found is that despite SEC and Sadara sukuk cases involve higher exposure to credit risk as required in Islamic finance, they do not provide in turn a recourse to the assets according to the concept of sukuk. The cases also show that the purchase undertaking solves the agency conflicts, caused by the originator being the servicer. The undertaking device has reduced the incentive asymmetries from different perspectives. ...|$|E

40|$|Interorganisationale Workflows sind Arbeitsabläufe, welche die Grenzen einer Organisation verlassen und einen Rahmen für Kooperationen der verschiedenen autonomen Organisationen zur Verfügung stellen. Ein wichtiger Punkt für den Entwurf solcher Workflows ist die Balance zwischen Offenheit und Abgrenzung, wobei erstere für Kooperationen und letztere die für den Schutz von Know-how benötigt wird. Workflow Sichten stellen ein effizientes Werkzeug für diesen Zweck zur Verfügung. Durch Offenlegung von bestimmten Teilen eines Prozesses, können Organisationen sowohl kooperieren als auch das Know-how schützen. Diese Dissertation präsentiert nun eine Methode für die korrekte Konstruktion von Workflow Sichten. Es wird angenommen, dass Organisationen Web Service orientierte Technologien zur Modellierung und Implementierung von interorganisationalen Workflows verwenden. Die Anwendung von Web Services bietet Organisationen viele Vorteile. Den eigentlichen Mehrwert von Web Services stellt aber die Kompositionsfähigkeit dar. Verfügbare Web Services können dadurch von anderen Choreographien und Orchestrationen (wieder-) {{verwendet}} werden. Die Notwendigkeit der Implementierung von Systemen von Null weg kann minimiert werden. Die zentralen Anforderungen sind einerseits eine Architektur mit adäquatem Potential, andererseits die Verifikation der Korrektheit. Diese Dissertation präsentiert nun eine Architektur zur Modellierung von Web Service Composition basierten interorganisationalen Workflows, genannt föderierte Choreographien, die verglichen mit anderen Architekturen verschiedene Vorteile anbieten. Darüber hinaus werden Algorithmen und Techniken zur Verifikation der strukturellen und temporalen Korrektheit vorgestellt. Strukturelle Korrektheit prüft, ob die Strukturen der beteiligten Prozesse zusammenpassen. Temporale Korrektheit überprüft, ob ein interorganisationaler Workflow, der aus mehreren Choreographien und Orchestrationen besteht hinsichtlich der lokalen und globalen Bedingungen fehlerfrei ist. Mit Hilfe dieser Techniken kann die strukturelle und temporale Konformität des Modells zur Designzeit überprüft werden. Falls das Modell nicht strukturell oder temporal konform ist, können nötige Änderungen durchgeführt werden, sodass die korrekte Ausführung zur Laufzeit garantiert werden kann. Die Überprüfung der Konformität zur Designzeit reduziert die Prozesskosten vor allem wegen den folgenden zwei Gründen: Erstens, die entdeckten Fehler zur Designzeit sind normalerweise billiger als jene, die zur Laufzeit entdeckt werden und zweitens, Fehlerbehandlungsmechanismen können verhindert werden, die wiederum Zusatzkosten verursachen. Zusätzlich zu der vorgestellten Architektur wird eine allgemeinere Architektur zusammen mit den passenden Konformitätsprüfungsalgorithmen präsentiert. Der Ansatz ist Platform- und sprachunabhängig und die Algorithmen sind verteilt. workflows are workflows {{that cross}} {{the boundaries of}} a single organization and {{provide a framework for}} cooperation of different autonomous organizations. An important issue when designing such workflows is the balance between the openness needed for cooperation and the privacy needed for protection of business know-how. Workflow views provide an efficient tool for this aim. By exposure of only selected parts of a process, organizations can both cooperate and protect their business logic. This dissertation presents a technique for a correct construction of workflow views. It is assumed that organizations and partners use web services and web service related technology to model and implement interorganizational workflows. Application of web services offers several advantages for organizations. The real surplus of web services is their capability of being composed to more complex systems. Available web services can be reused by other choreographies and orchestrations and the need for development of new systems from scratch can be minimized. <b>The</b> <b>essential</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>are</b> on the one hand an architecture with adequate capabilities and on the other hand, verification of correctness. This dissertation proposes an architecture for modeling web service composition based interorganizational workflows, calledfederated choreographies, that provides several advantages compared to existing proposals. Moreover, algorithms and techniques for verification of structural and temporal correctness of interorganizational workflows are proposed. Structural conformance checks if the structures of the involved processes match. Temporal conformance checks if an interorganizational workflow composed of choreographies and orchestrations is temporally error-free with respect to local and global temporal constraints. The proposed algorithms can be applied for checking the structural and temporal conformance of the federated choreographies at design-time. If the model is not structurally or temporally conformant, necessary modifications can be done such that the correct execution of the flow at run-time can be guaranteed. The conformance checking at design time reduces the cost of process because of two reasons: first, errors detected at design time are normally cheaper than those detected at run time and second, exception handling mechanisms can be avoided which are, in turn, coupled with additional costs. In addition to the proposed architecture, a more general architecture together with the conformance checking algorithms and techniques for interorganizational workflows are presented. The presented approach is language and platform independent and algorithms work in a distributed manner. ...|$|E

Our formulation and solution of this problem is completely representation-free.

The resulting behavior of the to-be-controlled variables is called the controlled behavior.

40|$|With 332, 000 {{operations}} {{carried out}} every year, the implantation of an artificial hip joint {{is one of}} the most common surgical operations performed in the US. According to prognosis which takes the demographical change into account, the number of these operations will increase in the coming years. One of <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> perfect reconstruction of the biomechanical functions, especially the knowledge about the center of the hip rotation and the length of the leg. Based on this information it is possible to ensure the right position of the newly set leg during surgery. The aim of this work is to present and evaluate an optical measurement method in order to gather information about the center of the hip joint and the leg length. An appropriate laboratory setup has been designed and implemented in order to evaluate two different approaches: a structured light-method consisting of a DLP-Beamer or a laser source which projects defined patterns onto the patient and a marker-based system. Together with this both methods are combined with custom software to determine the hip joint center and the leg length with an accuracy of around +/- 0. 2 inches. The clinical use of the tested approaches would give the surgeon the opportunity to reset the implant-parameters in the course of the surgery. In this way subsequent illnesses such as scoliotic pelvis can be prevented...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is the problem of {{stability}} and vibration reduction in designed drive systems, in which <b>the</b> <b>essential</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>is</b> to meet <b>the</b> desired dynamic properties. Design/methodology/approach: : The method of stabilisation and reduction has been based on active synthesis, which makes it possible to obtain the desired mechanical effect through the proper selection of dynamic properties of the system, including the calculation of the active force {{as a function of the}} system force feedback. Findings: Presented approach simplifies the process of selecting the dynamical parameters of machine drive systems in view of their dynamical characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The scope of discussion is the synthesis of machine drive systems as discrete models of torsional vibrations. Such vibrations are more difficult to detect than flexural ones, which are accompanied by noise and vibrations of the adjacent elements (for example, shaft frames). Due to the absence of symptoms, torsional vibrations are particularly dangerous, as they may be unnoticeable until the destruction of subsystems occurs. Practical implications: High durability and reliability of drive systems is associated with proper setting of system parameters - inertial, elastical and damping. Proper setting of these parameters is made possible by applying synthesis techniques. Originality/value: We should emphasize that the considered problem varies from other issues met in classic mechanics or control theory. The research has been undertaken on the basis of topological methods, developed in scholar environment of Gliwice...|$|R
