5|$|During 1988, when <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> {{movement}} towards {{independence was}} gaining strength, <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Supreme Soviet again recognized the tricolor {{as the national}} flag, by amending article 168 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> SSR. The flag was defined as rectangular tricolor which consists of three equally sized horizontal stripes: the upper is yellow, the middle is green, the lower is red; the flag ratio was to be 1:2 (as that of Soviet flags). This flag was confirmed by the Provisional Constitution of 11 March 1990 № I-10.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> nobility opposed the growing Polish–Lithuanian union and offered <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> crown to Ivan IV. The Tsar {{publicly}} advertised this option, either because {{he took the}} offer seriously, or because he needed time to strengthen his Livonian troops. Throughout 1561, a Russo-Lithuanian truce (with a scheduled expiration date of 1562) was respected by both sides.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Democratic Party and Ernestas Galvanauskas {{used the}} Seimas as an {{opportunity}} to organize the Peasant Union, which largely represented the interests of large and mid-size farmers. The Union helped spread the influence of the Seimas into the countryside. A few days after the Seimas, Jonas Basanavičius founded <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> National Democratic Party (Lithuanian: Tautiškoji lietuvių demokratų partija), the first nationalistic party in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> in <b>the</b> contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> claimed to be defending their borders, while Poland did not recognize the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> had no rights to these territories. Poland also accused <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> of collaborating with the Soviets and thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently. The diplomatic struggle, both directly between the two states and in the League of Nations, intensified.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> pursued <b>the</b> {{retreating}} Tatars; it {{was said}} that more Tatars died retreating across the Tsapra than in <b>the</b> battle. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> achieved a victory and recovered much booty (gold, silver, horses) and many prisoners taken by the Tatars. Remnants of Tatar forces were defeated by locals at Slutsk, Zhytomyr, Ovruch. For a few more days, <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> waited for Tatar contingents returning to the camp from pillaging Lithuanian villages and countryside.|$|R
50|$|It {{seems likely}} that <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> mustered an army near Vilnius as a {{strategic}} maneuver, since <b>Lithuanians</b> could use <b>the</b> downstream flow of the Neris River to transport artillery and military provisions from Vilnius; the Knights were forced to use overland or upstream transport. During the 1384 assault, <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> deployed cannons and trebuchets; the besieged Teutonic Knights had also installed cannons in the castle, which apparently destroyed the Lithuanians' trebuchet. Nevertheless, the castle was retaken by <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> {{language}} survived as {{a peasant}} vernacular {{and also as}} a written language in religious use, from the publication of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas in 1547. The Ruthenian language was and remained in the Grand Duchy's official use even after the Union, until the takeover of Polish.|$|E
5|$|The conference {{began in}} the evening of September 29, 1920. The Polish {{delegation}} was led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz (who originated from Lithuania), and <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> delegation by general Maksimas Katche. Lithuania proposed an immediate armistice, but the Polish delegation refused. Only after <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> delegation threatened to leave the negotiation table did Poland agree to stop fighting, but only {{to the east of}} the Neman River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting {{to the west of the}} river continued. The Polish delegates demanded that the Lithuanians allow the Polish forces to use a portion of the Warsaw– Saint Petersburg Railway and the train station in Varėna (Orany). The Lithuanians refused: their major forces were concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> claims to Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> army was {{expanding}} and modernizing. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Air Force was especially targeted for rapid development and service in this branch was prestigious. Some of its earlier members such as Jurgis Dobkevičius and Antanas Gustaitis {{were instrumental in}} improving on aeronautical designs. While at the military school Marcinkus played for the KSK (Kauno sporto klubas) football club. After his father's death in 1927, Marcinkus took on the responsibility of supporting his remaining family, he also began playing football for LFLS Kaunas.|$|E
50|$|In July 1273 <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> invaded Lublin. In retaliation, Leszek II the Black {{organized}} {{an expedition}} to Yotvingia in December of that year. In 1278 <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> again invaded Lublin, and they clashed with Leszek II's army at the Battle of Łukow.|$|R

Confused and disoriented, Lithuanians retreated from Suwałki and Sejny on August 30 and 31. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> reorganized, gathered their forces (11 battalions with 7,000 soldiers), and organized a counterattack to [...] "defend their border" [...] on September 2. The {{goal was to}} take and secure the Augustów-Lipsk-Hrodna line. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> succeeded in taking Sejny and Lipsk and by September 4 reached the outskirts of Augustów. On September 5, the Poles counterattacked and forced <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> to retreat. On September 9, the Polish forces recaptured Sejny, but <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> pushed back and regained Sejny and Giby on September 13 and 14. Pending direct negotiations, hostilities were ceased on both sides.|$|R

5|$|February 16 in Lithuania {{is now an}} {{official}} holiday. On this day various ceremonies are hosted all across Lithuania. The 2014 commemoration included laying flowers at the signatories’ graves in Rasos Cemetery, awarding <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> National Prize, the hoisting of the three Baltic States’s flags at Daukantas Square, dedicated concerts at Cathedral Square in Vilnius and at <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> National Philharmonic Society hall, and the lighting of 16 fires along Gediminas Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{disagree}} about who initiated {{the idea of}} organizing a national assembly. Some credit Jonas Basanavičius, while others argue for Jonas Kriaučiūnas. The organizational activities were largely taken on by <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Christian Democrats and by Vilniaus žinios, a moderate newspaper owned by Petras Vileišis. Vilniaus žinios was the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper to appear after <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> press ban was lifted on May 7, 1904; it was quite popular and its circulation soon reached 6,000 copies. On October 31 (October 18 O.S.), 1905 a fifteen-member organizational committee, chairman Jonas Basanavičius and secretary Jonas Kriaučiūnas, was given the task of convening the assembly. They published an appeal or a manifest to <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> people on November 11 (October 29 O.S.) in Vilniaus žinios. The appeal, signed by the chairman and the secretary, aroused much interest in the public. Invitations were extended to all persons who would be elected as representatives by their communities at volosts, and to all other educated people interested {{in the future of}} <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> state. At the end of the appeal there was an eight-point agenda to be discussed at the Seimas. It did not include the question of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E

Prince Waldeck, with 500 soldiers, managed to escape, as the Tatars and <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> were too busy looting the Prussian camp. Altogether, the battle lasted approximately five hours.|$|R

5|$|In October 1940, Marcinkus reached Liverpool, {{and from}} there {{travelled}} on to London. On 24 December of the same year, Marcinkus became a pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF). To achieve that, he changed some of his personal data; he stated that he was three years younger, otherwise {{he would have been}} too old for service in the RAF. At that time, his homeland Lithuania had already lost its independence, and <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> air force was rapidly liquidated by its occupiers. Throughout the years, Maricinkus maintained close contacts with <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> attaché in Britain in order to receive news about Lithuania and his family.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{had been}} part of the Russian Empire since the {{partitions}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. After the unsuccessful uprising of 1863, Lithuania was subjected to Russification policies: <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> press ban was initiated, schools were required to teach in the Russian language, Roman Catholics could not hold positions in government institutions and could own only limited amounts of land, and political rights were restricted. However, these measures had limited effects on <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> National Revival, and a sense of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> national identity continued to grow. The first Lithuanian political parties, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and Lithuanian Democratic Party, included goals of political autonomy for Lithuania within the Russian Empire in their basic program.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, the {{day before}} the Dunkirk evacuation, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov {{presented}} a diplomatic note that accused <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> government of abducting three Soviet soldiers stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the terms of the mutual assistance treaty. The note alleged that two soldiers had been tortured to obtain Russian military secrets but managed to escape, and that the third, Butayev, was murdered. Earlier in May, Butayev had deserted his unit and was searched by <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> police. When found, he committed suicide. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> government replied that the accusations were baseless, but promised a full investigation of the incident and convened a special commission. However, the commission's requests for detailed information, including interviews, photographs, physical descriptions, or other data that could further the investigation, went unanswered. The official Soviet stance was that Lithuania needed to carry out the investigation on its own and that its requests were an attempt to shift responsibility to the Russians.|$|E

5|$|Smetona and Voldemaras, both {{representing}} <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> National Union, {{invited the}} Christian Democrats {{to join them}} in forming a new government that would restore some degree of constitutional legitimacy. The party agreed reluctantly; {{they were worried about}} their prestige. Looking toward the near future, the Christian Democrats reasoned that they could easily win any upcoming Seimas elections, regaining power by constitutional means and avoiding direct association with the coup. In keeping with this strategy, they allowed members of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> National Union to take over the most prominent posts.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations {{began its}} session on September 16, 1920. After reports by Lithuanian {{representative}} Augustinas Voldemaras and Polish envoy Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the League adopted a resolution on September 20. It urged both states to cease hostilities and {{adhere to the}} Curzon Line. Poland was asked to respect Lithuanian neutrality if Soviet Russia agreed to do the same. A special Control Commission was to be dispatched into the conflict zone to oversee implementation of the resolution. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> government accepted the resolution. Sapieha replied that Poland could not honor <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> neutrality or the demarcation line as Lithuania was actively collaborating with the Soviets. The Poles reserved the right of full freedom of action. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> representative in London, Count Alfredas Tiškevičius, informed the secretariat of the League of Nations that Sapieha's telegram {{should be regarded as}} a declaration of war; he also asked that the League of Nations take immediate intervention in order to stop new Polish aggressive acts.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> {{government}} in Kaunas, which viewed {{the city as}} the historic capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, saw the Polish incursion as an occupation. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> government demanded Vilnius back. Relations between the Polish and Lithuanian governments, unable to reach a compromise over Vilnius, continued to worsen, destroying the prospects for Piłsudski's plan of the Międzymorze federation and leading to open hostilities in the ensuing Polish–Lithuanian War. In 1920, the Soviets recaptured Vilnius, followed by the Poles' establishment of the short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> did {{not have}} a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt for the end of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians.</b> On September 21, <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days. The PMO branch in Lithuania ceased to function and was liquidated.|$|R

5|$|The initial coup was {{postponed}} to September 1, 1919. However, some PMO units began their actions (cutting telegraph wires, damaging railways, etc.) as scheduled previously– {{on the night}} of August 27 to 28. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> intelligence intercepted and decoded the order to delay the coup. They had known before that Poles were plotting, but did not know who and when. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> government was informed about the cut telegraph wires and intercepted order in the morning of August 28. However, the government did not consider the threat real and did not take appropriate action.|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{contributed to}} {{the deterioration of the}} Polish–Lithuanian relations and further discouraged the Lithuanians from joining Piłsudski's proposed Międzymorze federation. The Sejny Uprising doomed the Polish plan to overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> government in a coup d'état. After the uprising, <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> police and intelligence intensified their investigation of Polish sympathizers and soon uncovered the planned coup. They made mass arrests of Polish activists from August 27 to the end of September 1919. During the investigations, lists of PMO supporters were found; law enforcement completely suppressed the organisation in Lithuania, arresting members.|$|E
