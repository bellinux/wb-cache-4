40|$|Abstract: Successive trade {{reforms have}} greatly opened the Chinese {{economy and the}} reforms offered for WTO {{accession}} involve further liberalization. To assess {{the implications of the}} <b>tariff</b> <b>offers,</b> we take into account the tariff exemptions that are especially important in China’s trade regime, and the reductions in the variability of tariffs at the tariff line level required by the WTO offers. The analysis suggests that these offers will result in real income gains of over $ 50 billion, benefiting both China and its major trading partners. Omitting the tariff exemptions is shown to result in over-estimation of the benefits from liberalization, while focusing on average tariff reductions leads to under-estimation. The views expressed in this paper are strictly those of the authors, and should not be taken as representing the official position of the World Bank or any other institution.

Our analysis focuses on the revenue trade-off for the company. We identify the effect of payment method on the relationship between fixed and variable charge. We find significant effects of the distribution and transmission charges which the suppliers pay in each area, as well as the size of the market both by number of customers and area; and confirm that incumbents charge significantly more that entrants. We also find significant differences between the prepayment and credit tariffs. Energy Competition, Non Linear Pricing, Simultaneous Equation Models...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{evolution}} of the electricity business regulation has given new possibilities to the electricity providers for formulating dedicated <b>tariff</b> <b>offers.</b> A key aspect for building specific tariff structures is {{the identification of the}} consumption patterns of the customers, in order to form specific customer classes containing customers exhibiting similar patterns.

These technologies, often called the 2 ̆ 2 smart grid, 2 ̆ 2 {{have the potential to}} improve the efficiency and reliability of future energy markets. This project focuses on developing a trading agent to compete in the 2012 Power TAC game, a new scenario this year {{that is part of the}} annual Trading Agent Competition. Modeling a liberalized retail electrical energy market, Power TAC is a simulation in which competing trading agents or brokers offer energy services to customers via tariff contracts. The brokers must also serve their customers by buying and selling energy in the wholesale and retail markets. Our agent design uses a feedback control mechanism to coordinate the agent’s actions across different markets and maintain the necessary energy balance. The agent predicts future energy supply and demand conditions based on its portfolio, and, if necessary, applies corrective actions. In the retail market, the agent can create and modify <b>tariff</b> <b>offers</b> to customers to increase or decrease demand, while in the wholesale market the agent can negotiate with suppliers to buy additional energy. The results of the competition and the design of agent strategies will help policy makers create institutions that produce the intended incentives for energy customers and consumers, and help to validate intelligent automation technologies for next-generation energy markets...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{dissemination}} {{of renewable energy}} subsidy schemes around the world has prompted dialogue and debate on the comparative merits of different policy schemes, whether it is monetary or non-monetary support. Some countries have announced the legislation to force power producers to build or buy electricity from renewable power plants (i. e. the power plants using renewable resources {{as the source of}} fuel) at the government electricity rate. In some countries, the production of electricity from renewable energy by the government has been promoted by purchasing that electricity at a higher rate than the normal rate. In order to encourage the application of renewable energy, the most prevalent policies for supporting new renewable electricity are variations of the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The Feed in <b>tariff</b> <b>offers</b> a long-term, fixed price payment to renewable energy generators, whereas the RPS has a mandatory to supply electricity from renewable resources, either by selfproduction or out-source at a defined ratio. RPS seeks to create price competition between renewable energy generators to meet defined targets, and typically define a maximum cost through a price cap instrument. This study was aimed to comparison of renewable subsidies scheme policies in various countries like USA and Europe. The results of the study suggest that a reasonable approach to encourage the electricity production from renewable resources in Thailand is an integrated scheme of a mandatory and voluntary base...|$|E
40|$|This is the {{specification}} for the Power Trading Agent Competition for 2012 (Power TAC 2012). Power TAC is {{a competitive}} simulation that models a “liberalized” retail electrical energy market, where competing business entities or “brokers” offer energy services to customers through tariff contracts, and must then serve those customers by trading in a wholesale market. Brokers are challenged {{to maximize their}} profits by buying and selling energy in the wholesale and retail markets, subject to fixed costs and constraints. Costs include fees for publication and withdrawal of tariffs, and distribution fees for transporting energy to their contracted customers. Costs are also incurred whenever there is an imbalance between a broker’s total contracted energy supply and demand within a given time slot. The simulation environment models a wholesale market, a regulated distribution utility, and a population of energy customers, situated in a real location on Earth during a specific period for which weather data is available. The wholesale market is a relatively simple call market, similar to many existing wholesale electric power markets, such as Nord Pool in Scandinavia or FERC markets in North America, but unlike the FERC markets we are modeling a single region, and therefore we do not model location-marginal pricing. Customer models include households {{and a variety of}} commercial and industrial entities, many of which have production capacity (such as solar panels or wind turbines) as well as electric vehicles. All have “real-time” metering to support allocation of their hourly supply and demand to their subscribed brokers, and all are approximate utility maximizers with respect to tariff selection, although the factors making up their utility functions may include aversion to change and complexity that can retard uptake of marginally better <b>tariff</b> <b>offers.</b> The distribution utility models the regulated natural monopoly that owns the regional distribution network, and is responsible for maintenance of its infrastructure and for real-time balancing of supply and demand. The balancing process is a market-based mechanism that uses economic incentives to encourage brokers to achieve balance within their portfolios of tariff subscribers and wholesale market positions, in the face of stochastic customer behaviors and weather-dependent renewable energy sources.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{flexible}} model of monopoly nonlinear pricing with endogenous participation decisions of heterogeneous consumers. We use computing intensive methods {{to fit the}} solution of this model to many nonlinear <b>tariffs</b> <b>offered</b> by incumbent monopolists in several early local U. S. cellular telephone markets. For each market, numerical solutions of two–point boundary problems identify the marginal cost, average price sensitivity of demand, marginal consumer type, and indexing parameters governing {{the distribution of the}} two-dimensional type components. The sources of identification are the position, shape, and allowance of free minutes that defines each <b>tariff</b> <b>offered</b> by monopolists as well as a measure of market penetration in each cellular market during the first and last quarter of monopoly regime. We use the distribution of these structural parameters across markets and time to evaluate the magnitude of the inefficient provision of goods due to asymmetric information, the importance of bunching of different consumer types, and the empirical relevance of random participation constraints. We use these structural parameters to provide a first performance comparison â€”profits and welfareâ€” of nonlinear tariffs relative to linear, optimal two-part, Coasian marginal cost-plus fixed fee, and flat tariffs. We furthermore evaluate the potential welfare gains of alternative policies such as implementing a universal service requirement or allowing a second identical cellular telephone carrier. Finally, we also conduct a descriptive analysis of the sample variation of all structurally identified variables conditional on the observable characteristics of markets and cellular carriersNonlinear Pricing; Random Participation;Bucket Tariffs; Quantity Underprovision; Nonlinear vs. Restricted Pricing; Universal Service; Divestiture...|$|R

40|$|The {{first draft}} of a paper (the 'Harbinson paper') setting out a basis for finding a way forward in the {{agricultural}} negotiations was circulated by the Chair of the WTO Committee on Agriculture on February 17 th 2003. This {{was the product of}} a series of meetings and represented a first attempt to bridge the wide gulf between member states' positions. On market access the draft proposed the following tariff reductions for developed countries: an average 60 % reduction on all tariffs greater than 90 % over a five-year period, with a minimum reduction of 45 % per tariff line; an average 50 % reduction on all tariffs between 15 % and 90 % over a five-year period, with a minimum reduction of 35 % per tariff line; an average 40 % reduction on all tariffs lower than 15 % over a five-year period with a minimum reduction of 25 % per tariff line. Where tariffs on processed products are higher than on the raw material, tariff reductions should be higher than those required for the raw material. Where non-ad-valorem tariffs are applied, cuts should be based on the tariff equivalent, in line with the formula outlined above. In drawing up their <b>tariff</b> <b>offers</b> it is suggested that developed countries should target concessions on developing countries. For developing countries the following tariff reductions were proposed: an average 40 % reduction on all tariffs greater than 120 % over a five-year period with a minimum reduction of 30 % per tariff line; an average 33 % reduction on all tariffs between 20 % and 120 % over a five-year period with a minimum reduction of 23 % per tariff line; an average 27 % reduction on all tariffs lower than 20 % over a five-year period with a minimum reduction of 17 % per tariff line. Developing countries however should have the option of declaring certain products as strategic products (SP) where these are important for food security, rural development or livelihood security. These products could then be subjected to special treatment, involving an average 10 % reduction in tariffs with a minimum of 5 % per tariff line. The paper also contains proposals for the modification of arrangements for tariff-rate quotas, involving an expansion of tariff-rate quotas to levels equivalent to 10 % of domestic consumption (6. 6 % for developing countries, excluding strategic products). It is also proposed that in-quota tariffs on tropical products be removed by developed countries, but otherwise no reduction in in-quota tariffs is to be required. The draft paper calls for an end to Special Safeguard Provisions for developed countries {{at the end of the}} implementation period. Developing countries would be allowed to retain special safeguard measures for strategic products. On export support, proposals are put forward for phasing out export subsidies over a six-year period for products representing 50 % of such support and over a nine-year period for the remainder. For developing countries reductions should take place over ten and thirteen years respectively. Proposals are also advanced for disciplining export credits, the activities of state-trading enterprises and the abuse of food aid. On domestic support, some proposals for amending the 'green box' provisions are advanced, but overall these provisions will largely be retained. 'Blue box measures are to be capped and subjected to a 50 % reduction over five years (a 35 % reduction over ten years for developing countries). 'Amber box' measures should be cut by 60 % over five years (40 % over ten years for developing countries). Least developed countries will not be required to undertake reduction commitments. It is proposed that developed countries should provide duty- and quota-free access for all least developed country exports. Comment: The tariff-reduction commitments the EU would make at the multilateral level in many product areas would simply reduce the value of the trade preferences extended to ACP countries under the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement and the EBA initiative. This would be despite the nominal commitment to maintaining the margins of preference extended under preferential trade regimes in favour of developing countries. In many respects this would only be possible under the EU's standard GSP scheme since the duties applied under this scheme are linked to the MFN duties applied. This being said, a provision is made for slowing down the rate of tariff reductions in those areas of particular importance to preferred trading partners, such as the ACP, by requiring the tariffs to be cut over eight years instead of five years and by calling for the abolition of all in-quota duties. In terms of the tariff-reduction commitments which developing countries are expected to commit to, a key determinant of the impact of such measures will be the extent to which other WTO rules effectively restrict trade-distorting forms of support. What is and what is not a trade-distorting form of agricultural support has now become a vital terrain of political discussion, with many of the EU's so called less trade-distorting or non-trade-distorting forms of support still having an important impact on production and export decisions. Indeed the entire objective of the CAP-reform process is to improve the price competitiveness of EU products on national and international markets. This policy is already causing EU production to expand despite major reductions in EU prices. This suggests that direct aid to EU farmers also has an impact on production levels and subsequent trade flows. It would therefore appear to be important that WTO rules establish effective disciplines for these kinds of support as well. The proposal that developed countries should provide duty- and quota-free access for all least-developed country exports is not directly relevant to least-developed country exports to the EU since the EU has already adopted such measures under its 'Everything but Arms' initiative. Overall there are concerns that issues of priority to developing countries, such as special safeguards (how to deal with import surges and food-dumping practices), special and differential treatment, and the establishment of a food-security mechanism, are being sidelined in the current intense negotiations.
