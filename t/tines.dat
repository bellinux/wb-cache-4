40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to {{experimentally}} study how the vibrational acceleration spreads along the branch shaken by PVC <b>tine,</b> steel <b>tine,</b> and nylon <b>tine</b> for citrus canopy shaking harvesting and to compare the difference. PVC <b>tine</b> and steel <b>tine</b> have potential to be used as shaking rod for citrus canopy shaking harvesting. Nylon <b>tine</b> is a commonly used shaking rod. A tractor-mounted canopy shaker was developed to do the trial. The shaking frequency was set at 2. 5 and 5 [*]Hz. Experimental results showed that the vibrational acceleration at the shaking spot is not the highest. Spreading from shaking spot to the stem, it increases evidently. When spreading from stems of the outside subbranch to stems of the nearest inside subbranch, its average decrease percentage is 42 %. The overall vibrational acceleration of shaking at 5 [*]Hz is 1. 85 times as high as shaking at 2. 5 [*]Hz. The overall vibrational acceleration exerted by straight PVC <b>tine</b> and steel <b>tine</b> is 1. 77 and 1. 97 times as high as that exerted by straight nylon <b>tine,</b> respectively.
