5|$|The {{combination}} of Lutosławski's aleatory techniques and his harmonic discoveries {{allowed him to}} build up complex musical textures. According to Bodman Rae, in his later works Lutosławski evolved a more mobile, simpler, harmonic style, in which less of the music is played with an ad libitum coordination. This development {{first appeared in the}} brief Epitaph for oboe and piano, around the time Lutosławski was struggling to find the <b>technical</b> <b>means</b> to complete his Third Symphony. In chamber works for just two instrumentalists the scope for aleatory counterpoint and dense harmonies is significantly less than for orchestra, but these developments also influenced his orchestral style in late works including the Piano Concerto, Chantefleurs et Chantefables, Chain 2 and the Fourth Symphony, which require mostly conventional coordination.|$|E

The paper presents {{the example of}} an application that solves automation of <b>technical</b> <b>mean</b> recirculation procedures. Automation in the aspect of overhaul process preparation should be obtained through new tools specially oriented to refurbish mechanically used or damaged components. Design/methodology/approach: Methodology is based on complex overhaul process analysis that conclude <b>technical</b> <b>mean</b> recirculation method. This method brings <b>technical</b> <b>mean</b> back to operation with procedures (like: disassembly, aggregation, examination, preparation of refurbishing technology, overhaul process report generation) determined in specific order. Findings: Method of <b>technical</b> <b>mean</b> refurbishing with computer aid application. Proposition of automation in aspects of: disassembly (disassembly correct sequence) and aggregation procedures (which elements should be examined). Research limitations/implications: Important limitations are: disassembly based on assembly order, automation widest range possible when disassembly and aggregation is based on existing documentation. Aggregation algorithm based on machined type of elements. Practical implications: Nowadays overhaul processes are based directly in most cases on leading technologist experience. Elaborated method and application leads to more objective solutions (decisions) based on algorithms results. Originality/value: CAO is an original and new approach {{that should be considered}} especially in heavy industry. Nowadays subjective decisions about how to refurbish in overhaul processes could be replaced by automated computer aided solutions. Positive economic impact to future and present overhaul processes execution in industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the specific {{approach to the}} designing process. This approach bases {{on the concept of}} integrated designing taking into consideration the three main attributes and three main subsystems of each <b>technical</b> <b>mean.</b> The attributes describing the features of an optimal <b>technical</b> <b>mean</b> include: the geometric form (including the mutual relations), the material form (including macroscopic and microscopic structure) and the assembly form (so called the dynamic form representing the constructional features obtaining only in the assembly process). The three specified constructional subsystems are: the structural subsystem (representing the main system of carrying and functional elements), the drive subsystem (representing the drives, actuators and energy sources) and the control subsystem (representing the sensors, controllers, signal buses and information’s subsystem). Optimally linking mentioned attributes it is possibly to obtain the optimal design solution. It corresponds to certain approaches in mechatronics design understood as creating the system of specified subsystems (including the mechanical one and the electric one). In the presented work will be described the formal aspects of the integrated approach in the designing process. They will be also illustrated the practical results of introducing the proposed approach. These results are considered with the possibility of application the sophisticated tools of analysis like multi-agents theory. It is also possible to show the consequences of this approach for the CAD/CAE process. The integrated approach creates the theoretical platform for these informatics solutions. Finally one should point out the possibility of linking, in one designing process, informatics tools considered with designing and analysis of control subsystem...|$|R

The research framework is the following: once a product concept has been approved, the mechanical design engineer develops the product architecture and product part (also called embodiment design). Sketches at that level are essential both for synthesis and analysis purposes. Moreover, the designer has often to collaborate with the production department. The current CAD tools do not allow the same freedom, sensitivity nor the same possibility of communication and understanding the sketch.

This Act regulates the use of police weapons and specific <b>technical</b> <b>means</b> of physical force used by police. However, this act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers {{such as the use}} of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. The officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity, reasonability and measure in order to use force. To ensure the Grand Ducal Police do not engage in police brutality numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. The police inspector (which is the term for an everyday officer) must undergo legal and tactical training lasting an intensive 26 months followed by further training at an allocated police station. By way of comparison, the Victoria Police Academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training. The 2015 Human Right Report on Government practices by the United States indicated no cases of police brutality in Luxembourg. This report suggests the Grand Ducal Police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.|$|E

Several power systems in Europe are already facing a very high penetration from variable renewables which is posing concerns on the operational stability limits that are being surpassed for extreme RES generation conditions.

500|$|Goebbels was {{particularly}} interested in controlling radio, which was then still a fairly new mass medium. Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly Prussia, headed by Göring), Goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934. Manufacturers were urged by Goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers, called Volksempfänger (people's receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans. On 2 September 1939 (the day {{after the start of}} the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty. Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime [...] "made the complete use of all <b>technical</b> <b>means</b> for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Experiments {{are being}} {{performed}} on the Avogadro Project's silicon spheres to determine whether their masses are most stable when stored in a vacuum, a partial vacuum, or ambient pressure. However, no <b>technical</b> <b>means</b> currently exist to prove a long-term stability any better {{than that of the}} IPK's because the most sensitive and accurate measurements of mass are made with dual-pan balances like the BIPM's FB2 flexure-strip balance (see External links, below). Balances can only compare the mass of a silicon sphere to that of a reference mass. Given the latest understanding of the lack of long-term mass stability with the IPK and its replicas, there is no known, perfectly stable mass artifact to compare against. Single-pan scales, which measure weight relative to an invariant of nature, are not precise to the necessary long-term uncertainty of [...] parts per billion. Another issue to be overcome is that silicon oxidizes and forms a thin layer (equivalent to [...] silicon atoms) of silicon dioxide (quartz) and silicon monoxide. This layer slightly increases the mass of the sphere, an effect that must be accounted for when polishing the sphere to its finished dimension. Oxidation is not an issue with platinum and iridium, both of which are noble metals that are roughly as cathodic as oxygen and therefore don't oxidize unless coaxed {{to do so in the}} laboratory. The presence of the thin oxide layer on a silicon-sphere mass prototype places additional restrictions on the procedures that might be suitable to clean it to avoid changing the layer's thickness or oxide stoichiometry.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the first}} forty {{official}} copies {{are made of}} the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions, periodic verifications using {{a large number of}} replicas—especially the national primary standards, which are rarely used—can convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK. What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other. It is also clear that the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50µg over the last century, and possibly significantly more, in comparison to its official copies. The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world. This relative nature of the changes amongst the world's kilogram prototypes is often misreported in the popular press, and even some notable scientific magazines, which often state that the IPK simply [...] "lost 50µg" [...] and omit the very important caveat of [...] "in comparison to its official copies".Even well respected organizations incorrectly represent the relative nature of the mass divergence as being one of mass loss, as exemplified by , and , and [...] The root of the problem is often the reporters' failure to correctly interpret or paraphrase nuanced scientific concepts, as exemplified by [...] by the Associated Press published on PhysOrg.com. In that AP story, Richard Davis—who used to be the NIST's kilogram specialist and now works for the BIPM in France—was correctly quoted by the AP when he stated that the mass change is a relative issue. Then the AP summarized the nature of issue with this lead-in to the story: [...] "A kilogram just isn't what it used to be. The 118-year-old cylinder that is the international prototype for the metric mass, kept tightly under lock and key outside Paris, is mysteriously losing weight— if ever so slightly". Like many of the above-linked sites, the AP also misreported the age of the IPK, using the date of its adoption as the mass prototype, not the date of the cylinder's manufacture. This is a mistake even Scientific American fell victim to in a print edition. Moreover, there are no <b>technical</b> <b>means</b> available {{to determine whether or not}} the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long-term trends upwards or downwards because their mass [...] "relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000µg over a period of 100 or even 50 years". Given the lack of data identifying which of the world's kilogram prototypes has been most stable in absolute terms, it is equally valid to state that the first batch of replicas has, as a group, gained an average of about 25µg over one hundred years in comparison to the IPK.|$|E
