40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of drilled ultra-extended reach wells and complex geometry wells, the drilling limitation caused by excessive torque and drag forces must be further investigated. The wellbore friction being a main limiting factor in extended reach well needs to be studied with the new developed models. This master thesis presents an application of the new 3 -dimentional analytical model developed by Bernt S. Aadn&# 248;y in the synthetic test and four real wells. Quite diverse wellbore trajectory and depth has been chosen for a better evaluation and comparison of the model with the measured data. In order to investigate the potential and limitation of the model, torque and drag analysis during the different operations such as <b>tripping</b> <b>in,</b> <b>tripping</b> <b>out,</b> rotating off bottom, combined up/down were investigated. An application of the analytical model for wellbore friction analysis in the actual wells is very time consuming and requires a lot data/input manipulation. As a part of the thesis assignment, it was required to create simplified means for application and testing the analytical model. With visual basic application in Excel a simple torque and drag simulator was created purely based on the analytical model simple solution. Along with the analytical model the master thesis includes Wellplan software for torque and drag analysis in all the included test and actual wells. Along with this, the project has a brief literature study of 3 D analytical model and torque and drag concept in general. The analytical model gives a reasonable torque and drag results. Based on comparison between the model and actual measurement, it has been observed that the analytical model simple solution in some cases may not precisely describe wellbore friction analysis. The discrepancy between Wellplan and the analytical model prediction occurs during the <b>tripping</b> <b>in</b> operations. Being a strong function of tension/compression in the drill string the analytical model for more accurate torque and drag prediction requires an application of the complete solution. The main challenge for this model is the complexity of its full application. There is an uncertainty regarding the model application in conjunction with drillstring effective tension. For the actual well application it is time consuming and requires drillstring effective tension analyzing which make the model disable for the real time analysis. The analytical model must be further investigated by application in the real well with good quality of measured data. </p...|$|R

These are South Sangu- 4 and Sangu- 11, which are situated in block 16. From the study it was found out that: Comparing the simulation data and real time data, the <b>tripping</b> <b>in</b> and <b>tripping</b> <b>out</b> coefficient of friction were back calculated. The coefficient of frictions derived from Sangu- 4 were used for planning of drilling in Sangu- 11. Calculating the Friction factor ratio on South Sangu- 4, it shows an indication of Pack off around 3000 m (MD) to 3500 m (MD). And eventually the well (South sangu 4) took a kick at the depth of 3486 m (MD). No real time Torque and Drag monitoring was done there. Getting {{the idea of the}} FF of that block 16, a simulation of drill string stresses, Hook Load and Torque was carried out based on the planned survey data. From the study, {{it was found that the}} Torque at higher Friction Factor will cross the limit of make-up torque which may cause the failure of the drill string. Based on the simulation the real time Hook Load and Torque data were monitored. The monitoring results investigated indication of higher Torque in real time for which Lubricant was added in the mud to reduce the Torque in safe limit.

40|$|To {{meet the}} growing demand of energy consumption, oil {{companies}} are trying their best to produce oil. However, {{in the past few}} years, the oil price has kept going down and dampened the whole industry. On one side, oil companies need to satisfy the requirement from the market, on the other hand, they have to keep proper focus on their own growth. Drilling operations, especially offshore are costly. Reducing non-productive time (NPT) will save money. The NPT is influenced by downhole restrictions during <b>tripping</b> <b>in</b> and <b>out.</b> Real time drilling data (RTDD) is used to monitor the drilling operations. According to the information obtained through RTDD, downhole restrictions can be detected in advance. Taking proper counter measures as early as possible will avoid restrictions and decrease NPT, thus decrease the cost. Hookload is an important RTDD parameter. This parameter tells us that how much force in total is applied on the hook. Especially while <b>tripping</b> <b>out</b> through curved sections, hookload is an important parameter for monitoring downhole restriction such as stuck pipe and uncleaned borehole. Predicting normal hookload in curved section with side forces is the topic of this thesis. To reach this goal, both experiment and simulation work will be performed and evaluated. In the experimental part, a well in the real world, the oil field, was downscaled to lab scale so that a proper physical model could be installed in the workshop. Based on the downscaling calculation, the setup is designed and a 2 D setup draft was drawn. This setup could satisfy current experimental requirements. Meanwhile, the design also considered future research. With proper adjustment, the setup can test hookload with circulation, cutting transportation, and 3 D <b>tripping</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> the simulation part, several friction models and torque-drag models were investigated and introduced. The mechanism of side force was also analyzed based on soft string model and stiff string model. A 2 D discrete static model was derived. This model could calculate drag force <b>in</b> <b>tripping</b> <b>out</b> considering side force <b>in</b> curved pipe. This static model had a general formula which could be applied in arbitrary well sections. A case study showed it had the same accuracy as classic soft string models. A 2 D discrete dynamic model was derived. This model also considered side force in curved section. A case study showed that this dynamic model was valid and could create reasonable simulated hookload. A future step will be to use experimental results for adjusting and verifying this mathematical model...|$|R

Airlines using a bidline system to award crew work schedules require additional reserves to cover scheduling conflicts, which result <b>in</b> <b>trips</b> dropping <b>out</b> of optimized bidlines. When-ever reserves are unavailable to cover these trips during daily operations, the airline has to pay a premium to cover these trips using regular pilots.
