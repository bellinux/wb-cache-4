Conversations between the group began before December 2005, when they elaborated the first themes, and songwriting and recording began in earnest in February. The discussion turned to how Jackson was feeling during the recording of her third studio album Control in 1986. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on in}} her life then that I just thought her album should be called that", Dupri said. Jam agreed, saying it made sense as a concept because it meant a sense of rejuvenation for her. A sense of that excitement that people have when they are 20 years old, when their life are beginning. He finished saying Jackson had that same sense of hunger and excitement than she had when she was younger. Jackson wanted to create an R and dance album, but with an emphasis on dance. Rather than contribute to separate songs for the album, Dupri Jam and Lewis decided to collaborate. According to the group, the process caused ego and procedural conflicts, but they complimented each other. Jam said: [...] "The great thing about working with Jermaine, he came in with total respect for us, we had total respect for him. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were fans of each other and for Janet". The singer stated, ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You must think," [...] he said, laughing, [...] "that we are over-particular; but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> value Clementina rather highly, {{and we wish}} to be {{sure that}} your hospitable offer will be for her real good." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, sir, it <b>is</b> not <b>that.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Anna Parsons, Miss Greendale's maid, you know, and I, {{have settled}} to get married, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I!" [...] Beatrice answered, {{opening her}} eyes. [...] "I have no wishes in the matter. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are poor, and let lodgings--that {{is what it}} comes to. If {{you think they will}} suit you, you are quite right to take them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. Think of {{all that}} he has had to bear! Well, Mr. Belton, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not so well off as we used to be, and are obliged to live in a very quiet way. You will not mind that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAREST FRIENDS," [...] it ran, [...] "Gabriel and I have grieved {{to think}} how {{concerned}} you must be at having neither heard from nor seen us. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are compelled {{to remain in the}} house. And this compulsion is not physical but moral.|$|E

60|$|We dress far too heavily. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{would be}} a much {{healthier}} people if we wore less clothing.

"Ah, Mafuta," [...] replied Tom with a smile, [...] "you're a happy man? <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> civilised people lead {{artificial}} lives, {{to a large}} extent, and, therefore, {{require a}} change sometimes to recruit our energies--that is, to put us right again, whereas {{you and your friends}} live in a natural way, and therefore don't require putting right.

6000|$|... "Indeed I don't know," [...] replied Aileen, {{looking up}} with a smile as she brushed away the two tears which the mention of their {{distress}} had forced into her eyes. [...] "Papa says it was owing to the mismanagement of a head clerk and the dishonesty of a foreign agent, but whatever the cause, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are ruined.

6000|$|... "There {{was just}} such an informality {{in the terms of}} the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely {{conditional}} recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are very different sort of men, and that he hates me." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had {{absolutely}} incompatible dispositions and habits {{of thought and}} action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated the incompatibility. At Halliford I had already come to hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind. His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and intensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together, and I verily believe that {{to the very end}} this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities. He ate more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their pit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals. He slept little.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{can tell}} {{that we do not}} live under a very terrible tyranny, Monsieur de Laval,' said he, 'or we should hardly venture to discuss our ruler so frankly. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have said nothing which he would not have listened to with {{pleasure}} and perhaps with approval. He has his little frailties, or he would not be human, but take his qualities as a ruler and I would ask you if there has ever been a man who has justified the choice of a nation so completely. He works harder than any of his subjects. He is a general beloved by his soldiers. He is a master beloved by his servants. He never has a holiday, and he is always ready for his work. There is not under the roof of the Tuileries a more abstemious eater or drinker. He educated his brothers at his own expense when he was a very poor man, and he has caused even his most distant relatives to share in his prosperity. In a word, he is economical, hard-working, and temperate. We read in the London papers about this Prince of Wales, Monsieur de Laval, and I do not think that he comes very well out of the comparison.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... § XXIII. But be this as it may, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{are never}} tired of contemplating this woven involution; and that, in some degree, the sublime {{pleasure}} which we have in watching the branches of trees, the intertwining of the grass, and the tracery of the higher clouds, is owing to it, not less than that which we receive from the fine meshes of the robe, the braiding of the hair, and the various glittering of the linked net or wreathed chain. Byzantine ornamentation, like that of almost all nations {{in a state of}} progress, is full of this kind of work: but it occurs most conspicuously, though most simply, in the minute traceries which surround their most solid capitals; sometimes merely in a reticulated veil, as in the tenth figure in the Plate, sometimes resembling a basket, on the edges of which are perched birds and other animals. The diamonded ornament in the eleventh figure is substituted for it in the Casa Loredan, and marks a somewhat later time and a tendency to the ordinary Gothic chequer; but the capitals which show it most definitely are those already so often spoken of as the lily capitals of St. Mark's, of which the northern one is carefully drawn in Plate IX.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; the {{stationer}} and printer, {{and one or}} two of <b>the</b> agents. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money, {{which should}} have satisfied them, has been frittered away uselessly." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Florence had hurried {{her a good}} deal, because Mr. Wingfield was to {{show them}} the rosettes the horses were to wear on the wedding-day.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{would be}} useless at present, seeing that we cannot bring {{ourselves}} {{to believe it}} possible that a foreigner should in any respect be wiser than ourselves. If any such point out to us our follies, we at once claim those follies as the special evidences of our wisdom. We are so self-satisfied with our own customs, that we hold up our hands with surprise at the fatuity of men who presume {{to point out to}} us their defects. Those practices in which we most widely depart from the broad and recognised morality of all civilised ages and countries are to us the Palladiums of our jurisprudence. Modes of proceeding which, if now first proposed to us, would be thought to come direct from the devil, have been made so sacred by time that they have lost all the horror of their falseness in the holiness of their age. We cannot understand that other nations look upon such doings as we regard the human sacrifices of the Brahmins; but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> drive a Juggernaut's car through every assize town in the country, three times a year, and allow it to be dragged ruthlessly through the streets of the metropolis at all times and seasons. Now come back to breakfast, for I won't wait here any longer." [...] Seeing that these were the ideas of Felix Graham, it is hardly a matter of wonder that such men as Mr. Furnival and Mr. Round should have regarded his success at the bar as doubtful.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Bingham,--I {{have not}} seen you since Monday {{to thank you for}} the {{magnificent}} speech you made on that night. Allow me to add my congratulations to those of everybody else. As you know, the Under Secretaryship of the Home Office is vacant. On behalf of my colleagues and myself I write to ask if you will consent to fill it for a time, for we do not in any way consider that the post is one commensurate with your abilities. It will, however, serve to give you practical experience of administration, and us the advantage of your great talents to an even larger extent than we now enjoy. For the future, it must of course take care of itself; but, as you know, Sir ----'s health is not all that could be desired, and the other day he {{told me that it was}} doubtful if he would be able to carry on the duties of the Attorney-Generalship for very much longer. In view of this contingency I venture to suggest that you would do well to apply for silk as soon as possible. I have spoken to the Lord Chancellor about it, and he says that there will be no difficulty, as although you have only been in active practice for so short a while, you have a good many years' standing as a barrister. Or if this prospect does not please doubtless some other opening to the Cabinet can be found in time. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot in our own interest overlook you for long." ...|$|E
60|$|After all, {{what the}} {{imitative}} arts really give us are merely the various styles of particular artists, or of certain schools of artists. Surely you don't {{imagine that the}} people of the Middle Ages bore any resemblance at all to the figures on mediaeval stained glass, or in mediaeval stone and wood carving, or on mediaeval metal-work, or tapestries, or illuminated MSS. They were probably very ordinary-looking people, with nothing grotesque, or remarkable, or fantastic in their appearance. The Middle Ages, as we know them in art, are simply a definite form of style, {{and there is no reason}} at all why an artist with this style should not be produced in the nineteenth century. No great artist ever sees things as they really are. If he did, he would cease to be an artist. Take an example from our own day. I know that you are fond of Japanese things. Now, do you really imagine that the Japanese people, as they are presented to us in art, have any existence? If you do, you have never understood Japanese art at all. The Japanese people are the deliberate self-conscious creation of certain individual artists. If you set a picture by Hokusai, or Hokkei, or any of the great native painters, beside a real Japanese gentleman or lady, you will see that there is not the slightest resemblance between them. The actual people who live in Japan are not unlike the general run of English people; that is to say, they are extremely commonplace, and have nothing curious or extraordinary about them. In fact the whole of Japan is a pure invention. There is no such country, there are no such people. One of our most charming painters {3} went recently to the Land of the Chrysanthemum in the foolish hope of seeing the Japanese. All he saw, all he had the chance of painting, were a few lanterns and some fans. He was quite unable to discover the inhabitants, as his delightful exhibition at Messrs. Dowdeswell's Gallery showed only too well. He did not know that the Japanese people are, as I have said, simply a mode of style, an exquisite fancy of art. And so, if you desire to see a Japanese effect, you will not behave like a tourist and go to Tokio. On the contrary, you will stay at home and steep yourself in the work of certain Japanese artists, and then, when you have absorbed the spirit of their style, and caught their imaginative manner of vision, you will go some afternoon and sit in the Park or stroll down Piccadilly, and if you cannot see an absolutely Japanese effect there, you will not see it anywhere. Or, to return again to the past, take as another instance the ancient Greeks. Do you think that Greek art ever tells us what the Greek people were like? Do you believe that the Athenian women were like the stately dignified figures of the Parthenon frieze, or like those marvellous goddesses who sat in the triangular pediments of the same building? If you judge from the art, they certainly were so. But read an authority, like Aristophanes, for instance. You will find that the Athenian ladies laced tightly, wore high-heeled shoes, dyed their hair yellow, painted and rouged their faces, and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallen creature of our own day. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> look back on the ages entirely through the medium of art, and art, very fortunately, has never once told us the truth.--The Decay of Lying.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{announcement}} of Dorothea's changed condition caused no small disturbance within me, and I expressed {{it in the}} abrupt manner mentioned by young Blake.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think a {{great deal}} about her," [...] said the squire. [...] "But that does not much matter now. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> she has {{declined}} Bernard's offer." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> {{all very}} well in an {{abstract}} point of view; but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> in practice, <b>the</b> more I didn't want to listen, the more I heard.|$|R
