5|$|In {{preparation}} of the storm, a high surf advisory and a tropical storm watch were issued for the Hawaiian Islands. Officials urged residents <b>to</b> <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> supplies and they closed beaches. Even though the Central Pacific Hurricane Center remarked that that watch will likely be upgraded into a hurricane warning, this failed to occur; instead, the watch was discontinued on July 20 because meteorologists were now expecting the storm to pass south of the island chain.|$|E

By the following day, all warnings and advisories for Atlantic Canada were dropped as Bertha dissipated.|$|E

Entry costs for the Nation War differ depending on the War instance's level range and may be refunded depending on the player's total score, as well as whether the faction is victorious or not. Players are also awarded special consumable items for their performance that they can sell on NPC shops, in which the rarest and most valuable of these will be worth a large sum of Alz. Characters may remain Neutral if they so wish, not completing the Nation quest for as long as they prefer. This will, however, restrict access to Nation War features until the player chooses a Nation for their character.|$|R
5000|$|Fort Worth {{became the}} westernmost {{railhead}} and a transit point for cattle shipment. With the city's main focus on cattle and the railroads, local businessman, Louville Niles, formed the Fort Worth Stockyards Company in 1893. Shortly thereafter, {{the two biggest}} cattle-slaughtering firms at the time, Armour and Swift, both established operations in the new stockyards.With the boom times came a variety of entertainments and related problems. Fort Worth {{had a knack for}} separating cattlemen from their money. Cowboys took full advantage of their last brush with civilization before the long drive on the Chisholm Trail from Fort Worth up north <b>to</b> Kansas. They <b>stocked</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> provisions from local merchants, visited the colorful saloons for a bit of gambling and carousing, then galloped northward with their cattle only to whoop it <b>up</b> again <b>on</b> their way back.

5|$|Mexican {{officials}} {{issued a}} tropical storm warning 37hours prior to the storm's landfall between Chetumal and Cabo Catoche, Quintana Roo. The warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning about a day before landfall, but was downgraded when Claudette weakened just 13hours prior to its landfall in the Yucatán Peninsula. The Mexican government {{declared a state of}} emergency in the projected path of the storm, and declared an evacuation order for 1,500 citizens in Quintana Roo. There, residents remained calm during the evacuation. Tourists left nightclubs for supermarkets <b>to</b> <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on,</b> among other items, beer, which was banned at midnight. Schools were set up as shelters, while police forced tourists to remain in their hotels.|$|E

September 26, 2012 Increasing signs of feeding injury from the stink bug complex observed on late season varieties including Red Delicious, Gala, Fuji and Golden Delicious in the Mid- Hudson Valley Over {{the past two}} weeks we have been seeing an increase in feeding injury from the complex of both the native species (predominately green stink bug) and the invasive brown marmorated stink bug on red and yellow colored varieties. As injury does not express itself immediately on the fruit, apple recently fed upon by the SB complex will likely be harvested and stored without blemish, only to find the same fruit with very high levels of fruit damage after its removal from cold storage. Efforts should be made to manage this insect complex prior to harvest. Trapping efforts throughout the Hudson Valley have documented the presence of brown marmorated stink bug since late April. However, its presence in border trees or even in traps has not, up until late August, been a sign of BMSB presence in orchards causing feeding damage.

5|$|Governments {{across the}} eastern Caribbean issued {{hurricane}} warnings {{as far south}} as Montserrat. In Anguilla, residents near the coast were advised to evacuate. Schools closed ahead of the storm, and the ferry between the island and Saint Martin was halted and moved to a safe location. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the National Emergency Management Agency was activated on November16. Officials there advised residents living near ghauts to evacuate, and one shelter was located in each district of the country. In addition, stores were open for longer hours to allow people <b>to</b> <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> supplies. Most businesses and schools were closed in Antigua and Barbuda during the storm, while in Dominica, the airport was closed.

5|$|Following the {{identification}} of a tropical disturbance on November6, a level four Typhoon Condition of Readiness (TCOR), {{the lowest level of}} alert, was raised for Guam. By November8, three days prior to Karen's arrival, this was raised to level three, prompting residents and military personnel <b>to</b> <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> supplies. A public announcement was made that day as well, warning residents that the typhoon would likely strike the island. At 9:00p.m. on November10 (11:00UTC), a level two TCOR was put in place for Guam and a typhoon emergency was declared. Buildings were boarded up and emergency supplies were distributed. By 8:00a.m. (22:00UTC on November10), this was raised to level one, the highest level of warning. At this time, the USS Haverfield, USS Brister, USS Wandank, and USS Banner sought refuge from the storm over open waters. All personnel on the island were ordered to evacuate to typhoon-proof shelters and emergency rations were prepared. Strategic air command planes stationed on the island were relocated to avoid damage. Many residents on the island sought refuge in government buildings designed to withstand powerful storms while others evacuated to Wake Island. Roughly 24hours after the typhoon's passage, all warnings were discontinued.|$|E

The roles of these sites were generally to provide a location for soldiers <b>to</b> <b>stock</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> supplies, receive medical treatment, or become discharged.
