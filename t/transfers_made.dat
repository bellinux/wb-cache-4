5|$|A 300-page iPhone {{bill from}} AT Mobility mailed {{in a box}} {{was the subject of}} a viral video made by YouTube {{personality}} Justine Ezarik, best known as iJustine, which became an Internet meme in August 2007. Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data <b>transfers</b> <b>made</b> during the billing period, including every email and text message. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media.|$|E

500|$|What {{followed}} {{was a period}} of uncertainty regarding exactly who would and would not {{be a part of the}} merged team. Leopard Trek had 27 riders under contract for 2012 and Team RadioShack had 13 [...] UCI rules impose a hard limit of 30 riders on top-level teams, meaning at least ten riders with valid contracts would be released from them. Leopard Trek riders were not told about the merger ahead of time and were unsure of their status at a time when riders everywhere looked to conclusively determine their places of employment for the upcoming season. The situation was further complicated by two rider <b>transfers</b> <b>made</b> in August, when Ben Hermans and Grégory Rast signed with Leopard Trek away from Team RadioShack, meaning they had effectively re-joined the team they had only just left. The new team also signed four riders who had not been a member of either side in 2011. This resulted in 12 riders departing for other teams, with 13 incoming from Team RadioShack's 2011 formation (that number including Hermans and Rast) and 12 riders being retained from Leopard Trek's 2011 formation. The fused team announced its new name as RadioShack-Nissan-Trek, though UCI rules limit registry to two title sponsors, meaning their name in the official UCI record is RadioShack-Nissan.|$|E

500|$|Corzine was subpoenaed {{to appear}} before a House {{committee}} on December 8, 2011, to answer questions regarding 1.2 billion dollars of missing money from MF Global client accounts. He testified before the committee, [...] "I simply {{do not know where}} the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date", and that given the number of money transfers {{in the final days of}} trading at MF Global, he didn't know specifics of the movement of the funds. He also denied authorizing any misuse of customer funds. In March 2012, Bloomberg reported on a memo produced by congressional investigators that quoted an internal company e-mail relating to a $175 million transfer which was a subject of their investigation. Initial media reports suggested impropriety on Mr. Corzine's part, but this was later disproved. According to the New York Times, the employee responsible for the transfer e-mailed Mr. Corzine stating the transfer was a [...] "House Wire", meaning it came from the firm's own account. The instructions Mr. Corzine had given were to deal with several overdrafts at JPMorgan Chase, but never related to any specific accounts or specific <b>transfers</b> <b>made.</b> A spokesperson for Mr. Corzine responded that Corzine [...] "never directed Ms. O’Brien or anyone else regarding which account should be used to cure the overdrafts, and he never directed that customer funds should be used for that purpose. Nor was he informed that customer funds had been used for that purpose." [...] In fact, as the New York Times reported, Mr. Corzine had been given specific assurances that the transfer in question was proper, and that no customer funds had been used. Subsequent court filings also attest to this fact. On November 5, 2013 The New York Times reported that MF Global customers would likely recover 100 percent of their funds. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine said [...] "Mr. Corzine is very pleased that all customers will receive a full recovery. This is a great outcome, which has been anticipated for many months." [...] Customers have since received distributions making them whole.|$|E

The same day, Le Canard enchaîné revealed that Fillon had failed to declare to the HATVP a €50,000 loan from Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, president of the Revue des deux Mondes. The UDI renewed its support for Fillon that evening, albeit only conditionally. On 13 March, Le Parisien revealed that investigators discovered suspicious wire <b>transfers</b> <b>made</b> by Marie and Charles Fillon to their father while employed by him, with Marie returning €33,000 of the €46,000 she was paid. Charles Fillon, in his hearing, referred to similar transfers to his parents' joint account, worth about 30% of his salary.|$|E
