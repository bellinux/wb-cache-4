5|$|Maryland's {{special teams}} {{recorded}} one touchdown when Torrey Smith returned a kickoff for 99yards. After the first touchdown of the game, senior placekicker Obi Egekeze missed an extra {{point for the}} first time in his career. Early in the season, Egekeze missed his first five field goal attempts, but, prior to the Humanitarian Bowl, he had made all 64extra-point attempts of his career. After the first failed kick, Egekeze made the other five extra-point attempts of the game. The placekicker also erred when he attempted to kick the ball as it fell off <b>the</b> <b>tee,</b> resulting in a short 15-yard kick which was returned 36yards by Nevada to the Maryland nine-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee {{won that}} {{ceremonial}} coin toss and chose {{to kick off}} to begin the game, ensuring the Volunteers received the ball to begin the second half. Tennessee placekicker Chad Cunningham delivered the ball from <b>the</b> <b>tee,</b> and Virginia Tech's Dyrell Roberts returned it to the Tech 26-yard line, where Virginia Tech began the game's first offensive drive. Two running plays by Tech's Ryan Williams gained 4 yards, then Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed a seven-yard pass for the game's initial first down. Tech advanced as far as its 43-yard line, but a five-yard false-start penalty prevented the Hokies from gaining another first down. They punted the ball to Tennessee, which began its first drive of the game from its 11-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Three {{positions}} {{are specific to}} the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, a holder {{may be used in}} certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on <b>the</b> <b>tee.</b> The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).|$|E
5000|$|... 11-4 - Teeing {{off from}} outside <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground {{is not a}} penalty in match play, but the {{opponent}} may require the stroke be cancelled and replayed from within <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground. Teeing off from outside <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground is a two-stroke penalty in stroke play and a ball must then be played from <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> area. <b>The</b> stroke made from outside <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> area and subsequent strokes made at that ball do not count.|$|R
50|$|Through 2008, <b>the</b> black <b>tees</b> (then <b>the</b> gold <b>tees),</b> {{measured}} only 6888 yards. Other than holes 1, 8, 13, and 18, all holes had new tee boxes {{built for}} <b>the</b> then gold <b>tees.</b> In many cases when the holes were extended, <b>the</b> blue <b>tees</b> {{were moved to}} where <b>the</b> former gold <b>tees</b> were, and <b>the</b> white <b>tees</b> moved to where <b>the</b> blue <b>tees</b> used to stand. In fact, <b>the</b> blue <b>tees</b> used to measure 6429 yards, and <b>the</b> white <b>tees</b> measured 5853 yards. <b>The</b> red <b>tees,</b> however, have always stood where they do today.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the changes, from <b>the</b> {{championship}} <b>tees,</b> <b>the</b> course measured 7360 yd and had {{a rating}} of 77.0/153. From <b>the</b> blue <b>tees,</b> <b>the</b> course measures 7010 yd and has a rating of 75.4/150. From <b>the</b> gold <b>tees,</b> <b>the</b> course measures 6646 yd and has a rating of 73.7/146. From <b>the</b> white <b>tees,</b> <b>the</b> course measures 6204 yd and has a rating of 71.8/142 for men and 77.2/144 for women. From <b>the</b> red <b>tees,</b> <b>the</b> course measures 5690 yd and has a rating of 74.3/138 for women.|$|R
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off <b>the</b> <b>tee.</b> This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw {{the ball into the}} end zone, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The game {{started with}} Maryland {{receiving}} the kick-off {{and on the}} first series, quarterback Chris Turner linked up with freshman Adrian Cannon for a 59-yard touchdown. However, placekicker Obi Egekeze missed the extra point. Nevada quarterback and Western Athletic Conference offensive player of the year, Colin Kaepernick, responded with a drive which included a 68-yard pass to the Maryland 3-yard line. The Terrapin defense stopped two rushing attempts by Vai Taua, but a short pass {{was good for the}} score, and with the extra point, Nevada took the lead 6–7. The Wolf Pack then kicked a 69-yard kick-off to Torrey Smith, who returned it 99yards for a second Maryland touchdown. Egekeze made good the extra point and Maryland regained the lead, 13–7. On the next kick-off, Egekeze attempted to kick the ball as it fell off <b>the</b> <b>tee,</b> resulting in a short squib, which was returned to the Terrapins' 9-yard line. Kaepernick threw into the endzone where it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate for a touchback, but the Terrapins were soon forced to punt. Kaepernick advanced the ball downfield before a Taua 17-yard touchdown run. In the next series, Maryland sophomore Morgan Green rushed for threeyards and then a 53-yard touchdown breakaway. Later, Turner converted on third down with a 16-yard toss to Ronnie Tyler and threw again to Tyler for a 14-yard touchdown. Turner tallied a two-point conversion with a throw to Davin Meggett, and Maryland led at halftime 28–14.|$|E

5000|$|... 11-1 - A player {{making their}} first stroke {{must do so}} from within <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground, and may use an {{approved}} <b>tee.</b> <b>The</b> player may stand outside <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground to play a ball within it.|$|R
50|$|A {{result of}} the 20-Year Tune Up was the {{addition}} of a new set of <b>tees,</b> <b>the</b> green <b>tees.</b> <b>The</b> green <b>tees</b> are now set up between <b>the</b> blue <b>tees</b> and white tees.|$|R
5000|$|Each tee box has two markers {{showing the}} bounds of <b>the</b> legal <b>tee</b> area. <b>The</b> <b>teeing</b> area spans <b>the</b> {{distance}} between the markers, and extends two-club lengths behind the markers. A golfer may play the ball standing outside <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> area, but <b>the</b> ball itself must be placed and struck from within the area. A golfer may place his ball directly {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> ground (called hitting it [...] "off the deck"), or the ball may be supported by a manufactured tee (limited to a height of four inches), or by any natural substance, such as a mound of sand placed on <b>the</b> <b>teeing</b> surface ...|$|R
25|$|Early {{in the war}} a new {{minefield}} {{was laid}} {{in the mouth of}} the Tyne by the Royal Marines and <b>the</b> <b>TEE.</b> Former submarine miners of <b>the</b> <b>TEE</b> were transferred or recalled, and provided many instructors for the new Royal Marine Submarine Miners, who laid and maintained minefields at anchorages all down the east and Channel coasts of the UK during World War I.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{inconvenient}} {{location of}} Clifford's Fort, the unit also used a small drill hall at Rockcliffe Avenue, Whitley Bay, formerly the HQ of G Company of the disbanded Northern Cyclist Battalion, which <b>the</b> <b>TEE</b> shared with {{a squadron of}} the Northumberland Hussars. In 1927 <b>the</b> <b>TEE</b> exchanged Clifford's Fort for a new site adjoining Tynemouth station, where it built a new HQ.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} duties of <b>the</b> <b>TEE</b> on arrival at Portsmouth was to set up {{telephone}} links. During the war <b>the</b> <b>TEE</b> telephone section based at Milldam Barracks, Portsmouth, became responsible for the entire military telephone system for the Southern Coast Defences, including Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight. The skills of the former submarine miners were employed when a cable linking the sea forts had to be repaired.|$|E
25|$|When the Territorial Force (TF) was {{established}} in 1908, the Electrical Engineers were to have been redesignated Fortress Engineers, but this was rescinded {{in the case of}} London and the Tyne, and the LEE and TEE remained in the order of battle, though <b>the</b> <b>TEE</b> transferred one Electric Light Company to the Durham Fortress Engineers. By January 1914 <b>the</b> <b>TEE</b> had four companies based at North Shields. The unit was known locally as 'The Electricals' or 'The Tynes'.|$|E
