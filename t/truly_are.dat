25|$|Among postmodernist photographers, the Australian Bill Henson {{photographs}} controversial nudes in low-key, Elad David works {{mainly with}} male nudes {{and in some}} of them only the busts – no head – of young men, is highlighted, leaving everything else in pitch black. Another artist who created a series of low-key photos exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world, is the Finnish photographer Juha Arvid Helminen. He names his series The Invisible Empire, and refers to the shield that black colour offers, like a mask between who we <b>truly</b> <b>are</b> and the way society perceives us.|$|E

Brit and Candy carry on, killing Big Arch's gang before confronting and killing Big Arch himself. During the assault and its aftermath, the camera pans over the dead bodies of Big Arch's gang while the girls speak in a voice-over, first heard earlier in the film, {{describing}} the beach's beauty and musing that they have discovered who they <b>truly</b> <b>are.</b> Brit and Candy, silent and wearing pensive, ambiguous expressions, drive home in Big Arch's Lamborghini. A final flashback shows the pair kissing Alien's dead body.|$|E

25|$|If {{the goal}} of shorter-term therapy is for {{patients}} {{to understand that they}} are not the way they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who and what they are as human beings, what they <b>truly</b> <b>are</b> like and what they truly contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.|$|E

500|$|In an 8 November 2002 Slate article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a [...] "trust-fund kid whose {{success at}} school is largely {{attributable}} to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him".

In a 12 August 2007 New York Times review of Deathly Hallows, however, Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for [...] "unmooring" [...] her [...] "English school story" [...] from literary precedents [...] "bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery", arguing that she had instead created [...] "a world of youthful democracy and diversity".|$|E

500|$|They {{sought to}} make Enterprise more {{character}} driven than the previous series in the Star Trek franchise, and hoped that this would gain viewers who had watched The Next Generation but had lost interest with Deep Space Nine and Voyager. It was intended to link the series directly into The Original Series by having T'Pau as a main character, who had previously appeared in the episode [...] "Amok Time". Instead, this character was developed into an original Vulcan character, T'Pol. Berman explained his vision for the series at launch, saying that [...] "we'll be seeing humanity when they <b>truly</b> <b>are</b> going where no man has gone before. We are seeing people who don't take meeting aliens as just {{another part of the}} job. It's not routine. Nothing is routine. Also, by bringing it back 200 years from Voyager, we're making the characters closer to the present, and by doing that they can {{be a little bit more}} accessible and a little bit more flawed and a little bit more familiar to you and me." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle called it his favorite {{episode of the}} show. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that [...] "it's nice to see [...] and Lisa getting along so well for once." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating and commented that [...] "any football fan will love this episode, but the reason {{why it is so}} good is the relationship between Homer and Lisa. The two <b>truly</b> <b>are</b> a father and daughter to one another, causing both laughter and touching emotion in the audience." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Lisa the Greek" [...] is [...] "a chance for Homer and Lisa to bond under less than ideal, but always amusing, circumstances. Oddly, for a show relying on actual events like the Super Bowl to guide its plotline, it doesn't have [...] retread feeling.|$|E

2500|$|The later Buddhist {{tradition}} considers ignorance (avidya) to be {{the root}} cause of samsara. Avidya is misconception and ignorance about reality, leading to grasping and clinging, and repeated rebirth. According to Paul Williams, [...] "it is the not-knowingness of things as they <b>truly</b> <b>are,</b> or of oneself as one really is." [...] It can be overcome by insight into the true nature of reality. In the later Buddhist tradition [...] "liberating insight" [...] came to be regarded as equally liberating as the practice of dhyana. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this happened in response to other religious groups in India, who held that a liberating insight was an indispensable requisite for moksha, liberation from rebirth.|$|E

2500|$|In {{genetics}} and developmental biology, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a laboratory strategy {{for creating a}} viable embryo from a body cell and an egg cell. The technique consists of taking an enucleated oocyte (egg cell) and implanting a donor nucleus from a somatic (body) cell. It is used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning. Dolly the Sheep became famous for being the first successful case of the reproductive cloning of a mammal. [...] "Therapeutic cloning" [...] refers to the potential use of SCNT in regenerative medicine; this approach has been championed as {{an answer to the}} many issues concerning embryonic stem cells (ESC) and the destruction of viable embryos for medical use, though questions remain on how homologous the two cell types <b>truly</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Other {{differences}} {{to the character}} were made, such as giving him the psychic ability to see [...] "half-breeds" [...] as they <b>truly</b> <b>are.</b> That ability, in the film, is what caused him to attempt suicide and which led to his damnation rather than his role in summoning a demon that killed a young girl. The resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the film was also amended; Lucifer saves the redeemed Constantine {{to give him a}} second chance at falling rather than being tricked into doing so as was seen in the comic book. Scenes with actress Michelle Monaghan as Constantine's lover, a half-breed demon named Ellie based on the succubus Ellie in the Hellblazer comics, were cut from the film to make Constantine more of a lonely character.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{there is}} a {{question}} about how separate from the idea of -genes birth and begetting the cited uses of monogenes in the sense of [...] "unique" [...] <b>truly</b> <b>are.</b> For example, the ending -genes is arguably not redundant even in the sense of [...] "only" [...] as per when Clement of Rome (96 AD), and later Origen, Cyril and others, employ monogenes to describe the rebirth of the phoenix. At issue is whether Clement is merely stressing monos unique, or using monogenes to indicate unique in its method of rebirth, or possibly {{that there is only one}} single bird born and reborn. Likewise in Plato's Timaeus, the [...] "only-begotten and created Heaven", is still unique in how it is begotten, in comparison to the begetting of animals and men, just as Earth and Heaven give birth to Ocean and Tethys. Of the Liddell Scott references for [...] "unique" [...] (monogenes being used purely as monos) that leaves only Parmenides, which (as above) is no longer considered a likely reading of the Greek text.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{this record}} was {{intended}} to be a double album, but Atlantic Records didn’t like the idea, so it was trimmed down to 17 songs. The album was then going to have spoken tracks in-between all the songs but that was scrapped also. The final version scrapped the 17th song [...] "Larry Elbows" [...] and erased all the spoken tracks except for the intro to Jesus Saves. The cover had the story explained in it {{to make up for the}} lost spoken tracks. Atlantic somehow over the years managed to lose the master tapes to Streets so the left over songs <b>truly</b> <b>are</b> lost. Many of the riffs from these songs showed up on the next album Edge of Thorns. Another interesting detail about the album is that [...] "Jesus Saves" [...] was originally written as a midtempo song, not the rocker it became on the finished album. In 2013, some of the lost material was found and the album was re-issued with the title: Streets: A Rock Opera - Narrated Version.|$|E
