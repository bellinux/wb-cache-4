The main purpose of the present work is to build and validate a numerical model of human head in order to evaluate pressure and stress distributions in bones and brain tissues due to impact. Geometrical characteristics for the finite element model have been extracted from CT and MRI scanner images, while material mechanical characteristics have been taken from literature. The model is validated by comparing the numerical results and the experimental results obtained by Nahum in 1977. The proposed numerical model is promising even if some quantitative differences with the experimental results can be found {{due to the fact that}} all the inner organs are considered as a continuum (without sliding interfaces or fluid elements) and due to the geometrical difference between the head used in the experimental test and the head used as reference to build the numerical model.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} job turnover and {{labour market}} adjustment {{activities in the}} Ontario economy from 1978 to 1993. The following highlights the major findings. Both the permanent layoff rate and the <b>total</b> <b>permanent</b> separation rate vary substantially from one industry to another. In 1992, the <b>permanent</b> layoff and <b>total</b> <b>permanent</b> separation rates ranged from 27. 3 % and 34. 2 % in construction to only 1. 4 % and 9. 3 % in public services, respectively. The permanent layoff rate and the <b>total</b> <b>permanent</b> separation rate also differ noticeably by gender, age and firm size - in most industries, the rates are higher among male workers than among females, higher among younger workers, and higher among smaller employers. While the permanent layoff rate increases during business cycle downturns and decreases during business cycle upswings, the reverse trend is observed with the <b>total</b> <b>permanent</b> separation rate. This is because the quit rate and the other permanent separation rate both decline during downturns and rise during upswings, more than offsetting the opposite trend associated with the permanent layoff rate. These univariate-tabulation findings are confirmed in the multi-variate logistic regression results on the statistical determinants of <b>permanent</b> layoffs and <b>total</b> <b>permanent</b> separations. In most industries, after controlling for gender, age, firm size and time periods, the estimated likelihood of permanent layoffs is lower among female workers, decreases significantly with age and firm size, increases during recessions and decreases during recovery and expansion in most industries. The patterns of estimated incidence of <b>total</b> <b>permanent</b> separations {{are very similar to}} those of permanent layoffs except that <b>total</b> <b>permanent</b> separations decline during business cycle downturns and climb during business cycle upswings. Permanently separated workers have had a much more difficult time in finding employment during the most recent recession than any other time in the past 15 years. Almost 40 % of those who lost or left a job in 1989 did not have a job in 1993. This is in marked contrast with the experience of the early 1980 s, when 29 % of permanently separated workers were jobless 3 years after the separation. A very similar trend is found when the analysis is applied to labour market transitions among permanently laid-off workers. There {{is a great deal of}} out-of-province migration among permanently separated workers who did find a job. Nearly 45 % of those who lost or left a job in 1989 and found a job in 1993 were employed outside of Ontario. An identical proportion of permanently laid-off workers is found to be employed in other provinces. There is tremendous inter-industrial mobility among permanently separated workers who found employment in Ontario. Less than 44 % of those separated from a job in 1989 and found employment in 1993 in Ontario have remained in the same industry. Inter-industrial mobility is even greater among permaEmployment and unemployment, Labour, Labour mobility, turnover and work absences, Work transitions and life stages...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{the most}} common {{musculoskeletal}} disease worldwide. OA, and especially knee osteoarthritis, is a condition of high socio-economic impact in terms of drug spending, hospital admissions, work absences and temporary or <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity.</b> The aim of this research is to evaluate literature on the efficacy of SPA-therapy (mud-pack therapy and/or bath therapy) in the management of knee osteoarthritis. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on SPA-therapy in the treatment of knee. A total of 1044 patients were enrolled in the aforementioned studies, of which 582 belonged to experimental groups while 462 belonged to control groups. The main methods used for clinical assessment were: VAS, WOMAC, Lequesne’s Index, MCII, AIMS and SF- 36. Statistical analysis was performed using common tests. In particular, due to the effect of spa-therapy in the patients participating in the research, the score of VAS, Lequesne's Index, and the three different WOMAC indices were respectively decreased compared to the initial value with a statistically significant difference. The research confirms that by spa therapy is possible to obtain good results for pain, articular function and quality of life with reduction of disabling consequences in affected patients...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} whether {{the different types of}} book-tax differences are useful for predicting the future income of publicly traded companies in five Latin American countries. This is possible since these differences convey information about transitory components of income, which can be used by investors for predicting future income. However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between tax variables and companies' future results. The sample analyzed here is composed of 580 publicly traded companies from five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru) with information available in the Economatica(r) database covering 2002 to 2013. In terms of methodology, regressions are employed in order to find a connection between the different types (<b>total,</b> <b>permanent,</b> temporary, and the negative and positive variations) of book-tax differences and companies' current and future earnings per share, as well as some control variables suggested by previous literature. The model's coefficients were estimated through panel data techniques: fixed effects. The results obtained suggest that the information gathered in the different types of book-tax differences (<b>total,</b> <b>permanent,</b> temporary, positive and negative variations) is relevant in predicting future income. <b>Total,</b> <b>permanent</b> and temporary differences contribute to the uncertainty in future income prediction, given that results are more transitory and less persistent in years with higher book-tax differences. Positive and negative variations, on the other hand, attribute higher income in coming years to greater variations in book-tax differences, representing increased timeliness of results and a reduction in off balance sheet funding for the publicly traded companies from these countries...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Blast-induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) {{is one of the}} causes of death or <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity</b> which can occur unexpectedly in both military and civilian populations. This study set out to conduct a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian computational analysis of the interaction between a single planar blast wave and a human head in order to assess the extent of intra-cranial shock wave generation and its potential for causing {{traumatic brain}} injury. Materials and Methods: To investigate the mechanical response of human brain to blast waves and to identify the injury mechanisms of TBI, a three-dimensional finite elementhead model consisting of the scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain was developed from the imaging data of a human head. The mechanical properties of brain tissue were obtained from the literature. Results: Throughout the loading regime, CSF acted as a protective layer for brain tissue by absorbing shear strain energy. Biomechanical loading of the brain was governed by direct wave transmission, structural deformations, and wave reflections from tissue-material interfaces. Conclusion: The brain experiences a complex set of direct and indirect loadings emanating from different sources (reflections from tissue interfaces and skull deformation) at different points of time. The flow dynamics strongly depend on geometry (shape, curvature) and structure (flexural rigidity, thickness) of a specimen and should be considered in understanding biomechanical loading pattern...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Alcoholism is a multifactorial, genetically {{influenced}} disorder. It is a {{major health}} and social issue, a highly frequent disease and a cause of premature death. It {{is also the most}} expensive addictive disorder due to morbidity, mortality, societal and legal problems. Besides their involvement in alcohol-related fatalities, forensic scientists are also required to assess driving and working ability as well as <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity</b> due to alcohol-related conditions. Greater knowledge of the genetic basis of alcoholism could improve prevention by identifying specific risk factors and mechanisms, leading to effective therapeutic strategies and eventually to personalized treatments. Methods: This overview of the recent scientific literature on the genetic basis of alcoholism summarizes the analytical strategies currently applied to the identification of candidate genes involved in alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) and discusses some genes and related phenotypes that have been shown to influence the risk of alcoholism. Results: Alcoholism is a complex heterogeneous genetic disease. It is a quantitative disorder, in which the combined incidence of multiple genetic factors and environmental factors varies from one subject to another. Family, twin and adoption studies indicate that 50 – 60 % of the risk of alcoholism is due to genetic factors. Risk loci for AUDs include both genes involved in alcohol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as genes moderating neurophysiological responses such as impulsivity, disinhibition, sensation-seeking and externalizing behaviours. Alcoholism also co-exists with other addictions an...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} German miners' model of mutual {{insurance}} from its introduction in 1854 to its basic reformation in 1923. Its core feature was {{the provision of}} cash benefits for compensation of income losses due to temporary sickness and <b>permanent</b> <b>invalidity</b> or death of the bread-winner. The carriers of the insurance scheme, the Knappschaften, date back to medieval times, and the Knappschaft is still present today as the second pillar of the German statutory old-age insurance. This paper aims to establish the Knappschaft insurance's main characteristics in the period under consideration. These include, for example, compulsory membership, shared financing between employed miners and entrepreneurs, selfmanagement, financing based on earnings-related social insurance contributions, a strong emphasis of the insurance principle, and application of the pay-as-you-go mechanism. The organisational analysis is complemented quantitatively, on the one hand, by evidence on increasing generosity and, on the other hand, evidence on increasing financial distress substantiating the shadow side of a maturing pay-as-you-go based scheme. In particular, Knappschaften experienced all trends we commonly associate with today's systems {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century as early as in the 19 th century, even before the Bismarckian insurance was installed from 1883 on: Increasing social security spending, rising pensioners-tocontributors ratios, concentration and pressure on finances forcing Knappschaften to adjust their fiscal policy according to the mechanics of pay-as-you-go.
