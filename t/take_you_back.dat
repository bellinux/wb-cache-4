25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to area B, but going south from area B did not <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles {{for the sake of}} puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E

She wrote, [...] "The film has a few moments, which will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to good old days of Mohanlal film. If you are a Mohanlal fan, the film will be a feast for you and Arun Vaidyanathan has nailed a good {{political}} satire for this festive season." [...] Aswin J. Kumar of The Times of India also gave the film three out of five stars: [...] "The attempt at political satire in this film is feeble, mindless and boring. It's more like a mask over disfigurement, for there is hardly any scope for satire in a narrative riddled with superfluous acts of a star who has begun {{to show signs of}} insecurity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Let me <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> to {{the winter}} of 1938: then as a young man, full of hope and {{ambition}} to play cricket for my county, I travelled from my place {{of work in the}} City of London to a sports complex at Leytonstone where Jack O'Connor and Stan Nichols looked after the cricketing side of the organisation. Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county. It was, in effect, a planned exercise, designed to make things happen, which continued right through to the spring of 1939 when I was finally invited to a trial at Woodford Wells. The planned exercise worked! ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{arguing that}} Austen's novels have feminist elements, {{scholars}} have still noted {{that women are}} frequently represented as confined in Austen's novels {{and that there are}} few depictions of female authority figures. Women are literally confined in small spaces but are constrained even more effectively by social factors such as [...] "miseducation" [...] and [...] "financial dependency". Gilbert and Gubar argue that women [...] "must acquiesce in their own confinement, no matter how stifling" [...] because [...] "they are too vulnerable in the world at large". For example, in Persuasion Anne Elliot describes the differences between men and women: [...] "We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions." [...] Butler points out that Austen's novels lack depictions of female mentors or authority figures. In the novels, Butler argues, women do not progress from ignorance to knowledge, for example, {{and many of them are}} [...] "oddly and even unnaturally ineffective". Instead, they marry authority figures. As Gilbert and Gubar put it, [...] "becoming a woman means relinquishing achievement and accommodating oneself to men and the spaces they provide". For example, in Persuasion, as Mary and Louisa grow up they lose their independence and become reliant on those around them.|$|E
