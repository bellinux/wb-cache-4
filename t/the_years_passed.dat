5|$|In {{subsequent}} years Perfini released {{a number of}} commercially oriented films, such as Delapan Pendjuru Angin (Eight Compass Directions, 1957) and Asrama Dara (Dormitory for Girls, 1958). Though none of these were commercial failures, none except for Asrama Dara approached the financial success of Tiga Dara. Ismail attempted to reassert himself as a director of quality not-for-profit films through Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom, 1960), which was screened in competition at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961. However, as <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> he became increasingly distanced from his early goals and had made attempts to enter banking, the nightclub industry, and parliament {{by the time of}} his death in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Rosas {{acquired}} a {{working knowledge of}} administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family's estancias. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> he became an estanciero (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.|$|E

5|$|The first {{permanent}} Portuguese {{settlement in}} the land which would become Brazil was São Vicente, which was established in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa. As <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed,</b> the Portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward, conquering more lands from both indigenous Americans and the Spanish. Brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by Portugal {{as the most important}} part of its far-flung maritime Empire. On 7 September 1822, the heir of Portuguese King Dom João VI secured the independence of Brazil from Portugal and, as Dom Pedro I, became its first Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Lad: A Dog was {{published}} by Dutton in April 1919, {{a year after the}} real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work Across the Line, a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband. With this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad: A Dog. Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 a month {{for the rest of her}} life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1942, the {{railroad}} was already seeing signs of decreased ridership: there were 600 daily riders on the Yonkers branch, down from 2,000 daily riders sixteen years prior. The Interstate Commerce Commission gave New York Central Railroad permission {{to abandon the}} branch on November 12, 1942. Subsequently, riders filed a lawsuit to keep the line open, and the federal lawsuit was heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who {{ruled in favor of}} {{the railroad}} on June 21, 1943. Nine days later, the railroad abandoned the line. By December 1944, the rails were being removed. The main line also saw fewer riders as <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed,</b> and on March B, 1958, with daily ridership numbering between 400 and 500 commuters, the New York State Public Service Commission gave its approval for the railroad to stop passenger service on the line. The last day of service was June 1, 1958, and the station was abandoned, the line now only being used for freight.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{itinerant}} royal court comprised various parts. At {{the heart}} was Henry's domestic household, called the domus; a wider grouping was termed the familia regis, and formal gatherings {{of the court}} were termed curia. The domus was divided into several parts. The chapel, headed by the chancellor, looked after the royal documents, the chamber dealt with financial affairs and the master-marshal was responsible for travel and accommodation. The familia regis included Henry's mounted household troops, up to several hundred strong, who came from {{a wider range of}} social backgrounds, and could be deployed across England and Normandy as required. Initially Henry continued his father's practice of regular crown-wearing ceremonies at his curia, but they became less frequent as <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed.</b> Henry's court was grand and ostentatious, financing the construction of large new buildings and castles with a range of precious gifts on display, including the King's private menagerie of exotic animals, which he kept at Woodstock Palace. Despite being a lively community, Henry's court was more tightly controlled than those of previous kings. Strict rules controlled personal behaviour and prohibited members of the court from pillaging neighbouring villages, as had been the norm under William Rufus.|$|E

25|$|The Netherlands, however, was a land whose {{culture and}} {{language}} were strange and {{difficult for the}} English congregation to understand or learn.

25|$|After {{the monarchy}} was abolished, Prince Peter decided to {{liquidate}} his possessions in Greece, most notably his residence in Glyfada.

25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed,</b> {{erosion and}} modern {{construction}} destroyed many structures.

For many of those that remain, neglect and the attentions of nature have achieved a degree of camouflage greater than that during the Second World War.|$|E

In such memorable addresses as that delivered on the Yevno Azef affair, he tended toward conservatism, opposing alliances with revolutionaries. But he grew hostile to the government as <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> and actively supported the Progressive Bloc, a coalition of liberal parties in the Fourth Duma that called for sweeping reforms.|$|E
