5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress.

5000|$|The name of {{this island}} group, Leeward Islands, dates from {{previous}} centuries, when sailing ships were the sole form of transportation across the Atlantic Ocean. In the West Indies, the prevailing winds, known as the trade winds, blow from the northeast to the southwest. The early Spanish colonizers called Puerto Rico and <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west Sotavento, meaning leeward. <b>The</b> <b>islands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south and east of Puerto Rico were then called Islas de Barlovento, meaning [...] "windward islands". When the British gained control {{of many of the}} Lesser Antilles, they designated Antigua, Montserrat, and <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north [...] "Leeward Islands". Guadeloupe and <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south were designated [...] "Windward Islands". Later on, all islands north of Martinique became known as <b>the</b> Leeward <b>Islands.</b> Thus, Dominica is the first of <b>the</b> Leeward <b>islands.</b> However, even in modern usage in languages other than English, e.g., Spanish, French and Dutch, all of the Lesser Antilles from <b>the</b> Virgin <b>Islands</b> <b>to</b> Trinidad and Tobago are known as <b>the</b> Windward <b>Islands</b> (Iles du Vent in French, Bovenwindse Eilanden in Dutch, and Islas de Barlovento in Spanish). <b>The</b> <b>islands</b> along <b>the</b> Venezuelan coast, known in English as the Leeward Antilles, in languages other than English are known as <b>the</b> Leeward <b>Islands.</b>|$|R

5|$|After Janet passed Barbados, {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. Relief workers on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} the island, the Allied forces developed Labuan into a significant base. The 24th Brigade left from <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> capture {{the eastern shore}} of Brunei Bay in late June, and the island's airfield was repaired and expanded to host Royal Australian Air Force units. While occupying Labuan, the Allies had to reconstruct the island's infrastructure and provide assistance to thousands of civilians who had been rendered homeless by the pre-invasion bombardment. Following the war, a major Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery was established on Labuan.|$|E
5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site.

5|$|Arriving at Mauritius on 29 April 1836, Darwin was {{impressed}} by the civilised prosperity of the French colony which had come under British rule. He toured the island, examining its volcanic mountains and fringing coral reefs. The Surveyor-general Captain Lloyd took him on the only elephant on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> see an elevated coral plain. By then FitzRoy was writing the official Narrative of the Beagle voyages, and after reading Darwin’s diary he proposed incorporating it into the account, a suggestion Darwin discussed with his family.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked to {{preserve}} the San Clemente Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California. In 1991, it added genetic material from the San Clemente to their genetic database, later transferred to the National Animal Germplasm Program. As of June 2010, the organization {{was working on the}} rescue of a group of feral Spanish goats from an island in South Carolina. There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US. Conservancy members first made trips to <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats, then undertook action to remove some goats from <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> preserve the bloodlines from threatened extinction. A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established.|$|E

Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.|$|E

As a result, the United States Air Force ordered {{all of the}} planes on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> fly to the mainland. After continued weakening, Dolly passed over the island on September11, producing only gale-force winds, rains, and little to no damage. It deteriorated into a tropical storm on September12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The remnants of Dolly later turned eastward, dissipating just west of Portugal on September17.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped. Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the ship would roll upright, instead of sliding toward the shore. Despite {{recovery}} efforts and patching, the Oklahoma sank during a mid-Pacific storm while it was being towed to the scrapyard. Nevada, California, West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re-floated and salvaged by the Navy. The entire salvage operation took 20,000 man-hours underwater and 5,000 dives to recover human remains, weapons, ammunition and artifacts of historic or military importance.|$|E
