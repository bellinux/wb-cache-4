In 1954, the B-3 and C-3 models were introduced {{with the additional}} harmonic percussion feature. Despite several attempts by Hammond to replace them, these two models remained popular and stayed in continuous production through early 1975.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was {{considered}} an expert in matters {{in science and technology}} due to his background. He was a supporter of continuing the B-1 bomber program, which he considered successful. This conflicted with President Carter's desire to fund <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> bomber program. Glenn did not fully support development of <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> because he had doubts about the feasibility of the stealth technology. Glenn joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1978. He became the chairman of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, for which he traveled to Japan, Korea, the Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China. Glenn helped to pass the Taiwan Enabling Act of 1979. In 1979, another dispute Glenn had with President Carter was Glenn's stance on the SALT II treaty. He did not believe that the U.S. had the capability to monitor the Soviet Union accurately enough to verify compliance with the treaty. During the launching ceremony for the , he spoke about his doubts about verifying treaty compliance. First Lady Rosalynn Carter also spoke at the event, during which she criticized Glenn for speaking publicly about the issue. The Senate never ratified the treaty, {{in part because of the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the Air War College. He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative and <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E

The Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation 2003 Annual Report noted that <b>the</b> <b>B-2's</b> serviceability for Fiscal Year 2003 was still inadequate, mainly {{due to the}} maintainability of <b>the</b> <b>B-2's</b> low observable coatings.

25|$|In 2013, the USAF {{contracted}} for the Defensive Management System Modernization {{program to}} replace the antenna system and other electronics to increase <b>the</b> <b>B-2's</b> frequency awareness. <b>The</b> Common Very Low Frequency Receiver upgrade will allow <b>the</b> <b>B-2s</b> to use <b>the</b> same very low frequency transmissions as the Ohio-class submarines so as {{to continue in the}} nuclear mission until the Mobile User Objective System is fielded.|$|R
5|$|It was {{powered by}} two {{turbofan}} engines with each {{in a separate}} engine nacelle with S-ducts, to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of thrust vectoring nozzles as on the YF-22. As on <b>the</b> <b>B-2,</b> the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine nacelle housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height of}} the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>B-2's</b> low-observable, or [...] "stealth", {{characteristics}} {{enable the}} undetected penetration of sophisticated anti-aircraft defenses and to attack even heavily defended targets. This stealth {{comes from a}} combination of reduced acoustic, infrared, visual and radar signatures (multi-spectral camouflage) to evade the various detection systems {{that could be used to}} detect and be used to direct attacks against an aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>B-2's</b> stealth enables <b>the</b> reduction of supporting aircraft that are required to provide air cover, Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses and electronic countermeasures, making the bomber a [...] "force multiplier". , there have been no instances of a missile being launched at a B-2.|$|R
25|$|Since 2003, <b>the</b> <b>B-2's</b> forward {{presence}} {{has become}} a reality and proved the aircraft can deliver combat airpower, any time and any place. The deployment to Guam, which began in February 2005, provided a continuous bomber presence in the Asia Pacific region and augmented Pacific Command's establishment of a deterrent force. The 80-day tour, the longest in the bomber's 13-year history, also marked <b>the</b> first <b>B-2</b> deployment since <b>the</b> aircraft was declared fully operational.|$|R
5|$|On 1November1975, Lockheed and Northrop {{were each}} awarded $1.5-million {{contracts}} {{to proceed with}} Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March1976, a Lockheed model {{was transferred to the}} range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> bomber.|$|E
5|$|Tibbets's {{grandson}} Paul W. Tibbets IV {{graduated from}} the United States Air Force Academy in 1989, and in April 2006 became commander of the 393d Bomb Squadron, flying <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> Spirit at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The squadron {{was one of the}} two operational squadrons that had formed part of the 509th Composite Group when Tibbets commanded it. Paul Tibbets IV was promoted to brigadier general in 2014, and became Deputy Director for Nuclear Operations at the Global Operations Directorate of the United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. As such, he was responsible for America's strategic nuclear forces. On 5 June 2015, he assumed command of the 509th Bomb Wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> was not sufficient, {{and it was}} dropped in favour of the Ju 87 R {{long-range}} versions {{in the second half}} of 1940. The 105 R-1s were converted to R-2 status and a further 616 production R-2s were ordered. In May 1941, the development of the D-1 was planned and was ordered into production by March 1942. However, the expansion of the Junkers Ju 88 production lines to compensate for the withdrawal of Dornier Do 17 production delayed production of the Ju 87 D. The Weserflug plant in Lemwerder experienced production shortfalls. This prompted Erhard Milch to visit and threaten the company into meeting the RLM's Ju 87 D-1 requirements on 23 February 1942. To meet these demands, 700 skilled workers were needed. Skilled workers had been called up for military service in the Wehrmacht. Junkers were able to supply 300 German workers to the Weserflug factory, and as an interim solution, Soviet prisoners of war and Soviet civilians deported to Germany. Working around the clock, the shortfall was made good. WFG received an official commendation. By May 1942, demand increased further. Chief of Procurement General Walter Herthel found that each unit needed 100 Ju 87s as standard strength and an average of 20 per month to cover attrition. Not until June–December 1942 did production capacity increase, and 80 Ju 87s were produced per month.|$|E
25|$|In October 2005, Noshir Gowadia, {{a design}} {{engineer}} {{who worked on}} <b>the</b> <b>B-2's</b> propulsion system, was arrested for selling B-2 related classified information to foreign countries. Gowadia was {{convicted and sentenced to}} 32 years in prison for his actions.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to organizational issues and high-profile mistakes made within the Air Force, all of <b>the</b> <b>B-2s,</b> along with <b>the</b> nuclear-capable B-52s and the Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), {{were transferred to}} the newly formed Air Force Global Strike Command on 1 February 2010.|$|R

25|$|Only {{a decade}} after delivery, <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> was now a proven weapons system, a veteran of three campaigns and first-ever forward deployment. In {{recognition}} of the maturity {{of the system and}} the unit, the Air Force declared <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> fully operational capable.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>B-2</b> saw {{service in}} Afghanistan, {{striking}} ground targets {{in support of}} Operation Enduring Freedom. With aerial refueling support, <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> flew one of its longest missions to date from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri to Afghanistan and back. B-2s would be stationed in the Middle East {{as a part of}} a US military buildup in the region from 2003.|$|E

25|$|Operation Allied Force {{incorporated}} the first large-scale use of satellites {{as a direct}} method of weapon guidance. The collective bombing was the first combat use of the Joint Direct Attack Munition JDAM kit, which uses an inertial-guidance and GPS-guided tail fin to increase the accuracy of conventional gravity munitions up to 95%. The JDAM kits were outfitted on <b>the</b> <b>B-2s.</b> <b>The</b> AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) had been previously used in Operation Southern Watch earlier in 1999.|$|R
50|$|Members of the 394th {{participated in}} Operation Enduring Freedom by flying {{the first of}} a series of long {{duration}} missions. Two <b>B-2s,</b> <b>the</b> Spirit of Georgia and the Spirit of America, departed Whiteman on 7 October 2001, bombed targets in Afghanistan, and then went on to land at a forward location following missions lasting 40.3 and 44.3 hours, respectively. Following engine running crew changes, <b>the</b> <b>B-2s</b> and crews returned to Whiteman on 9 October after sorties lasting 29 hours each for the two bombers. Total engine run time for <b>the</b> two <b>B-2s</b> was 69.3 and 73.3 hours, respectively. The sortie accomplished in the Spirit of America (73.3 hours) was the longest combat sortie in the history of the Air Force to date.|$|R
50|$|Then, on 17 Dec 1993, {{the event}} that Whiteman had long-awaited finally arrived. On that day, at {{approximately}} 2 pm, a dark jet bomber swooped from the sky and landed on the Whiteman runway. Amid much fanfare, <b>the</b> first operational <b>B-2,</b> <b>The</b> Spirit of Missouri, had arrived. Less than a week later, on 22 Dec 1993, Whiteman again made history as it generated <b>the</b> first <b>B-2</b> sortie from <b>the</b> base.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>B-2</b> {{was aimed}} mainly at the {{military}} trainer market, and the prototype B-2 was shipped to Lisbon in September 1933 for evaluation by Portugal. Although it performed well in the evaluation, the Portuguese preferred a tandem layout, and purchased the de Havilland Tiger Moth. Although not successful in competing for major military orders, <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> continued in production to equip civilian flying schools in the United Kingdom that were busy training pilots for the Royal Air Force under the RAF expansion scheme, with <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> equipping flying schools owned by Blackburn at Brough Aerodrome and London Air Park, Hanworth. A total of 42 B-2s, including the prototype, were built, with production continuing until 1937.|$|E
25|$|During {{its design}} and development, the Northrop B-2 {{program was a}} gray project before its revelation to the public. Unlike the Lockheed F-117 program, which was a black project, the type of {{military}} project of which very few people knew even existed while it was being designed and developed, more people within the United States federal government knew about <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> and {{more information about the}} project was available. Both during development and in service, there has been considerable importance placed to the security of <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> and its technologies. Staff working on <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> in most, if not all, capacities have to achieve a level of special-access clearance, and undergo extensive background checks carried out by a special branch of the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|During {{the decade}} several {{military}} projects went into production, including Boeing {{support of the}} stealth B-2 bomber. As part of an industry team led by Northrop, Boeing built the outboard portion of <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> stealth bomber wing, the aft center fuselage section, landing gear, fuel system and weapons delivery system. At its peak in 1991, <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> was the largest military program at Boeing, employing about 10,000 people. The same year, the National Aeronautic Association of the USA awarded <b>the</b> <b>B-2</b> design team the Collier Trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. The first B-2 rolled out of the bomber's final assembly facility in Palmdale, California, in November 1988 and it flew {{for the first time}} on July 17, 1989.|$|E
