2500|$|There {{have been}} {{specific}} tensions between recovery models and [...] "evidence-based practice" [...] {{models in the}} transformation of US mental health services based on {{the recommendations of the}} New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. The Commission's emphasis on recovery has been interpreted by some critics as saying that everyone can fully recover through sheer will power and therefore as giving false hope and implicitly blaming those who may be unable to recover. However, the critics have <b>themselves</b> <b>been</b> charged with <b>undermining</b> consumer rights and failing to recognize that the model is intended to support a person in their personal journey rather than expecting a given outcome, and that it relates to social and political support and empowerment as well as the individual.|$|R
40|$|Machado {{showed a}} fascination with homeopathic medicine, an {{indirect}} form of treatment that uses agents to stimulate reactions similar to the symptoms of the condition to be cured. Several of the author&# 8217;s texts show a pattern of projects realized by indirect means, by "like curing like", which suggests a homeopathic logic in Machado&# 8217;s worldview. Certain narrators, such as those inMemórias póstumas de Brás Cubas, Dom Casmurro, and in short stories such as "O segredo do bonzo" and "Adão e Eva", are notable for denouncing <b>themselves,</b> that <b>is,</b> for <b>undermining</b> their own validity. This curious situation has implications for Machado&# 8217;s overall project, which seems more interested in posing questions than providing answers. It also suggests a particular relationship with the reader, which affords as much independence as possible...|$|R
