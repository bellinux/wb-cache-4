5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{circumstances}} as {{to which}} side fired the first shot are disputed by both sides. General Bacon claimed {{that one of the}} soldier's rifles accidentally discharged causing the Pillagers hiding in the woods <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were being attacked while the Pillagers said the battle started when several soldiers were seen firing at an Indian canoe carrying several women as their steamship approached Sugar Point.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{people began}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were too busy}} to heed every crime and abuse that {{happened}} in their society. They grieved on the rising of evil amongst their people. But {{most of their time}} had already been invested in tending their fief. So, they appointed someone to rectify what is right and what is wrong, give warnings to those who need it, give punishment to those who deserve it, and in return, they will give him a share of their rice.|$|E

25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, people are more likely <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that {{they have a lot of}} control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E

I certainly would love <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} fierce fights were {{underway}} at Bucharest Otopeni International Airport between troops sent {{against each other}} under claims {{that they were going}} to confront terrorists. Early in the morning troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon. These troops were from the UM 0865 Campina military base, and were summoned there by Gen. Ion Rus, the commander of the Romanian Air Force. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers as well as eight civilians. The military trucks were allowed entrance into the airport's perimeter, passing several checkpoints. However, after passing the last checkpoint, being on their way to the airport, they were fired upon from different directions. A civilian bus was also fired upon during the firefight. After the firefight the surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the troops guarding the airport, who seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were loyal to Ceausescu's regime.|$|E

The return of {{the character}} on 19 October 2009, after an eight-month absence, drew large ratings for the show's episodes which were watched by 9.88m (42.2%) and 10.24m (40.5%) respectively.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, the typological {{similarity}} {{of the structures}} and the relatively short distance between them (ideal for visual communication), has led some <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{on opposite sides of}} the frontier line between the Kingdoms of León and Castile (in Salamanca there is a town names Zorita de la Frontera ("Zorita on the Border") in memory of those times). These fortresses were reinforced in the 12th and 13th centuries due to conflicts between the two kingdoms; but it appears that they are more plentiful on the Castilian side (near the Trabancos) than on the Leonese side (near the River Guareña). This has been seen as indicative of a certain independence on the part of the militia of the Community of Medina del Campo and surrounding areas, which was thereby forced to defend itself without outside help, while the Leonese side would have been able to rely on the help of Royal troops, and the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, billeted in Castronuño and Torrecilla de la Orden.|$|E

[...] University of Melbourne evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that [...] "I think that it was a little bit naive <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence... when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive... I don't really know what they were thinking." ...|$|E

60|$|She also {{obtained}} a great ascendency over {{the mind of}} Theodore himself, and this, of itself, very much increased her importance {{in the eyes of}} the courtiers. <b>They</b> all began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>they</b> wished <b>to</b> obtain any favor of the emperor, it was essential <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should stand well with the princess.

[...] Some types of insects, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, so there is as yet no good reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have a common evolutionary origin; nor is there sufficient similarity in brain structure to enable anything resembling a [...] "hippocampus" [...] to be identified in these species.

2500|$|However, {{a number}} of {{problems}} are inherent in intentionalism, and a fortiori when that theory is applied to the Constitution. [...] For example, most of the Founders did not leave detailed discussions of what their intent was in 1787, and while a few did, there is no reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should be dispositive of what the rest thought. [...] Moreover, the discussions of the drafters may have been recorded; however they were not available to the ratifiers in each state. [...] The theory of original intent was challenged in a string of law review articles in the 1980s. Specifically, original intent was seen as lacking good answers to three important questions: whether a diverse group such as the framers even had a single intent; if they did, whether it could be determined from two centuries' distance; and whether the framers themselves would have supported original intent.|$|E
2500|$|One {{reason for}} not taking up an {{offering}} at all meetings is to avoid causing any unbelievers who may be present <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might gain a spiritual benefit by making a donation. Some assemblies never send an offering bag round the congregation, even at the Breaking of Bread meeting. They prefer to simply have a box or two located {{at the back of}} the meeting hall, thus avoiding even the appearance of solicitation for funds. Many assemblies operate a [...] "back seat" [...] or [...] "guest row" [...] during the Breaking of Bread so that neither the offering bag nor the emblems of bread and wine will pass down the row of those not in fellowship. An offering bag, basket or box may be sent around after these two [...] "emblems" [...] have been passed, collecting money given voluntarily for use in maintaining the building, hall or room, to remunerate full-time or labouring members, or for distribution to the needy. In some cases an offering box may be placed at the door and not circulated.|$|E

Goldschmidt believed that the neo-Darwinian view of gradual accumulation of small mutations was important but could account for variation only within species (microevolution) and was not a powerful enough source of evolutionary novelty to explain new species. Instead he believed that large genetic differences between species required profound [...] "macro-mutations" [...] a source for large genetic changes (macroevolution) which once in a while could occur as a [...] "hopeful monster".|$|R
