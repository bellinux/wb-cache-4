40|$|Elecrtochemical {{degradation}} of phenol was evaluated at five typical anodes for mineralization to carbon dioxide or {{for being a}} pre-treatment method in toxic aromatic compounds. Three kinds of RuO 2 -base electrodes were prepared by <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition,</b> which were <b>coated</b> by the oxides of Ru or by Ru, Sn and Sb or by Ru, Sn, Sb and Gd on Ti metal surface, respectively. Another electrode Ti/ PbO 2 was prepared by electro-deposition method with PbO 2 coated on Ti. A Pt electrode was chosen for comparison. Characteristics of the typical five electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, SEM and its degradation ability for phenol. Performance for phenol {{degradation of}} the three RuO 2 electrodes lie in: Ti/Sb-Sn-RuO 2 -Gd> Ti/Sb-Sn-RuO 2 > Ti/RuO 2 and the electrode with β-PbO 2 coating was superior to RuO 2 -based electrodes and Pt electrode. Aromatic ring opening take place at all researched electrodes and it is supposed that electrolysis run stop at different intermediates, such as benzoquinone, maleic acid, etc. Under the present experimental conditions, whole mineralization to CO 2 takes place only in the β-PbO 2 anode. A pathway of electrochemical degradation of phenol was suggested based on the experimental analysis. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Major joining {{methods of}} dental casting metal include brazing and laser welding. However, brazing cannot be applied for {{electroformed}} metals since heat treatment {{could affect the}} fit, and, therefore, laser welding is used for such metals. New methods of joining metals that do not impair the characteristics of electroformed metals should be developed. When new coating is performed {{on the surface of}} the base metal, surface treatment is usually performed before re-coating. The effect of surface treatment is clinically evaluated by peeling and flex tests. However, these testing methods are not ideal for <b>deposition</b> <b>coating</b> strength measurement of electroformed metals. There have been no studies on the <b>deposition</b> <b>coating</b> strength and methods to test electroformed metals. We developed a new <b>deposition</b> <b>coating</b> strength test for electroformed metals.

Cathode electrolysis is a simple and safe method that is capable of improving the surface treatment by adjustments to the current supply method and current intensity. 3. Electrochemical treatment can improve the <b>deposition</b> <b>coating</b> strength compared to the physical or chemical treatment methods. 4.

In this paper, a <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> technique is utilized as a method to fabricate antenna structures on substrates.

Despite its high potential, conventional polycrystalline PbO layers deposited with the basic thermal evaporation method are not yet mature for practical use in X-ray imaging; indeed, they are highly porous, unstable at ambient conditions, and substoichiometric. In order to combat the above issues with PbO, we advance the basic evaporation process with simultaneous energetic ion bombardment of the growing film. We show that tuning the ion-assisted <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> not only solves the structural problems of poly-PbO, but also enables the growth of a new non-crystalline polymorphic form of the material?amorphous PbO (a-PbO).

40|$|Hyperthermia {{plays an}} {{important}} role in oncological therapies, most often being used in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The success of this therapy is strongly dependent on the precision and control of <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition.</b> Hyperthermia based on induction heating, with thermally self-regulating thermoseeds inserted into the tumorous mass, is used for interstitial treatment. The technique was the subject of the numerical study presented in the paper. The analysis was carried out using coupled electromagnetic heating and thermo-fluid dynamic FEM simulations. During <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> by induction heating of inserted seeds, the simulations estimated the thermal field inside and outside the tumour, as well as the sensitivity of the thermal field to variations regarding seed temperature, configuration and proximity to vessels. The method, for which accurate anatomical patient's information is essential, is suitable for providing useful qualitative and quantitative information about thermal transients and power density distribution for hyperthermic treatment. Several grid steps were analysed and compared. A 1 cm seed grid was resulted in good homogeneity and effectiveness of the <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition.</b> The cold spot effect caused by large vessels was demonstrated and quantified.

In addition, one sample of magnetite nanorods (S 4) has been prepared in order to compare the magnetic properties of the two different iron oxides. S 4 was prepared by using <b>thermal</b> <b>deposition</b> and fixed glancing angle deposition, but no PIB was applied. The hysteresis loop has been studied for all samples and the temperature dependent magnetic properties {{of one of the}} hematite samples and the magnetite been studied, too. The studies of the magnetic hysteresis for S 1, S 2, S 3 and S 4 showed that all of the samples have hysteresis loops but with dissimilar values of the saturation magnetization Ms, remanence MR, and coercivity HC. Furthermore, the hysteresis loops of all four samples showed different behaviors as the nanorods of the samples change the orientation with respect to the magnetic field. In addition to that fact, the hysteresis loop demonstrated that samples that have similar morphology have like behavior of the hysteresis loop. Also, it has found that S 2 has the largest hysteresis loop of all hematite samples and it has large hysteresis loop in the perpendicular and parallel directions with the field as well. However, the magnetite hysteresis loops are significant larger than the ones of the hematite. Likewise, the studies of the temperature dependence magnetic properties of S 2 and S 4 showed that the ZFC and FC M-T curves of S 1 and S 4 behaved differently when the direction of the nanorods changed from perpendicular to parallel with the field.
