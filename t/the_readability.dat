2500|$|Heyse's argument: Given that [...] "ss" [...] {{may appear}} {{at the end of}} a word, before a fugue and [...] "s" [...] being a common initial letter for words, [...] "sss" [...] is likely to appear in a large number of cases (the amount of these cases is even higher than all the {{possible}} triple consonant cases (e.g. [...] "Dampfschifffahrt") together). Critics point out that a triple [...] "s" [...] in words like [...] "Missstand" [...] feature less readability than spelling it [...] "Mißstand". Even in cases where the second word of a compound does not start with [...] "s", [...] "ß" [...] should be used to improve <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> of the fugue (e.g. [...] "Meßergebnis" [...] over [...] "Messergebnis" [...] (measurement), which suggests the unrelated word [...] "Messer" [...] (knife), and [...] "Meßingenieur" [...] over [...] "Messingenieur" [...] (measuring engineer), which suggests the unrelated word [...] "Messing" [...] (brass)).|$|E

2500|$|Links {{are created}} using a {{specific}} syntax, the so-called [...] "link pattern". Originally, most wikis used CamelCase to name pages and create links. These {{are produced by}} capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word [...] "CamelCase" [...] is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking easy, it also leads to links {{in a form that}} deviates from the standard spelling. To link to a page with a single-word title, one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word (e.g. [...] "WiKi" [...] instead of [...] "Wiki"). CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as [...] "TableOfContents" [...] and [...] "BeginnerQuestions." [...] It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor of such links [...] "pretty" [...] by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case. However, this reprocessing of the link to improve <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal. For example, [...] "RichardWagner" [...] should be rendered as [...] "Richard Wagner", whereas [...] "PopularMusic" [...] should be rendered as [...] "popular music". There is no easy way to determine which capital letters should remain capitalized. As a result, many wikis now have [...] "free linking" [...] using brackets, and some disable CamelCase by default.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E
