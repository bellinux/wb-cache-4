The authors ascertained the category of consumers that has more influence on the quality judgment of the salami and investigated on the differences in the sensory attributes perception between consumers with different familiarity. Design/methodology/approach – Eight samples of both Napoli and Mugnano del Cardinale salami were investigated. The study consisted of three parts: first, <b>technical</b> <b>questionnaire</b> submitted to the producers; second, descriptive analysis performed by 12 trained judges, and third, hedonic tests with different consumer categories: low familiar and high familiar consumers, trained assessors, and salami producers. Findings – Manufacturing processes were quite heterogeneous, those differences affected the sensory profiles of both salamis. Hedonic results indicate that consumer familiarity had a significant effect on overall liking of Napoli salami. In particular, both low familiar consumers and producers give the same judgment to all the products. High familiar consumers and especially trained assessors were more selective than the other ones. Differences in the sensory attributes perception between the consumer’ categories were found. Practical implications – Europe has a great number of traditional foods as a result its long history, diversity of cultures, and different climates. These foods represent a very important part of the local economy. Thus, the research effort is contributing to better understanding of the manufacturing process of two Italian traditional salamis and to better addressing consumer needs in relation to traditional foods. Originality/value – The experimental procedure used in this study for consumer tests is very original and proved to be useful to obtain interesting results.

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{methodology}} “Road Safety Review” in the road safety analysis has been spread for a long time. These methodologies are used to analyze in detail the different components of the streets and to see which are the elements that affect adversely the road safety. Checklists are drawn up in form of <b>technical</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and classified by topic, each in turn divided by sub-topic. It’s clear that topics to be considered depend on the element to be analyzed, whether it is an arc or a node. Indeed, checklists are divided in two main macro areas, one for the arcs analysis {{and the other for}} the nodes analysis. In this way, it is possible to study in detail each part of the road network and identify the most critical areas. It is important to carry out on-visits in any arc and node, as well as to draw up the checklists. Once completed, a large number of data is available, but they are often difficult to be read. In this study, we wanted to develop a management system checklist more fluid and functional, whose main goal is to have an immediate overview of the network situation under consideration.

Participating laboratories performed Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for rearrangements of the TCRβ chain gene and PCR for the TCRγ chain gene rearrangements. Of 14 laboratories performing TCRβ Southern blot analysis, there was complete agreement in 10 of 14 cases, with some false negative results obtained in 4 cases. No false positive results were obtained by Southern blot analysis. TCRβ PCR analysis was only performed by two laboratories, and only 47. 1 % of positive samples were detected. Twenty-one laboratory results were obtained for TCRγ PCR. This method showed an overall detection rate of 77. 9 % for T cell gene rearrangements with a 4. 1 % false positive rate, as compared to both TCRγ Southern blot analysis results and immunophenotyping. The detection rate for TCRγ PCR, however, significantly differed when extracted DNA samples from frozen tissue were compared to paraffin-embedded tissue (85. 4 % versus 65. 9 %; P = 0. 0005). Significant differences in true positive results were obtained when laboratories using primers directed against multiple TCRγ variable regions (V 1 – 8 plus one to three other primer sets) were compared to laboratories that used only a single set of TCR primers directed against the V 1 – 8 (P < 0. 0001). Other technical factors significantly affecting results were also identified. These findings provide useful data on the current state of diagnostic TCR testing, highlight the risk of false negative results for TCR testing directed against only portions of the TCRγ gene, and identify limitations of testing of paraffin-embedded tissues in some laboratories...|$|E

40|$|Determination of monoclonality {{through an}} {{evaluation}} of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements is a commonly performed and useful diagnostic assay. Many laboratories that perform this assay do so by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To evaluate current methods for performing IgH gene testing, 19 different Association of Molecular Pathology (AMP) member laboratories analyzed 29 blinded B cell and T cell lymphoid neoplasm samples of extracted DNA and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue {{and were asked to}} complete a <b>technical</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> From this study, it is clear that Southern blot analysis remains the diagnostic gold standard, with a 100 % diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. There was, however, remarkable heterogeneity in the performance of, and results obtained from, IgH PCR assays with diagnostic sensitivity ranging from over 90 % to as low as 20 %, when evaluating the same specimens. Many laboratories overestimate the diagnostic sensitivity of their IgH PCR assay, and there was a significant, and under appreciated, drop-off (from 61. 3 % to 41. 8 %) in detection in paired FFPE as compared with fresh/frozen tissues. Fixation has a dramatic impact on the inability to perform the test on FFPE (43. 1 %) versus DNA already extracted from fresh or frozen tissue (2. 8 %). A number of variables that affected the outcome of IgH PCR were identified. Strategies that improved the detection of monoclonal IgH rearrangements include: the addition of FRII to the FRIII upstream primer (increasing detection from 57. 3 % to 73. 6 %) {{and the use of the}} FR 3 A rather than the FR 3 FRIII primer (increasing detection from 54. 7 % to 69. 7 %). Although numerous variables (from DNA extraction to PCR product detection) were evaluated, making it difficult to mandate alterations in laboratory practice, these findings ought to prompt diagnostic molecular pathology laboratories to reevaluate their claims of sensitivity, as well as their methodologies. Both pathologists and surgeons need to ensure that not all submitted material is fixed, if there is adequate sample. Importantly, there is a need for greater standardization to reduce the unacceptably high false negative rate of this crucial diagnostic assay...|$|E
40|$|Between March 2003 and September 2006 the FOODMIGROSURE project, {{contract}} number QLK-CT 2002 - 2390, {{was carried out}} by 9 European project partners with the intention to develop an ¿into-food¿ migration model tool which should enable prediction of mass transfer of constituents from plastics food contact materials into foodstuffs in support of calculations/estimations of the exposure of consumers towards food packaging constituents. A further objective was to investigate the social acceptance of migration modelling versus chemical measurements, and its implications for exposure estimation. This was achieved by several approaches including focus group (as qualitative approach), and questionnaires with a large polling bas as quantitative approach from citizens. A test trial was run on consumer associations and the experiment was then conducted on citizens during a JRC Open Day. Questionnaires and comments were colleted for 700 units which represented about 1400 visitors to the food contact activities. In the last phase, a more specific <b>technical</b> <b>questionnaire</b> was directed to end-user of modelling, which was mailed to a variety of stakeholders such as National Reference Laboratories, commercial laboratories, industries, EFSA, CEN members etc. Globally, people in the overwhelming majority -both for the questionnaire approach and for the focus group approach- felt reassured regarding the safety of packaging simply from the fact that they did not previously know that such research and controls existed. Many citizens also clearly expressed the wish to have this type of research much more visible at the level of both consumer associations and consumers themselves. The responses were echoing quite interestingly between the different approaches directed at consumers/citizens. Although obtained by completely different methodologies, both focus groups and quantitative citizen polling questionnaires showed many similarities even in the specifics. There is a fundamental trust from the public in the scientists to distinguish and understand safety issues. The consumer wants sincerely to be approached and informed by scientists for this reason and is also ready to favour new approaches such as migration modelling if it can be an additional tool for better consumer protection. The benefits of packaging are recognised, and the presence of migrants is considered similarly to the presence of food additives in foods. Modelling is viewed as a additional helping tool to assist the scientist as first and foremost raison d¿être, and was found to have its strongest value as pointing the worst cases that could occur. The consumers or citizens made no mention of environmental or worker health effects benefits. However, the consumer especially {{in the context of the}} focus group remarked justly that one needs to be sure that at the root for use of these models are experimental data which demonstrate the applicability of the model.

The current recommendation is to screen for DKD by evaluating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and measuring urinary albumin (UA) levels in a spot sample. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the availability of UA measurement in Southern Brazilian laboratories.   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the routine use of UA in all laboratories registered in the State Pharmacy Council ofRio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state ofBrazil. Data was collected by mail, e-mail, telephone, or personal interview. A sample size of at least 384 laboratories was necessary to achieve 5 % precision at a 95 % confidence level based on a fixed proportion of 0. 5.   Results: Eight hundred and eighty laboratories currently registered in the state were invited to participate in the study; 548 (62 %) answered the <b>technical</b> specification <b>questionnaire.</b> Only 306 (55 %) of the 548 surveyed laboratories performed UA measurements. The laboratories were also required to provide the number of UA measurements performed per day, which ranged from less than one per week to 65 per day.   Conclusion: The availability of UA measurements is undesirably low inSouthern Brazil. This demonstrates the urgent need to increase the availability of this important test. It also reveals the gap between the current guidelines and the awareness about them among health care professionals...|$|R
