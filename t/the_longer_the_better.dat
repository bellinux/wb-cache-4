The pigs from eastern England, mainly Essex, were influenced by importations from China in the late 18th century, while those from Devon and Cornwall were probably {{more closely related to}} the pigs in mainland Europe, particularly France. The Devon pigs were originally selected for [...] "the length of their bodies, ears, noses, tail and hair, <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> <b>better,</b> without reference to quality or substance", but selective breeding brought improvements to the breed, and by 1850 the type was small-boned and thick-bodied, with good conformation and constitution.

METHODS: Totally 60 BN rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal control group, model group, experimental group, physiological saline group with 15 in each group. All CNV models were made by krypton laser. Rats in experimental group were intraperitoneally injected with 0. 35 % EGb 761 (100 mg/kg) every day after laser exposure until they were sacrificed. Rats in physiological saline group were intraperitoneally injected physiological saline every day after laser exposure until they were sacrificed. Fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA) was performed on every rat on the 7 th day, 14 th day and the 21 st day after laser exposure, then the rats were sacrificed immediately.

Thus, it provides one of the many motivations for our work to develop such a coded-cooperative scheme, which may be useful particularly for applications having small information block size and require low encoding and decoding complexity. For any communication system, there is and always will be a trade-off between the complexity and performance as suggested in [22].|$|E

This study presents the numerical simulation of optimum pin-fin heat sink with air impinging cooling by using Taguchi method. L 9 (34) orthogonal array is selected as {{a plan for the}} four design-parameters with three levels. The governing equations are discretized by using control-volume-based-finite-difference method with power-law scheme on an orthogonal non-uniform staggered grid. The coupling of the velocity and the pressure terms of momentum equations are solved by SIMPLEC algorithm. The k -ɛ two-equations turbulence model is employed to describe the turbulent structure and behavior. The parameters studied include fin height H (35 mm- 45 mm), inter-fin spacing a (2 mm - 6. 4 mm), inter-fin spacing b (2 mm - 6. 4 mm), inter-fin spacing c (2 mm - 6. 4 mm), and Reynolds number (Re = 10000 - 25000).

This finding indicates that the length of the NA stalk affects the host range of influenza A viruses. The NA stalkless mutant was highly attenuated in mice; none of the animals died even after intranasal inoculation of 10 (6) PFU of the virus (the dose of the parent virus required to kill 50 % of mice was 10 (2. 5) PFU). Moreover, the stalkless mutant replicated only in the respiratory organs, whereas the parent virus caused systemic infection in mice.
