5|$|The Southern Railway was {{primarily}} a passenger-carrying railway which used most of its resources to extend its electrified lines. There was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however, although the <b>Traffic</b> <b>Department</b> preferred mixed traffic designs which could also haul passenger trains on the remaining non-electrified lines at peak periods. By the late 1930s the Southern Railway was adequately served with powerful mixed traffic locomotives of the S15 and N and N1 classes, {{but there was a}} need for a smaller freight locomotive with high route availability that could also undertake light passenger duties. This role had been performed by the ex-LSWR 'Jubilee' A12 0-4-2, which were approaching the end of their useful lives.|$|E

The 1960s saw the start of construction of new motorways, so the <b>traffic</b> <b>departments</b> grew.

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s {{it was clear that the}} tram network could become profitable again only if it was expanded to the more lucrative suburban routes dominated by the private bus operators. Additionally most of the rolling stock dated from before or during the World War II, and were nearing the end of their lifespan, which meant that sizeable investment would be needed to keep the trams operational. In 1961 the <b>traffic</b> <b>department</b> proposed the acquisitions of new four-axle trams, but the proposal was left untreated by the technical committee until the <b>traffic</b> <b>department</b> would make a proposal for the future of the tram system. As a result, Pentti Savolainen proposed the gradual closure of the tram system by 1980, synchronising the closure of different lines with the retirement of the then-current tram staff. Six new four-axle trams would have been required for this plan to be realised. No actual reason was given why the tram system should be closed.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{improved}} ”King Arthur” class 4-6-0 locomotives {{were capable of}} the heaviest express passenger work between London and South-West England, there was a growth in demand for Continental traffic travelling via Dover and Folkestone. By the mid-1920s the Southern Railway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Department</b> wished to begin operating [...] express trains on these routes during peak periods. These would require a more powerful locomotive, able to pull heavier loads at sustained speeds of , {{so as not to}} impede the congested electrified lines around London. However, any enlargement of the existing 2-cylinder design was not possible due to weight restrictions imposed by the railway’s Civil Engineer.|$|E

2500|$|As the 1950s progressed {{the general}} opinion started turning against tram traffic, {{following}} the general {{trend of the}} time. The termination of tram traffic by 1980 was first proposed in 1952 by architect Olavi Laisaari of the city planning department in a proposal for general guidelines for city planning. The proposal {{was at the time}} rejected. In 1954 a committee led by vice-city executive Öyvind Stadius {{came to the conclusion that}} trams were an impractical solution for a city of Turku's size, but nevertheless recommended maintaining the tram network as large investment were made to it. During the 1950s and 60s the decisions for the future of the tram network were largely a struggle between Laisaari and Stadius for termination of tram traffic on one side, and the leader of the <b>traffic</b> <b>department</b> Pentti Savolainen (Stadius' subordinate) for development of tram traffic on the other side. Despite the statements against the tram network, the city <b>traffic</b> <b>department</b> made large-scale plans for expansion of the tram network during the 1950s, including light rail lines connecting Turku with neighbouring cities Raisio and Kaarina, which would have greatly increased the profitability of the tram system. Unfortunately these were not realised, apart from a short expansion of line 2 completed in 1956 with a light rail -type track entirely separated from street traffic. Also in 1956 the <b>traffic</b> <b>department</b> acquired new RM 2 -type four-axle trams. Although the city had decided not to build the proposed light rail lines, these so-called [...] "ghost cars" [...] were designed to be usable on light rail lines.|$|E

2500|$|The Manx Northern Railway's {{first two}} engines were {{provided}} by Sharp, Stewart and Company for the line's opening in 1879 and were 2-4-0 side tank locomotives bearing the names Ramsey and Northern. [...] J.I.C. Boyd in his [...] "Isle of Man Railway (Oakwood Press 1967) {{points out that the}} Sharpies were dimensionally similar to the Beyer Peacock locomotives built for the IMR. [...] However, in their use of a leading radial axle, rather than a Bissell truck, and other features, they were more conventional examples of mid-Victorian locomotive design than the Isle of Man Railway's Beyers. [...] Boyd mentions that they were tested at speed before their entry into service and officially restricted to 45mph. [...] There have been some suggestions that their shorter wheelbase, 11'6" [...] as opposed to 13'9" [...] for the Beyer Peacock locomotives, made their ride less than steady at higher speeds. [...] However, this {{does not seem to have}} limited their usefulness as both were reboilered in 1892/3, and McNabb ("Isle of Man Railway," [...] 1945) reports that they were both [...] "worn out" [...] by 1905. Ramsey was hired to IOMTEPCo by the MNR for construction work in the 19th century. Whilst there are very few photographs in existence, it is known that they survived the takeover by the Isle of Man Railway in 1905 but were never re-numbered as the other two Manx Northern locomotives were. [...] They saw very little use on the line after takeover (the railway having only just purchased Nos. 10 and 11 at this time) and were scrapped in 1923 and 1912 respectively. [...] Ramsey is reported to have been used to haul Permanent Way trains (Boyd, op. cit.) in the years before 1914. [...] Their fate other than these dates is not known and they have become part of the folklore of the island's railway network, lost in the mists of time. [...] It seems likely, however, that as non-standard locomotives, they were scrapped as soon as the <b>traffic</b> <b>department</b> regarded them as surplus to future requirements. [...] This probably occurred after the delivery of No. 13 Kissack in 1910. [...] There is some evidence (Boyd, op. cit.) that the Railway attempted to sell [...] "Ramsey" [...] in 1919, and again in 1920 as a contractors' locomotive.|$|E
