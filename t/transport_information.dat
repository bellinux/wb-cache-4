25|$|Peptides {{are able}} to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) through various mechanisms, opening new {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic avenues. However, their BBB transport data are scattered in the literature over different disciplines, using different methodologies reporting different influx or efflux aspects. Therefore, a comprehensive BBB peptide database (Brainpeps) was constructed to collect the BBB data available in the literature. Brainpeps currently contains BBB <b>transport</b> <b>information</b> with positive as well as negative results. The database is a useful tool to prioritize peptide choices for evaluating different BBB responses or studying quantitative structure-property (BBB behaviour) relationships of peptides. Because a multitude of methods {{have been used to}} assess the BBB behaviour of compounds, we classified these methods and their responses. Moreover, the relationships between the different BBB transport methods have been clarified and visualized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A primary {{functionality}} {{of wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) is <b>transporting</b> the <b>information</b> acquired by the sensors as per the desired application requirements. The diverse applications supported by WSNs also stipulate a diverse range of reliability requirements for the <b>transport</b> of various <b>information</b> types. The continuous variation of application requirements and dynamic operational perturbations complicates {{the design of a}} generic solution for <b>information</b> <b>transport</b> in WSNs. In this paper, we present a new framework for generic <b>information</b> <b>transport</b> (GIT), which considers varied application requirements and evolvable network conditions in WSNs. GIT manages the information and utilizes a probabilistic approach to ensure tunable reliability of <b>information</b> <b>transport.</b> The GIT framework is distributed in nature and performs its operations locally. The simulation results validate the tunability of the GIT framework. In some setups GIT achieves up to 4 - 5 times reduction in number of transmissions compared to existing approaches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{constitute the}} transportation conduit {{for the results}} of the in-network processing of the raw data. In WSNs the sensor node and communication level perturbations are often the norm than the exception due to varied environmental conditions. Consequently, the diverse applications supported by WSNs stipulate their individual (and varied) requirements for WSN <b>information</b> <b>transport</b> reliability in order to meet their specific responsiveness needs. The use of an approach that guarantees the highest reliability level for information delivery is not a realistic option as this over-provisioning wastes key resources such as energy or bandwidth. In this paper, we present a new approach termed ReCAIT that targets ‘congestionaware’ reliable <b>information</b> <b>transport</b> in WSNs to provide application-specific tunable reliability and thus avoids over-provisioning. To provide tunable reliability, ReCAIT efficiently integrates probabilistic adaptive retransmissions, hybrid acknowledgement and retransmission timer management. ReCAIT proactively alleviates the congestion by <b>transporting</b> <b>information</b> on multiple paths. If congestion persists ReCAIT’s back-pressure mechanism triggers the information rate control. Our simulation results show that ReCAIT provides tunable reliability and mitigate congestion, which maximises the efficiency of <b>information</b> <b>transport</b> in terms of reduced number of transmissions...|$|R
