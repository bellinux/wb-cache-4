5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E

Previous work has found that {{people are able to}} form accurate impressions that predict certain ecologically valid outcomes from brief observations or “thin slices ” of behavior. This article discusses theoretical and empirical work showing that <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> judgments are intuitive and efficient. <b>Thin</b> <b>slice</b> judgments can be made accurately even under conditions of distraction. Moreover, such judgments are impeded by tasks that interfere with the intuitive process. <b>Thin</b> <b>slice</b> judgments are impeded by tasks involving deliberation such as reasons analyses tasks. Thus, impressionistic, evaluative <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> judgments seem to be intuitive. Intuition is essential to optimal social and interpersonal functioning. Individuals have to both produce and enact behavior as well as process and perceive the behavior of others. These complex processes occur smoothly, for the most part, because they are intuitive. They are rapid, nonconscious, and automatic...|$|R

25|$|Stone Roof, {{a private}} {{residence}} in Nagano, Japan, built in 2010, {{consists of a}} roof which is meant to spring from the ground, providing a complete enclosure to the home. A local stone was chosen to intimately relate itself to the preexisting natural environment of the mountain side. The exterior stone work is made light and airy by cutting each stone into <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> and bracing each slice as a pivoting panel. In this way, the heavy quality of stone is diluted and provides the eye with an illusion of lightness, allowing light and air directly into the space within. With this choice of material and construction, {{a new kind of}} transparency emerges; one that not only frames nature the way a glass curtain wall would, but also deeply relates itself to the mountain side.|$|E
500|$|Although L. indigo is a {{well-known}} edible species, opinions vary on its desirability. For example, American mycologist David Arora considers it a [...] "superior edible", while a field guide on Kansas fungi rates it as [...] "mediocre in quality". It may have a slightly bitter, or peppery taste, and has a coarse, grainy texture. The firm flesh is best prepared by cutting the mushroom in <b>thin</b> <b>slices.</b> The blue color disappears with cooking, and the mushroom becomes grayish. Because of the granular texture of the flesh, it does not lend itself well to drying. Specimens producing copious quantities of milk {{may be used to}} add color to marinades.|$|E

500|$|The {{citizens}} of Leningrad {{were subjected to}} heavy bombardment and a siege that would last 872 days and starve {{more than a million}} people to death, of whom approximately 400,000 were children below the age of 14. The German-Finnish blockade cut off access to food, fuel and raw materials, and rations reached a low, for the non-working population, of four ounces (five <b>thin</b> <b>slices)</b> of bread and a little watery soup per day. Starving Soviet civilians began to eat their domestic animals, along with hair tonic and Vaseline. Some desperate citizens resorted to cannibalism; Soviet records list 2,000 people arrested for [...] "the use of human meat as food" [...] during the siege, 886 of them during the first winter of 1941–42. The Wehrmacht planned to seal off Leningrad, starve out the population, and then demolish the city entirely.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of Anomalocaris ("abnormal shrimp") was a comedy of errors. The name was initially {{given to a}} fossil that looked like the rear end of a shrimp-like crustacean. Walcott classified a ring-like fossil he called Peytoia {{as a kind of}} jellyfish, and another poorly preserved fossil he called Laggania as a holothurian (sea cucumber). After many plot twists, Derek Briggs started dissecting another ill-defined fossil in very <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> and found a pair of Anomalocaris-like structures on one end of a specimen of Laggania, which also had a specimen of Peytoia attached just behind those of Anomalocaris. After dissecting more specimens and finding similar configurations, Briggs and Whittington concluded that the whole assemblage represented a single animal, which was named Anomalocaris because that was the earliest name assigned to any of its parts. This animal's body was fragile and usually disintegrated before it could be fossilized. But the complete animal had tough grasping appendages (Anomalocaris), a tough, ring-like mouth with teeth on the inner edge (Peytoia) and a long, segmented body (Laggania) with flaps on the sides that enabled it to swim with a Mexican wave motion, and perhaps to turn quickly by putting the flaps on one side into reverse. This monster was over [...] long when other animals were only a few inches at most. Nedin suggested in 1999 that the animal was capable of taking heavily armored trilobites apart, possibly by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock {{the other end of the}} animal back and forth, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. In 2009 Hagadorn found that anomalocarid mouthparts showed little wear, which suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells. Computer modeling of the Anomalocaris mouthparts suggests they were in fact better suited to sucking on smaller, soft-bodied organisms. Although Whittington and Briggs concluded that Anomalocaris did not fit into any known phylum, research since the 1990s has concluded that it was closely related to Opabinia and to the ancestors of arthropods. In 2009 a fossil named Schinderhannes bartelsi, an apparent relative of Anomalocaris, was found in the Early Devonian period, about 100million years later than the Burgess Shale.|$|E

40|$|Background & objectives: With {{improvement}} in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, breast conserving therapy (BCT) is being increasingly used. Precise preoperative evaluation of the incision margin is, therefore, very important. Utilizing three dimentional (3 D) images in a preoperative evaluation for breast conserving surgery has considerable significance, but the currently 3 D CT scan reconstruction commonly used has problems in accurately displaying breast cancer. <b>Thin</b> <b>slice</b> 3 D reconstruction is also widely used now to delineate organs and tissues of breast cancers. This study was aimed to compare 3 D CT with <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> 3 D reconstruction in breast cancer patients {{to find a better}} technique for accurate evaluation of breast cancer. Methods: A total of 16 -slice spiral CT scans and 3 D reconstructions were performed on 15 breast cancer patients. All patients had been treated with modified radical mastectomy; 2 D and 3 D images of breast and tumours were obtained. The specimens were fixed and sliced at 2 mm thickness to obtain serial <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> images, and reconstructed using 3 D DOCTOR software to gain 3 D images. Results: Compared with 2 D CT images, <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> images showed more clearly the morphological characteristics of tumour, breast tissues and the margins of different tissues in each slice. After 3 D reconstruction, the tumour shapes obtained by the two reconstruction methods were basically the same, but the <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> 3 D reconstruction showed the tumour margins more clearly. Interpretation & conclusions: Compared with 3 D CT reconstruction, <b>thin</b> <b>slice</b> 3 D reconstruction of breast tumour gave clearer images, which could provide guidance for the observation and application of CT 3 D reconstructed images and contribute to the accurate evaluation of tumours using CT imaging technology...|$|R

2500|$|Potato chips, {{also known}} as crisps in British English, are <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> of potato that are deep fried or baked until crispy. Potato chips serve as an appetizer, side dish, or snack. The basic chips are cooked and salted, and {{additional}} varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings, herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives. The original potato chip recipe was invented by chef George Crum at Moon's Lake House near Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 24, 1853. Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes back complaining that they were too thick and soggy, Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin {{that they could not}} be eaten with a fork. As they could not be fried normally in a pan, he decided to stir-fry the potato slices. Against Crum's expectation, the guest was ecstatic about the new chips and they soon became a regular item on the lodge's menu, and were known as [...] "Saratoga chips".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Voronoff's {{negative}} {{reputation was}} softened. In November 1991, {{one of the}} oldest peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, The Lancet, suggested that the file on Voronoff's work be reopened and in particular that [...] "the Medical Research Council should fund further studies on monkey glands." [...] By 1994, there were calls for a qualified apology from the orthodox medical establishment for dismissing Voronoff's work. In particular, since modern medicine has established that the Sertoli cells of the testes constitute a barrier to the immune system, rendering the testes an immunologically privileged site for the transplantation of foreign tissue, the <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> of monkey testicles Voronoff implanted into the patient's testicles may in theory have survived to produce some benefit. There have recently been successful experiments reducing insulin requirements in diabetics by implanting into them pancreatic islet cells from pigs coated in Sertoli cells to insulate them from attack by the immune system. [...] No immunosuppressive drugs were required. In 1998, the sweeping popularity of Viagra brought forth references to Voronoff.|$|E
