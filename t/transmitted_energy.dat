It turned out that 50 cm was a standard wavelength that German defensive radars used, which made Window a very effective way of blinding all their defensive radar systems, following its introduction in the Hamburg raid of 24 July 1943.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{carry out}} a {{comprehensive}} study of the resource costs of distributed averaging consensus in wireless sensor networks. In particular, we consider two metrics appropriate to the wireless medium: total <b>transmit</b> <b>energy</b> and time-bandwidth product. Most previous approaches, such as gossip algorithms, suppose a graphical network, which abstracts away crucial features of the wireless medium, and measure resource consumption {{only in terms of}} the total number of transmissions required to achieve consensus. Under a path-loss dominated protocol interference model, we study the performance of several popular gossip algorithms, showing that they are nearly order-optimal with respect to <b>transmit</b> <b>energy</b> but strictly sub-optimal with respect to time-bandwidth product. We also propose a new scheme, termed hierarchical averaging, which is tailored to the wireless medium, and show that in general this approach is nearly order-optimal with respect to time-bandwidth product but strictly sub-optimal with respect to <b>transmit</b> <b>energy.</b> For the special case of free-space propagation, however, the proposed hierarchical scheme is approximately order-optimal with respect to both metrics.

50|$|The {{duration}} of the transmission determines {{the length of the}} pulse emitted by the antenna, which in turn corresponds to the volume of air illuminated (in electrical terms) by the radar beam. Small amounts of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>energy</b> are scattered back (referred to as backscattering) toward and received by the radar. Delays of fixed intervals are built into the data processing system so that the radar receives scattered energy from discrete altitudes, referred to as range gates. The Doppler frequency shift of the backscattered energy is determined, and then used to calculate the velocityof the air toward or away from the radar along each beam as a function of altitude. The source of the backscattered energy (radar “targets”) is small-scale turbulent fluctuations that induce irregularities in the radio refractive index of the atmosphere. The radar is most sensitive to scattering by turbulent eddies whose spatial scale is ½ the wavelength of the radar, or approximately 16 centimeters (cm) for a UHF profiler.|$|E
50|$|In some configurations, {{bistatic}} radars may {{be designed}} to operate in a fence-like configuration, detecting targets which pass between the transmitter and receiver, with the bistatic angle near 180 degrees. This is a special case of bistatic radar, known as a forward scatter radar, after the mechanism by which the <b>transmitted</b> <b>energy</b> is scattered by the target. In forward scatter, the scattering can be modeled using Babinet's principle and is a potential countermeasure to stealth aircraft as the radar cross section (RCS) is determined solely by the silhouette of the aircraft seen by the transmitter, and is unaffected by stealth coatings or shapings. The RCS in this mode is calculated as σ=4πA²/λ², where A is the silhouette area and λ is the radar wavelength. However, target may vary {{from place to place}} location and tracking is very challenging in forward scatter radars, as the information content in measurements of range, bearing and Doppler becomes very low (all these parameters tend to zero, regardless of the location of the target in the fence).|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} classes of {{communications}} satellites, passive and active. Passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source, toward {{the direction of the}} receiver. With passive satellites, the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a very small amount of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>energy</b> actually reaches the receiver. Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to free-space path loss, so the signal received on Earth is very, very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground. Passive satellites were the first communications satellites, but are little used now.Telstar was the second active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to AT&T as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, Bell Telephone Laboratories, NASA, the British General Post Office, and the French National PTT (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on July 10, 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch. Relay 1 was launched on December 13, 1962, and it became the first satellite to transmit across the Pacific Ocean on November 22, 1963.|$|E

5000|$|Instead of light, {{this method}} employs {{ultrasound}} for collecting {{information on the}} particles that are dispersed in fluid. Dispersed particles absorb and scatter ultrasound similarly to light. This has been known since Lord Rayleigh developed the first theory of ultrasound scattering and published a book [...] "The Theory of Sound" [...] in 1878. There have been hundreds of papers studying ultrasound propagation through fluid particulates in the 20th century. It turns out that instead of measuring scattered energy versus angle, as with light, {{in the case of}} ultrasound, measuring the <b>transmitted</b> <b>energy</b> versus frequency is a better choice. The resulting ultrasound attenuation frequency spectra are the raw data for calculating particle size distribution. It can be measured for any fluid system with no dilution or other sample preparation. This is a big advantage of this method. Calculation of particle size distribution is based on theoretical models that are well verified for up to 50% by volume of dispersed particles. However, as concentration increases and the particle sizes approach the nanoscale, conventional modelling gives way to the necessity to include shear-wave re-conversion effects in order for the models to accurately reflect the real attenuation spectra.|$|E
50|$|A {{traffic counter}} is a device, often {{electronic}} in nature, used to count, classify, and/or measure {{the speed of}} vehicular traffic passing along a given roadway. The device is usually deployed in near proximity to the roadway and uses an on-road medium, such as pneumatic road tubes laid across the roadway, piezo-electric sensors embedded in the roadway, inductive loops cut into the roadway, {{or a combination of}} these to detect the passing vehicles. Pneumatic road tubes are generally used for temporary studies to study a sample of traffic, while piezo-electric sensors and inductive loops are used for permanent studies which can ascertain seasonal traffic trends and are often used in congestion monitoring on major roads. One of the first traffic counting units, called traffic recorders, was introduced in 1937, operated off a strip laid across the street, and used a six volt battery. Each hour it printed off a paper strip with the total for that hour. Recently, off-road technologies have been developed. These devices generally use some sort of <b>transmitted</b> <b>energy</b> such as radar waves or infrared beams to detect vehicles passing over the roadway. These methods are generally employed where vehicle speeds and volume are required without classification which require on-road sensors.|$|E
