I'm simply <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what any sensible girl would see {{she had to}} do. You think it over--both sides of the question--before you absolutely decide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all day," [...] she continued, [...] "but {{you have been}} too engrossed. Yesterday {{afternoon}} I went to see Mr. Grier at the Atlas Theatre. I had my voice tried, and to-morrow night I am {{going to take a}} small part in the new musical comedy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{all this}} while!" [...] said I, [...] "that you had best leave me alone, whom {{you can make}} no more unhappy if you tried, and turn your {{attention}} to James More, your father, with whom you are {{like to have a}} queer pirn to wind." ...|$|E

A {{foreigner}} can't be expected to know any better. I am an Englishman, and I know a gentleman at sight. I should know one drunk, in the gutter, in jail, under the gallows. There's a something--it isn't exactly the appearance, it's a--no use me <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You ain't an Englishman, and if you were, you wouldn't need to be told." ...|$|E

Cowmen who had {{themselves}} branded cattle not their own. This was a practice. They didn't think it crooked. They all did it. But it was crooked, when you come down to truth. And though {{that may not be}} legally as criminal as the stealing of branded cattle, to my mind it is just as bad. Your father began that way, Hardman caught him, and perhaps forced him into worse practice." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} Pitt," [...] said his lordship. [...] "He's a dashed good fellow, Pitt. I {{wish there were}} more like him. And he wasn't {{pinching}} the stuff, either. If you had only listened when he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> you mightn't be in such a frightful hole. He was putting the things back, as he said. I know all about it. Well, what's the answer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Facts," [...] {{returned}} her companion, [...] "don't count for much with me. I deal in impressions; and sometimes I feel full of them. I could astonish everybody if I {{could get them}} out; but that, of course, is the difficulty. Feeling, unfortunately, isn't quite {{the same thing as}} power of expression. Still, you asked me what I thought about these mountains, and I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You have brought it on yourself, you see. The key-tone of this place is an almost overwhelming tranquillity. One rather shrinks from that kind of thing when one is not used to it, and longs to do something to disturb it. It's a natural impulse. When you see a smooth sheet of ice you generally look for a big stone with which to smash it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be disturbed, mother; I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all I think. We were friends, but I imagine Kit {{knows his}} {{drawbacks}} from {{our point of}} view. Besides, after father quarreled with Peter Askew I never sent Kit a message, and he must have thought I acquiesced. In a way, I did acquiesce; {{it was the best thing}} to be done. You see what this implied? If I had loved him, it meant I had no pluck and was ashamed to acknowledge a farmer's son. But he knew I did not love him and understood that our friendship would not bear the strain of father's disapproval. Either way, it hinted that I was weak and not worth pursuing. Well, he met me without embarrassment and we talked about nothing important. I may meet him now and then, but that, I think, is all." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am going}} to tell you the history of the most {{wonderful}} people who ever lived. But I have to begin with a good deal that is not true; for the people who descended from Japhet’s son Javan, and lived in the beautiful islands and peninsulas called Greece, were not trained in the knowledge of God like the Israelites, but had to guess for themselves. They made strange stories, partly from the old beliefs they brought from the east, partly from their ways of speaking of the powers of nature—sky, sun, moon, stars, and clouds—as if they were real beings, and so again of good or bad qualities as beings also, and partly from old stories about their forefathers. These stories got mixed up with their belief, and came to be part of their religion and history; and they wrote beautiful poems about them, and made such lovely statues in their honour, that nobody can understand anything about art or learning who has not learnt these stories. I must begin with <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a few of them.|$|E
60|$|I looked round. There {{was only}} Maria in the lonely hall. Shall I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what my sensations were? It may sound strangely, {{but it is}} true--I felt like a sleeper, who has half-awakened from a dream.|$|R
6000|$|... "But lest {{you might}} misunderstand, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} {{of what is}} on my mind, and I want you to read it to Ben. He has been hurt by my strange reluctance to be with him.|$|R
60|$|But {{soon they}} gained courage {{to look more}} closely at the Peculiar Person. As he was a type of all the {{inhabitants}} of this extraordinary land whom they afterward met, I will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what he looked like.|$|R
60|$|I do not {{remember}} at all clearly what I wrote to her. It has disappeared from existence. But it was certainly a long letter. Throughout this book I have been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the growth of my views of life and its purpose, from my childish dreams and Harbury attitudes to those ideas of human development that have made me undertake the work I do. It is not glorious work I know, {{as the work of}} great artists and poets and leaders is glorious, but it is what I find best suits my gifts and my want of gifts. Greater men will come at last to build within my scaffoldings. In some summary phrasing I must have set out the gist of this. I must have explained my sense of the supreme importance of mental clarification in human life. All this is manifest in her reply. And I think too I did my best to tell her plainly the faith that was in me, and why life seemed worth while to me....|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you make}} me laugh," [...] she reproached him, [...] "when the matter is so serious? What I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is that I'm sure Mr. Hodder has worked it out. He's too sincere {{to remain in the}} Church and not have {{something}} constructive and satisfying. I've always said that he seemed to have a truth shut up inside of him which he could not communicate. Well, now he looks as though he were about to communicate it, as though he had discovered it. I suppose you think me silly, but you'll grant, whatever Mr. Hodder may be, he isn't silly. And women can feel these things. You know I'm not given to sentimentality, but I was never so impressed by the growth in any personality as I was this morning by his. He seems to have become himself, as I always imagined him. And, Phil, he was so fine! He's absolutely incapable of posing, as you'll admit, and he stood right up and acknowledged that he'd been wrong in our argument. He hasn't had the services all summer, and when he resumes them next Sunday I gathered that he intends to make his new position clear." ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{people say}} that {{improbable}} things don't necessarily happen in India--but these people never find improbabilities anywhere. This sounds clever, but you will at once perceive that it really means {{the opposite of what}} I intended to say. So we'll drop it. What I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is that after Sparkley had that affair with Miss Millikens a singular change came over him. He grew abstracted and solitary,--holding dark seances with himself,--which was odd, as everybody knew he never cared a rap for the Millikens girl. It was even said that he was off his head--which is rhyme. But his reason was undoubtedly affected, for he had been heard to mutter incoherently at the Club, and, strangest of all, to answer questions THAT WERE NEVER ASKED! This was so awkward in that Branch of the Civil Department of which he was a high official--where the rule was exactly the reverse--that he was presently invalided on full pay! Then he disappeared. Clever people said it was because the Department was afraid he had still much to answer for; stupid people simply envied him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> after supper. In the meanwhile, I {{can only}} say that he seems {{determined}} on breaking himself up by attempting a task that in my opinion is beyond the power of any man on the prairie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--at least, I {{want to be}} good--not {{like what}} I have been," [...] said Gwendolen. [...] "I will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bear what you think I ought to bear. I have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> the worst about myself. What ought I to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes! Agnes, my dear girl!' I said, {{bending over}} her. 'I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> {{when we met}} today, {{something}} that has been in my thoughts since Dora died. You remember, when you came down to me in our little room--pointing upward, Agnes?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is this: One night, in the Caribbean Sea, we {{ran into}} one of the Leeward Islands, that had been in olden time a {{rendezvous}} for our ship. We were piloted to our anchorage outside by my Portuguese friend, who knew the locality thoroughly, and on whose dexterity and skill we placed the greatest reliance. If anything more had been necessary to fix this circumstance in my mind, {{it would have been the}} fact that two or three days before he had assured me that I should presently have the means of honorable discharge from the pirate's crew, and a return to my native land. A launch was sent from the ship to communicate with our friends on the island, who supplied us with stores, provisions, and general information. The launch was manned by eight men, and officered by the first mate,--a grim, Puritanical, practical New Englander, if I may use such a term to describe a pirate, of great courage, experience, and physical strength. My Portuguese friend, acting as pilot, prevailed upon them to allow me to accompany the party as coxswain. I was naturally anxious, you can readily comprehend, to see--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Please {{remember}} that I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> my philosophy, and not arguing about yours. Let me try and express how {{in my mind}} this matter of negative terms has shaped itself. I think of something which I may perhaps best describe as being off the stage or out of court, or as the Void without Implications, or as Nothingness or as Outer Darkness. This {{is a sort of}} hypothetical Beyond to the visible world of human thought, and thither I think all negative terms reach at last, and merge and become nothing. Whatever positive class you make, whatever boundary you draw, straight away from that boundary begins the corresponding negative class and passes into the illimitable horizon of nothingness. You talk of pink things, you ignore, if you are a trained logician, the more elusive shades of pink, and draw your line. Beyond is the not pink, known and knowable, and still in the not pink region one comes to the Outer Darkness. Not blue, not happy, not iron, all the not classes meet in that Outer Darkness. That same Outer Darkness and nothingness is infinite space, and infinite time, and any being of infinite qualities, and all that region I rule out of court in my philosophy altogether. I will neither affirm nor deny if I can help it about any not things. I will not deal with not things at all, except by accident and inadvertence. If I use the word 'infinite' I use it as one often uses 'countless,' [...] "the countless hosts of the enemy"--or 'immeasurable'--"immeasurable cliffs"--that is to say as the limit of measurement rather than as the limit of imaginary measurability, as a convenient equivalent to as many times this cloth yard as you can, and as many again {{and so on and so}} on. Now a great number of apparently positive terms are, or have become, practically negative terms and are under the same ban with me. A considerable number of terms that have played a great part in the world of thought, seem to me to be invalidated by this same defect, to have no content or an undefined content or an unjustifiable content. For example, that word Omniscient, as implying infinite knowledge, impresses me as being a word with a delusive air of being solid and full, when it is really hollow with no content whatever. I am persuaded that knowing is the relation of a conscious being to something not itself, that the thing known is defined as a system of parts and aspects and relationships, that knowledge is comprehension, and so that only finite things can know or be known. When you talk of a being of infinite extension and infinite duration, omniscient and omnipotent and Perfect, you seem to me to be talking in negatives of nothing whatever. When you speak of the Absolute you speak to me of nothing. If however you talk of a great yet finite and thinkable being, a being not myself, extending beyond my imagination in time and space, knowing all that I can think of as known and capable of doing all that I can think of as done, you come into the sphere of my mental operations, and into the scheme of my philosophy....|$|E
6000|$|... "I let him run on, this papier-mache Mephistopheles, and {{it seemed}} to me that if I tried I could poke my {{forefinger}} through him, and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don't you see, had been planning to be assistant-manager by and by under the present man, and I could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a little. He talked precipitately, and I did not try to stop him. I had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal. The smell of mud, of primeval mud, by Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek. The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver--over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple, over the great river I could see through a sombre gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur. All this was great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about himself. I wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace. What were we who had strayed in here? Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us? I felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that couldn't talk, and perhaps was deaf as well. What was in there? I could see a little ivory coming out from there, and I had heard Mr. Kurtz was in there. I had heard enough about it, too--God knows! Yet somehow it didn't bring any image with it--no more than if I had been told an angel or a fiend was in there. I believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet Mars. I knew once a Scotch sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter something about 'walking on all-fours.' If you as much as smiled, he would--though a man of sixty--offer to fight you. I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie. You know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies--which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world--what I want to forget. It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe. I became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see--you understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything? It seems to me I am <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a dream--making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams...." ...|$|E
