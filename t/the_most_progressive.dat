5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and is among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>progressive</b> {{in the developed}} world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and {{about half of all}} taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
