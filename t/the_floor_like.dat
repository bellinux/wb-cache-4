5|$|The castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the county gaol after the war and in 1653 a new gaol, built from stone and brick, was constructed in the castle grounds. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard inspected the gaol and was very critical of the facility. In particular he complained about the castle's underground dungeon, accessed down a flight of 26 steps; the room was circular, 18 feet (5.5 m) across, and guarded by an iron grill. Worcester conducted extensive work after the report at a cost of £3,431 (£364,000 at 2009 prices), and by 1788 the prison had 18 new cells for men and two for women, in addition to the dungeon and the sick-rooms. Nevertheless, it was housing 74 inmates at the time of Howard's inspection, with two prisoners routinely sharing each cell, sleeping together on <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>Like</b> other prisons of the time, Worcester Castle was run as a private enterprise, in this case by a local butcher, who was paid £150 a year (£15,400) to run the facility. The prison was known to suffer from outbreaks of gaol fever, which claimed the life of a local doctor who visited the facility.|$|E
25|$|The other {{dominant}} {{center of}} the early 1990s was David Robinson. Playing college ball at the United States Naval Academy, his entry into the NBA was delayed by his military service, but he unanimously won the Rookie of the Year Award in 1990 and, in 1995, was voted the MVP. Offensively, Robinson excelled in fast-breaks, running <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> no 7-footer (2.13 m and above) before or since, while also possessing an effective left-hand jumper. Defensively, his speed and agility helped him hold {{the distinction of being}} the only player in NBA history to rank among the top five in rebounds, blocks and steals in a single season.|$|E
2500|$|Knight got {{the ball}} in the left front court and faked a drive into the middle. Then [...] crossed over like he worked on it all his life and drove right in and laid it up. That tied the game for us, and Knight ran clear across <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> a 100-yard dash {{sprinter}} and ran right at me and said, 'See there, coach, I should have been in that game a long time ago!' ...|$|E

The new 115-room hotel opened as the [...] "Hotel in Old Town" [...] in 1999. The hotel has purchased what it {{claims to be the}} [...] "largest authentic collection ever assembled" [...] of Keen Kutter hardware which are displayed on all <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>like</b> a private museum focusing on Keen Kutter and old Wichita.|$|R
2500|$|The Dorothy Vernon {{room in the}} Deanery was {{designed}} by {{the architects of the}} second renovation, Archer and Allen, and Lockwood de Forest. De Forest decorated the spaces between the dark, exposed ceiling beams with decorative brass panels with East Indian patterns. <b>The</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>like</b> several other spaces on campus, was of Mercer tiles as per the request of Thomas herself as seen a 1908 letter to Mercer when she notes, [...] "It {{seems to me that this}} large room would not be complete unless it had a tile floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rabana is a flat faced {{circular}} {{drum and}} comes in several sizes. The large Rabana has {{to be placed on}} <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> a circular short-legged table and several people (especially the womenfolk) can sit around it and beat on it with both hands. This is used in festivals such as the Sinhalese New Year and ceremonies such as weddings. The resounding beat of the Rabana symbolizes the joyous moods of the occasion. [...] The small Rabana is a form of mobile drum beat, since the player carries it wherever he goes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesigned}} WJ 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127parts {{with its}} predecessor (mostly fasteners). The European model was coded WG. The spare tire was relocated {{from the side}} of the cargo compartment to under <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> (<b>Like</b> the 1998 ZJ, the rear tailgate glass opened separately.) The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler's then-new PowerTech. The new V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on road performance figures (the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity). The straight-six engine was also updated in 1999. A redesign of the intake manifold added [...] While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider bolt pattern:– 5 x 5.|$|E

2500|$|After {{carrying}} out the shooting, the gunmen calmly walked away. Shortly after, a married couple came upon {{the scene of the}} killings and began praying beside the victims. They found the badly-wounded Alan Black lying in a ditch. When an ambulance arrived, Black was taken to hospital in Newry, where he was operated on and survived. The Catholic worker, Richard Hughes, had managed to stop a car and was driven to Bessbrook RUC station, where he raised the alarm. One of the first police officers on the scene was Billy McCaughey, who had taken part in the Reavey killings. He said [...] "When we arrived it was utter carnage. Men were lying two or three together. Blood was flowing, mixed with water from the rain". Some of the Reavey family also came upon the scene of the Kingsmill massacre while driving to hospital to collect the bodies of their relatives. Johnston Chapman, the uncle of victims Reginald and Walter Chapman, said the dead workmen were [...] "just lying there like dogs, blood everywhere". At least two of the victims were so badly mutilated by gunfire that immediate relatives were prevented from identifying them. One relative said the hospital mortuary [...] "was like a butcher's shop with bodies lying on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> slabs of meat".|$|E
2500|$|There he had {{a temple}} built, {{and it was a}} {{sizeable}} building, with a door on the side-wall near the gable. The high-seat pillars were placed inside the door, and nails, that were called holy nails , were driven into them. Beyond that point, the temple was a sanctuary. At the inner end there was a structure similar to the choir in churches nowadays and there was a raised platform in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> an altar, where a ring weighing twenty ounces and fashioned without a join was placed, and all oaths had to be sworn on this ring. It also had to be worn by the temple priest at all public gatherings. A sacrificial bowl [...] was placed on the platform and in it a sacrificial twig like a priest's aspergillumwhich was used to sprinkle blood from the bowl. This blood, which was called sacrificial blood , was the blood of live animals offered to the gods. The gods were placed around the platform in the choir-like structure within the temple. All farmers had to pay a toll to the temple [...] [...] [...] [...] The temple godi was responsible for the upkeep of the temple and ensuring it was maintained properly, as well as for holding sacrificial feasts in it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, British {{director}} John Doyle directed the musical at the Chichester Festival Theatre. The production was dark in concept and featured new orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. [...] On a spare stage, decorated only with blue sheets, [...] "Confetti of rose petals stains <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> drops of blood, and a nightmarish dream-dance sequence has Freudian overtones as Laurey's bridal gown becomes her shroud." [...] It received mixed reviews. [...] The Times reviewer wrote: [...] "This is a very stylised, overdrilled production, no friend of intimate moments or quiet depth of emotion." [...] The Guardian liked it the most, stating that [...] "it's a delight, with one brilliant tippy-tappy-toed song after another and a nugget of darkness lodged in its sweet heart." [...] Whats On Stage, {{like most of the}} papers, gave the show three out of five stars and wrote that this is a [...] "downbeat vision" [...] and that [...] "all told it's a somewhat disappointing show", but their [...] "average reader rating" [...] was four stars. A review in The Telegraph commented, [...] "Doyle uses shadow and silhouette to bring out the musical's nightmarish aspects but doesn't over-labour them. There are enough sunny spots – no more so than in Act 2's rousing title song – to keep the tone evenly textured." ...|$|E
25|$|Highland dancing {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Scottish country dancing which is both a social dance (that is, a dance which is danced with a partner or partners) like ballroom dancing, and a formation dance (that is, a dance in which an important element is the pattern of group movement about <b>the</b> dance <b>floor)</b> <b>like</b> square dancing.|$|R

60|$|Well, I {{went into}} the big hut, and there found Nandie and some other women, also a native doctor or two.

50|$|The {{interior}} of the building was open plan, with <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> and roof being supported by iron girders and large internal columns of reinforced concrete. <b>The</b> <b>floors,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> roof, were of concrete slab construction, and also early examples of their type in Queensland.

The building was completed in time for the 1913 Christmas trade, with the shop windows carrying brilliant displays of electroplated Birmingham silverware. The new building marked the development of Michael Boland's business into one of the first modern department stores in North Queensland. It allowed the further organisation and growth of separate departments providing customers with an extensive choice of goods and services. The firm was able to cater not only to the local trade but also to visitors from all over the vast hinterland for which Cairns was the centre.|$|R
