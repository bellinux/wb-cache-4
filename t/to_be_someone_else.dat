This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
25|$|Roger Ramey {{sent the}} demo tape out to every major label in Nashville, and {{was met with}} a solid wall of {{rejection}} by them all. After a month of not getting anywhere, out of desperation to help his sister, {{he decided to take}} a chance with MCA Nashville. MCA, being the industry leader at the time was his first choice of labels. Taking a cassette of the five song demo of Loveless, Roger bluffed his way past the receptionist of Tony Brown, the head of A (Artist & Repertoire – in charge of finding and developing new talent) by pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> who was late for an appointment.|$|E

He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, [...] "I've always known I haven't a personality of my own, I have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to be happy. That's why I became an actor, I suppose." ...|$|E

500|$|The men of {{the village}} join in a rousing {{drinking}} song ("To beer!"), while Jeník and Kecal argue the merits, respectively, of love and money over beer. The women enter, and the whole group joins in dancing a furiant. Away from the jollity the nervous Vašek muses over his forthcoming marriage in a stuttering song ("My-my-my mother said to me"). Mařenka appears, and guesses immediately who he is, but does not reveal her own identity. Pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> she paints a picture of [...] "Mařenka" [...] as a treacherous deceiver. Vašek is easily fooled, and when Mařenka, in her false guise, pretends to woo him ("I know of a maiden fair"), he falls for her charms and swears to give Mařenka up.|$|E

2500|$|Another Colbert {{neologism}} {{related to}} Wikipedia is [...] "Wikilobbying", regarding which he stated [...] "when money determines Wikipedia entries, reality {{has become a}} commodity". He alluded to a case involving controversy over whether governments should reject a Microsoft document format {{in favor of an}} independent standard, during which Microsoft allegedly hired a Linux user to edit Wikipedia to ensure neutral and factual coverage of Microsoft's version. Colbert used the term [...] "self-determination" [...] to refer to corporations being able to act out their fantasies online by editing their own Wikipedia entries.

As of April 1, 2016, there are 17 Marzipan's Answering Machines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{responses}} of nearly 1200 {{children and young people}} in Wales who <b>were</b> asked <b>to</b> identify which three famous people they most admired and which three they most disliked. Analysis of these young people’s responses reveals a number of sociological and educational issues. Their selections confirm other research which has highlighted the importance of celebrities in the lives of young people. Their ‘heroes’ and ‘villains’ are drawn mostly from the worlds of popular music and sport. Their choices are also highly gendered and ‘raced’. Of particular interest is the finding that <b>someone’s</b> ‘villain’ <b>is</b> more than likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else’s</b> ‘hero’. Our young people’s selection of heroes and villains reflects the broader landscape of celebrity culture, where female fame is as much about appearance as talent and Black and minority ethnic celebrities <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found largely in the fields of sport or popular music. The paper concludes by discussing the chasm between our young people’s ‘heroes’ and ‘villains’ and those which are ‘officially sanctioned’ within the school curriculum and considers what schools and teachers might do about it...|$|R
