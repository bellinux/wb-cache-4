5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced {{that it would be}} impossible <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>delivery</b> of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, IndiGo was the second-fastest-growing {{low-cost}} carrier in Asia behind Indonesian airline Lion Air. In February 2013, {{following the}} announcement of the civil aviation ministry that it would allow IndiGo <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>delivery</b> of only five aircraft that year, the airline planned to introduce low-cost regional flights by setting up a subsidiary. Later, IndiGo announced that it planned to seek permission from the ministry to acquire four more aircraft, therefore taking delivery of nine aircraft in 2013. As of March 2014, IndiGo is the second-largest low-cost carrier in Asia in terms of seats flown.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{submarines}} were complete when World War I {{began in}} August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians {{became convinced that}} it would be impossible <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>delivery</b> of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then awarded Kriegsauftrag D, hence the type was known as UD.|$|E

5|$|Northolt pre-dates the {{establishment}} of the Royal Air Force by almost three years, having opened in May 1915. Originally established for the Royal Flying Corps, it has the longest history of continuous use of any RAF airfield. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, the station was the first <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>delivery</b> of the Hawker Hurricane. The station played a key role during the Battle of Britain, when fighters from several of its units, including No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron, engaged enemy aircraft as part of the defence of London. It became the first base to have squadrons operating Supermarine Spitfire aircraft within German airspace.|$|E
5|$|U-9 {{was laid}} down on 31 December 1913, {{the third of}} the U-7 boats. Her {{construction}} was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months. Neither U-9 nor any of her sister boats were complete when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced {{that it would be}} impossible <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>delivery</b> of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-9 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|Eastern Air Lines {{operated}} {{the first commercial}} 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route. On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B trijets. Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and Air Europe also began 757 operations later that year. Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners. Transition courses eased pilots' introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose. Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>delivery</b> of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn {{and the use of}} a two-crew member flight deck. Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.|$|E
50|$|On 2 February 2015, Scoot <b>took</b> <b>delivery</b> of {{its first}} of 10 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners the airline has on order. The {{aircraft}} entered service on 5 February 2015 and was deployed on the Singapore - Perth route. It then was operated on the Singapore - Hong Kong route the next day. As Scoot continues <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>deliveries</b> of the Boeing 787, the airline expects to phase out all six of its aging Boeing 777 aircraft acquired from parent company Singapore Airlines. Scoot will then begin to transition to operating an all Boeing 787 fleet. Once the transition is complete, Scoot will operate a total of 20 Boeing 787 Dreamliners.|$|R

The [...] "Hispano-Nieuport" [...] (as it was known) was unpopular in Spanish service, {{being described}} as heavy and unresponsive, {{while it was}} slower than expected, with Spanish aircraft only able to reach 225km/h (140mph) compared with the 260km/h (162mph) claimed by Nieuport. Losses to accidents were heavy, with only 56 remaining when the Spanish Civil War broke out on 18 July 1936.|$|R
5|$|Returning to Australia in 1938, Hewitt was {{appointed}} senior air staff officer at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and by July that year had been promoted wing commander. In May 1939, {{he was chosen}} to lead No.10 Squadron, due to be formed on 1July at the recently established RAAF Station Rathmines, near Lake Macquarie. Hewitt was preparing to depart for England <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>delivery</b> of the unit's planned complement of Short Sunderland flying boats when he broke his neck riding his motor cycle near Richmond, and had to forgo the assignment while he recovered. Fit for duty by August, he was given command of the Rathmines base to manage the deployment of No.10 Squadron and its aircraft, but this was suspended due to the outbreak of World WarII in September, and the Sunderlands and their RAAF crews remained in Britain for service alongside the RAF.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF and RAN {{took part}} in the Battle of the Atlantic. No.10Squadron, based in Britain at the {{outbreak}} of war <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>delivery</b> of its Short Sunderland flying boats, remained there throughout the conflict as part of RAF Coastal Command. It was joined by No.461Squadron in April 1942, also equipped with Sunderlands. These squadrons escorted Allied convoys and sank 12U-boats. No.455Squadron also formed part of Coastal Command from April 1942 as an anti-shipping squadron equipped with light bombers. In this role the squadron made an unusual deployment to Vaenga air base in the Soviet Union in September 1942 to protect Convoy PQ 18. Hundreds of Australian airmen also served in RAF Coastal Command squadrons. In addition to the RAAF's contribution, several of the RAN's cruisers and destroyers escorted shipping in the Atlantic and Caribbean and hundreds of RAN personnel served aboard Royal Navy ships in the Atlantic throughout the war.|$|E
