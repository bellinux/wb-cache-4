40|$|The {{considered}} problem {{consists in}} optimizing the refueling {{costs of a}} fleet of locomotives over a railway network. The goal consists in determining the number of <b>trucks</b> contracted <b>for</b> each <b>yard</b> (<b>truck</b> assignment problem) and to determine the refueling plan of each locomotive (fuel distribution problem), while minimizing the costs and satisfying constraints. A two-levels approach is proposed to tackle this NP-hard problem. Three metaheuristics (namely a descent procedure, a tabu search, and an ant local search algorithm) are proposed <b>for</b> the <b>truck</b> assignment level, and a flow model is designed for the fuel distribution level. A post-optimization procedure can be combined with the latter flow model. Six algorithms are proposed for the whole problem, and were tested on a realistic instance proposed by the Railway Applications Section of INFORMS. Competitive results were obtained. A strength of the proposed approach is its flexibility, {{as it can be}} easily adapted to non linear cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{two-level}} problem {{studied in}} this article consists of optimizing the refueling costs of a fleet of locomotives over a railway network. The goal consists of determining: (1) the number of refueling <b>trucks</b> contracted <b>for</b> each <b>yard</b> (<b>truck</b> assignment problem denoted TAP) and (2) the refueling plan of each locomotive (fuel distribution problem denoted FDP). As the FDP can be solved efficiently with existing methods, the focus is put on the TAP only. In a first version of the problem (denoted (P 1)), various linear costs (e. g., fuel, fixed cost associated with each refueling, weekly operating costs of trucks) have to be minimized while satisfying a set of constraints (e. g., limited capacities of the locomotives and the trucks). In contrast with the existing literature on this problem, two types of nonlinear cost components will also be considered, based on the following ideas: (1) if several trucks from the same fuel supplier are contracted <b>for</b> the same <b>yard,</b> the supplier is likely to propose discounted prices <b>for</b> that <b>yard</b> (Problem (P 2)); (2) if a train stops too often on its route, a penalty is incurred, which represents the dissatisfaction of the clients (Problem (P 3)). Even if exact methods based on a mixed integer linear program formulation are available for (P 1), they are not appropriate anymore to tackle (P 2) and (P 3). Various methods are proposed for the TAP: a descent local search, a tabu search, and a learning tabu search (LTS). The latter is {{a new type of}} local search algorithm. It involves a learning process relying on a trail system, and it can be applied to any combinatorial optimization problem. Results are reported and discussed for a large set of instances (for (P 1), (P 2), and (P 3)), and show the good performance of LTS...|$|R
