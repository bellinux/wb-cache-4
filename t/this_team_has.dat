They are currently playing in the National League North, the highest level in the club's history following two consecutive promotions, beating town rivals Ashton United in the playoffs.

25|$|The {{following}} year Kilkenny retained their National League and Leinster titles {{before reaching the}} championship decider yet again. Cork, who were attempting to capture their own three-in-a-row, provided the opposition; however, victory went to a superior Kilkenny side. In 2007 ‘the Cats’ won an unprecedented ninth Leinster title from ten campaigns. They later reached the All-Ireland final where they defeated Limerick GAA to win their thirtieth championship title. In 2008 they won the Leinster title before defeating Waterford in the All-Ireland final. <b>This</b> <b>team</b> <b>has</b> been called the best team ever to play the sport. Later in the year Kilkenny {{went on to win}} the All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship. Combined with the All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship title, the All-Ireland Intermediate Hurling Championship title (which is broadly a competition for the second string county teams) and of course the senior title: this marks a quadruple. The achievement was unique and marks a high point in the dominance of hurling by Kilkenny teams. In 2009, Kilkenny's dominance was lessened and it was suggested that they were entering a decline. They saw off an emerging Dublin side in the Leinster final thanks to two goals from Martin Comerford. Nevertheless, they reached the final and secured a four-in-a-row with a five-point win over old rivals, Tipperary who mounted a formidable challenge to their crown in an absorbing final which made up for the mis-matches of the two previous years when only token resistance was presented by Limerick and Waterford. Kilkenny became the first team since Cork in the 1940s to do the four in a row.|$|E
