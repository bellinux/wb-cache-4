5|$|Clement criticizes Greek paganism in the Protrepticus on {{the basis}} that its deities are both false and poor moral examples, and he attacks the mystery {{religions}} for their obscurantism and trivial rituals. In particular, the worshippers of Dionysus are ridiculed for their ritual use of children's toys. He suggests at some points that the pagan deities are based on humans, but at others that they are misanthropic demons, and he cites several classical sources in support of this second hypothesis. Clement, like many pre-Nicene fathers, writes favourably about Euhemerus and other rationalist philosophers, on the grounds that <b>they</b> <b>at</b> least saw the flaws in paganism. However, his greatest praise is reserved for Plato, whose apophatic views of God prefigure Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Now {{that he was}} a reservist, Matsui {{had more}} time to pursue his pan-Asian project. Between October and December 1935 he toured the major cities of China and Manchukuo {{speaking}} to Chinese politicians and businessmen about pan-Asianism and setting up a new branch of the Greater Asia Association in Tianjin. Upon his return to Japan in December 1935 he became President of the Greater Asia Association. In February and March 1936, amid ongoing tension with China, Matsui made a second trip to China, this time on a government-sponsored goodwill tour. Matsui met personally with Chiang, and though he found little common ground with him, <b>they</b> <b>at</b> least were united in their anti-communism. Matsui came out of the meeting believing that joint anti-communism could be the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. Then in December 1936, following the Xi'an Incident, Chiang agreed to join with the Communist Party of China to resist Japan, a move that Matsui viewed as a personal betrayal.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Olybrius and Placidia were engaged in 455, and only after Gaiseric freed her from his possession in the early 460s were <b>they</b> <b>at</b> last married.

25|$|The partly autobiographical Lykke-Per (1898–1904) (Lucky Per), {{perhaps his}} most famous novel, deals with the self-confident, richly gifted man who breaks with his {{religious}} family {{in order to be}} an engineer and a conqueror, free of heritage and milieu.

25|$|Why do we in this feast carry candles? Because the Gentiles {{dedicated}} {{the month}} of February to the infernal gods, and as {{at the beginning of}} it Pluto stole Proserpine, and her mother Ceres sought her in the night with lighted candles, so <b>they,</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the month, walked about the city with lighted candles. Because the holy fathers could not extirpate the custom, they ordained that Christians should carry about candles in honor of the Blessed Virgin; and thus what was done before in the honor of Ceres is now done in honor of the Blessed Virgin.|$|E
25|$|The Associated Press reports, {{based on}} {{interviews}} in California and Egypt, that trafficking of children for domestic labor in the U.S. includes an extension of an illegal but common practice in Africa. Families in remote villages send their daughters to work in cities for extra money {{and the opportunity to}} escape a dead-end life. Some girls work for free on the understanding that <b>they</b> <b>at</b> least will be better fed in the home of their employer. This custom has led to the spread of trafficking, as well-to-do Africans accustomed to employing children immigrate into the U.S.|$|E

25|$|On the {{simplest}} level, Hogarth portrays {{the inhabitants of}} Beer Street as happy and healthy, nourished by the native English ale, and {{those who live in}} Gin Lane as destroyed by their addiction to the foreign spirit of gin; but, as with so many of Hogarth's works, closer inspection uncovers other targets of his satire, and reveals that the poverty of Gin Lane and the prosperity of Beer Street are more intimately connected than <b>they</b> <b>at</b> first appear. Gin Lane shows shocking scenes of infanticide, starvation, madness, decay and suicide, while Beer Street depicts industry, health, bonhomie and thriving commerce.|$|E

25|$|In Manila in {{the early}} hours of January 30, 1911, people were awakened out of their sleep by what <b>they</b> <b>at</b> first took for loud thunder. The {{illusion}} was heightened when great streaks of lightning were seen to illumine the southern sky. Those who investigated further, however, soon learned the truth. A huge, fan-shaped cloud of what looked like black smoke rose to a great height. It was crossed and crisscrossed with a brilliant electrical display, which the people of Manila at first took for lightning. This cloud finally shot up in the air, spread, then dissipated, and this marked the culmination of the eruption, at about 2:30 a. m.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Kings of the Picts were derived from a sept of the Eóganachta. If so, then the Eóganacht Locha Léin, and thus the ancestors of the O'Moriartys and others, are the most obvious candidates. Not only were <b>they</b> <b>at</b> one point expansive as the powerful Kingdom of Iarmuman, but they were also frustrated by their exclusion and forced isolation by the inner circle. Glaringly, they were said to descend from a Pictish woman, and this was sometimes given as the reason for their isolation. The inner circle exhibited peculiar attitudes {{from time to time and}} so this could have been the real story.|$|E

While the Train wasn't itself involved in actual fighting, it was constantly shelled and bombed by Turkish forces. It was a common sight at Suvla to see 40 British soldiers under the direction of a RAN Petty Officer, working to bring supplies ashore during rough weather. The soldiers would openly look forward to returning to their trenches where <b>they</b> <b>at</b> least had the ability to shoot back at anyone who attacked them.|$|E
25|$|She became {{extremely}} {{proficient in}} the use of pastels, eventually creating many of her most important works in this medium. Degas also introduced her to etching, of which he was a recognized master. The two worked side-by-side for a while, and her draftsmanship gained considerable strength under his tutelage. He depicted her in a series of etchings recording their trips to the Louvre. She treasured his friendship but learned not to expect too much from his fickle and temperamental nature after a project they were collaborating on at the time, a proposed journal devoted to prints, was abruptly dropped by him. The sophisticated and well-dressed Degas, then forty-five, was a welcome dinner guest at the Cassatt residence, and likewise <b>they</b> <b>at</b> his soirées.|$|E
