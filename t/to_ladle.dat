Most of these graves are unmarked, in a separate field behind the church which was added by Rev. Arnold Escombe Jerram before he left in 1910. By 1913 there was fear in the village that the pauper burials were causing epidemics, because the sexton was saving money by leaving graves open to rain and weather, and not filling them with earth until they each contained their full complement of four coffins.

60|$|These papers do not {{boast of}} great sport. They are truthful, {{not like the}} tales some fishers tell. They should appeal to many sympathies. There is no false modesty in the {{confidence}} with which I esteem myself a duffer, at fishing. Some men are born duffers; others, unlike persons of genius, become so by an infinite capacity for not taking pains. Others, again, among whom I would rank myself, combine both these elements of incompetence. Nature, that made me enthusiastically fond of fishing, gave me thumbs for fingers, short-sighted eyes, indolence, carelessness, and a temper which (usually sweet and angelic) is goaded to madness {{by the laws of}} matter and of gravitation. For example: when another man is caught up in a branch he disengages his fly; I jerk at it till something breaks. As for carelessness, in boyhood I fished, by preference, with doubtful gut and knots ill-tied; it made the risk greater, and increased the excitement if one did hook a trout. I can't keep a fly-book. I stuff the flies into my pockets at random, or stick them into the leaves of a novel, or bestow them in the lining of my hat or the case of my rods. Never, till 1890, in all my days did I possess a landing-net. If I can drag a fish up a bank, or over the gravel, well; if not, he goes on his way rejoicing. On the Test I thought it seemly to carry a landing- net. It had a hinge, and doubled up. I put the handle through a button- hole of my coat: I saw a big fish rising, I put a dry fly over him; the idiot took it. Up stream he ran, then down stream, then he yielded to the rod and came near me. I tried to unship my landing-net from my button-hole. Vain labour! I twisted and turned the handle, it would not budge. Finally, I stooped, and attempted <b>to</b> <b>ladle</b> the trout out with the short net; but he broke the gut, and went off. A landing-net is a tedious thing to carry, so is a creel, and a creel is, to me, a superfluity. There is never anything to put in it. If I do catch a trout, I lay him under a big stone, cover him with leaves, and never find him again. I often break my top joint; so, as I never carry string, I splice it with a bit of the line, which I bite off, for I really cannot be troubled with scissors and I always lose my knife. When a phantom minnow sticks in my clothes, I snap the gut off, and put on another, so that when I reach home I look as if a shoal of fierce minnows had attacked me and hung on like leeches. When a boy, I was--once or twice--a bait-fisher, but I never carried worms in box or bag. I found them under big stones, or in the fields, wherever I had the luck. I never tie nor otherwise fasten the joints of my rod; they often slip out of the sockets and splash into the water. Mr. Hardy, however, has invented a joint-fastening which never slips. On the other hand, by letting the joint rust, you may find it difficult to take down your rod. When I see a trout rising, I always cast so as to get hung up, and I frighten him as I disengage my hook. I invariably fall in and get half-drowned when I wade, there being an insufficiency of nails in the soles of my brogues. My waders let in water, too, and when I go out to fish I usually leave either my reel, or my flies, or my rod, at home. Perhaps no other man's average of lost flies in proportion to taken trout was ever so great as mine. I lose plenty, by striking furiously, after a series of short rises, and breaking the gut, with which the fish swims away. As to dressing a fly, one would sooner think of dressing a dinner. The result of the fly-dressing would resemble a small blacking-brush, perhaps, but nothing entomological.|$|E

This paper describes a novel approach which significantly enhances the performance of laser-based analysis and its application <b>to</b> <b>ladle</b> metallurgy. Laser-induced emission spectrometry (LIBS) uses the spectrally dispersed light emission of a plasma for the chemical analysis of solid and liquid materials. A collimated high-intensity laser beam, directed onto the material, produces the plasma. The interaction between the laser radiation of a Nd:YAG laser and the substrate (steel or steel melt) can be influenced in a definite manner by controlling the laser power output (laser modulation). Laser modulation enables plasma conditions to be created, which are advantageous in emission spectrometry. A comparison can then be made between the plasma conditions generated using laser modulation and those produced with standard laser parameters, in ord er to demonstrate the benefits of the laser modulation technique. It has been shown {{for the first time that}} the use of the laser modulation technique considerably improves the analytical performance of laser-induced emission spectrometry.

In this paper, the parameters of slits such as thickness, width and length were theoretical studied and proposed a projected dimension. It was indicated that the optimal parameters of slits on slot plug using in bottom powder injection desulfurization was listed as follows, length exceeded 160 ~ 250 mm, width exceeded 10 mm, thickness was 0. 15 mm, and the slits should circular symmetric distribute on slot plug. The slot plug with parameters described above was industrial desulphurization tested in a 20 t foundry ladle and feasible. Besides, the foundry ladle with the design and application of slits on slot plug used for bottom powder injection desulfurization was safety in production. Pretreatment desulfurization of hot metal emerged in the 1970 s, originally, it was only used for the unqualified hot metal as remedial measure.

40|$|This thesis work {{aimed to}} provide a better {{knowledge}} of inclusion behavior at the steel-slag interface. All results are based on mathematical modeling of liquid and solid inclusion separation to the slag. The model descriptions of the inclusion transfer {{are based on the}} equation of motion at the system. It is assumed that the inclusion transfer is governed by four forces acting on the inclusion as it has reached the steel-slag interface. These are the buoyancy force, the added mass force, the drag force and the rebound force. The models assume two cases of inclusion separation depending on the inclusion Reynolds number. In the case where Reynolds number is larger or equal to unity, Re≥ 1, a steel film is formed between the inclusion and the slag. This steel film must first be drained before the inclusion can separate to the slag. If Reynolds number, Re< 1, then no steel film is formed and the inclusion will be in direct contact with the slag. The mathematical models also propose three types of inclusion behavior as the inclusion crosses the steel-slag interface. The inclusion can either, pass and separate to the slag, oscillate at the interface with the possibility of reentering the steel bath with the steel flow or it can remain at the interface not completely separated to the slag. A parameter study for 20 μm inclusions showed that the most important parameters controlling the inclusion behavior at the steel-slag interface are the slag viscosity and the interfacial tensions between the phases. For 100 μm inclusions also the inclusion density affects the inclusion behavior. The models were applied <b>to</b> <b>ladle</b> and tundish conditions. Since the slags in the chosen industrial conditions have not been studied experimentally before, estimations of the important physical property parameters were made. Future measurements will therefore be needed in order to make predictions of inclusion transfer behavior at the steel-slag interface which are more relevant for the industry. The main conclusion is that useful plots can be made in order to illustrate the tendency for the inclusion transfer and how to manipulate the physical property parameters in order to increase the inclusion separation in ladles and tundishes.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{a study on}} the thermal state of {{steelmaking}} ladles was undertaken. The transient hot wire method was verified for thermal conductivity measurements on metallurgical slags and applied <b>to</b> <b>ladle</b> slag measurements. Temperature measurements on ladles in an industrial environment were carried out. The emissivities of the outer and inner shells of steelmaking ladles were investigated. Two dynamic models were developed to predict the heat transfer and fluid flow in a preheating and teeming ladle. The gathered thermal conductivity values for ladle slag were used to study the effect of the slag layer on the top surface of the melt on heat transfer and fluid flow in a teeming ladle. In the first stage, the transient hot-wire method was verified to measure the thermal conductivity of metallurgical slags at steelmaking temperatures. A numerical model was developed, cold model experiments were conducted and test measurements using a high temperature experimental setup were carried out. To minimize natural convection and to obtain more reliable measurements, the crucible diameter, the hot-wire diameter, the applied current, the position of the wire in the crucible and the cooling on the upper surface of the crucible were studied. Investigations into the choice of sheathing material of the circuit exposed to the slag were also made. It was found that only certain materials were suitable for slag measurements depending on slag composition and temperature. The electrical resistivity of the hot wire was measured to make the thermal conductivity calculation more reliable. The wire diameter also played a major role due to the heat generation per surface area. The thermal conductivity should be derived from the values measured during the first seconds. In this initial stage, the effect of the natural convection {{as a function of the}} wire position in the crucible, the cooling on the top surface and the diameter of the crucible are negligible. A compromise has to be made in choosing the electrical current, since higher current results in higher sensitivity but at the same time in more natural convection. In the second stage, the thermal conductivities of four different ladle slags were measured at 1773 K, 1823 K, 1873 K and 1923 K using the transient hot wire method. Very good reproducibility was obtained. The thermal conductivity did not vary substantially with the variation of slag composition at 1873 K and 1923 K, at which the slag samples were all entirely liquid. The thermal conductivities were low. It was found that the precipitation of solid phase resulted in a considerable increase of thermal conductivity. In the third stage, a two dimensional model was developed in order to predict the temperature distribution in the ladle wall during the preheating process. The model calculated the heat transfer and the velocity field in the gas phase inside the ladle as well as the heat transfer in the solid walls during the preheating process. Measurements of the temperature profiles in an industrial ladle were carried out using an infrared thermography. The measurements were made both inside and outside the ladle. The model predictions were found to be in reasonably good agreement with the measured temperatures. It was found that the preheating time could be minimized when the working lining became thinner. The effect ofthe distance between the lid and the ladle was also studied by the model. The results indicated that there was no significant temperature change on the upper side wall of the ladle. On the lower side wall and bottom the temperature changed slightly. The temperature difference in the lower part of the ladle could be explained by the larger flame distance from the bottom layer. In the fourth stage, a two dimensional axisymmetric model was developed to predict the heat flux in a steelmaking ladle during the teeming process. The model predicts dynamically the flow fields in both the liquid phase and the gas phase along with the movement of the liquid upper surface. The model also predicts the temperature distributions in the liquid metal, gas phase and all layers in the ladle wall. Again, industrial measurements were performed using an infrared thermography, both inside the ladle after teeming and at the wall outside the ladle during the whole process sequence. The model predictions were found to be in agreement with the measured data. It was found that the heat transfer to the surrounding atmosphere and the conductivity of the highly insulating layer were the most important factors for the heat loss. The decrease of the thickness of the working lining was found to have limited effect on the total heat flux. In the fifth and final stage, the effect of the slag layer on the top surface of the melt, on fluid flow and on heat transfer in a teeming ladle was investigated theoretically. The two dimensional axisymmetric model developed in the fourth stage was used. To predict the effect of the slag layer a stationary heat conduction boundary condition including thermal conductivity and slag layer thickness was employed. Different calculations with differing thermal conductivity values for the slag layer were carried out. The calculations showed that the effect of the slag layer was insignificant. This could be explained by the similarity of the thermal conductivity of slag and gas phase. QC 20121010 </p...|$|E
