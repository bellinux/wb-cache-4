50|$|People {{have worked}} with logging and <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> for more than 300 years in this valley. Numerous {{artifacts}} are left including dams, walls constructed by stones out in the rivers, and runs to get the logs past troublesome spots.|$|R
50|$|Farming {{and logging}} are {{traditionally}} {{the most important}} occupations in the municipality, {{and there are many}} wood related industries.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been to study and analyse in detail {{the process by which}} <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> in tributaries was phased out. The region covered is that of the Ume and Vindel rivers and the period studied is 1945 - 70. The years I 945 - 60 have been the most central to the analysis. The {{approach}} taken was to study <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> itself rather than the new transport alternative (lorries) which developed during the post-war period. This brought the increasing costs of <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> in tributaries into the forefront of the investigation, along with the efforts made to restrain these by means of investment in and partial closure of the floatway network. The consequences in terms of changed labour demand are also discussed. An important part of the analysis has been to examine the inherent weaknesses of <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> in tributaries and the internal driving forces underlying its phasing-out. The term "internal driving forces" connotes those forces which affected <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> as a means of transport by causing its costs to rise. In other words it has not been a matter of looking at the direct competition from lorry transport and the advantages of the new transport technique but rather of identifying the drawbacks of floating, when, where and how they arose, and how they helped to make it relatively dearer, thus motivating the changeover to lorry transport. The internal driving forces were forest structure and labour costs. When labour costs incurred in <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> in tributaries were rising rapidly and the dimensions of the logs became smaller in size, floating became a dearer transport solution than before. As regards changes in forest structure, the dimensions of logs were diminishing throughout the floating epoch. This meant that the risk of sinking during floating increased. The effect of this was that the need to bark the timber was increasing all the time, which in turn entailed an indirect transport cost for floating. In addition to this, smaller log dimensions affected the labour time and cost of floating. The changed labour conditions along with the changed forest structure showed the importance of studying structural change in the Norrland forest region. For during the later 1940 s and early 1950 s a shortage of labour presented itself, and the cause was {{to be found in the}} new job opportunities which were emerging, some in the rural areas, for example in the construction of hydro-electric powerplants, and some in the larger populated localities, and these factors taken together made recruitment for jobs in forestry and <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> more difficult. One of the chief characteristics of the way events were moving was that recruitment shifted away from having mainly targeted the agrarian lower class of smallholders, crofters and leaseholders so that it now focused increasingly on freehold farmers while at the same time the recruitment base, having previously consisted of younger workers, was now composed mainly of older people. Also in this study, various factors have been examined which could conceivably explain the changes in productivity of <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> in tributaries. The results show, for example, that during the 1950 s a partial phasing-out had very small direct effects on productivity in the area studied. Thus the combination of investment and changes in the quantity of timber is the factor which best explains the differences between different tributaries in the trend of productivity. A tributary´s greater capacity to <b>float</b> <b>timber</b> did not necessarily signify a bigger labour requirement since to a certain extent the watercourse itself “did the job”. As regards investment, clearance operations using caterpillar tractors were probably very important. It is true that the genuine dependence of log driving in tributaries on nature influenced conditions varied strongly from year to year, but since the link between investment costs and the trend of productivity is significant, it still seems reasonable to draw the conclusion that investment lent impetus to the rise in productivity during the 1950 s. digitalisering@um...|$|R

50|$|Timber rafting is a log {{transportation}} {{method in}} which logs are tied together into rafts and drifted or pulled across a water body or down a flatter river.

50|$|As {{early as}} the 1790s, the forests on the Susquehanna were being logged and the <b>timbers</b> <b>floated</b> downriver to points near the ferry landing.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} follow-up {{studies from}} Finnish and Swedish streams {{that have been}} restored after <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> to assess the abiotic and biotic responses to restoration. More specifically, from a review of 18 case studies (16 published and 2 unpublished), we determined whether different taxonomic groups react differently or require different periods of time {{to respond to the}} same type of restoration. Restoration entailed returning coarse sediment (cobbles and boulders) and sometimes large wood to previously channelized turbulent reaches, primarily with the objective of meeting habitat requirements of naturally reproducing salmonid fish. The restored streams showed a consistent increase in channel complexity and retention capacity, but the biotic responses were weak or absent in most species groups. Aquatic mosses growing on boulders were drastically reduced shortly after restoration, but in most studies, they recovered after a few years. Riparian plants, macroinvertebrates and fish did not show any consistent trends in response. We discuss seven alternative explanations to these inconsistent results and conclude that two decades is probably too short a time for most organisms to recover. We recommend long-term monitoring using standardized methods, a landscape-scale perspective and a wider range of organisms to improve the basis for judging to what extent restoration in boreal streams has achieved its goal of reducing the impacts from <b>timber</b> <b>floating...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first stop}} for log drives coming from the Kronach area was Schwürbitz. The next station was then Bischberg. As the Regnitz’s outflow into the Main {{strengthened}} this river considerably, twenty-seven of the small rafts that had been driven here downstream could be lashed {{together to make a}} Stück (“piece”, meaning a great timber raft), which could then be driven farther down the Main, and then by way of the Rhine {{all the way to the}} Netherlands. Later developments in road and railway transport, however, ended the need for these drives, and <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> died out.|$|R

50|$|The remote {{northern}} {{interior of}} Maine {{was in the}} 19th century developed as a major logging region. Because the provincial government of New Brunswick began charging tariffs for <b>timber</b> <b>floated</b> down the Saint John River, American logging interest sought ways to divert timber into the Penobscot River watershed. This was accomplished by the placement of dams {{in a number of}} places on Chamberlain Lake and Eagle Lake, whose waters historically reached the Saint John via the Allagash River, which resulted in their waters' diversion toward Webster Lake (now in the far north of Baxter State Park), part of the Penobscot watershed. By the late 19th century the lock dam between Chamberlain and Eagle Lakes had become a hindrance to logging operations.|$|R

It was almost impossible to estimate the losses. Roads were rendered impassable-bridges swept away-the mails stopped, and traveling by land to any distance utterly vetoed.

40|$|I {{have done}} a follow up study of the {{restoration}} of two rivers, Röälven and Grundan, in order to evaluate {{the effects of the}} restoration on the endemic population of trout. Both rivers have been used for <b>timber</b> <b>floating</b> during many years throughout the 20 th century, and because of this, had all obstacles such as rocks and wood parts removed. In 2004 - 2005 both rivers were restored, and rocks and wood were put back into the rivers. Spawning grounds were created and boulder dams were constructed to promote the streaming water. The result showed that the trout population of both rivers increased after the restoration, but also that the trout population of Röälven increased more than that of Grundan. My conclusion is that the way the restoration is of a river contributes to the result...|$|R
