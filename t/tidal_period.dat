50|$|Like other {{estuaries}} {{along the}} Oregon Coast, Netarts Bay experiences semi-diurnal tides (two high tides and two low tides per day). At mean low low water (the lower low tide), the bay contains approximately 113 million cubic ft of water. Contrasting that with that a mean higher high tide volume of approximately 450 million cubic feet, the bay's tidal prism is about 33 million cubic feet. The tidal range varies between 1.5 and 3 meters(5 - 9 feet), which can vary {{the amount of}} water (40-90%) flushed out of the estuary during each tidal cycle. With a mean <b>tidal</b> <b>period</b> of 745 minutes, bay waters turn over, on average, twice a day. Mixing within the estuary is dependent on local winds and tides. Horizontal mixing is limited, although vertical mixing is strong. Little to no vertical variations in temperature and salinity prevent density-driven current velocities, indicating that Netarts Bay is a well-mixed estuary. This has been further corroborated by water quality and dye studies.|$|E

To attain the objectives, the bathymetry of the estuarinesystem was obtained, allowing to define the limits {{of high and low}} tides. The one-dimension analysis considered: salinity and the water concentration and/or fresh waterfraction, in high and low tides; the rates and times of discharges; and the volumes offresh water restrained in the estuary in high and low water slacks.

5000|$|The {{internal}} {{tidal energy}} in one <b>tidal</b> <b>period</b> going through an area {{perpendicular to the}} direction of propagation is called the energy flux and is measured in Watts/m. The energy flux at one point can be summed over depth- this is the depth-integrated energy flux and is measured in Watts/m. The Hawaiian Ridge produces depth-integrated energy fluxes as large as 10 kW/m. The longest wavelength waves are the fastest and thus carry most of the energy flux. Near Hawaii, the typical wavelength of the longest internal tide is about 150 km while the next longest is about 75 km. These waves are called mode 1 and mode 2, respectively. Although Fig. 1 shows there is no sea surface expression of the internal tide, there actually is a displacement of a few centimeters. These sea surface expressions of the internal tide at different wavelengths can be detected with the Topex/Poseidon or Jason-1 satellites (Fig. 2). [...] Near 15 N, 175 W on the Line Islands Ridge, the mode-1 internal tides scatter off the topography, possibly creating turbulence and mixing, and producing smaller wavelength mode 2 internal tides.|$|E

5000|$|Long-Period tides are {{gravitational}} tides, typically with amplitudes {{of a few}} centimeters or {{less and}} periods longer than one day, generated by changes in the Earth's orientation relative to the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. The distance between a reference point {{on the surface of}} the Earth relative to these objects can be expressed as an infinite combination of periods and, as the distance changes, so does the tidal forcing. An analysis of the changing distance by Pierre-Simon de Laplace in the 18th century shows that these periods at which gravity varies cluster into three species, the semi-diurnal and diurnal tide constituents which have periods of a day or less, and the long <b>period</b> <b>tidal</b> constituents (see also tide). Long <b>period</b> <b>tidal</b> constituents with relatively strong forcing include the lunar fortnightly (Mf) and monthly (Ms) as well as the solar semiannual (Ssa) and annual (Sa) constituents. In addition to having periods longer than a day-long <b>period</b> <b>tidal</b> forcing is distinguished from that of the first and second species by being zonally symmetric. The long period tides are also distinguished by the way in which the oceans respond. In contrast to the first and second species, the long <b>period</b> <b>tidal</b> forcings occur sufficiently slowly that they do not excite surface gravity waves. This property of exciting surface gravity waves is responsible for the high amplitude semi-diurnal tides in the Bay of Fundy, for example.
