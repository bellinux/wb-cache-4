40|$|Atmospheric cycling of {{nitric acid}} and other nitrogen-bearing {{compounds}} {{is an important}} biogeochemical process, with significant implications for ecosystems and human health. Volcanoes are rarely considered {{as part of the}} global nitrogen cycle, but here we show that they release a previously unconsidered flux of HNO 3 vapour to the atmosphere. We report the first measurements of nitric acid vapour in the persistent plumes from four volcanoes: Masaya (Nicaragua); Etna (Italy); and Villarrica and Lascar (Chile). Mean near-source volcanic plume concentrations of HNO 3 range from 1. 8 to 5. 6 Wmol m 33, an enrichment of one to two orders of magnitude over background (0. 1 ^ 1. 5 Wmol m 33). Using mean molar HNO 3 /SO 2 ratios of 0. 01, 0. 02, 0. 05, and 0. 07 for Villarrica, Masaya, Etna, and Lascar respectively, combined with SO 2 flux measurements, we calculate gaseous HNO 3 fluxes from each of these volcanic systems, and extend this to estimate the global flux from high-temperature, non-explosive volcanism to be V 0. 02 ^ 0. 06 Tg (N) yr 31. While comparatively small on the global scale, this flux could have important implications for regional fixed N budgets. The precise mechanism for the emission of this HNO 3 remains unclear but we suggest that <b>thermal</b> nitrogen <b>fixation</b> followed by rapid oxidation of the product NO is most likely. In explosive, ash-rich plumes NO may result from, or at least be supplemented by, production from volcanic lightning rather than <b>thermal</b> N <b>fixation.</b> We have calculated NO production via this route to be of the order of 0. 02 Tg (N) yr 31...|$|R

The aim of the proposed study is to determine the effect of the combination of posture-control insoles and ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) improving functional limitation in children with CP. Methods/Design: The sample will be composed of 24 children with CP between four and 12 years of age. After the signing of the statement of informed consent, the children will be randomly allocated to two groups: a control group using AFOs alone and an experimental group using both posture-control insoles and AFOs. Evaluations will be performed on five occasions: without any accessory (insoles or AFOs), immediately after, one month after, six months after and one year after AFOs or insole and AFOs use. The evaluation will involve the analysis of gait, static and functional balance, mobility and hypertonia. The three-dimensional assessment of gait will involve the eight-camera SMART-D SMART-D 140 (R) system (BTS Engineering), two Kistler force plates (model 9286 BA) and an eight-channel, wireless FREEEMG (R) electromyography (BTS Engineering).

40|$|We report {{here the}} first {{observations}} of NO 2 emission from Mt. Erebus, a volcano with an active lava lake located on Ross Island, Antarctica. Erebus generates a persistent plume, which is entrained {{at an altitude}} of about 4 km above sea level. Its NO 2 flux, measured by scattered light ultraviolet spectroscopy in December 2003, was equivalent to ∼ 0. 6 Gg (N) yr- 1. The total reactive nitrogen supply may be significantly higher than this since other NOy species are likely to have been present in the plume. We believe the NO 2 is generated by <b>thermal</b> <b>fixation</b> of atmospheric nitrogen at the hot lava surface, forming NO, which then reacts rapidly with oxidants including ozone to yield NO 2. Erebus volcano has displayed lava lake activity for many decades and may, therefore, play a significant long-term role in Antarctic tropospheric chemistry, and represent an important source of nitrogen deposited to the ice surface. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Hot {{volcanic}} vents {{promote the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>fixation</b> of atmospheric N 2 into biologically available forms. The {{importance of this}} process for the global nitrogen cycle is poorly understood. At Masaya volcano, Nicaragua, NO and NO 2 are intimately associated with volcanic aerosol, such that NOx levels reach {{as much as an}} order of magnitude above local background. In-plume HNO 3 concentrations are elevated above background to an even greater extent (≤ 50 μmol·m- 3). We estimate the production efficiency of fixed nitrogen at hot vents to be ∼ 3 × 10 - 8 mol·J- 1, implying present-day global production of ∼ 109 mol of fixed N per year. Although conversion efficiency would have been lower in a preoxygenated atmosphere, we suggest that subaerial volcanoes potentially constituted an important source of fixed nitrogen in the early Earth, producing as much as ∼ 1011 mol·yr- 1 of fixed N during major episodes of volcanism. These fluxes are comparable to estimated nitrogen-fixation rates in the prebiotic Earth from other major sources such as bolide impacts and thunderstorm and volcanic lightning. © 2004 Geological Society of America...|$|E
40|$|Research from {{biological}} and geological sources has highlighted {{the role of}} volcanoes in the outgassing of P, and <b>thermal</b> <b>fixation</b> and subsequent atmospheric oxidation of NOx in volcanic environments. The impact of these nutrient fluxes on biological systems has been demonstrated on present-day Hawai'i, and here we consider {{the impact on the}} plant communities within a large igneous province (LIP). The Miocene Columbia River Basalt Province, the youngest LIP on Earth, contains many sedimentary interbeds between the flows of the major extrusive phase, and these interbeds preserve variable but often diverse palynofloras. By integration of palynofloral analysis with analysis of macronutrient levels in the interbeds it can be suggested {{that there may have been}} significantly elevated levels of P within the lava field proximal to the source vents, a distribution mirrored by Ca and Mg. Evidence for potential volcanogenic eutrophication is restricted to > 103 year duration interbeds, contemporary with eruptive activity elsewhere in the LIP. The geochemistry and palynology of other interbeds demonstrate nutrient deficiency, with a potential route to nutrient sufficiency available from long-term symbiotic N-fixation. Elsewhere within the Columbia River Basalt Province, this process is short-circuited by the imput of felsic ash from the nearby Cascades Range of volcanoes...|$|E
40|$|According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, {{radiofrequency}} ablation (RFA) is a {{safe and}} effective treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In most studies, the initial complete tumour response rates of small HCCs = 3 D 3 cm following RFA have been reported as more than 90 % or 95 %, and local tumour progression rates have been reported as approximately 10 % or 20 %. Notwithstanding these promising clinical outcomes, the complete tumour response rates for HCC following RFA as determined by conventional histopathological diagnostic criteria {{have been reported to}} be less than 50 % in many recent reports. While considering that most cases of local tumour progression of HCC are known to occur within two years following RFA, it may not be reasonable to assume that clinical and radiological examinations have significantly overestimated the tumour response rates. On the contrary, {{it is likely that the}} conventional histopathological examination techniques may have underestimated the tumour response rates. The apparent discrepancy between the histopathological and the radiological tumour response of radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinomas can be attributed to several histological features, such as <b>thermal</b> <b>fixation</b> or apoptosis, that were not included in the conventional histopathological diagnostic criteria. However, a robust conclusion cannot be derived because of lack of adequate controlled studies, and further well designed prospective multicentre trials will be helpful to solve this issue...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a highly reusable photocatalyst based on TiO 2 nanoparticles for degrading organic pollutants in water. The particles were immobilized on steel mesh (SM) by a three-step procedure: (1) formation of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder interface by dip-coating SM (2. 5  cm ×  5. 0  cm), (2) electrospraying of TiO 2 nanoparticles dispersed in methanol (Degussa P 25, 1  mg/mL), and (3) final <b>thermal</b> <b>fixation</b> with a pressure of 100  MPa for improved mechanical stability. When the electrosprayed volumes were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60  mL, the TiO 2 loading {{on both sides of}} the PVDF-coated SM increased from 0. 20, 0. 43, 0. 73, 0. 97, 1. 10, to 1. 60  mg respectively. The SM sample loaded with 1. 10  mg TiO 2 (SM-TiO 2) was found to be optimal for the photocatalytic oxidation of methylene blue (MB) under UV irradiation, with stable performance for 20 consecutive photocatalytic runs. The SM-TiO 2 thermally fixed at 160  °C exhibited higher photocatalytic efficacy than those fixed at 180 and 200  °C, because at higher temperatures the melted PVDF resin layer (melting point: 165 &# 8211; 172  °C) entrapped the TiO 2 nanoparticles and rendered them photocatalytically inactive.

40|$|International audienceSince the {{discovery}} of bromine oxide (BrO) in volcanic emissions, there has been speculation concerning its role in chemical evolution and notably ozone depletion in volcanic plumes. We report the first measurements using Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) of BrO in the tropospheric plume of the persistently degassing Erebus volcano (Antarctica). These are the first observations pertaining to emissions from an alkaline phonolitic magma. The observed BrO/SO 2 ratio of 2. 5 x 10 - 4 {{is similar to that}} measured at andesitic arc volcanoes. The high abundance of BrO is consistent with high abundances of F and Cl relative to sulfur in the Erebus plume. Our estimations of HBr flux and BrO production rate suggest that reactive bromine chemistry can explain a 35 % loss of tropospheric O 3 observed in the Erebus plume at approximately 30 km from source (Oppenheimer et al., 2010). Erebus also has a permanent lava lake, which could result in generation of NOx by <b>thermal</b> <b>fixation</b> of atmospheric N 2 at the hot lava surface. Any NOx emission could play a potent role in reactive bromine chemistry. However, the presence of NO 2 could not be detected in the plume, about 400 m above the lake, in our DOAS observations of 2005. Nor could we reproduce spectroscopic retrievals that reportedly identified NO 2 in DOAS observations from 2003 made of the Erebus plume (Oppenheimer et al., 2005). Based on the NO 2 detection limit of our analysis, we can state an upper limit of the NO 2 /SO 2 ratio of ≤ 0. 012, an order of magnitude lower than previously reported. Our new result supports a rapid oxidation of NOx in the young plume and is more consistent with measurements of NOy species measured using an instrumented aircraft flying in the plume. Model simulations, tuned for Erebus, were performed to reproduce the BrO/SO 2 observed in the young plume and to investigate the impact of NOx emissions at source on the subsequent formation of BrO in the plume. They support our hypothesis of rapid conversion of NOx to NOy {{in the vicinity of the}} lava lake. This study thus places new constraints on the interaction between reactive nitrogen and bromine species in volcanic plumes, and its effects on ozone...|$|E
