As noted previously, the bob is still spinning with the Earth (a spot of the bob will spin with the Earth), even though the bob is no longer turning with the Earth. Thus the Earth continues to turn underneath the swing of the pendulum while the swing of the pendulum remains in a fixed plane that doesn't rotate (turn).|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{are also}} {{interested}} in testing whether {{the values of the}} obtained coefficients are stable throughout the <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> <b>considered</b> in this study. If instability is detected, the model is said to experience a structural change or regime shift. One of the most used stability tests in the literature is Chow’s test. However, this test suffers from a severe problem since it requires the selection of the timing when the structural change took place and such timing might not be defined. There are few methods that would allow us to select the timing in a systematic way. Mostly, the timing can be selected either arbitrarily or by prior knowledge of major events that are believed to cause regime change. Brown et al. (1975) proposed the CUSUM of squares test that is able to reveal model instability by detecting instability in the variance of the regression error without the need to define a specific date for structural change.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{deals with}} a unit {{commitment}} problem of a generation company whose aim {{is to find the}} optimal scheduling of a multiunit pump-storage hydro power station, for a short term period in which the electricity prices are forecasted. The problem has a mixed-integer nonlinear structure, which makes very hard to handle the corresponding mathematical models. However, modern mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) software tools have reached a high efficiency, both in terms of solution accuracy and computing time. Hence we introduce MILP models of increasing complexity, which allow to accurately represent most of the hydroelectric system characteristics, and turn out to be computationally solvable. In particular we present a model that takes into account the head effects on power production through an enhanced linearization technique, and turns out to be more general and efficient than those available in the literature. The practical behavior of the models is analyzed through computa-tional experiments on real-world data.

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e. g. phenology), space (e. g. range) and self (e. g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> <b>considered.</b> Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction {{in the history of the}} earth...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{operational}} planning of a biogas {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant {{under conditions of}} limited biofuel resources is analyzed in this paper. The power plant operation mode depends on the biomass amount and its delivery. Consideration of parameters with high dispersion, such as the ambient temperature, thermal energy consumption and energy price, makes the problem solution much more complicated and requires new algorithms and software tools. This paper proposes an algorithm of stochastic optimization to estimate the maximum value of income by taking into account the random nature of variables. When the biomass resource is limited, the need of its optimal distribution for all the <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> <b>considered</b> becomes of top importance. In this paper, a case study is conducted on a realistic biogas CHP plant that demonstrates the feasibility of our stochastic optimization algorithm.

40|$|Annual {{rainfall}} series trends {{were investigated}} {{for more than}} 100 years of data using two nonparametric trend tests Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen&# 039;s slope (Q) for five selected meteorological stations in Victoria, Australia. The annual rainfall time series showed no significant trends {{for any of the}} five stations. To assess the sensitivity of trends to the length of the <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> <b>considered,</b> the annual rainfall analysis was repeated using recent data from approximately half the data set between 1949 and 2011. Contrasting results from the original full data set analysis were revealed. All five stations showed decreasing trends with two stations showing significant trends suggesting that this recent time period has added more low precipitation data to the time series. The year of abrupt changes for all the five stations identified using the sequential MK test varied. Conclusions drawn from this paper, point to the importance of selecting the time series data length in identifying trends and abrupt changes. Due to the climate variability, trend testing results might be biased and strongly dependent on the data period selected. Therefore, use of the full data set available would be required in order to improve understanding of change or to undertake any further studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] We have {{investigated}} the middle atmospheric response to the 27 -day and 11 -yr solar UV flux variations at low to middle latitudes using a two-dimensional photochemical model. The model reproduced most features, of the observed 27 -day sensitivity and phase lag of the profile ozone response in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere, with a maximum sensitivity of + 0. 51 % per 1 % change in 205 nm flux. The model also reproduced the observed transition to a negative phase lag above 2 rob, reflecting the increasing importance with height of the solar modulated HOx chemistry on the ozone response above 45 km. The model revealed the general anti-correlation f ozone and solar UV at 65 - 75 km, and simulated strong UV responses of water vapor and HOx species in the mesosphere. Consistent with previous 1 D model studies, the observed upper mesospheric positive ozone response averaged over _ 40 ° was simulated only when the model water vapor concentrations above 75 km were significantly reduced relative to current observations.
