To earn more money, Naite works at a club servicing female customers, though this only makes Xiaofei jealous. One of Naite's customers is Meijia, who kisses him, causing his allegiance to switch to her due to his simple programming. Despite this, though, the fact that he still remembers Xiaofei makes Wuwu realize that there is still hope for him to return to Xiaofei, who then goes through a swimming challenge to finally be able to kiss Naite back, a <b>task</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> successful with.|$|E
5000|$|Starship Ezekiel (called [...] "Ell") is a {{state-of-the-art}} UFO {{designed to take}} the appearance and actions {{of a young girl}} whilst upholding the task of protecting the other characters. Ell has a very obedient and earnest personality, she does whatever is necessary to fulfill the <b>task</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> given and does whatever she can to protect {{the other members of the}} cast. However, being such an honest girl causes her to become very depressed when she fails at a task and she usually resorts to placing herself in a box while emitting a depressed aura. It is noted that after crashing on Earth she developed a fear of heights. Her identity is made top secret, and she protects the president and her cabinet as an SP agent in government. She has a tendency to be quiet and shy of strangers and a girl that leaves a fleeting impression in some respects. She can be a natural airhead that takes jokes seriously and does hysterical things. She chooses to get close to Junichiro and take care of him in order to understand the love that’s awakening inside of her. Due to having limited knowledge pertaining to sex, she obediently receives Junichiro’s sexual harassment. Ell is the younger sister of Starship Jeremiah, better known as Remi, the two share a rivalry because Remi is jealous that her creator Ku Little Little seems more prideful of her newer creation Ell than herself. Her design and personality (as well as artificial nature) are very similar to Hatsune Miku.|$|E

From a retrospective case study research of three design projects different principles and strategies were formulated for dealing with dynamic use situations. In this paper we present solution principles that are applied to accommodate products to dynamic use situations and we discuss two design process issues with regard to dynamic usability, namely the information sources that are used to get insight in the use situations and the means by which designers try to get insight in the consequence of their design decisions with regard to future use situation...|$|R
40|$|How {{does the}} Prime Minister {{organize}} her government so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can implement her policy agenda? In our model, a popularly elected Prime Minister appoints individuals to her cabinet, allocates their portfolios, and assigns their policy <b>tasks</b> - <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>she</b> decides the relevant jurisdiction of departments. Upon appointment ministers obtain expertise on policies specic to their jurisdiction and strategically communicate {{this information to}} the Prime Minister before a policy is implemented. Assignment allows the Prime Minister to implement her agenda even when <b>she</b> <b>is</b> constrained to appoint ministers whose policy preferences are far from her own. There are normative implications: an open leadership contest for the position of Prime Minister produces policies that are Pareto efficient and when a Condorcet winning policy exists it is implemented with certainty. We explore the minimal costs of re-assigning policy <b>tasks</b> and show <b>that</b> in a reasonably large government these are negligible. We provide comparative statics {{on the relationship between}} cabinet personnel and the assignment of their policy tasks...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Veal {{died the}} 7th of September, at twelve o'clock at noon, of her fits, {{and had not}} above four hours' senses before her death, in which time she {{received}} the sacrament. The next day after Mrs. Veal's appearing, being Sunday, Mrs. Bargrave was mightily indisposed with a cold, and a sore throat, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not go out that day; but on Monday morning she sent a person to captain Watson's, to know if Mrs. Veal was there. They wondered at Mrs. Bargrave's inquiry; and sent her word, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not there, nor was expected. At this answer Mrs. Bargrave told the maid she had certainly mistook the name, or made some blunder. And though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ill, <b>she</b> put on her hood, and went herself to captain Watson's though she knew none of the family, to see if Mrs. Veal was there or not. They said, they wondered at her asking, for <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had not <b>been</b> in town; they <b>were</b> sure, if <b>she</b> had, <b>she</b> would have <b>been</b> there. Says Mrs. Bargrave, I <b>am</b> sure <b>she</b> <b>was</b> with me on Saturday almost two hours. They said, it was impossible; for they must have seen her if she had. In comes Capt. Watson, {{while they were in}} dispute, and said, that Mrs. Veal was certainly dead, and her escutcheons were making. This strangely surprised Mrs. Bargrave, when she sent to the person immediately who had the care of them, and found it true. Then she related the whole story to captain Watson's family, and what gown she had on, and how striped; and that Mrs. Veal told her, it was scowered. Then Mrs. Watson cried out, You have seen her indeed, for none knew, but Mrs. Veal and myself, that the gown was scowered. And Mrs. Watson owned, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> described the gown exactly: For, said she, I helped her to make it up. This Mrs. Watson blazed all about the town, and avouched the demonstration of the truth of Mrs. Bargrave's seeing Mrs. Veal's apparition. And captain Watson carried two gentlemen immediately to Mrs. Bargrave's house, to hear the relation of her own mouth. And when it spread so fast, that gentlemen and persons of quality, the judicious and sceptical part of the world, flocked in upon her, it at last became such a <b>task,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> forced to go out of the way. For they were, in general, extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing, and plainly saw that Mrs. Bargrave was no hypocondriac; for she always appears with such a cheerful air, and pleasing mien, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has gained the favour and esteem of all the gentry; and it is thought a great favour, if they can but get the relation from her own mouth. I should have told you before, that Mrs. Veal told Mrs. Bargrave, that her sister and brother-in-law were just come down from London to see her. Says Mrs. Bargrave, How came you to order matters so strangely? It could not be helped, says Mrs. Veal. And her brother and sister did come to see her, and entered the town of Dover just as Mrs. Veal was expiring. Mrs. Bargrave, asked her, whether she would drink some tea. Says Mrs. Veal, I do not care if I do; but I'll warrant you, this mad fellow, (meaning Mrs. Bargrave's husband,) has broke all your trinkets. But, says Mrs. Bargrave, I'll get something to drink in for all that; but Mrs. Veal waived it, and said, It is no matter, let it alone; and so it passed.|$|R

April had a dysfunctional relationship with her parents, who allowed her to use substances such as cigarettes at a young age. The family reportedly lived in cheap hotels and rummaged through garbage for aluminum cans and other items to provide money for food and drugs.
