5|$|On September 23, 2007, however, he tore {{his right}} ACL while being {{restrained}} by Padres manager Bud Black during an altercation with first base umpire Mike Winters. Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters {{said that he}} had <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached first base, he questioned Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters addressed Bradley with a barrage of profanity. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.|$|E
5|$|The oldest part of {{the temple}} was built in 652 by Songtsen Gampo. To find a {{location}} for the temple, the king reportedly <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> hat (a ring in another version) ahead of him with a promise to build a temple where the hat landed. It landed in a lake, where a white stupa (memorial monument) suddenly emerged over which the temple was built. In another version of the legend, Queen Bhrikuti founded the temple to install the statue she had brought and Queen Wencheng selected the site according to Chinese geomancy and feng shui. The lake was filled, leaving a small pond now visible as a well fed by the ancient lake, and a temple {{was built on the}} filled area. Over the next nine centuries, the temple was enlarged; its last renovation was carried out in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|Upon Bradman's dismissal, {{dark clouds}} began {{to close in}} on the ground, and rain {{appeared}} to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the square cut. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run.|$|E

5|$|England were {{eventually}} out for 441 {{on the final}} day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman’s men progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries, whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine. Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle. This left Australia at 2/48; dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came; Lindsay Hassett joined Barnes and they took the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave Jack Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary and ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. He <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his square cut. The next morning, he perused all of the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.|$|E
5|$|Having missed {{what could}} have been Chelsea's winning penalty, John Terry had to be consoled by his manager, Avram Grant. The Manchester United players formed a guard of honour for Chelsea, lining up in two {{opposite}} rows {{at the foot of the}} steps up to the presentation party and applauding as the Chelsea team – led by chief executive Peter Kenyon – walked through. As Didier Drogba had been sent off during the game, he was not allowed to collect his medal himself and it was given to Grant; when he returned to pitch level, Grant <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> own medal into the crowd. After Chelsea's team received their medals, Munich air disaster survivor Bobby Charlton, who had captained United to the European Cup title in 1968, led his team up to collect their medals in his capacity as a club director. UEFA President Michel Platini presented both Kenyon and Charlton with commemorative plaques and medals, but Charlton declined to accept his medal; he later donated it to the club museum. When all the players had received their medals, Platini presented Manchester United with the trophy, which Rio Ferdinand – as team captain for the match – and Ryan Giggs – standing in for club captain Gary Neville – lifted together.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi's {{trip to the}} 1924 Summer Olympics was {{endangered}} by a knee injury {{in the spring of}} 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day. On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances. In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster. His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe, still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds. The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m. Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace. Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> stopwatch onto the grass. The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel. On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.|$|E

Believing that the helmet was tossed at him, second base umpire Steve Fields ejected Valentine from the game. Outraged, Valentine charged the umpire and bumped him. Valentine received a three-game suspension and $500 fine for his actions.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 a new Illinois {{governor}} took office, John P. Altgeld. Altgeld had run on {{a platform}} which included adding more teacher colleges to the state, specifically in northern Illinois. Altgeld, a Democrat, faced considerable opposition to his plan in the Republican controlled Illinois General Assembly. In order to spur the plan ahead Clinton Rosette, {{the publisher of the}} local DeKalb newspaper began to put pressure on Altgeld to fulfill his promises. Then, Isaac Ellwood <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> hat into the foray. The barbed wire baron used his influence, as a Republican, to press the state legislature, soon a bill was drafted and introduced to build a state teacher's college somewhere in northern Illinois.|$|E

25|$|Bruce Gradkowski's {{homecoming}} {{was also}} his worst {{game of the}} season. In the first quarter, Ben Roethlisberger threw his only interception {{early in the game}} to linebacker Derrick Brooks. Later in the quarter, Gradkowski <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> first interception to Steeler linebacker Larry Foote. In the final seconds of the first quarter, Roethlisberger threw a short touchdown pass to tight end Jerame Tuman. Later in the first half, Gradkowski tossed another interception in the red zone to Bryant McFadden. Steeler kicker Jeff Reed, kicked a fifty-yard field goal to end the first half. After another interception of Gradkowski in the second half, Roethlisberger completed a touchdown pass in the early fourth quarter. By the two-minute warning, the score was 20–0, in the favor of the Steelers. Tampa Bay kicker Matt Bryant, made sure the Bucs did not get shut out with a 27-yard field goal in the last seconds of regulation.|$|E
500|$|The 2008 Olympic Games {{have been}} {{generally}} {{accepted by the}} world's media as a logistical success. Many of the worst fears about the games failed to materialize: no terrorists struck Beijing; no athlete protested at the podium (though Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> bronze medal in disgust over judging), and the air quality – due largely to favorable weather patterns – was {{not as bad as}} many had feared beforehand despite being the worst in Olympics history. [...] Hopes that hosting the Games would lead to improvements in human rights protections and rule of law in China, however, went unfulfilled.|$|E
500|$|As a leader, Hassett was {{regarded}} as an outstanding success. In that era, the tours were accompanied by much ceremony, and captains were expected to make many appearances with dignatories at dinner parties and make speeches. He had his players participate in cultural activities such as dancing and singing with indigenous tribesmen, and {{reached out to the}} local children, interspersing his presentations with self-deprecating jibes. As the team’s boat departed for home, Hassett <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> remaining money away among the local children. The Australian High Commission hailed him as the most effective Australian diplomat to have visited South Africa. Of his on-field performances, the historian Chris Harte wrote that [...] "Hassett’s captaincy impressed from the start. His warmth of personality and sense of fun contrasted with Bradman’s efficient but cold methods. It was a happy tour with the players remembering particularly the hospitality offered to them." ...|$|E

500|$|Unseen by the Allies, Seydlitz {{assembled}} his cavalry {{into two}} lines, one of 20 squadrons {{and the second}} of 18, and reduced the speed of his approach {{until they reached the}} screening ridge of the Pölzen hill. There, they waited. Seydlitz sat {{at the head of the}} lines, calmly smoking his pipe. When the Allied cavalry came within striking distance, 1000 paces from the crest of the ridge, he <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> pipe in the air: this was the signal to charge. At 3:30 pm, Seydlitz crested the hill and his first 20 squadrons descended on the Allied army; [...] the leading Allied cuirassiers managed to deploy to meet Seydlitz's squadrons, but the momentum of the Prussian attack penetrated the Allied lines and wrought havoc among the disorganized mass. Prussian cavalry rode flank to flank; their training had taught them to form a line three and four deep from a column without breaking pace; once formed into a line, the troopers rode with knees touching, the horses' flanks touching, and horses riding tail to nose. Any attack of Prussian cavalry on open ground meant a line of horses—big Trakehners —bearing down on infantry or cavalry columns, lines, or squares. The horsemen could maneuver at a full gallop, to the left or right, or in an oblique.|$|E

2500|$|On August 20, Philadelphia began {{a three-game}} series against Washington. Halladay {{captured}} his sixth straight victory in a 1–0 victory, lowering his ERA to 2.16 despite committing his first balk in over five seasons; the Phillies' only run was plated by Ibáñez {{in the third}} inning. Stephen Strasburg made his first start against the Phillies in the second game, leaving early with an injury; Washington, however, scored eight runs to draw even in the series. Oswalt won his third consecutive game the following day, raising his record in a Phillies uniform to 3–0, to take the series with a 6–0 victory. In the opening game of the next series against Houston, Philadelphia led, 2–1, after seven innings of play, when former Phillies outfielder Michael Bourn appeared to leave the basepath running from home plate to first base on an infield single. Though Utley, Howard, and Manuel all argued the call—leading to the latter's ejection—the call by umpire Greg Gibson, later called [...] "controversial", stood and Bourn scored the winning run in the 3–2 Philadelphia loss. Umpiring played a role the following night, as the Phillies and Astros played to extra innings. In the 14th, Howard was called out on a check-swing third strike by Triple-A fill-in umpire Scott Barry. As Howard <b>tossed</b> <b>his</b> bat toward the dugout, Barry ejected Howard from the game for arguing balls and strikes. After a brief on-field altercation, the Phillies, who were out of bench players, moved Ibáñez to first base and brought on Oswalt to play left field, where he made the first putout of the 15th inning on a fly ball. Ibáñez made the third out on a race to first base with Bourn, but made an error in the 16th during a two-run Astros rally; the Phillies lost their longest game of the season, 4–2. Happ defeated Halladay in his first appearance against Philadelphia since being traded; he allowed 2 runs through [...] innings to secure his fourth victory {{of the season and}} seal Halladay's ninth loss. Houston completed the four-game sweep in a 5–1 contest on August 26; it was the Astros' first four-game sweep since they beat the Phillies in four straight games the previous season. After taking the lead from the Padres in the eighth inning of the opener of the next series in San Diego, Lidge balked in the winning run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth, but Rollins scored the winning run from second base on a Polanco single in the twelfth with a slide later described as [...] "fantastic", [...] "athletic", and [...] "unbelievable". Victorino notched two hits and two RBI against right-handed pitcher Jon Garland in the series' second game, although he had batted only [...]220 against right-handers through August 26; the Phillies won, 3–1. Philadelphia completed their three-game sweep of San Diego behind eight shutout innings from Hamels and a two-run home run from Sweeney, his first in a Phillies uniform. Against the Dodgers, Hiroki Kuroda no-hit the Phillies into the eighth inning on August 30 before Victorino singled; the Phillies lost, 3–0. To complete the month, the Phillies defeated Los Angeles behind Howard's first home run since July 27; the final tally was 8–4 in Philadelphia's favor, finishing the month with an 18–10 record.|$|E
