25|$|Some genetic {{susceptibility}} {{may play a}} minor role in most cases. Overall, however, genetics {{is believed to be}} the primary cause of 5–10% of all cases.

40|$|Background: The estrogen-induced gene 121 (EIG 121) {{has been}} {{associated}} with breast and endometrial cancers, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. In a genome-wide search for tandem repeats, we found that EIG 121 contains a short tandem repeat (STR) in its upstream regulatory region which has the potential to alter gene expression. The presence of this STR has not previously been analysed in relation to breast or endometrial cancer risk. Results: In this study, the lengths of this STR were determined by PCR, fragment analysis and sequencing using DNA from 223 breast cancer patients, 204 endometrial cancer patients and 220 healthy controls to determine if they were associated with <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> or endometrial cancer. We found this repeat to be highly variable with the number of copies of the AG motif ranging from 27 to 72 and having a bimodal distribution. No statistically significant association was identified between the length of this STR and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> or endometrial cancer or age at diagnosis. Conclusions: The STR in the upstream regulatory region of EIG 121 is highly polymorphic, but is not associated with <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> or endometrial cancer in the cohorts analysed here. While this polymorphic STR in the regulatory region of EIG 121 appears to have no impact on <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> or endometrial cancer, its association with disease recurrence or overall survival remains to be determined...|$|R

25|$|Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a {{synthetic}} form of estrogen. It {{has been used}} between the early 1940s and 1971. Pregnant women took DES to prevent certain pregnancy complications.

25|$|Although the {{pesticide}} DDT was banned over 20 years ago, {{studies have shown}} that there are still trace amounts found in certain agricultural products, as well as in human and animal milk.

25|$|It is {{not known}} whether {{prasterone}} is safe for long-term use. Some researchers believe prasterone supplements might actually raise <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Prasterone may stimulate tumor growth in types of cancer that are sensitive to hormones, such as some types of breast, uterine, and prostate cancer. Prasterone may increase prostate swelling in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland.|$|E
50|$|The {{correlation}} between {{breast cancer and}} the use of vaginal rings is under investigation, but recent literature suggests that the hormones used in vaginal rings has little, if any, relation to <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing <b>breast</b> cancer.|$|R

40|$|The {{relatively}} {{restricted use}} of {{hormone replacement therapy}} in the United Kingdom has frequently been noted. It is possible that low prescribing rates may, in part, {{be due to the}} difficulty in interpreting the wealth of research evidence relating to <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> and benefits <b>of</b> hormone replacement therapy.

This paper reviews the evidence relating to hormone replacement therapy and <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, endometrial cancer and cardiovascular disease and discusses the issues which require critical assessment.

25|$|The {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulators (such as tamoxifen) reduce <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>breast</b> cancer but {{increase the}} risk of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer.
