5|$|After resigning, Rudd {{stated that}} he did not think Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next {{election}} and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> lost the vote she would return to the backbench and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E

Cox breaks into a rapid-fire delivery ("The Rant Song") of the litany of annoying things J.D. does, with some help from Janitor. Dr. Cox tells Ms. Miller <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can get J.D. to leave him alone, she'll get the tests she wants.

6000|$|Kate {{went on as}} if, at this, {{making it}} out in a fashion for herself. [...] "I believe <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> ill at all she's very ill. I believe <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> bad she's not a little bad. I can't tell you why, but that's how I see her. She'll really live or she'll really not. She'll have it all or she'll miss it all. Now I don't think she'll have it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh I shall {{like to see}} any one who's {{devoted to}} you, for clearly it will be jolly to be 'in' it. So <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> to be at Venice I shall see her?" ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, she {{switched}} to golf, sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54. She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E
5|$|Candace, back at {{the mall}} (having not further {{attempted}} to bust her brothers since the building implosion from earlier), is downtrodden until her crush, Jeremy, assures her to not let the boys' fun ruin her good time and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{got the chance to}} sing, she ought to, so she joins with the band singing their hit song in a reunion concert. When she thinks she has finally made it, the band announces they have finished their career and the mall closes, leaving her in the dark.|$|E

6000|$|... "For all <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> stricken, {{she must}} see swept away. I shouldn't {{care for her}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> hadn't so much," [...] Kate very simply said. And then as it made him laugh not quite happily: [...] "I shouldn't trouble about her if there were one thing she did have." [...] The girl spoke indeed with a noble compassion. [...] "She has nothing." ...|$|R
5|$|Don instructs the Jaguar team {{to ditch}} the {{mistress}} concept {{because it is}} vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E

The deal for the briefcase fell through, but {{the man who had}} promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and she returned to the United States in 1972.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{starts with}} Sydney Sage in re-education, {{still in her}} dark cell, called {{reflection}} time by the Alchemists. She is still resisting their mind games, holding onto Adrian's love for her, until they start talking about letting her see her family <b>if</b> <b>she</b> admits she has been corrupted, making her think <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> out of reflection, {{she might be able}} to see Adrian in a dream.|$|R

At first, it seems that Rainbow has the upper hand, but as soon as Twilight reminds Fluttershy <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> gets away Discord will win, Fluttershy puts on an enormous burst of speed and the ponies eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to cast her memory spell. The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen and locks her in a crate telling her <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working and she would die. He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ava {{is asked}} to be the grand marshal to a New Year's Day parade. This makes her boyfriend, Kevin, feel like he can't live up to her lifestyle.

Eventually, Kevin confronts Ava on this and she reveals <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> messes up their relationship she doesn't wanted {{to be reminded of}} it while Googling her name. He assures her that their relationship won't end badly and the two go to the parade.|$|E

5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI status—which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shorts—had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wanted to harm herself, she could do so with her underwear or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
5|$|Prosecuting {{attorney}} Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek) tells Howard (Melissa Leo) <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> cannot {{find more}} evidence against Ralph Fenwick (Michael Sheldon), {{who is a}} suspect in a brutal murder, Danvers will have to plead to manslaughter. The next day, Howard tells her partner Felton (Daniel Baldwin) she was visited by the ghost of Fenwick's murder victim and told where the murder weapon was, but Howard cannot find it. Felton does not believe her, and Howard grows angry when he tells Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) about the ghost experience. The next day, however, Howard and Felton arrest Fenwick after finding the murder weapon based on advice Felton got from a tarot card reader.|$|E

Rita tells him {{that there is no}} shoe, despite having found it over a month ago. She later admits that she found the shoe, but refuses to acknowledge that Dexter is involved.

After this, Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle with the hope of catching one of the people responsible for Alex's kidnapping.|$|E
5|$|The Forensic Science Service email was {{translated}} into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, {{and that she had}} hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E
