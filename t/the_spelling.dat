5|$|Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage (1972) {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} innovative features, {{one of which was}} a simplified version of GR. Lin eliminated most of <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> rules requiring substitution of vowels, as can be seen from his spelling Guoryuu Romatzyh, in which the regular -r is used for T2 and a doubled vowel for T3.|$|E
5|$|Officially, the Deseret {{alphabet}} {{was created}} to simplify <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> of English words {{for the benefit of}} children and English as a second language learners. Some of the alphabet's contemporaries, however, posited an alternative motivation for its development: increasing the isolation of the early Mormons.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
50|$|Spell-slot systems often {{employ a}} {{rationale}} that <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> is forgotten when cast, {{or that the}} caster has a finite supply of the ingredients required to cast <b>the</b> <b>spell.</b> In <b>the</b> first case, the spellcaster must re-memorize <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> from a source of such, typically a grimoire. In the second case, the caster must hunt up new ingredients and prepare the equipment needed to cast <b>the</b> <b>spell.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There is {{one other}} way for a spell to be [...] "countered". If <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> targets {{something}} (such as Giant Growth or Shock), then the target must be legal both when <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> is cast and when it resolves. A spell can't be cast without a legal target; if the target becomes illegal while <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> is on <b>the</b> stack, then <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> is countered by the game rules (for having an illegal target) just before it would start to resolve. If a spell is countered this way, then no part of <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> — even a non-targeting part of <b>the</b> <b>spell's</b> effect — takes place. This {{is referred to as}} 'Countered Upon Resolution' (formerly [...] "Fizzling").|$|R
50|$|Back at the Wizard's Keep, Richard senses {{powerful}} {{magic and}} goes to investigate. He discovers Zedd, Ann and Nathan in a room where Nicci is {{caught up in the}} grips of a powerful spell called a verification web. The web is meant to examine <b>the</b> Chainfire <b>spell</b> and see if there is any way to undo it. Richard realizes that {{there is something wrong with}} <b>the</b> <b>spell,</b> recognizing that <b>the</b> corruption of <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> was caused by the presence of the three chimes - Reechani, Sentrosi, Vasi - being in the world, and the chimes not only corrupted the verification web, but they have corrupted all magic, including <b>the</b> Chainfire <b>spell.</b> Despite <b>the</b> other three's refusal of his analysis, he is able to disable <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> to release Nicci before <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> kills her. Before Nicci can tell anyone that <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> was indeed corrupted, the deadly beast that Jagang had created to hunt Richard appears in the room. In order to drive it off, Nicci places herself back into <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> form to draw upon the power between life and death. By refusing to actually supply the magic to <b>the</b> <b>spell,</b> <b>the</b> power of life and the power of the underworld come together and strike the beast, driving it away for the time being. Richard saves her from <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> a second time.|$|R
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> of English vowels do not {{correspond}} well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Charles Cunningham Boycott {{was born}} in 1832 to ReverendWilliam Boycatt and his wife Georgiana. He {{grew up in the}} village of Burgh StPeter in Norfolk, England; the Boycatt family had lived in Norfolk for almost 150 years. They were of Huguenot origin, and had fled from France in 1685 when LouisXIV revoked civil and {{religious}} liberties to French Protestants. Charles Boycott was named Boycatt in his baptismal records. The family changed <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> of its name from Boycatt to Boycott in 1841.|$|E
5|$|During the 2006 election, it {{was brought}} to {{attention}} that Reinfeldt's paternal great-great-grandfather was an African American circus director from New York, John Hood, who had a son with Emma Dorotea Reinfeld, a maid from Eckau in present-day Latvia. Emma Dorotea Reinfeld later married the Swede Anders Karlsson, but her illegitimate son John kept his mother's surname. <b>The</b> <b>spelling</b> was later changed to Reinfeldt. He also has Italian ancestry, via his paternal grandmother.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, by the time of <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Joppenbergh {{is named}} after Colonel Jacob Rutsen, born Jacobsen Rutger van Schoonderwoerdt. Rutsen was a merchant, {{and the son of}} a Dutch immigrant, from Albany; he founded the first {{settlement}} in what is now the town of Rosendale, New York, in the late 17thcentury. <b>The</b> <b>spelling</b> of the mountain's name has been disputed, and has been rendered as Joppenberg and Joppenburgh. It has also been called Jacob's Nose, Jacob's Mount, and, in an early 18th-century deed, Jobsenbright.|$|E
5|$|Katharine Way {{was born}} in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, the second child of William Addisson Way, a lawyer, and his wife Louise Jones. She had an older brother and a younger sister. Originally named Catherine, she later changed <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> to Katharine. Friends and colleagues {{generally}} knew her as Kay. Her mother {{died when she was}} twelve years old, and her father married an ear and throat specialist, who provided Kay with a role model of a career woman.|$|E

50|$|The Mana Pool may be {{purchased}} for 40,000 points; {{it allows the}} user to train wizards, which allow spells to be cast by selecting <b>the</b> desired <b>spell,</b> then selecting <b>the</b> enemy on whom one wishes to inflict <b>the</b> <b>spell.</b> <b>The</b> more wizards one has, <b>the</b> more <b>spells</b> can be cast. (<b>the</b> first <b>spell</b> is gained with 1 wizard, the second with 35, and the third with 100) <b>The</b> first <b>spell</b> is an instant kill spell, instantly killing an enemy. <b>The</b> second <b>spell</b> is an explosion that inflicts massive damage to all units within range. <b>The</b> third <b>spell</b> allows <b>the</b> player to instantly convert an enemy unit to their side.|$|R
5|$|On 9 January 2017, {{a new set}} {{of opening}} titles debuted. The titles now feature the cast members posing in front of green screen, instead of on the sets. Viewers also noticed that actors Ryan Moloney, Colette Mann and Zoe Cramond had their names misspelled. <b>The</b> <b>spelling</b> errors were {{corrected}} by the production team and the edited titles debuted the following day. The opening title sequence was updated in April 2017, following the arrival of the new Rebecchi family. The style of the titles was not changed, but most of the cast shots were re-filmed.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{recorded}} named places of Oldham is Hathershaw, occurring in a deed for 1280 with <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> Halselinechaw Clugh.

5|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of Ely's name have always been {{regarded}} as obscure by place-name scholars, and are still disputed. The earliest record of the name is in the Latin text of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, where Bede wrote Elge. This is apparently not a Latin name, and subsequent Latin texts nearly all used the forms Elia, Eli, or Heli with inorganic H-. In Old English charters, and in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> is usually Elig.|$|E
5|$|The term Al Nesr Al Tair {{appeared}} in Al Achsasi al Mouakket's catalogue, which {{was translated into}} Latin as Vultur Volans. This name was applied by the Arabs to the asterism of α, β, and γ Aquilae and probably {{goes back to the}} ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star. <b>The</b> <b>spelling</b> Atair has also been used. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.|$|E
5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. <b>The</b> <b>spelling</b> debate raged on until the early 19th century, and {{it was not until the}} latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E
50|$|Magic spells can be {{equipped}} and have three components that players receive by looting enemies or {{objects in the}} world. First, the player chooses a Sigil to craft <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> under. <b>The</b> <b>spell</b> can only {{be used by the}} Sigil it is made with. Next, the player chooses a Pattern to attach <b>the</b> crafted <b>spell,</b> determining how <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> is delivered. <b>The</b> three types of Patterns are: Targeted, which shoots a direct version of the element; Nova, which teleports the player and creates a wave that damages nearby enemies, and AoE, which damages all enemies that are within range of <b>the</b> <b>spell.</b> Finally, one or multiple Augments {{can be applied to the}} crafting recipe depending on what the Pattern allows for. Augments enhance certain aspects of <b>the</b> <b>spell's</b> statistics in specialized ways. A Destruction Augment will allow for the player to deal more damage when <b>the</b> <b>spell</b> is cast, a Control Augment will cause the elemental-specific effect to be enhanced, and a Mastery Augment will debuff an enemy and allow for more damage to be inflicted. Spells that have been crafted can likewise be deconstructed into smaller components.|$|R

5|$|Born 22 September 1905 into {{a family}} of Finnish origin in Oslo (then named Kristiania), he was baptized Håkon Steen Lie. He would later change <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> to Haakon during World War II. His father was fireman Andreas Lie (1870-1942) {{and his mother was}} {{homemaker}} Karen Halvorsdatter Gunderud (1871-1952). Though he describes his childhood as a happy one, his family was poor and, until 1916, his father had to work 120 hours a week. With his parents, two brothers, and two sisters, he grew up at his fathers fire-station sharing one room and a kitchen in the St. Hanshaugen neighborhood. Lie got involved with the labour movement at the age of sixteen, in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilia and Crocodylia {{have been}} used interchangeably for decades {{starting}} with Schmidt's redescription of the group from the formerly defunct term Loricata. Schmidt used the older term Crocodilia, based on Owen's original name for the group. Shortly after, Wermuth opted for Crocodylia as the proper name for this redescribed group, basing it on the type genus Crocodylus (Laurenti, 1768). Dundee—in a revision of many reptilian and amphibian names—argued strongly for Crocodylia to be <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> for the group. However, {{it was not until}} the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature that a more solid justification for assuming one spelling over the other was proposed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{differences}} in spelling, {{the towns of}} Breckenridge, Minnesota, Breckenridge, Missouri, Breckenridge, Texas, and Breckenridge, Colorado were named in Breckinridge's honor. The Colorado town deliberately changed <b>the</b> <b>spelling</b> of its name when its namesake joined the Confederacy. Fort Breckinridge, Arizona Territory (1860 to 1865), located at {{the confluence of the}} Aravaipa Creek and the San Pedro River, was named in honor of the Vice President. During the Civil War, its name was changed to Fort Stanford in honor of California Governor Leland Stanford, before being changed back to Fort Breckinridge. After the Civil War, the name was changed once again to Camp Grant. Between 1855 and 1862, the county now known as Lyon County, Kansas, was known as Breckinridge County.|$|E
