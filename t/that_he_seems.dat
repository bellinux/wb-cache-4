Meanwhile, Ensign Sato and Doctor Phlox are {{attacked}} in San Francisco, and Phlox is kidnapped. Captain Archer and Lieutenant Reed investigate the scene, and Reed is given a secret assignment by a secretive agent <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to know. Commander T'Pol, seeking information from Sato, conducts her first mind-meld, and the two realize that the attackers spoke Rigelian. They discover that a Rigelian freighter recently left orbit and head off in pursuit.|$|E

25|$|Hence Halbertsma {{expected}} to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably {{played a role in}} this, but there were other reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced {{on the edge of a}} burn-out for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have achieved a state of mental composure.|$|E

25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E
500|$|... {{generally}} without bloodshed, but {{resorting to}} confiscations and sacking of Christian office-holders. Although this characterization of Licinius as anti-Christian is somewhat doubtful, {{the fact is}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have been far less open in his support of Christianity than Constantine. Therefore, Licinius was prone to see the Church as a force more loyal to Constantine than to the Imperial system in general, as the explanation offered by the Church historian Sozomen.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{felt that}} having waited {{years for a}} studio version of the song made it more powerful. Mapes wrote of the [...] "sense that an older, wiser man" [...] was singing, and that the lyrics were more heartfelt [...] "now <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> {{resigned}} to haunting the afterlife". Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound wrote that the long wait [...] "allowed Radiohead to peel its words when riper than ever." [...] Phoenix New Times writer Jozef speculated that the studio version was influenced by Yorke's recent separation from his partner of almost 25 years, Rachel Owen; whereas the early arrangement, likely written shortly after Yorke met Owen, has a [...] "hopeful, proud character", the Moon Shaped Pool version sounds [...] "resigned, isolated, lost". Rolling Stone critic Andy Beta wrote that [...] "the effect is like stumbling upon an old love letter years after a relationship has grown cold", and that whereas the [...] "Don't leave" [...] refrain once suggested redemption, it now sounded like a goodbye.|$|E

Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair." [...] Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote: [...] "The result {{is a lot of}} laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there'll be anything else like it the rest of this year." [...] In a five star review for Empire Magazine, Ian Nathan wrote: [...] "For those who delight in the Coens' divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana" [...] and [...] "In a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as [...] "weirdly engaging". In a 2010 review, Ebert gave The Big Lebowski four stars out of four and added the film to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|One {{commentator}} {{has said}} that Wilfrid [...] "came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age". Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that [...] "Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility". The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that [...] "Wilfrid's character was such <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> {{to have been able}} to attract and infuriate in equal measure". His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop. The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.|$|E
500|$|Krusty's {{appearance}} and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that [...] "The satirical conceit that I {{was going for}} {{at the time was}} that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a (non-canonical) Butterfinger commercial, pertaining to a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. [...] In the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as and is confused with Krusty. Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that [...] "at some point, we decided he looked [...] all the time." [...] The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] and [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", Krusty reveals that his [...] "grotesque appearance" [...] is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> fine, and Krusty replies, [...] "This ain't makeup." [...] In [...] "Bart the Fink", [...] he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.|$|E

[...] In imitation of the ancient Greeks, he emphasized three things in music training: [...] rhapsodizing (improvising or composing on the spot), sight-reading, {{and the ability to}} accompany (especially requiring a sense of harmony). [...] His approach also included the idea of “total theater,” which centers on creative and educational audience participation. [...] He also made use of ethnic and folk melodies in his theory training, especially as an aid to student composition. [...] Together, these ideas formed the foundation of his music teaching (and music theater compositional) practices ...|$|E

2500|$|In England he {{developed}} a version of his style which combined a relaxed elegance and ease with an understated authority in his subjects which was to dominate English portrait-painting {{to the end of}} the 18th century. Many of these portraits have a lush landscape background. His portraits of Charles on horseback updated the grandeur of Titian's Emperor Charles V, but even more effective and original is his portrait of Charles dismounted in the Louvre: [...] "Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King". Although his portraits have created the classic idea of [...] "Cavalier" [...] style and dress, in fact a majority of his most important patrons in the nobility, such as Lord Wharton and the Earls of Bedford, Northumberland and Pembroke, took the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil War that broke out soon after his death.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher R. Weingarten of The Village Voice {{wrote that}} Wayne's lyrics [...] "still walk some {{fascinating}} line between signifying unmistakable genius, curious savant, or total dick", but viewed the album as lacking substance, stating [...] "Wayne's {{big problem is}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to {{like the idea of}} rock music more than any actual rock music itself". Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal called Rebirth [...] "an unlikely, unqualified, and quite unbelievable rock album". Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo described it as [...] "a total misperception of what makes a rock record" [...] and found its sound [...] "mostly unrecognizable, a twisted amalgam of tacky set pieces collected from throughout the genre's history". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated, [...] "Given that everyone knows Carter can do so much better than this, it all smacks a bit of condescension, of locating a different audience, then talking down to them". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] " [...] Jordan returned to the basketball court after one ill-fated season in the farm leagues; we can only hope for the same for Wayne".|$|E
2500|$|The Qianlong Emperor's massive art {{collection}} became an intimate {{part of his}} life; he took landscape paintings with him on his travels in order to compare them with the actual landscapes, or to hang them in special rooms in palaces where he lodged, to inscribe them on every visit there. [...] "He also regularly added poetic inscriptions to the paintings of the imperial collection, following {{the example of the}} emperors of the Song dynasty and the literati painters of the Ming dynasty. They were a mark of distinction for the work, and a visible sign of his rightful role as emperor. Most particular to the Qianlong Emperor is another type of inscription, revealing a unique practice of dealing with works of art <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> to have developed for himself. On certain fixed occasions over a long period he contemplated a number of paintings or works of calligraphy which possessed special meaning for him, inscribing each regularly with mostly private notes on the circumstances of enjoying them, using them almost as a diary." ...|$|E
