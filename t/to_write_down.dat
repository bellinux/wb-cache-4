5|$|These codes make {{it easier}} and shorter <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> the amino acid {{sequences}} that make up proteins. The nucleotide bases {{are made up of}} purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine or uracil). These nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA. These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.|$|E
5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle solving and plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes instead of having <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu {{on the bottom of the}} game screen.|$|E
5|$|Three forts in the Ohio Country {{were taken}} in a second wave of attacks in mid-June. Iroquois Senecas took Fort Venango (near {{the site of the}} present Franklin, Pennsylvania) around June 16, 1763. They killed the entire 12-man {{garrison}} outright, keeping the commander alive <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> the grievances of the Senecas. After that, they ritually burned him at the stake. Possibly the same Seneca warriors attacked Fort Le Boeuf (on the site of Waterford, Pennsylvania) on June 18, but most of the 12-man garrison escaped to Fort Pitt.|$|E

5|$|Much of the sunnah is {{recorded}} in the Hadith. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> his acts, so they may not confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally. As {{long as he was}} alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established. Due to problems of authenticity, the science of Hadith (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.|$|E
5|$|The duo wrote three songs while touring {{in support}} of their debut album Felt Mountain, but decided to take their work in a {{different}} direction with more rhythmic music. Goldfrapp chose to record in a studio in a Bohemian area of Bath, England, because they needed a place to put their equipment and start working. The band began working on the album in January 2002 with a list of songs they wanted to try to record, such as a disco song with only string instruments. The studio's walls were covered in neon lights and Alison Goldfrapp used them <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> her song ideas. They recorded early demos and worked on pre-production using a Yamaha 02R digital mixing console. Goldfrapp held jam sessions with Mark Linkous and Adrian Utley and, after they built momentum writing the album, decided not to move to another studio.|$|E
5|$|The stadium had a {{book value}} of NOK230 million, {{way over the}} real value, causing Start Toppfotball to have <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> the investment. To finance this, Sparebanken Sør, the main creditor, bought Start Stadion from Start Toppfotball for NOK2,600 on 23 December 2008. At the same time, the club signed a 40-year {{agreement}} to lease the stadium from Sparebanken Sør for NOK12 million per year. On 7 March 2009, the bank also bought the remaining shares of Start Toppfotball, becoming the sole owner of both the club and the stadium. Sparebanken Sør offered to sell Sparebanken Sør Arena to the municipality for NOK100 million, but the municipality rejected this on 29 May. The bank subsequently sold Start Stadion and Start Toppfotball to Ravnaas on 25 June for NOK1 each. Start Stadion {{had at the time}} a debt of NOK34 million to Start Toppfotball, NOK60 million to Sparebanken Sør and NOK40 million to Kristiansand Municipality. Sparebanken Sør lost NOK80 million in their transactions with Start and Sparebanken Sør Arena.|$|E

5|$|Two {{versions}} of the musical score of L'incoronazione exist, both from the 1650s. The first was rediscovered in Venice in 1888, the second in Naples in 1930. The Naples score {{is linked to the}} revival of the opera in that city in 1651. Both scores contain essentially the same music, though each differs from the printed libretto and has unique additions and omissions. In each score the vocal lines are shown with basso continuo accompaniment; the instrumental sections are written in three parts in the Venice score, four parts in the Naples version, without in either case specifying the instruments. Conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, a leading Monteverdi interpreter, refers to the contemporary practice of leaving much of a score open, to allow for differing local performance conditions. Another convention made it unnecessary <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> detail that performers would take for granted. Neither Venice nor Naples score can be linked to the original performance; although the Venice version is generally regarded as the more authentic, modern productions tend to use material from both.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Logan {{ride the}} {{elevator}} and reach the apartment before finding Kendall (Charisma Carpenter), indicating that Duncan was sleeping with her. Veronica confronts Duncan, who abruptly breaks up {{with her in the}} middle of the fight. After their breakup, Veronica slips into a depression; Keith (Enrico Colantoni) attempts to console her to no avail. Logan and Weevil discuss who killed Felix, and they deduce that whoever it was in cahoots with the Fitzpatricks. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) comes in and informs Veronica that Duncan has disappeared and kidnapped his daughter, Faith. He arrests Veronica as a supposed accomplice. At the police station, Keith pressures Veronica to tell the truth about her unknowing involvement in supplying the finances for the kidnapping. Afterwards, Sheriff Lamb requires her <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> everything she knows on a notepad. Logan asks Dick (Ryan Hansen) to get some drugs for the Pacific Coast Highway biker gang. Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) talks to Veronica and says that he’ll find Duncan before she does.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, {{and did not}} see much future in India for him or the {{lifestyle}} he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract {{some of the larger}} border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>down</b> their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that {{it would be difficult for}} him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.|$|E
