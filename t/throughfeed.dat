50|$|Wheel blast systems include {{satellite}} rotation models, rotary <b>throughfeed</b> components, {{and various}} manipulator designs. There are overhead monorail systems {{as well as}} reverse-belted models. Workpiece holding equipment includes rotating index tables, loading and unloading robots, and jigs that hold multiple workpieces. For larger workpieces, manipulators to reposition them to expose features to the shot blast stream are available.|$|E
50|$|The outer {{diameter}} (OD) {{of the races}} are often centerless ground using the <b>throughfeed</b> process. Centerless grinding can achieve a very high degree of accuracy, especially when done in stages. These stages are: rough, semi-finish and finish. Each grinding stage is designed to remove enough stock material from the casing so that the next stage does not encounter any problems such as burning or surface chatter, the finish stage achieves the final dimension. Each grinding wheel {{at all of the}} aforementioned stages has a varying degree of abrasive quality (finish being the finest grade) to achieve the appropriate stock removal for the next stage and final surface finish required.|$|E
50|$|Centerless {{grinding}} {{is a form}} of grinding {{where there}} is no collet or pair of centers holding the object in place. Instead, there is a regulating wheel positioned {{on the opposite side of}} the object to the grinding wheel. A work rest keeps the object at the appropriate height but has no bearing on its rotary speed. The workblade is angled slightly towards the regulating wheel, with the workpiece centerline above the centerlines of the regulating and grinding wheel; this means that high spots do not tend to generate corresponding opposite low spots, and hence the roundness of parts can be improved. Centerless grinding is much easier to combine with automatic loading procedures than centered grinding; <b>throughfeed</b> grinding, where the regulating wheel is held at a slight angle to the part so that there is a force feeding the part through the grinder, is particularly efficient.|$|E
40|$|Shrimp {{hatcheries}} often beset with diseases, {{mainly the}} bacterial infection and antibiotics arewidely used for prevention of disease. Presently, beneficial bacteria (probiotics) {{are used to}} preventdiseases instead of antibiotics and increasing the production. In the present study, the two new microbialstrains Bacillus megaterium and Streptomyces fradiae isolated from mangrove sediments were applied(experimental culture) for the post larval rearing of Penaeus monodon which is compared with controlculture tanks (without probiotics). The water quality condition such as temperature (27 - 29 oC), salinity(26 - 28 â€°) and dissolved oxygen (4. 7 - 5. 0 mg L- 1) of both control and experimental culture were more orless similar. Concentration of ammonia and pH were significantly different (p< 0. 05) between the controland experimental culture during the study period. The feed assimilation efficiency is higher (above 80 %) in experimental culture tank when compared to control tank (74. 76 %). The growth rate was higher - 1. 70 and 1. 67 in S. fradiae, 1. 66 and 1. 63 in B. megaterium - through feed and water, respectively,while in control tank it was 1. 4. The FCR values were 2. 06 and 2. 12 in S. fradiae treated tanks <b>throughfeed</b> and water, respectively, while 2. 51 and 2. 55 were observed in B. megaterium treated through feedand water respectively. The FCR value was found higher (4. 02) in the control tank. The average totalheterotrophic bacteria (THB) and total presumptive Vibrio bacteria both in culture water and post larvaewere lower during experimental culture in compared to control culture. The present study indicates thatthe probiotic treatment using two new microbial strains such as B. megaterium and S. fradiae would helpin better aquaculture production...|$|E
