5|$|Cockroaches {{appear to}} use just {{two pieces of}} {{information}} <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> in Italy {{to settle the}} tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E

The Computer Modern Roman typeface provided with TeX includes the five common ligatures ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl. When TeX finds these combinations in a text, it substitutes the appropriate ligature, unless overridden by the typesetter.

30|$|The {{motivation}} for this paper {{came from the}} author’s experience of cloud applications with security constraints (e.g. healthcare applications in the ‘Social Inclusion through the Digital Economy’ (SiDE) project[11]). However, the general concern that security was a barrier to use of the cloud for many organizations and applications has been widely discussed[1]. The general issues associated with security and clouds are discussed in[12]. A high-level approach <b>to</b> <b>deciding</b> <b>where</b> an application could be deployed is discussed in[13]. Another approach to eliciting and exploiting information on the security and other properties of clouds is described in[14]. These methodologies could be valuable in assigning security levels to clouds, services and data: something which is orthogonal to the scheme described in this paper.|$|R

25|$|Any {{attempt to}} give an {{exhaustive}} list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine {{with each other and}} interchange qualities making it difficult <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus. One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four or five forms of a single archetype.|$|E
25|$|Cockroaches {{are mainly}} nocturnal and will run away {{when exposed to}} light. A study tested the {{hypothesis}} that cockroaches use just two pieces of information <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> to go under those conditions: how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the Free University of Brussels and other European institutions created a set of tiny robots that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of critical mass. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.|$|E
25|$|When I {{first started}} doing the stain paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the courts applied the lex loci {{contract}}us or the law of the place where the contract was made to decide whether the given contract was valid. The apparent advantage of this approach was that the rule was easy to apply with certain and predictable outcomes. Unfortunately, it was also open to abuse, e.g. the place could be selected fraudulently to validate an otherwise invalid contract; it might lead to the application of laws with no real connection with the transaction itself, say, because the parties signed the agreement while on holiday; or it might have been difficult <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> the contract was made, e.g. because it was negotiated and signed on a railway journey through several states.|$|E
25|$|His journey {{began in}} Zaragoza, {{further down the}} valley of the Ebro to Tarragona, Barcelona, and Girona, whence he {{proceeded}} north to France, then set sail from Marseilles. After visiting Genoa, Lucca, Pisa, and Rome, he went to Greece and Constantinople, then set off across Asia. He visited Syria, Lebanon, the Land of Israel, and northern Mesopotamia (which he called Shinar) before reaching Baghdad. There is also evidence that suggests that Benjamin made it as far as Iraq and Palestine.From there he went to Persia, then cut back across the Arabian Peninsula to Egypt and North Africa, returning to the Iberian Peninsula in 1173. In his travels, he described a significant Jewish community somewhere around modern-day Ethiopia. While it appears clear that such a community exists, scholars still struggle <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> in Africa he actually visited-- a lack of uniform spelling makes it hard to distinguish what places Benjamin and other contemporary writer travel writers are actually referencing.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lead}} up to the final against Galatasaray in Copenhagen, scuffles took place between British and Turkish {{supporters}} at City Hall Square after an Arsenal fan was stabbed. The incident, dubbed the [...] "Battle of Copenhagen" [...] by the media led to 19 civilians injured and 60 arrests. The match itself was a lacklustre affair; neither side scored after 90 minutes and in extra time Gheorghe Hagi was sent off. It was decided on penalties and Arsenal lost after Šuker and Patrick Vieira missed their spot-kicks.

Björk felt that the song is [...] "the most personal [...] for me". David Fricke of Rolling Stone noted that [...] "Björk likens the human emotions – love, physical obsession, changing moods, violent hurt – in songs such as [...] "Mutual Core", [...] "Moon" [...] and [...] "Virus" [...] to natural phenomena: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, lunar phases and contagious disease".|$|E
500|$|Having {{failed to}} find land, the {{expedition}} had <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> to winter. The matter was of some urgency, since the sea would soon be freezing over, with {{the risk of the}} ship becoming trapped. Bruce decided to head back to the South Orkneys and find an anchorage there. In contrast to his stated object, to winter as far south as possible, the South Orkneys were more than [...] from the South Pole, but the northerly location had advantages. The relatively brief period during which the ship would be frozen in would allow more time for trawling and dredging operations in the early spring. Also, the islands were well-situated as a site for a meteorological station—their relative proximity to the South American mainland opened the prospect of establishing a permanent station.|$|E
500|$|As Australia {{were leading}} 20 after three Tests, England {{needed to win}} the last two matches to square the series. The hosts won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch, which was seen as being unhelpful to fast bowling. Despite saying the pitch would be more conducive to spinners, O'Reilly {{described}} the playing strip as being [...] "so green {{that it was difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>where</b> the out-field ended and the pitch began". Although fast, the outfield was bumpy in some parts. On some sections of the ground, there was a downward slope towards the edge of the playing arena, meaning the ball would accelerate downhill after being hit. At times the crowd spilled over the unfenced boundary, making the ground smaller than intended. All these factors meant scoring a boundary would be an easier task for the batsmen.|$|E
