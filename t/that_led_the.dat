5|$|Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was {{the only}} actor {{actually}} on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter {{was that of a}} somewhat older man than the way the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder was a year younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter role in Goldfinger <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> producers to recast the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger.|$|E

However, it was not the advantages of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.|$|E

5|$|While Arbour {{was pleased}} with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's {{critical}} portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting {{his point of view}} concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American audiences that both sides were to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not his opinions, <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> UN to not intervene.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in 12 {{games for the}} Tigers in 1913 and playing {{in the minor leagues}} in 1914, he was purchased by the Yankees before the 1915 season.

He led the American League in home runs in 1916 and 1917. With Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Joe Dugan, and Waite Hoyt, the Yankees won three consecutive American League pennants from 1921 through 1923, and won the 1923 World Series. In 1925, he lost his starting role to Lou Gehrig, after which he finished his major league career with Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E

5|$|During the Diệm era, the VNQDD were {{implicated in}} two failed coup attempts. In November 1960, a paratrooper revolt failed after the mutineers agreed to negotiate, {{allowing}} time for loyalists {{to relieve the}} president. Many of the officers involved had links to or {{were members of the}} VNQDD, and fled the country after the coup collapsed. In 1963, VNQDD leaders Tam and Vũ Hồng Khanh were among those arrested for their involvement in the plot; Tam committed suicide before the case started, and Khanh was jailed. In February 1962, two Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots, Nguyễn Văn Cừson of a prominent VNQDD leaderand Phạm Phú Quốc, bombarded the Independence Palace in a bid to kill the president and his family, but their targets escaped unharmed. Diem was eventually deposed in a military coup and killed in November 1963. While the generals <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> coup were not members of the VNQDD, they sought to cultivate ARVN officers who were part of the VNQDD because of their antipathy towards Diem.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{claimed the}} Mascarene parrot {{was found on}} Madagascar, an idea <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> French naturalist and ornithologist René Primevère Lesson to coin the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831. His new genus name prevailed and, when Tommaso Salvadori {{combined}} it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a tautonym (a scientific name {{in which the two}} parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The binomial name was emended from M. mascarinus to M. mascarin by the IOC World Bird List in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he has never seen video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E

5|$|Many princes {{were also}} {{pressured}} by popular sentiment favouring integration with India, which meant {{their plans for}} independence had little support from their subjects. The Maharaja of Travancore, for example, definitively abandoned his plans for independence after the attempted assassination of his dewan, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. In a few states, the chief ministers or dewans {{played a significant role}} in convincing the princes to accede to India. The key factors <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> states to accept integration into India were, however, the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon. The latter two were respectively the political and administrative heads of the States Department, which was in charge of relations with the princely states.|$|E

As a redshirt junior in 2010, Molk was the cornerstone in an offensive line that helped Denard Robinson break the Big Ten Conference single-season record with 4,189 yards of total offense. Molk was recognized as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player {{at the end of}} the 2010 season. As a redshirt senior in 2011, Molk anchored a line <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> way for Denard Robinson and Fitzgerald Toussaint to become Michigan's first duo of 1,000-yard rushers since 1975.

The Italian Fascist regime's 1938 racial laws against Jews caused his family members to leave Italy for Britain, France and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The impact Reeves had was immediate. As Bill Parcells {{had done}} before in 1984, Reeves named Phil Simms the {{starting}} quarterback and released Hostetler. They won their first three games, and five of their first six. The defense was back to its Parcells-era levels and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two games to go, the Giants were 11–3 and battling for an Eastern Division crown and a first round bye. However, they were upset by Phoenix, 17–6, in the next to {{last week of the}} season, setting up a winner–take–all game against the Dallas Cowboys in the season finale. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first round game 17–10 over the Minnesota Vikings. However, they were then defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3, in their worst performance of the season in the second round.|$|E
5|$|The normal peacetime British Army cavalry {{formation}} was the brigade, {{but twice}} a cavalry division had been formed. The {{first time was}} during the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. The second was during the Second Boer War (1899–1901) in South Africa, the last major conflict fought by the British Army before the First World War. During the fighting in South Africa, it was the 7,000-strong colonial mounted contingent, not the 5,000-strong regular cavalry, <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> way in tactical development. They were better trained, better armed, and more efficient, if only {{because they had been}} correctly trained to use the right weapons and tactics for the conflict. Since 1880 British cavalrymen had been armed with only carbines and swords, although some carried a lance; it was not until 1903 that the cavalry were issued rifles, the same ones used {{by the rest of the}} army. The regular cavalry regiments were considered so poor in quality that General Sir Redvers Henry Buller, commanding the advance into Northern Natal, left his six cavalry regiments behind at Ladysmith, trusting in the irregular mounted forces to carry out patrols in their stead.|$|E
