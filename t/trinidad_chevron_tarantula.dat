50|$|Psalmopoeus cambridgei, the <b>Trinidad</b> <b>chevron</b> <b>tarantula,</b> is {{a species}} of spider in the Theraphosidae family, endemic to Trinidad. Its venom {{is the source of}} psalmotoxin and vanillotoxin which are {{classified}} as inhibitor cystine knot proteins. Psalmotoxin may be of therapeutic use in patients suffering from a stroke.|$|E
50|$|Arboreal tarantulas live singly in {{specially}} constructed silken tube webs or in crevices, behind loose bark {{or among}} epiphytic plants. The <b>Trinidad</b> <b>chevron</b> <b>tarantula</b> breeds freely in captivity. Two silken egg sacs are commonly produced from one mating {{and each of}} these contains one hundred to {{one hundred and fifty}} eggs. The female spider guards the sac, turning it occasionally, and the eggs hatch after about six weeks. The spiderlings usually disperse at the first instar stage.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo novel {{peptides}} that {{inhibit the}} intra-erythrocyte stage of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro {{were identified in}} the venom of the <b>Trinidad</b> <b>chevron</b> <b>tarantula,</b> Psalmopoeus cambridgei. Psalmopeotoxin I (PcFK 1) is a 33 -residue peptide and Psalmopeotoxin II (PcFK 2) has 28 -amino acid residues; both have three disulfide bridges and belong to the Inhibitor Cystine Knot superfamily. The cDNAs encoding both peptides were cloned, and nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the peptides are synthesized with typical signal peptides and pro-sequences that are cleaved at a basic doublet before secretion of the mature peptides. The IC 5 O of PcFK 1 for inhibiting P. falciparum growth was 1. 59 ± 1. 15 μM and that of PcFK 2 was 1. 15 ± 0. 95 μM. PcFK 1 was adsorbed strongly to uninfected erythrocytes, but PcFK 2 was not. Neither peptide has significant hemolytic activity at 10 μM. Electrophysiological recordings in isolated frog and mouse neuromuscular preparations revealed that the peptides (at up to 9. 3 μM) do not affect neuromuscular transmission or quantal transmitter release. PcFK 1 and PcFK 2 do not affect the growth or viability of human epithelial cells, nor do they have any antifungal or antibacterial activity at 20 μM. Thus, PcFK 1 and PcFK 2 seem to interact specifically with infected erythrocytes. They could therefore be promising tools for antimalaria research and {{be the basis for}} the rational development of antimalarial drugs...|$|E
