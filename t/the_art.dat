At {{the time}} of writing On <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> of the Cinema, Kim's father Kim Il-sung was systematically rallying support for the younger Kim to prepare for his succession.

40|$|According to the Survey of Public Participation in <b>the</b> <b>Arts,</b> {{there has}} been a steady decline in adult {{attendance}} at “benchmark ” arts events and adult participation in <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> since 1982. <b>The</b> rate of participation in <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> in almost all areas tracked by the National Endowment for <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> has, likewise, eroded.
