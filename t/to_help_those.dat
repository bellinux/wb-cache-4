5|$|The coins were minted in August 1918, {{and were}} sold {{to the public for}} $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial {{celebrations}} or <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>those</b> in need because of World War I. Later writers have generally admired the coin, considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. The coin is valued in the hundreds of dollars today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.|$|E

Clark's season-one problems include his inability to share his secret and his desire for a normal life. After months of scouting, Welling was cast as Clark. Although David Nutter had to convince his manager that the role would not hurt the actor's film career to persuade Welling to read the pilot script, after reading the script Welling agreed to audition.|$|E
5|$|Trump's October 12, 2017 {{executive}} order and a related action {{the same day}} ending federal subsidies of questionable legality used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>those</b> buying insurance through exchanges with their co-payments and deductibles. About 6 million people were helped {{at a cost of}} $7 billion a year but that amount was expected to double in 10 years. State officials claimed the action caused insurance premiums to go up dramatically. Many states sued in federal court on the grounds that Trump was not legally allowed to take the action.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>those</b> neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E
5|$|Within {{two days}} of the cyclone striking, the Sri Lankan Red Cross began an {{operation}} with 4,000volunteers <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>those</b> most badly affected. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued a preliminary appeal for $323,000 2000USD ($ USD, $ in 2000CHF) to assist about 10,000people by making blankets, shelter, food, and kitchen utensils available. To kick-start the operation, the Federation released about $61,000 (2000USD ($ USD, $ in 2000CHF)) {{within a few hours}} of the cyclone making landfall. After about a month, the Red Cross distributed 10 roofing sheets each to 1,720 families, and also sent a set of cooking utensils, bed sheets, and sleeping mats to 3,000families. Relief ended on November 7, 2001, roughly 40weeks after the cyclone struck.|$|E
5|$|Prior to kickoff of the 2005game, {{the stadium}} {{announcer}} made an appeal for donations <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>those</b> {{suffering in the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana fivedays previously. Donations were not accepted at the game because of a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag that was given to the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during missions in southeastern Iraq. For this game only, the Longhorns wore throwback uniforms furnished by Nike as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963National Championship season under Coach Darrell K. Royal. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States have created an expectation that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90°F (32°C) which is also the average temperature in Austin for the month of September.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>those</b> within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Bolt ran as {{the third}} leg in the Jamaican 4x100 metres relay team, {{increasing}} his gold medal total to three. Along with teammates Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, and Asafa Powell, Bolt broke another world and Olympic record, their 37.10 s finish breaking the previous record by three-tenths of a second. Powell, who anchored the team to the finishing line, lamented {{the loss of his}} 100 m record to Bolt but showed no animosity towards his Jamaican rival, stating that he was delighted to help him set his third world record. In January 2017 the Jamaican relay team were stripped of their gold medals after a blood sample taken from Nesta Carter - one of Bolt's teammates in the relay - after the race, was tested again nine years later and tested positive for a banned substance. Following his victories, Bolt donated US$50,000 to the children of Sichuan province in China <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>those</b> harmed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.|$|E
