5|$|The Skanda Purana narrates that Bhikshatana-Shiva {{appears on}} another {{occasion}} as a naked, fierce Kapali beggar. Once, at a sacrifice hosted by Brahma, Bhikshatana appears and begs for food. The Brahmins performing the sacrifice try to drive him away, considering a hungry beggar unfit for sacrificial rites. Bhikshatana throws his skull begging-bowl {{on the ground and}} the Brahmins <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> but another skull bowl appears in its place. Consequently, hundreds of skulls appear, polluting the sacrifice, which compels Brahma to promise Shiva that no sacrifice will be deemed complete without an invocation to him, Kapaleshvara—the Lord of the skulls.|$|E
5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2017, Revis was {{involved}} in a street brawl in Pittsburgh around 2:40a.m. Revis was suspected to have attacked two men, knocking them unconscious. One follower attempted to record Revis on a cell phone, prompting Revis to snatch the phone and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> at the street. That night, Revis was charged for aggravated assault, robbery, terroristic threats and conspiracy stemming. Revis turned himself into police the following day and was released on non-monetary bond. All charges were dismissed March 15 after a friend of Revis testified that he was responsible for knocking the two men out.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the songwriting process, Rabin recalled the group used Abbey Road (1969) by The Beatles as a model and influence for the music on Big Generator. He explained: [...] "If we come up with an idea, why pressure ourselves into making it a song? Just have it there. If you can't come up with a chorus, don't <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> because it's not a complete song and don't put a bad chorus around it". Such an approach led to the album having tracks longer than common pop songs of the time, peaking at seven minutes in length. Rabin described Kaye's role as a greater one than he had on 90125, but continual clashes between Kaye and Horn resulted in his keyboard parts recorded in another studio away from Horn.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} was made to not use the Cox/Davies script, which gave Gilliam only ten days to write another. Gilliam has stated in an interview [...] "When we were writing the script, we really tried not to invent anything. We sort of cannibalized the book." [...] The director enlisted the help of Tony Grisoni and they wrote the script at Gilliam's home in May 1997. Grisoni remembers, [...] "I'd sit at the keyboard, and we'd talk and talk and I'd keep typing." [...] One of the most important scenes from the book that Gilliam wanted to put in the film was the confrontation between Duke and Dr. Gonzo and the waitress of the North Star Coffee Lounge. The director said, [...] "This is two guys who have gone beyond the pale, this is unforgivable – that scene, it's ugly. My approach, rather than to <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> was to make that scene the low point." ...|$|E

Three points that were raised in the lawsuit. The first is for the court to declare that the government's action in prohibiting The Herald from using the word [...] "Allah" [...] is illegal and null and void.

2500|$|When it {{came time}} to record the score for Double Indemnity, Lipstone made no secret that he despised what Rózsa had done, to which Wilder finally turned to him and snapped, [...] "You may be {{surprised}} to hear that I love it. Okay?" [...] Lipstone then disappeared and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned Rózsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing [...] "Carnegie Hall music" [...] which had no place in a film. Rózsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not – and suggested he listen to the music from Madame Curie to learn how to write a proper film score. When Rózsa pointed out that Double Indemnity was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to The Battle of Russia. Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director, Buddy DeSylva, heard the music he would <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over: expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief – only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: there was not enough of it. By this time Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously, [...] "I always find you the right guy for the job, Buddy, don't I?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} [...] "and it bred worms and rotted" [...] in [...] a Midrash asked whether {{anything}} exists that first produces worms and then rots (implying that surely, rot precedes worms). Answering in the negative, the Midrash taught that God wished to reveal to people the deeds {{of those who}} disobeyed and saved the manna, so God caused many worms to breed during that night so that the sinners should {{not be able to}} smell the staleness of the manna in the evening and <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> The Midrash told that Moses became so angry with them that he forgot to tell them to gather two omers for each person on the sixth day. So when they went out and gathered on the sixth day and found a double portion, the princes told Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses." [...] The Midrash noted that Moses told them (in [...] ), [...] "This is that which the Lord has spoken," [...] not [...] "which I have spoken," [...] because Moses had forgotten. For this reason, the Midrash taught, in [...] God asked, [...] "How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?" [...] including Moses among them (as Moses should not have given vent to his anger, thereby forgetting God’s command).|$|E
2500|$|During My Life, Stark Hesseltine told Reeve that he {{had been}} asked to {{audition}} for the leading role as Clark Kent/Superman in the big budget film, Superman (1978). Lynn Stalmaster, the casting director, put Reeve's picture and résumé {{on the top of the}} pile three separate times, only to have the producers <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> each time. Through Stalmaster's persistent pleading, a meeting between director Richard Donner, producer Ilya Salkind, and Reeve was set in January 1977 at the Sherry Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue. The morning after the meeting, Reeve was sent a 300-page script. He was thrilled that the script took the subject matter seriously, and that Richard Donner's motto was verisimilitude. Reeve immediately flew to London for a screen test, and on the way was told that Marlon Brando was going to play Jor-El and Gene Hackman was going to play Lex Luthor. Reeve still did not think he had much of a chance. Though standing , he was a self-described [...] "skinny WASP." [...] On the plane ride to London, he imagined how his approach to the role would be. He later said, [...] "By the late 1970s, the masculine image had changed... Now it was acceptable for a man to show gentleness and vulnerability. I felt that the new Superman ought to reflect that contemporary male image." [...] He based his portrayal of Clark Kent on Cary Grant in his role in Bringing Up Baby. After the screen test, his driver said, [...] "I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you've got the part." ...|$|E
