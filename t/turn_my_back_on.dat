500|$|He {{looked through}} the Yellow Pages for jobs and played at bar mitzvahs for $125; he later said [...] " [...] was glad to do it." [...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded me that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{was offered}} the chance to join World Series Cricket. He turned it down after he found the matches would be played in {{opposition}} to the Australian Cricket Board matches that were being sponsored by his employer, British American Tobacco. [...] "I felt I couldn't <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a company that had supported me in cricket for nearly ten years, and by then I wasn't really enjoying playing cricket for a living," [...] said Turner.|$|E

6000|$|Trent drew {{a handful}} of cigars from his pocket. [...] "They're beastly," [...] he said, [...] "but it's a beastly country. I'll be glad to <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellency, spare me," [...] I murmured. [...] "Did {{you know}} all my miserable story you would be merciful. Did you know with what joy I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the Court of Pesaro--" ...|$|R
60|$|As I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{the coarse}} and {{exciting}} {{life in the}} saloons and gambling hells, and spent all my time except when sleeping, out in the windy open under blue sky and starry heaven, my spirit had an uplift.|$|R
6000|$|... "The lamp," [...] said Miserrimus Dexter, [...] "and the looking-glass.--Pardon me," [...] he added, {{addressing}} us, [...] "for <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> you.

6000|$|... "If I {{thought there}} was any fear of our doing so," [...] {{observed}} Mr. Pennycoop, [...] "I'd <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the Church of England to-morrow and become a Methodist." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{stood there}} looking at 'im, but he couldn't meet my eye. None of 'em could; and arter waiting {{there for a minute}} or two to give 'em a chance, I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> 'em and went off to my dooty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the scene. I heard Carlos's loud cries as if {{from some}} extreme grief too poignant for words. I heard the {{complaining}} murmur of the crew and the maledictions of Torres, the sailing master--I {{could not bear to}} look.|$|R
60|$|I was so irate at his audacity, so disgusted that {{presently}} I {{felt that}} I {{could not bear}} {{the sight of him}} any longer.

6000|$|... "How {{dare you}} say I lie?" [...] demanded Lucy. [...] "I've {{a mind to}} <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> you. I'm {{trying to make up}} for my blunder and you--you insult me!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Yet his, {{none the}} less, was half the victory. Nothing on earth could now have dissuaded me from keeping my bargain. His words had bitterly frightened me.

60|$|What excuses I made {{to account}} for my strange conduct I cannot now remember.

60|$|I {{had just}} opened my lips {{to make one}} more attempt at reconciliation, by saying some pacifying words to her--when she planted that last sting in me.

60|$|My sorrow because Jacob {{had left}} us on a venture from which I {{did not believe}} he could ever return, {{was so great that}} I felt no desire for food, but ate it from a sense of duty, even as I had <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> comrade when he needed aid.|$|R

6000|$|... "Let us {{pass them}} boldly," [...] he muttered to Margaret; [...] "I'll not <b>turn</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a brace of Spaniards," [...] {{but he also}} laid his hand upon the hilt of the sword he wore beneath his cloak, and bade her get behind him.|$|E
5000|$|Invited {{to partake}} in the Moderna Museet's [...] "Art in Motion" [...] (1961) exhibition, curated by Pontus Hulten, Leslie {{proposed}} Jolly, a kit with the ingredients {{to make an}} inflatable sculpture. Anticipating Andy Warhol's Clouds (1966), he proposed that a massive weather balloon suspend a brick over an inflated wading pool. In 1962, having gained recognition as a second generation Abstract Expressionist painter, Leslie abruptly changed course. His new works were realistic figurative paintings in grisaille, of which he later said, [...] "there was {{a point at which}} I realized that if my work was to develop and evolve, and if I was to mature as an artist, these figurative ideas could not be ignored, even though following them could seem to imply that I would be <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the twentieth century, <b>turning</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> abstract achievement".|$|R
5000|$|Reflecting on {{his time}} as an {{undergraduate}} at Wadham, McGrath has written, I was discovering that Christianity was far more intellectually robust than I had ever imagined. I had some major rethinking to do, {{and by the end}} of November 1971, my decision was made: I <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> one faith and embraced another.’ ...|$|R
60|$|His eyes {{wandered over}} the turf beneath me, mounted slowly up, my foot to my head, {{and looked into}} mine. In their intense regard I seemed to be but a bubble {{floating}} away into the air. I shivered, and <b>turned</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> him, {{without waiting for an}} answer. He followed me as quietly as a sheep.|$|R
