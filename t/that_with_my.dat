5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> fans.|$|E
500|$|During the quarterfinal {{match against}} Brazil, Rapinoe came on as a {{substitute}} and served the precise cross to Abby Wambach's equalizer goal in the 122nd minute of the game: a goal that holds the record for latest goal ever scored in a World Cup match. Rapinoe would later convert her shot during the penalty shootout to help send the United States to the semifinals. Rapinoe described her last minute cross against Brazil: [...] "I just took a touch and friggin' smacked it with my left foot. I don't think I've hit a ball like <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> left foot. I got it to the back post and that beast in the air just got a hold of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then I think that this is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who will tell me that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emerson would {{occasionally}} cover or sample other musical works in his compositions. Permission to use pieces was sometimes denied by the composer or his family; for example Gustav Holst's daughter refused to grant official permission for rock bands to perform her late father's composition Mars, the Bringer of War. However, {{a number of}} composers did grant permission for their works to be used. Aaron Copland {{said that there was}} [...] "something that attracted [...] " [...] about ELP's version of [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man", and so approved its use, although he said, [...] "What they do in the middle (i.e., the modal section between repeats of Copland's theme), I'm not sure exactly how they connect <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> music" [...] Alberto Ginastera, on the other hand, enthusiastically approved Emerson's electronic realisation of the fourth movement of his first piano concerto, which appeared on their album Brain Salad Surgery under the title [...] "Toccata". Ginastera said, [...] "You have captured the essence of my music, and no one's ever done that before." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aguilera {{set about}} {{contacting}} collaborators {{on her own}} accord, {{at the behest of}} then-husband Jordan Bratman, without relying on the record label A [...] "Going into , I said, 'I'm a really big fan of yours, and I'm interested in stepping into your world and what you do,'" [...] Aguilera says. [...] "'I want to combine <b>that</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> sound, and let's see what happens.' I feel like I can do so much with my voice. I would be so bored sitting on a stool singing ballad after ballad just because I can." [...] Australian singer-songwriter Sia Furler and her collaborator Samuel Dixon worked with Aguilera on a number of tracks for the album. Aguilera told Billboard that she is a big fan of Furler and stated that she was thrilled when Furler said that she wanted to work with her as well. They recorded together in the studio in January 2009, and according to Furler's blog the duo wrote four songs together during the sessions. Members of British electronic band Ladytron, Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu, went to Los Angeles to meet Aguilera in December 2008 after hearing that they were one of her favorite bands. During the meeting, Aguilera identified what kind of Ladytron songs she liked, with Hunt later saying, [...] "We were impressed because she had a real deep knowledge of our music – album tracks, not just the singles!". Ladytron said following about the sessions with the singer, [...] "We went in with no expectations; the whole thing was a massive surprise. But it was incredible. She was so musically talented, a vocalist who really knows her voice. The first takes sounded really amazing, and while we'd made demos, it was only when her voice was on them that it all came to life." [...] They finished the work with Aguilera in March 2009 and produced four or five tracks, but only three songs made the final cut. Two songs produced by Ladytron appeared on the deluxe edition of the album, [...] "Birds of Prey" [...] and [...] "Little Dreamer." [...] Meanwhile, the third track, [...] "Kimono Girl" [...] did not make the final cut, although it has been highly anticipated by fans. British duo Goldfrapp said in a January 2010 interview that they did not finish the studio session and did not know whether their songs would make the final cut.|$|E
