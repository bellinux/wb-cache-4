40|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> by Spemann and Mangold in 1924 raised {{two kinds of}} questions: those about the means of patterning the chordate body axis and those about the mechanisms of cell determination by induction. Some researchers, stressing the second, have suggested {{over the years that}} <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> is poorly named and doesn't really organize because inducers act permissively, because they are not unique to <b>the</b> <b>organizer,</b> and because multipotent responsive cells develop complex local differentiations under artificial conditions. Furthermore, with the {{discovery of}} meso-endoderm induction in 1969, the possibility arose that this earlier induction generates as much organization as, or more than, does <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> itself. Evidence is summarized in this article that <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> does fulfill its title with regard to pattern formation: it adds greatly to embryonic organization by providing information about time, place, scale, and orientation for development by nearby members of the large multipotent competence groups surrounding <b>the</b> <b>organizer.</b> Embryos having smaller or larger organizers due to experimental intervention develop defective axial organization. Without an <b>organizer</b> <b>the</b> embryo develops no body axis and none of the four chordate characters: the notochord, gill slits, dorsal hollow nerve chord, and post-anal tail. For normal axis formation, <b>the</b> <b>organizer's</b> tripartite organization is needed. Each part differs in inducers, morphogenesis, and self-differentiation. <b>The</b> <b>organizer</b> is a trait of development of all members of the chordate phylum. In comparison to hemichordates, which constitute a phylum with some similarities to chordates, the chordamesoderm part is unique to <b>the</b> chordate <b>organizer</b> (<b>the</b> trunk-tail <b>organizer).</b> Its convergent extension displaces the gastrula posterior pole from alignment with the animal-vegetal axis and generates a new anteroposterior axis orthogonal to this old one. Once it has extended to full length, its signaling modifies the dorsoventral dimension. This addition to <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> is seen as a major event in chordate evolution, bringing body organization beyond that achieved by oocyte organization and meso-endoderm induction in other groups...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>organizer</b> of <b>the</b> {{amphibian}} gastrula {{provides the}} neurectoderm with both neuralizing and posteriorizing (transforming) signals. In zebrafish, transplantations {{show that a}} spatially distinct transformer signal emanates from tissues other than <b>the</b> <b>organizer.</b> Cells of <b>the</b> germring (nonaxial mesendoderm) posteriorized forebrain progenitors when grafted nearby, resulting in an ectopic hindbrain-like structure; in contrast, cells of <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> (axial mesendoderm) caused no posterior transformation. Local application of basic fibroblast growth factor, a candidate transformer in Xenopus, caused malformation but not hindbrain transformation in the forebrain. Thus, the zebrafish gastrula may integrate spatially distinct signals from <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> and <b>the</b> germring to pattern the neural axis...|$|R

5|$|At the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, Fischer scored 8½ {{points in}} the first 10 games, to lead the field.

Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor, since Fischer knew little French and <b>the</b> <b>organizers</b> had very limited English.

50|$|Typically, an EQA scheme {{consists}} of several rounds per year.

Often the test items' properties and analyte concentrations are known to <b>the</b> <b>organizer,</b> but not disclosed to participants before the final report. However, there are also many schemes where <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> doesn't know <b>the</b> sample composition.

40|$|AbstractIn Xenopus embryos, the dorso-ventral and antero-posterior axes are {{established}} by <b>the</b> Spemann–Mangold <b>organizer.</b> According to <b>the</b> prevalent model of early development, <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> is {{induced by the}} dorsalizing Nieuwkoop signal, which is secreted by the Nieuwkoop center. Formation of the center requires the maternal Wnt pathway, which is active on the dorsal side of embryos. Nevertheless, the molecular nature of the Nieuwkoop signal remains unclear. Since the Nieuwkoop center and <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> both produce dorsalizing signals in vitro, we asked if they might share molecular components. We find that vegetal explants, the source of Nieuwkoop signal in recombination assays, express a number of <b>organizer</b> genes. <b>The</b> product {{of one of these}} genes, chordin, is required for signaling, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> and <b>the</b> center share at least some molecular components. Furthermore, experiments with whole embryos show that maternal Wnt activity is required in <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> just as it is needed in the Nieuwkoop center in vitro. We conclude that the maternal Wnt pathway generates the Nieuwkoop center in vitro and <b>the</b> <b>organizer</b> in vivo by activating a common set of genes, without the need of an intermediary signaling step...|$|R
