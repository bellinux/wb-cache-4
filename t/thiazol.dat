MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation was evaluated by methyl <b>thiazol</b> tetrazolium bromide reduction; apoptosis by annexin V, mitochondrial transmembrane potential by tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester. Functional experiments and gene expression evaluations were performed by flow cytometry, microarray, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Significant cell growth inhibition and increased apoptosis were observed. ITF 2357 reduced protein levels of BCL- 2, MCL- 1, and BCL-X, and increased levels of BAK. Exposure to ITF 2357 did not abrogate NF-κB DNA binding.

40|$|Aims: Bovine {{lactoferrin}} (bLf) causes anchorage-independent cell {{growth in}} PC 12 cells. The present {{study investigated the}} mechanisms involved in bLf-induced anchorage-independent cell growth and survival in PC 12 cells. Main methods: The number of adherent cells and suspended cells was estimated separately by using a methyl <b>thiazol</b> tetrazolium (MTT) assay, and the sum of both optical density (O. D.) (570 nm) values {{was used as a}} measure {{of the total number of}} cells. Key findings: Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) plays an important role in integrin and growth factor signaling pathways. Stable transfection of PC 12 cells with a dominant negative kinase-deficient mutant of ILK (DN-ILK) inhibited bLf-induced anchorage-independent cell growth. The ILK activity in the parental cells was transiently activated after addition of bLf, whereas bLf-induced activation of ILK was blocked in DN-ILK-transfected cells. bLf also activated p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); however, the p 38 MAPK activation was inhibited by stable DN-ILK transfection. Moreover, cell viability in the suspended cells by bLf strongly decreased after treatment with SB 203580, an inhibitor of p 38 MAPK. Significance: These results suggest that ILK is involved in bLf-induced anchorage-independent cell growth and viability via activation of p 38 MAPK. [URL]...|$|E

Rubber gutter compound was made from mixing of natural (RSS) and synthetic rubber (SBR) and some aditives such Zink Oxide, Stearic Acid, Napthenic Oil, HAF black, Phenyl Beta Naphtylamine, Mercapto Benz <b>Thiazol</b> Disulfide, Diphenyl Guanidine and Sulphur. Three compositions of RSS/SBR and Phenyl Beta Naphtylamine were used in {{the research}}, namely 40 / 60; 50 / 50; 60 / 40, and 1 : 1, 5; 2 respectively. A statistical procedure was used to analyze the data of the physical characteristic of rubber gutter compound produced. The results were compared to the data of the physical characteristic of rubber gutter compound produced. The results were compared to the physical strength of rubber gutter available in the market. From the statistical analyses they denoted that the levels of Phenyl Beta Naphtylamine gave significant effects on elongation at break and constant deflection however there was no effect on tensile strength. The composition levels of RSS /SBR could produce compounds which were significant difference in the tensile strength, elongation at break and constant deflection. Compounds resulted from this research had better tensile strength and elongation compared to rubber gutter available in the market...|$|E
40|$|The Forkhead box protein M 1 (FoxM 1) is an {{important}} transcription factor having significant roles in various cellular events. FoxM 1 overexpression {{has been reported to}} be related with many types of cancer. However, it is not known whether it contributes to oncogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Siomycin A, a <b>thiazol</b> antibiotic, is known to inhibit FoxM 1 transcriptional activity. In this study, we aimed to determine gene expression levels of FoxM 1 in Jurkat cells (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line) and therapeutic potential of targeting FoxM 1 by siomycin A alone and in combination with dexamethasone which improves the survival of children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also examined the molecular mechanisms of siomycin A and dexamethasone-induced cell death in Jurkat cells. We demonstrated that FoxM 1 mRNA is highly expressed in Jurkat cells. Dexamethasone and siomycin A caused a significant reduction in gene expression levels of FoxM 1 in Jurkat cells. Targeting FoxM 1 by siomycin A and dexamethasone caused a significant decrease in T-ALL cell line proliferation through induction of G 1 cell cycle arrest. All these findings suggest a possible role of FoxM 1 in T-cell ALL pathogenesis and represent FoxM 1 as an attractive target for T-cell ALL therapy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Summary: This paper {{describes}} {{a comparison between}} the microscopic brilliant cresyl blue and the flow cytometric <b>thiazol</b> orange (FACScan) and auramine O (Sysmex) methods for enumeration of reticulocytes. The mean intra-assay coefficients of Variation for the microscopic, FACScan and Sysmex methods were established to be 33, 9 and 5 % respectively. A rather poor correlation was observed between the microscopic count and both flow cytometric methods (FACScan r = 0. 61; Sysmex r = 0. 57). However, {{the correlation between the}} flow cyto-metric methods was satisfactory (r = 0. 79). Reference ranges for the reticulocyte count, corresponding with the 2. 5 th and 97. 5 th percentile, were determined for the microscopic (8 - 30 %o), FACScan (ll- 27 %o) and Sysmex (8 - 18 %o) methods. Sysmex R- 3000 methodology definitely revealed the lowest and narrowest reference ränge. In conclusion, because of higher reproducibility, flow cytometric analysis of reticulocytes is an attractive alternative procedure for the microscopic enumeration method.

40|$|Zinc has {{important}} effects on structural and functional activities of many proteins and enzymes involved in biological activities especially regulation of immune- system. Deficiencies of this element {{may result in}} many diseases and immunological disorders. Symptoms of zinc toxicity include nausea/vomiting, fever, cough, diarrhea, fatigue, neuropathy and dehydration. Further signs include growth retardation, altered iron function, anemia, copper deficiency, decreased immune function, decreased HDL (high density lipoprotein), increased LDL (low density lipoprotein), and increased HgbA 1 C. This study was carried out to examine the in vitro effects of different concentration of zinc on viability and death of T-Lymphoid (Molt- 4) cell line. In this study, the cell line was exposed to different concentrations of zinc (10 nM to 500 µM) followed by incubation (37 °C, 5 % CO 2) at various time points (12 to 72 h). The cells were then evaluated with trypan blue exclusion dye and Mitochondorial <b>Thiazol</b> Tetrazolium Assay (MTT) and light microscopy. The {{results of this study}} showed almost different responses to different amounts of zinc by The T cell line (Molt- 4). Zinc concentrations below 100 µM at different incubation time points had little or no effect on cell line compared to the controls. Higher concentrations of zinc (> 100 µM) viability diminished to 70 % at 12 h and less than 50 % at 24 to 72 h of incubation times. We conclude that Zinc has dose-dependent cytotoxicity on Molt- 4 cells...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, using drug {{delivery}} {{is an essential}} method to improve cancer therapy through decreasing drug toxicity and increasing efficiency of treatment. Silibinin (C 25 H 22 O 10), a polyphenolic flavonoid which is isolated from the milk thistle plant, has various applications in cancer therapy but it has hydrophobic structure with low water solubility and bioavailability. To increase the effect of silibinin, silibinin-loaded PLGA-PEG-Fe 3 O 4 was prepared to determine the inhibitory effect of this nanodrug on Telomerase gene expression. Methods: The rate of silibinin loaded into PLGA-PEG-Fe 3 O 4 was measured. Then, the cytotoxic effect of silibinin-loaded PLGA-PEG-Fe 3 O 4 was determined by Methyl <b>Thiazol</b> Tetrazolium (MTT) assay. After that, inhibition of Telomerase gene expression was indicated through Real-time PCR. Results: Data analysis from MTT assay showed that silibinin-loaded PLGA-PEG-Fe 3 O 4 had dose dependent cytotoxic effect on T 47 D cell line. MTT assay showed no cytotoxic effect of free PLGA-PEG- Fe 3 O 4 on T 47 D breast cancer cell line. Real Time PCR analysis showed {{that the level of}} telomerase gene expression more efficiently decreased with silibinin-loaded PLGA-PEG- Fe 3 O 4 than with free silibinin alone. Conclusion: The present study indicates that this nanodrug causes down-regulation of Telomerase gene expression in cancer cells. Therefore, PLGA-PEG- Fe 3 O 4 could be an appropriate carrier for hydrophobic agents such as silibinin to improve their action in cancer therapy...|$|E
