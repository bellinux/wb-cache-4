40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Caste is peripheral to official (state and donor) frameworks {{for the analysis}} of poverty and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in South Asia, and yet caste is evermore central to the assertion of rights to development resources by marginal groups themselves. Given growing wealth and aspirations in India, the inequality of opportunity, persistent poverty, unemployment, ill-health or low education levels are interpreted by such groups as caste discrimination. This programme of research focuses on organisations, movements and campaigns that insist on the continuing relevance of caste to poverty, and that assert the rights of caste-excluded Dalits. It examines the conjunction of international rights-based approaches to development and regional ethno-politics. It focuses on civil society actors - churches, development NGOs, women's organisations and international Dalit human rights campaigns - that have produced this conjunction, particularly from south India (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka) where pervasive caste discrimination persists. The research uses institutional/network ethnography to examine the 'dalitisation' of social policy, and village-level study to discover the social consequences of promoting the politics of poverty as the politics of identity, the influence on access to resources, and <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrapment</b> in subordinated identities or of caste conflict and violenc...|$|R

50|$|Because the {{umbilical}} cord—the baby’s oxygen supply—is significantly compressed while {{the head is}} in the pelvis during a breech birth, {{it is important that}} the delivery of the aftercoming fetal head not be delayed. If the arm is extended alongside the head, delivery will not occur. If this occurs, the Løvset manoeuvre may be employed, or the arm may be manually brought to a position in front of the chest. The Løvset manoeuvre involves rotating the fetal body by holding the fetal pelvis. Twisting the body such that an arm trails behind the shoulder, it will tend to cross down over the face to a position where it can be reached by the obstetrician's finger, and brought to a position below the head. A similar rotation in the opposite direction is made to deliver the other arm. In order to present the smallest diameter (9.5 cm) to the pelvis, the baby’s head must be flexed (chin to chest). If the head is in a deflexed position, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrapment</b> is increased. Uterine contractions and maternal muscle tone encourage the head to flex.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} rapid-manufacturable, hair-actuated contact sensor array {{designed}} for use on legged millirobots. The sensor is an array of sensitive contact switches. Each switch is activated by loading a hair mounted at the switch tip. The hair sensor array is sufficiently sensitive to detect the small contact forces experienced by a lightweight robot, with an average normal sensitivity of 0. 8 grams/hair. The compliant polymer hairs detect both normal and shear contact, allowing the array to detect a variety of contact forces. By virtue of its design, the hair sensor array can be fabricated using a roll-to-roll layered process. We demonstrate a straightforward application of the sensor technology on a hexapedal millirobot, using the array to both estimate average ground speed and detect high-centering when running over obstacles. This application {{is of particular interest}} for milliscale robots operating in rough terrain, where <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrapment</b> is high. Our results indicate that the hair sensor array can estimate ground speed and detect highcentering when running over simple geometric obstacles. I...|$|E
40|$|How {{do great}} powers {{decide whether to}} provide arms to or form alliances with client states? This “patron's dilemma” {{revolves}} around a decision about how to best provide security to clients without becoming entrapped in unwanted conflicts. Strong commitments worsen <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrapment,</b> whereas weak commitments intensify fears of abandonment. This traditional alliance dilemma can be addressed through the provision of arms and alliances. Great power patrons primarily make such decisions {{on the basis of}} two factors: first, {{the extent to which the}} patron believes it and its client have common security interests; and second, whether the patron believes that its client has sufficient military capabilities to deter its main adversary without the patron's assistance. Patrons assess the degree of shared threat and the local balances of capabilities in determining whether to support their clients with arms, alliances, or both. As demonstrated in the U. S. provision of security goods to Taiwan and Israel during the Cold War, this strategic logic explains how great powers manage the patron's dilemma...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we provide}} a {{longitudinal}} account of institutionally originated, cohort inequalities in a two-tier labour market, taking Italy as an exemplary case of partial and targeted deregulation. We examine the incidence and career consequences of temporary employment relying on panel data, across reforms {{implemented in the}} 1990 s and early 2000 s. A substitution effect is found for {{the initial stages of}} workers’ careers: while the youngest cohorts of school-leavers increasingly enter the flexible labour market, access to stable positions is hampered. Previous experiences in the flexible segment of the labour force also increase <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrapment</b> in temporary jobs. This lock-in dynamic is more visible for post-reforms cohorts and might have increased labour market inefficiency. Indeed, the entrapment risk has risen disproportionately for those individuals whose (un) observed characteristics could instead predict a faster exit from the flexible labour market, possibly towards stable positions. Our findings cast doubts on the transitory nature of temporary work in Italy and on the efficiency of partial and targeted reforms...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The port-access {{approach}} allows surgeons {{to perform}} heart operations through small intercostal openings, or 'ports'. This technique requires new skills for anesthesiologists. A pulmonary artery venting (PAV) catheter and, in some cases, a coronary sinus catheter (for administration of retrograde cardioplegia) are positioned {{with the aid}} of fluoroscopy and transesophageal echography (TEE). Both catheters have a wider diameter than the more commonly used conventional PA catheter and present distinctive features. We report a case in which a pulmonary artery venting catheter was entrapped by a suture during a port-access procedure. Clinical Features: A 35 -yr-old man with severe mitral valve insufficiency was scheduled for valve repair. After a successful bypass procedure, resistance was felt while attempting to withdraw the PAV catheter. On fluoroscopy, fixation of the catheter at the heart level was established and perforation by suture was confirmed after injection of a contrast agent. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cardiac wall rupture and tamponade, the thorax was reopened. After release of some atrial sutures, the catheter could be withdrawn easily. Transfixion by a suture was confirmed by visual examination. Conclusion: The more frequent use of a PAV catheter in minimally invasive cardiac surgery with the port-access technique should remind the anesthesiologist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrapment</b> by surgical sutures. Surgeons should be aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> accidentally transfixing this catheter during closure of the atriotomy via the port.

40|$|For {{applications}} in which unmanned vehicles must traverse unfamiliar terrain, there often exists <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> vehicle <b>entrapment.</b> Typically, this risk {{can be reduced}} by using feedback from on-board sensors that assess the terrain. This work addressed the situations where a vehicle has already become immobilized or the desired route cannot be traversed using conventional rolling. Specifically, {{the focus was on}} using push-pull locomotion in high sinkage granular material. Push-pull locomotion is an alternative mode of travel that generates thrust through articulated motion, using vehicle components as anchors to push or pull against. It has been revealed through previous research that push-pull locomotion has the capacity for generating higher net traction forces than rolling, and a unique optical flow technique indicated that this {{is the result of a}} more efficient soil shearing method. It has now been found that pushpull locomotion results in less sinkage, lower travel reduction, and better power efficiency in high sinkage material as compared to rolling. Even when starting from an "entrapped" condition, push-pull locomotion was able to extricate the test vehicle. It is the authors' recommendation that push-pull locomotion be considered as a reliable back-up mode of travel for applications where terrain entrapment is a possibility...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{dimensional}} {{guidelines for}} bedrails {{have been developed}} to minimise <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>entrapment</b> within <b>the</b> bed. We examined whether bedrails in a large Irish teaching hospital complied with these standards. Design and setting: survey of 60 accessible beds in six hospital wards. Methods: a specialised cone and cylinder tool that mimics the size and weight of a small adult neck and head was used to determine gaps in the four zones most associated with entrapment. Results: the number of failures for each zone was 15 beds for zone 1 (any space between the perimeters of the rail); 42 beds for zone 2 (the space under the rail); 41 beds for zone 3 (the space between the inside surface of the bedrail and the mattress) and 13 beds for zone 4 (the space between the mattress and rail {{at the end of the}} rail). Failures were more common with hydraulic adjusted than with electric profiling beds. Mattresses that were the wrong size (usually too narrow) or too soft and bedrails that were loose or were poorly maintained accounted for many failures. Conclusion: many beds used in our hospital did not comply with dimensional standards to minimise entrapment <b>risks.</b> This emphasises <b>the</b> need for careful selection of patients for whom bedrails are to be used as well as the need for monitoring and maintenance of bed systems...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a research aimed at studying the effect of replacing part of portland cement with fly ash and bottom ash, both from municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI). Fly ash was subjected to a washing treatment to reduce the chloride content, while bottom ash was subjected to dry grinding or wet grinding under water. Concretes with addition of different types of ashes, including a traditional coal fly ash, were manufactured. Fresh and hardened properties of the concretes were compared in order to study the advantages and the side effects of each type of addition. Results showed that MSWI bottom ash is potentially attractive as mineral addition for the production of concrete, provided that <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrapment</b> of hydrogen bubbles produced by corrosion of aluminium metallic particles in the fresh concrete is prevented. This could be achieved by wet grinding the bottom ash so that reactions leading to gas development exhaust within the slurry before this is added to the concrete mixture. However, by considering bottom ashes from different incinerators, a great variability was observed in the time required to complete the hydrogen gas production. Nevertheless, when the hydrogen development in the fresh concrete could be avoided, wet ground MSWI bottom showed a good pozzolanic behavior and proved to give a significant contribution {{to the development of the}} strength and impermeability of concrete...|$|E
40|$|This paper evaluates a {{possible}} US-SACU (Southern African Customs Union) {{free trade agreement}} {{as part of a}} US approach to new preferential trade agreements characterized by the term competitive liberalization. ' This is the idea that competition among large countries (US/EU) to negotiate preferential arrangements with smaller countries or regions will lower barriers, and eventually add fresh impulse to new multilateral WTO negotiations. In commercial policy terms, the US interest in such an arrangement lies in improved access to a smaller but more protected market where the EU already has preferential arrangements, and the SACU interest lies in improved access to a much larger but less protected market. There is also a SACU interest in weakening the trade restrictive effects of MFA quotas in the US for apparel imports. <b>The</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>entrapment</b> in extremely complex rules of origin arrangements which at times close markets (as in NAFTA and other US bilaterals) is a concern for SACU. Also, gains to SACU may be only temporary because of the US proposal to eliminate non agricultural tariffs entirely in the WTO by 2015. In key non commodity trade areas (services, investment, intellectual property, temporary entry of business persons), if other US bilaterals are any guide most liberalization requested will be heavily asymmetric if not unilateral on the SACU side. SACU does not currently cover any of these items since it is only a customs union, and prior negotiation will be needed among SACU countries. SACU also clearly has an interest in coordinating its negotiation with other US bilateral negotiating partners. These and other barriers to negotiation (including negotiating capacity constraints in several SACU members) will influence the outcome of negotiations. ...|$|E

40|$|The use of TurboSwirl {{to obtain}} an {{improved}} steel cleanliness during filling of an ingot was numerically studied by VOF and DPM models. It was found that a radius-reduced TurboSwirl or a proper tapered mold entrance nozzle with an adequate developed region for steel flow can reduce <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mold flux <b>entrapment</b> in a mold. The ingot casting process can create highly turbulent conditions inside the mold during {{the initial stages of}} casting. Since the TurboSwirl generates much calmer filling conditions it can promote separation of large nonmetallic inclusions. The TurboSwirl also collects large inclusions (200 [*]μm) towards the axis of rotation, which should promote agglomeration. In addition, the residence time for inclusions of small sizes can be prolonged, increasing chance of agglomeration, which indirectly promotes their separation from steel. Moreover, the average turbulent dissipation rate in an ingot casting swirl setup is about 40 % higher than that in a no swirl setup. This further facilitates the agglomeration of inclusions before they enter the mold. The removal of nonmetallic inclusions is thus enhanced because of an increasing inclusion collision rate due to both Stokes collisions and turbulent collisions, while maintaining a calm flow inside the mold...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Despite {{the high}} {{frequency}} of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, {{the relation between}} work conditions and ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow {{has not been the}} object of much research. In the present study, the predictive factors for such ulnar nerve entrapment were determined in a 3 -year prospective survey of upper-limb work-related musculoskeletal disorders in repetitive work. METHODS: In 1993 - 1994 and 3 years later, 598 workers whose jobs involved repetitive work underwent an examination by their occupational health physicians and completed a self-administered questionnaire. Predictive factors associated with the onset <b>of</b> ulnar nerve <b>entrapment</b> at the elbow were studied with bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The annual incidence was estimated at 0. 8 % per person-year, on the basis of 15 new cases during the 3 -year period. Holding a tool in position was the only predictive biomechanical factor [odds ratio (OR) 4. 1, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 4 - 12. 0]. Obesity increased <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ulnar nerve <b>entrapment</b> at the elbow (OR 4. 3, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 16. 2), as did the presence of medial epicondylitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, radial tunnel syndrome, and cervicobrachial neuralgia. The associations with "holding a tool in position" and obesity were unchanged when the presence of other diagnoses was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the study, the results suggest that the incidence <b>of</b> ulnar nerve <b>entrapment</b> at the elbow is associated with one biomechanical risk factor (holding a tool in position, repetitively), overweight, and other upper-limb work-related musculoskeletal disorders, especially medial epicondylitis and other nerve entrapment disorders (cervicobrachial neuralgia and carpal and radial tunnel syndromes) ...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. Mechanical {{testing of}} cadaveric spines. Objective. To test the {{hypothesis}} that, in the ageing spine, vertebrae deform more than discs, {{and contribute to}} time-dependent creep. Summary of Background Data. Intervertebral discs and vertebrae deform under load, narrowing the intervertebral foramen and increasing <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> nerve root <b>entrapment.</b> Little is known about compressive deformations when elderly spines are subjected to sustained physiologic loading. Methods. A total of 117 thoracolumbar motion segments, aged 19 to 96 yrs (mean, 69), were subjected to 1 kN compressive loading for 0. 5, 1, or 2 hours. Deformations during the first 7 seconds were designated "elastic" and subsequent deformations as "creep". A 3 -parameter model was fitted to experimental data in order to characterize their viscous modulus E- 1, elastic modulus E- 2 (initial stiffness), and viscosity eta (resistance to fluid flow). Intradiscal pressure (IDP) was measured using a miniature needle-mounted transducer. In 17 specimens loaded for 0. 5 hours, an optical MacReflex system measured compressive deformations separately in the disc and each vertebral body. Results. On average, the disc contributed 28 % of the spine's elastic deformation, 51 % of the creep deformation, and 38 % of total deformation. Elastic, creep, and total deformations of 84 motion segments in 2 -hour tests averaged 0. 87, 1. 37, and 2. 24 mm respectively. Measured deformations were predicted accurately by the model (average r(2) = 0. 97), but E- 1, E- 2, and eta depended on the duration of loading. E- 1 and eta decreased with advancing age and disc degeneration, in proportion to falling IDP (P < 0. 001). Total compressive deformation increased with age, but rarely exceeded 3 mm. Conclusion. When the ageing spine is compressed, vertebral bodies show greater elastic deformations than intervertebral discs, and creep by a similar amount. Responses to axial compression depend largely on IDP, but deformations appear to be limited by impaction of adjacent neural arches. Total compressive deformations are sufficient to cause foraminal stenosis in some individuals...|$|R

The authors have created classification of Latvian trade sector economic and financial <b>risks</b> and classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trade technological process <b>risks.</b> <b>The</b> authors have created the algorithms of classification and assessment of the trade sector enterprises’ <b>risks.</b> <b>The</b> economic <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country’s economic slowdown, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> increment <b>of</b> taxes, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> reduction in consumer’s solvency, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> demand’s instability and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency of credit resources. <b>The</b> financial <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> unpaid credit, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> financial instability, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency <b>of</b> own capital, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> liquidity and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> debtors. <b>The</b> trade technological process <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> organization <b>of</b> selling goods, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> accounting, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ordering goods, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> acceptance <b>of</b> goods and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> transportation of goods. In order to develop their business strategies, enterprises need to identify, classify and assess the Latvian trade sector risks. Enterprises can use the authors created algorithms of classification and assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> to produce their own risk management systems...|$|R

40|$|Background: Clivus {{fractures}} {{are highly}} uncommon. The classification by Corradino et al. divides the different lesions in longitudinal, transverse and oblique fractures. Longitudinal types {{are associated with}} the highest mortality rate between 67 – 80 %. Clivus fractures are often found after high velocity trauma, especially traffic accidents and falls. <b>The</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> neurologic lesions is high, because of the anatomic proximity to neurovascular structures like the brainstem, the vertebrobasilar artery, and the cranial nerves. Longitudinal clivus fractures have a special <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> causing <b>entrapment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basilar artery and thus ischemia of the brainstem. Case presentation: This lesion in our patient was a combination-fracture of the craniocervical junction with a transverse clivus fracture. In this case, the primary closed reduction of the clivus fracture and the immobilization with a halo device was the therapy of choice and led to consolidation of the fracture. Conclusion: Therapy advices and examples in the literature are scarce. We present a patient with a clivus fracture, who could be well treated by a halo device. Through detailed research of the literature a therapy algorithm has been developed. <br...|$|R
