40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the extent to which the {{principal}} and teacher leaders at four purposefully selected schools collaboratively developed <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice related to the exchange between empowerment and accountability envisioned by education reform writers. The researcher posited that the tradeoff between empowerment and responsibility envisioned by policymakers would never occur without the principal and teacher leaders forming a consensus-building group and co-developing <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice as the basis for improving schools. Two research questions guided this investigation: (a) To what extent were principal espoused <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice and modeled behaviors congruent and (b) To what extent did the principal and teacher leaders co-develop <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice related to the trade-off between empowerment and accountability. The researcher used a qualitative, multiple case study design to examine <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice at four purposefully selected schools. Data were collected by interview, observation, document mining, and norm checklist. The researcher conducted semistructured interviews with six teacher leaders and the principal at each site. A focus group comprising four teachers assisted the researcher in clarifying the wording on the norm checklist at each school. The researcher coded and categorized until a saturation point was reached. Findings indicated that the principal influenced, to a great extent, the codeveloped <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice of teacher leaders and the principals. Many commonalities surfaced in this study among and between principal <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice and among and between principal and teacher leader co-developed <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice. The four most common themes comprising the collective <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> practice were: (a) building relationships, (b) focusing on students as a priority, (c) making collective decisions, and (d) accepting responsibility for school-wide outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The dilaton {{in three}} {{dimensions}} does not roll. Witten’s conjecture that duality between <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> three and four dimensions solves the cosmological constant problem thus may also solve the dilaton problem <b>in</b> string <b>theory.</b> 1 Recently Witten pointed out that theories with Bogomol’nyi saturated solitons {{may be related to}} <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> higher dimensions in a Kaluza–Klein type framework [1, 2]. This idea can be motivated from classical duality considerations which generically imply a trading between solitons and particles <b>in</b> dual <b>theories.</b> Given the soliton–particle correspondence and the infinite tower of equidistant solitonic excitations it seems very natural to expect that theories with Bogomol’nyi saturated solitons are related to compactified <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> higher dimensions. In this framework the particular case of dualities between supersymmetric <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> 2 + 1 dimensions and non–supersymmetric <b>theories</b> <b>in</b> 3 + 1 dimensions deserves special attention, since the four–dimensional theory might inherit the vanishing of the cosmological constant from the corresponding three–dimensional theory 1 [2, 7].
