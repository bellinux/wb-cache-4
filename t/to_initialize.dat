She is {{prevented}} by Professor, Erik, Hank, and Wolverine, but Erik decides to kill her as {{the surest way to}} prevent the apocalyptic future. Hank intervenes and exposes himself, Erik, and Mystique as mutants to the world. Trask takes advantage of this event and successfully convinces President Richard Nixon <b>to</b> <b>initialize</b> the Sentinel program.|$|E
5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project aimed at protein structure prediction {{and is one}} of the most accurate tertiary structure predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used <b>to</b> <b>initialize</b> a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E
25|$|A {{constructor}} is {{a special}} method that is called automatically when an object is created. Its purpose is <b>to</b> <b>initialize</b> {{the members of the}} object.

25|$|Some assemblers, such as NASM, provide {{flexible}} symbol management, letting programmers manage different namespaces, automatically calculate offsets within data structures, and assign labels that {{refer to}} literal values or {{the result of}} simple computations performed by the assembler.

25|$|The {{following}} code {{defines a}} class named Person. In addition <b>to</b> <b>initialize,</b> the usual constructor {{to create new}} objects, it has two methods: one to override the <=> comparison operator (so Array#sort can sort by age) {{and the other to}} override the to_s method (so Kernel#puts can format its output). Here, attr_reader is an example of metaprogramming in Ruby: attr_accessor defines getter and setter methods of instance variables, but attr_reader only getter methods. The last evaluated statement in a method is its return value, allowing the omission of an explicit return statement.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} formed in February 1954. The country school of Dutch Hollow closed; therefore, some members felt {{that they needed to}} keep the {{community}} spirit alive. The club’s initial hobby was shell craft although they ventured into sewing, ceramics, and cookbook making. The original nine members consisted of Emma Tindall, Violet Pulfer, Jean Paterson, Kathleen Gibson, Gladys Carey, Helen Fritz, Kathryn Eger, and Lois DeBlois. Tony Fritz loaned the group $40 <b>to</b> <b>initialize.</b> Thereafter, it charged ten cents for each cup of coffee to raise funds. Members celebrated the 20th, 25th, and 40th anniversaries at the parish hall by playing cards and games, and feasting.|$|E

25|$|The front crawl swimmer uses a {{tumble turn}} (also {{known as a}} flip turn) to reverse {{directions}} in minimal time. The swimmer swims close to the wall as quickly as possible. In the swimming position with one arm forward and one arm to the back, the swimmer does not recover one arm, but rather uses the pull/push of the other arm <b>to</b> <b>initialize</b> a somersault with the knees straight to the body. At {{the end of the}} somersault the feet are at the wall, and the swimmer is on his or her back with the hands over the head. The swimmer then pushes off the wall while turning sideways to lie on the breast. After a brief gliding phase, the swimmer starts with either a flutter kick or a butterfly kick before surfacing no more than 15 m from the wall.|$|E

500|$|A {{priority}} queue is a data structure for maintaining {{a collection of}} items with numerical priorities, having operations for finding and removing the item with the minimum priority value. Comparison-based {{priority queue}}s such as the binary heap take logarithmic time per update, but other structures such as the van Emde Boas tree or bucket queue may be faster for inputs whose priorities are small integers. These data structures {{can be used in}} the selection sort algorithm, which sorts a collection of elements by repeatedly finding and removing the smallest element from the collection, and returning the elements in the order they were found. A priority queue can be used to maintain the collection of elements in this algorithm, and the time for this algorithm on a collection of [...] elements can be bounded by the time <b>to</b> <b>initialize</b> the priority queue and then to perform [...] find and remove operations. For instance, using a binary heap as a priority queue in selection sort leads to the heap sort algorithm, a comparison sorting algorithm that takes [...] time. Instead, using selection sort with a bucket queue gives a form of pigeonhole sort, and using van Emde Boas trees or other integer priority queues leads to other fast integer sorting algorithms.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, Norman Phillips {{developed}} {{a mathematical model}} which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere, which became the first successful climate model. Following Phillips's work, several groups began working to create general circulation models. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes {{was developed in the}} late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. [...] By the early 1980s, the United States' National Center for Atmospheric Research had developed the Community Atmosphere Model; this model has been continuously refined into the 2000s. [...] In 1986, efforts began <b>to</b> <b>initialize</b> and model soil and vegetation types, which led to more realistic forecasts. [...] For example, the Center for Ocean-Land Atmosphere Studies (COLA) model showed a warm temperature bias of 2-4°C (4-7°F) and a low precipitation bias due to incorrect parameterization of crop and vegetation type across the central United States. [...] Coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models such as the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research's HadCM3 model are currently being used as inputs for climate change studies. [...] The importance of gravity waves was neglected within these models until the mid-1980s. [...] Now, gravity waves are required within global climate models in order to properly simulate regional and global scale circulations, though their broad spectrum makes their incorporation complicated. [...] The Climate System Model (CSM) was {{developed a}}t the National Center for Atmospheric Research in January 1994.|$|E
