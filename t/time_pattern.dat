40|$|Excerpt] Working {{time is a}} {{recurrent}} topic of study because the nature of work, its content, {{the conditions under which}} it is performed and the labour market itself keep changing. These changes have an impact on working time duration and the way working time is organised. One of the manifest results is the erosion of a clear demarcation between working time and non-working time – the work and private sphere. The European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) is among the sources that have clearly established the link between working <b>time</b> <b>patterns</b> and the health and wellbeing of workers. Eurofound’s research on job quality shows that working time quality is one of the crucial contributing elements. ]This report examines working <b>time</b> <b>patterns</b> in more detail. It provides an overview of the recent evolution of working time duration and organisation in the EU and highlights the most important trends and differences between Member States.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare Daphnia magna {{responses}} to cadmium between two toxicity experiments performed in static and flow-through conditions. As a consequence of how water was renewed, the two experiments were characterised by two different exposure <b>time</b> <b>patterns</b> for daphnids, time-varying and constant, respectively. Basing on survival, growth and reproduction, we addressed the questions of organism development and sensitivity to cadmium. Classical analysis methods are not designed to deal with the time dimension and therefore not suitable to compare effects of different exposure <b>time</b> <b>patterns.</b> We used instead a dynamic modelling framework taking all timepoints and the time course of exposure into account, making comparable the results obtained from our two experiments. This modelling framework enabled us to detect an improvement of organism development in flow-through conditions compared to static ones and infer similar sensitivity to cadmium for both exposure <b>time</b> <b>patterns.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The final part of the paper is devoted to implementation paths for transport pricing policies. A simple numerical model demonstrates how different <b>time</b> <b>patterns</b> of constraints on pricing and capacity policy instruments may lead to different <b>time</b> <b>patterns</b> of efficiency along those implementation paths. ...|$|R
40|$|One out {{of eight}} deaths {{throughout}} the world is due to cancer. Developing new treatments and improving existing treatments is hence of major importance. In this thesis we have studied how mathematical optimization {{can be used to}} improve an existing treatment method: high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. HDR brachytherapy is a radiation modality used to treat tumours of for example the cervix, prostate, breasts, and skin. In HDR brachytherapy catheters are implanted into or close to the tumour volume. A radioactive source is moved through the catheters, and by adjusting where the catheters are placed, called catheter positioning, and how the source is moved through the catheters, called the dwelling <b>time</b> <b>pattern,</b> the dose distribution can be controlled. By constructing an individualized catheter positioning and dwelling <b>time</b> <b>pattern,</b> called dose plan, based on each patient’s anatomy, it is possible to improve the treatment result. Mathematical optimization has during the last decade been used to aid in creating individualized dose plans. The dominating optimization model for this purpose is a linear penalty model.

40|$|Abstract—Cloud-based elastic systems {{leverage}} cloud infras-tructures {{to implement}} elasticity, {{the ability of}} computing systems to dynamically adjust their capacity by changing the allocation of resources in response to fluctuating workloads. The runtime behavior of elastic systems {{is the result of}} an intricate interplay of many factors that include the input workload, the elasticity logic determining the resources allocation, and the technology of the underlying cloud. This makes elastic systems difficult to design and hard to specify. In this paper we propose a novel formalization of elasticity and related concepts that is based on <b>timed</b> <b>patterns</b> written using <b>timed</b> regular expressions. Timed regular expressions naturally deal with dense-time signals, and <b>timed</b> <b>patterns</b> allow us to intuitively describe relevant changes in those signals. This, in turn, enables us to directly characterize elasticity as relation between relevant changes in the input workload and in the resources allocation signals. We firstly characterize the relevant changes by means of <b>timed</b> <b>patterns,</b> and then we define desired and undesired behaviors of cloud-based elastic systems in terms of the occurrence of such patterns over an observation period.

We model this neural activity as a branching process, which in turn is approximated by a random walk. As the distribution of the random walk return times is a power law with the exponent 1. 5, the distribution of the inter-murder intervals is thus explained.

To understand {{more about the}} nature of border crossing delay, this study applies a dictionary-based compression algorithm to process the historical Niagara Frontier border wait times data. It can identify the abnormal spatial-temporal patterns for both passenger vehicles and trucks at three bridges connecting US and Canada. Furthermore, it provides a quantitate anomaly score to rank the wait <b>times</b> <b>patterns</b> across the three bridges for each vehicle type and each direction. By analyzing the top three most abnormal patterns, we find that {{there are at least two}} factors contributing the anomaly of the patterns. The weekends and holidays may cause unusual heave congestions at the three bridges at the same time, and the freight transportation demand may be uneven from Canada to the USA at Peace Bridge and Lewiston-Queenston Bridge, which may lead to a high anomaly score. By calculating the frequency of the top 5 % abnormal patterns by hour of the day, the results show that for cars from the USA to Canada, the frequency of abnormal waiting <b>time</b> <b>patterns</b> is the highest during noon while for trucks in the same direction, it is the highest during the afternoon peak hours. For Canada to US direction, the frequency of abnormal border wait <b>time</b> <b>patterns</b> for both cars and trucks reaches to the peak during the afternoon.
