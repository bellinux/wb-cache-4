5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> {{physical}} properties of ytterbium {{could not be}} determined with any precision until 1953, when the first nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using ion-exchange processes. The price of ytterbium was relatively stable between 1953 and 1998 at about US $1,000/kg.|$|E
5|$|In {{chemical}} fields, such as crystallography, space {{groups and}} point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical {{analysis of these}} properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur {{simply because of the}} symmetry of the states involved.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> physical properties.|$|E

5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through vivisection {{and other}} experimental methods) <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> physical functions of living bodies {{to an unprecedented}} degree, {{laying the groundwork for}} endocrinology (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over {{the second half of the}} 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases {{use different}} amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a nucleophile. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad. <b>The</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> physical constraints on enzyme catalysis have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different enzyme superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|Welded {{titanium}} {{pipe and}} process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) {{are used in}} <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The {{pulp and paper industry}} uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Other applications include ultrasonic welding, wave soldering, and sputtering targets.|$|E

5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's supply of <b>the</b> <b>chemical)</b> <b>and</b> reveals that chocolate {{is a source}} of the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in <b>the</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. The chemical was used to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most {{of the victims were}} Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli, and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by Testa. Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from the manufacturers. Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942–44, 56 metric tons (about 8 per cent of domestic sales) were sold to concentration camps. Auschwitz received 23.8 tons, of which 6 tons were used for fumigation. The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage (the product had a stated shelf life of only three months). Testa conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of <b>the</b> <b>chemical,</b> <b>and</b> thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight.|$|E

5|$|On January 31, 2004, a victim's rights group, the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed {{a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, against several U.S. {{companies}} for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing <b>the</b> <b>chemical,</b> <b>and</b> claimed {{that the use of}} Agent Orange violated the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law {{at the time of its}} use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. Weinstein used the British example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to Agent Orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it.|$|E
