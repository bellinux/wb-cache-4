5|$|The first preview {{screening}} of the 113-minute version of <b>The</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game took place on June 28, 1939. It received a poor reaction from the audience. On June 29 the film was screened for the Minister of National Education and Fine Arts Jean Zay and for the jury of the annual Louis Delluc Prize for the best French film. When the awards were announced ten days later Marcel Carne's Le Quai des brumes won the first prize and <b>The</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game was not a runner-up. Because of the success and popularity of Renoir's previous films, <b>The</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game was highly anticipated and Zay had expected to award it the prize. Renoir later {{said he thought the}} film would be commercially successful.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congregation (1QSa) is an {{appendix}} to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{first seven}} Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in caves near the Qumran site in 1946.

Over twenty chapters are devoted to the Divine Office.|$|R
5|$|Hecht saw K-1 as a safer bet, {{given it}} had more {{international}} notoriety.

Hecht credits Kevin Kay and his editorial collaboration with the UFC for highlighting the show's story lines, which he believes helped drive its ratings success.|$|E

5000|$|Only one {{complete}} copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book exists with certainty, but 9 other copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congregation {{written in}} a cryptic script may exist.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{are that}} in general the first-published {{description}} has priority; therefore, the valid scientific name for the oceanic whitetip shark should be Carcharhinus maou.

5|$|Almost {{all modern}} paleontologists agreed with Riggs {{that the two}} dinosaurs should be {{classified}} together in a single genus. According to <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name Apatosaurus, having been published first, has priority as the official name; Brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that A.ajax and A.excelsus were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|Cortinarius violaceus was {{designated}} as the type species for the genus Cortinarius by Frederic Clements and Cornelius Lott Shear in their 1931 work The Genera of Fungi. Mycologist David Arora considers this odd, due to the mushroom's unusual colour and cystidia. Because of this designation, if C.violaceus were to be split {{from the rest of}} the current genus, then, according to <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, it would retain the name Cortinarius, while the other species would have to be reclassified. The species was one of only two placed in the Cortinarius subgenus Cortinarius by the Austrian mycologist Meinhard Moser. Molecular investigation of webcaps worldwide has increased this number to at least twelve.|$|E
