25|$|Belle {{has learned}} that the monster that took Robin was a Fury. Someone had used magic in Camelot to save Robin and did not pay the price, which is a life, and the monster has arrived to collect Robin's soul as payment.

500|$|Writing for the Marburg Journal of Religion, the German Protestant theologian {{and history}} of {{religion}} scholar Marco Frenschkowski called Bare-Faced Messiah the [...] "most important critical biography of Hubbard. Like [...] and [...] it is extremely polemical and very much <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> Hubbard to pieces." [...] He added that Miller's book had [...] "definitely exposed some inflated statements about Hubbard's early achievements," [...] but the Church of Scientology {{has been able to}} counter a number of the points made by Miller: [...] "Hubbard's assertions about his military career in WWII, e.g., have been much nearer to the truth than Miller is trying to show ... (a complete set of the relevant documents is part of my collection)." [...] Though Miller strongly implies that Hubbard's mentor, Snake Thompson, was only a myth, Frenschkowski confirms that Joseph [...] "Snake" [...] Thompson (1874-1943) was an actual Commander in the US Navy Medical Corp and a personal friend of Sigmund Freud, just as Hubbard said. [...] Miller states that Hubbard was a disciple of Aleister Crowley, with the implication that Scientology derives from Crowley's teachings, but Frenschkowski concludes, [...] "Nevertheless it remains quite obvious that Hubbard did not take much inspiration from Crowley and Parsons." ...|$|E

However, Lex Luthor is held {{to be responsible for}} the entire plot of Batman and Superman destroying each other. The two decide to team up and stop Luthor. Christian Bale, who was being considered for the lead in Darren Aronofsky's [...] adaptation at the time, was simultaneously approached by Peterson for the Superman role. Peterson confirmed in a 2010 interview the only other actor he approached for Superman was Josh Hartnett.

Christopher Nolan would later cast Bale as Batman the following year in Batman Begins. In the opening scene of I Am Legend, a large banner displays the Superman symbol within the Batman symbol in Times Square. It is meant as an in-joke by writer Akiva Goldsman, who wrote scripts for Batman vs. Superman and I Am Legend.|$|E
