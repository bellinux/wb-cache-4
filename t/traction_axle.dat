5000|$|The EMC E1 was {{an early}} passenger-train diesel {{locomotive}} developing 1,800 hp, with an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois. They were built during 1937 and 1938 for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway {{for a new generation}} of diesel-powered streamlined trains. 8 cab-equipped lead A units and three cabless booster B units were built. The initial three locomotives were AB pairs built to haul the Santa Fe's Super Chief diesel streamliners, while the others were built as single A units to haul shorter trains. The locomotives were diesel-electrics with two [...] Winton 201-A engines each, with each engine driving its own generator to power the traction motors. The E1 was the second model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units. All Winton 201A-engined Santa Fe passenger units, including the E1s, were extensively rebuilt into the 80-class E8M engines in 1952-53. These were similar to production E8 models, but derated to 2000 hp so as not to burn out the early <b>traction</b> (<b>axle)</b> motors (which were reused).|$|E
5000|$|The E.626 {{class is}} the result of a {{requirement}} issued in 1926 by the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS, Italian Railways) for a new locomotive to be used under the new 3,000 V DC line being built between Foggia and Benevento. The design was carried out by the team of Giuseppe Bianchi, the [...] "founder" [...] of modern Italian railroads, at the FS Traction and Material Service in Florence. The requirement specified the locomotive should have 6 <b>traction</b> <b>axles,</b> to improve adhesion in steep lines.|$|R
50|$|The {{track circuit}} {{provides}} additional functionality of detecting many, however not all, kinds of broken rails, though {{only to a}} limited extent in AC traction areas {{and not in the}} common rail in DC <b>traction</b> areas. <b>Axle</b> counters offer no such facility. Ordinary track circuits have a blind spot of about a metre in length from the wiring connections to the insulated joint.|$|R
50|$|The 2TE25A {{main line}} two-unit diesel freight locomotive, rated at , with AC/AC {{transmission}} and individual <b>axle</b> <b>traction</b> control, {{is designed to}} haul freight trains on the Russian Federation lines RŽD with the broad gauge.|$|R
5000|$|The 4wd F150 {{continued}} {{the use of}} the Dana 44 Twin-Traction Beam axle from the 80-91 trucks, and the Ford 8.8" [...] Rear Straight axle. The 4wd F250 carried the Dana 50 Twin <b>Traction</b> Beam <b>axle,</b> the Sterling 10.25 from the previous generation for the rear; full float on heavy duty 3/4 ton trucks and the 4wd F350 used the Dana 60 Straight Axle front, and the Sterling 10.25" [...] rear Straight axle.|$|R
50|$|The Dana 50 axle {{featured}} on most F-250 Super Dutys differs greatly {{from the early}} models. The Dana 50 {{started out as a}} Twin <b>Traction</b> Beam <b>axle</b> (much like independent suspension) in 1980. This lasted all the way to 1997 models. The Super Duty models then used a solid axle version of this axle. The ring, pinion, carrier and u joints all remained the same however. The Dana 50 was phased out of the trucks in 2004, in favor of the Dana 60 and was last used in the Ford Excursion.|$|R
50|$|Each axle was powered: the <b>traction</b> motors were <b>axle</b> hung, nose suspended, {{driving the}} {{wheelsets}} via a single reduction gear. The motors were connected in three parallel connected groups of sets of two motors connected in series; each motor {{was a series}} wound machine rated at 220 hp, 300V, 550A.|$|R
50|$|With {{diesel-electric}} {{and electric}} locomotives, the gear ratio between the <b>traction</b> motors and <b>axles</b> is what adapts the unit to freight or passenger service, although a passenger unit may include other features, such as {{head end power}} (also referred to as hotel power or electric train supply) or a steam generator.|$|R
50|$|The TEP70 {{main line}} single unit diesel {{passenger}} locomotive, rated at , with AC/DC transmission and individual <b>axle</b> <b>traction</b> control, is a railway engine designed to haul passenger trains on the Russian gauge railway network of eastern Europe. The TEP70 {{is currently in}} service in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Kazakhstan.|$|R
50|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 35 is an {{automotive}} axle {{manufactured by}} Dana Holding Corporation since 1985 when American Motors (AMC) sold its axle tooling equipment to Dana. The axle was originally named an AMC-15 {{when it was}} first made in 1962. Dana upgraded the axle, and made IFS and Twin <b>Traction</b> Beam front <b>axle</b> variations, as well.|$|R
2500|$|Ultimately, {{the source}} of the energy {{dissipated}} in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures. [...] Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake. [...] As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16km/h (10mph), depending on the gear ratio between the <b>traction</b> motors and <b>axles.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{first ever}} series {{production}} DCT was the Volkswagen Group DQ250 six-speed dual-clutch transmission, with dual concentric wet multiplate clutches. [...] It was produced at the Group's Kassel plant under exclusive license from BorgWarner {{for use in}} transverse powertrain installations, of either front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive (4WD) layouts. The 4WD versions are fundamentally identical to the FWD versions, but the 4WD versions use an additional bolt-on power take-off unit to direct engine torque to the Haldex <b>Traction</b> rear <b>axle.</b> [...] This DQ250 variant is used {{in a wide range}} of models: Volkswagen Passenger Cars (Polo, Golf/Rabbit/Golf Plus, Scirocco, Jetta, Eos, Passat, and Touran); Audi cars (A3, and TT); SEAT cars (Ibiza, León, Altea, and Toledo); Škoda cars (Octavia and Superb); and Volkswagen commercial vehicles (Caddy and T5 Transporter).|$|R
5000|$|The 2TE70 is a Russian {{main line}} dual unit freight diesel locomotive, rated at [...] It has AC/DC {{transmission}} and individual <b>axle</b> <b>traction</b> control {{and is designed}} to haul freight trains on the Russian Federation lines RŽD with [...] The 2ТE70 Freight diesel locomotive with two six-axle sections shares main parts with the TEP70 and TEP70BS passenger diesel locomotives. Each section is rated at [...] and it is designed for running freight trains of up to 6000 t.|$|R
50|$|For an {{electric}} locomotive or a diesel-electric locomotive, {{starting tractive effort}} can be calculated from the amount of weight on the driving wheels (which may be less than the total locomotive weight in some cases), combined stall torque of the traction motors, the gear ratio between the <b>traction</b> motors and <b>axles,</b> and driving wheel diameter. For a diesel-hydraulic locomotive, the starting tractive effort {{is affected by the}} stall torque of the torque converter, as well as gearing, wheel diameter and locomotive weight.|$|R
50|$|Under the British and Imperial {{classification}} scheme of locomotive axle arrangements, which {{is related to}} the UIC classification, 1Co+Co1 is a classification code for a locomotive wheel arrangement of two eight-wheeled bogies with an articulated inter-bogie connection, each with three axles powered by a separate <b>traction</b> motor per <b>axle</b> and with the fourth non-powered axle in an integral leading pony truck to reduce the axle load. The similar 1Co-Co1 classification is in the same axle configuration, but without the inter-bogie connection.|$|R
25|$|It was the Eastern Region's Motive Power officer, L.P. Parker, {{who made}} the case for a new design of {{powerful}} freight locomotive, able to shift heavy loads at fast speeds in round trips between distant destinations within the eight-hour shift of the footplate crew. Riddles took up the challenge, initially designing a 2-8-2 locomotive, but settled upon the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement for the increased <b>traction</b> and lower <b>axle</b> load that five coupled axles can provide. The resultant design {{became one of the most}} successful locomotive classes ever constructed in Britain.|$|R
50|$|Freight {{locomotives}} {{are designed}} to produce higher maximum tractive effort than passenger units of equivalent power, necessitated by the much higher weight that is typical of a freight train. In modern locomotives, the gearing between the <b>traction</b> motors and <b>axles</b> is selected to suit the type of service in which the unit will be operated. As traction motors have a maximum speed at which they can rotate without incurring damage, gearing for higher tractive effort is {{at the expense of}} top speed. Conversely, the gearing used with passenger locomotives favors speed over maximum tractive effort.|$|R

50|$|The Centre Steer used a Rover 1.6 litre 4-cylinder {{petrol engine}} of 50 {{horsepower}} (37 kW). This was coupled to a 4-speed manual gearbox from the Rover P3 saloon. This unit was coupled to a Willys/Ford 2-speed transfer gearbox {{taken from a}} Jeep. This not only allowed {{the selection of a}} lower set of 'crawler' gears but controlled the selection of drive to the front axle as well. The production 1948 Land Rover used the P3 gearbox, but an entirely different transfer box, designed and built by Rover, was fitted. This incorporated a Rover 'freewheel' mechanism to provide a permanent 4-wheel-drive system. The freewheel could be locked out to ensure full <b>traction</b> at both <b>axles</b> when off-road.|$|R
50|$|UK Mail {{is at the}} A47/A4040 {{junction}} next to the River Tame at Ward End near M6, {{and next}} to the former LDV factory. Genting Group UK (the UK's biggest casino operator) is based at Star City near Washwood Heath. Dana <b>Traction</b> Technologies make <b>axles</b> (including that of the Ford Transit and Range Rover) and limited slip differentials at Witton, off the A4040 near the M6, and TIMET UK. Legrand UK (electrical switches) is based at the A41/A4540 junction at Newtown south of Aston. TRW Automotive Electronics (the former Lucas Electrical Training Centre) is on the A453 north of the M6 at Perry Barr. Delcam (CAD/CAM software) is at Small Heath Trading Est off the A45. Eaton Electric (former Delta and MEM) make residual-current devices (Cutler-Hammer) and switchgear off the A41 in Tyseley, and Mereway Kitchens is nearby; SCC (computing) is on A41 at the River Cole bridge. Goodrich Engine Controls make engine control systems for jet engines at Hall Green.|$|R
5000|$|The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10000, {{delivered}} to the railroad on February 12, 1934, {{at a cost of}} $230,997, was the first internal combustion engine, lightweight streamlined express passenger train built in the United States. The M-10000 featured a turret cab, an inward-slanting Duralumin body with a nose formed of parabolic arches, and large nose air intakes {{on each side of the}} centerline. The prime mover was a [...] Winton 191-A V12 distillate engine. This engine design was unrelated to the later 201 or 201A Winton diesels. There were three cars: a driving, power and baggage car at the front; and two passenger cars. The 204 ft long, 85 ST train was fully articulated, with trucks shared between cars. The front truck carried one General Electric <b>traction</b> motor per <b>axle,</b> and was the only one powered. The train was painted in Armour Yellow with Leaf Brown roof and undersides. Later, the area around the front air intake was also painted yellow. Dividing lines of red separated the colors.|$|R
50|$|The DPC {{differential}} features clutch packs on both output sides {{that are}} actuated by an electric motor. The clutch pack activates a planetary gearset which causes one wheel to be overdriven. A conventional control system, such as BMW's typical xDrive system without Dynamic Performance Control, relies on brakes {{to reduce the}} speed of the faster-moving wheel (which is the one with less traction) and reduce engine power to limit slip at that wheel. This leads to increased brake wear, and slows the vehicle's optimal progress. By contrast, xDrive when integrated with DPC will speed up the slower-moving, not slipping wheel (the one with the most traction) in order to maintain stability when needed. For example, during vehicle turning, the outer wheel is overdriven to provide greater acceleration, using the traction advantage through the dynamic loading of the outboard wheel in cornering. Meanwhile, in an oversteer situation, the inner wheel is overdriven to regain traction balance. This provides additional <b>traction</b> across the <b>axle</b> of the vehicle, {{while at the same time}} maintaining more of the vehicle's optimal progress through turns.|$|R
50|$|The Arrow IIIs {{were given}} a mid-life {{overhaul}} between 1992 and 1995 by ABB. The rebuild replaced the original DC propulsion system with a new solid state AC system that also included higher power traction motors {{with a total of}} about 375 hp per two axle truck. The increased power per motor allowed for motors to be eliminated from the truck located under the pantograph in each of the married pairs, reducing the number of powered axles per pair to 6 although raising horsepower to 1125. Single units retained all 4 powered axles with a total of 750 hp. After the rebuild was completed, problems were encountered with both <b>traction</b> motor and <b>axle</b> bearing overheating which lowered the maximum permitted speed in service to 90 mph from 100 and then ultimately to 80 mph as the problems persisted. In 2011 a single arm TransTech type pantograph was fitted to Arrow III #1463 replacing the original twin-arm Stemmann. By early 2014, all 160 units remaining in revenue service had been fitted with the new pantographs.|$|R
40|$|The span of {{the bridge}} was assumed as 100 feet. The type of bridge used is the timber Howe Truss. The height of truss was taken as 20 feet between center lines of top and bottom chords. The width was taken as 18 feet center to center of trusses. The truss was divided up into five panels 20 feet long. It was {{designed}} according to the "General Specifications for Steel Highway Bridges" by Ketchum. For the live load for the floor and its supports, a load of 80 pounds per square foot of total floor surface or a 15 ton <b>traction</b> engine with <b>axles</b> 10 feet centers and 6 feet gage, two thirds of load to be carried by rear axles. For the truss a load of 75 pounds per square foot of floor surface. For the wind load the bottom lateral bracing is to be designed to resist a lateral wind load of 300 pounds per foot of span; 150 pounds of this {{to be treated as}} a moving load. The top lateral bracing is to be designed to resist a lateral wind force of 150 pounds per foot of span. The timber {{to be used in the}} bridge is to be Douglas fir. The unit stresses used for timber are those of the American Railway Engineering Association. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{diesel engine}} is an twelve-cylinder, turbocharged, water-cooled, four-cycle, V-type engine usedto provide power. It is {{directly}} connected to the main generator. The <b>traction</b> motors are <b>axle</b> hung and supported on the truck transoms by spring-loaded suspension. One motor is geared to each axle through a single set of gears with a ratio of 14:72. The radiator keeps engine at proper operating temperature between 100 and 1980F (37.7 and 92.2°C). Two externally mounted battery boxes, {{one on each side}} of the locomotive, provide ventilated compartments to house the eight batteries. Two main reservoir tanks, one {{on each side of the}} locomotive, provide a means of storing air for the air system. The main generator furnishes direct-current power over a wide range of voltage at variousspeeds up to 1200 rpm. It is separately excited by the exciter generator mounted on the generator frame. The generator also acts as a starting motor when the start button is pushed and the battery switch is closed. The fuel tank can hold 500 gallons (1892 liters) of diesel fuel for engine operation. Two fill pipes and two sight glasses, one on each side of the locomotive, provide a means of filling the tank and monitoring the level of fuel. The blower provides forced ventilation for the traction motors which require adequate cooling. It is belt driven from the main generator shaft.|$|R
