5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one could easily miss <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E

25|$|Of a {{firm and}} unselfish but abrupt and passionate disposition, Ashkenazi {{everywhere}} aroused the discontent and {{hatred of the}} rich and the scholarly. Extensive learning, keen intelligence, and exceptional linguistic attainments, all combined to make him one of the most distinguished men of his day. All his contemporaries, even those who knew him only {{as the head of the}} Klaus at Altona, unite in praising his profound learning, his astuteness, his clearness of exposition, which never degenerated into <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the pilpul, and his absolute disregard for the influence of money. He would suffer serious deprivation rather than accept pecuniary assistance; and this characteristic, interpreted by the wealthy of that day as obstinacy and arrogance, became to him a source of much suffering and enmity.|$|E
25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is a little harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E

25|$|The {{dispute over}} Fadak was narrated in various sources, {{some of which}} became almost legendary. Among these is {{the tale of the}} famed caliph of the Arabian Nights tales, Harun al Rashid, narrated in the 16th-century work Laṭā’if al-Tawā’if <b>The</b> <b>Subtleties</b> <b>of</b> People, in which Harun is {{described}} as feeling regret over the denial of Fadak to Muhammad's family. Harun inquired about the boundaries of the oasis from a descendant of Fatima in order to return it to its rightful possessors. The descendent cautioned that after drawing the borders of the garden of Fadak, Harun would no longer want to relinquish it. Nevertheless, Harun pressed on. The descendant replied that the first boundary of Fadak was Aden, the second Samarqand, the third the Maghrib, and the fourth the Armenian Sea. These borders outlined virtually the entire empire of Harun. That Harun himself initiated the process of returning Fadak and was not pressed by Muhammad’s descendants reveals that in the Shi’i conception, worldly possessions are of little to no importance to Muhammad's family or to the authority of the Imams.|$|E

[...] Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: [...] "For Asda... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its Harry Potter offer rewarded with television, radio, Internet and newspaper coverage.

[...] To serve <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the script and to help personify death, production designer John Willet developed the concept of [...] "skewing" [...] the sets. [...] "What I've tried {{to do with the}} sets themselves, with their design and with various color choices, is to make things just a little unnatural," [...] Willet explained. [...] "Nothing that calls attention to itself, but instead creates a sense of uneasiness—the unsettling feeling that something's not quite right". [...] To achieve this mystique, Willet designed two versions of virtually every set—one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes.|$|E
500|$|Linguistic {{relativity}} {{studies have}} experienced a resurgence since the 1990s, {{and a series of}} favorable experimental results have brought Whorfianism back into favor, especially in cultural psychology and linguistic anthropology. The first study directing positive attention towards Whorf's relativist position was George Lakoff's [...] "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things", in which he argued that Whorf had been on the right track in his focus on differences in grammatical and lexical categories as a source of differences in conceptualization. In 1992 psychologist John A. Lucy published two books on the topic, one analyzing the intellectual genealogy of the hypothesis, arguing that previous studies had failed to appreciate <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> Whorf's thinking; they had been unable to formulate a research agenda that would actually test Whorf's claims. Lucy proposed a new research design so that the hypothesis of linguistic relativity could be tested empirically, and to avoid the pitfalls of earlier studies which Lucy claimed had tended to presuppose the universality of the categories they were studying. His second book was an empirical study of the relation between grammatical categories and cognition in the Yucatec Maya language of Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Talbot nicknamed Windle [...] "the greyhound" [...] {{because of}} his thin and angular build. As a result of Windle's small build, he took between 45 and 47 strokes to {{complete}} a lap, but fellow distance swimmer Murray Rose needed only 35 to 37 strokes. Talbot said that Windle was the most thinly built elite swimmer that he had trained, and had great trouble in trying to increase Windle's frame. Talbot motivated Windle and instilled him with a greater level of self belief. For his part, Windle responded by increasing his workload, and was regarded as Talbot's most diligent student. Windle trained with a determination that often saw him swim through others who were in his training lane. These collisions led to complaints by recreational swimmers that Windle was too aggressive. He often did twice as much pre-season training as the other swimmers in Talbot's squad. According to Talbot, Windle's weakness {{was that he was}} only capable of swimming in two ways, flat out or very slowly. Windle had trouble in pacing himself to conserve energy for later events. Talbot lamented to [...] "never [...] astute enough to realise that he [...] didn't have <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> pace that would have added to his armament as a swimmer".|$|E

500|$|The Holy Roman Empire's {{defeat in}} the War of the Second Coalition shook up {{diplomatic}} circles, and the promising Metternich was now offered a choice between three ministerial positions: to the Imperial Diet at Regensburg; to the Kingdom of Denmark at Copenhagen; or to the Elector of Saxony at Dresden. He chose Dresden in late January 1801, and his appointment was officially announced in February. Metternich summered in Vienna, where he wrote his [...] "Instructions", a memorandum showing much greater understanding of statesmanship than his earlier writing. He visited the Königswart estate in the autumn before taking up his new position on 4 November. <b>The</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> the memorandum were lost on the Saxon court, which was headed by the retiring Frederick Augustus, a man with little political initiative. Despite the boredom of the court, Metternich enjoyed the light-hearted frivolity {{of the city and}} took up a mistress, Katharina Bagration, who bore him a daughter, Klementine. In January 1803 Metternich and his wife had a child whom they named Viktor. In Dresden Metternich also made a number of important contacts including Friedrich Gentz, a publicist who would serve Metternich as both confidant and critic for the next thirty years. He also established links with important Polish and French political figures.|$|E

[...] IGN contributor Robert Canning said that his favorite storyline in the episode was Jack and Frank's, and enjoyed Lupone's role, but noted that the episode [...] "lacked that familiar 30 Rock punch and tight rhythm", and gave the episode a 7.8 out 10 rating. Rick Porter of Zap2it said that [...] "Goodbye, My Friend" [...] had its [...] "usual share of brilliantly funny moments, but I'm not sure whether I can fully get behind an episode that hangs an entire subplot on <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> Harry and the Hendersons."

500|$|Libby Hill of the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} how Jessica Jones exposed modern day sexism and {{misogyny}} through Kilgrave's {{use of the}} phrase [...] "Smile", calling the season [...] "the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique" [...] from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile, and her obliging, to [...] "similar well-meaning scenarios [...] play out {{in the real world}} time and again each day" [...] many in the form of gendered street harassment, that resonates with many women. Hill also added that [...] "Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent," [...] due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that [...] "Jessica Jones is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> its premise." [...] Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that [...] "powerlessness is not gendered." ...|$|E

[...] It was also noted that models applying to be in the video should have an Abercrombie & Fitch style about them, and that [...] "small tattoos" [...] were acceptable. For the most part of the video, Lewis is featured on a beach in a variety of different settings, such as sitting in an old cabriolet car, in which she is surrounded by her friends. Sitting in the car, Lewis wears a polka dot bikini top. Other scenes include Lewis standing in the shallow part of the ocean by herself, as well as sitting around a fire on the beach. As the video progresses, it changes from daytime to nighttime.

500|$|Engs {{notes that}} missionaries {{struggled}} {{to reconcile the}} task of assimilating discriminated peoples into a society that defined itself by that active discrimination. Engs portrays Armstrong as a natural politician, administrator, and [...] "risk-taker" [...] who sought broad-based support from opposed parties, including African Americans, the [...] "anti-Negro white South", and white philanthropists of the North, which made Armstrong into a [...] "master prevaricator". As a [...] "realist", Armstrong adopted <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> his patrons to keep Hampton open, and did not confuse [...] "the uplift of African Americans" [...] with [...] "promoting their equality with whites". Hampton's curriculum was ultimately set by federal and donor money. In time, Armstrong's goals for the school were derailed by increased costs and the school's Northern industrialist backers, who made manual labor education the focus {{and end of the}} curriculum, rather than a means. Engs concludes that Armstrong's black graduates lived in better circumstances than their peers. Many became teachers in the South and were [...] "grateful" [...] for their opportunities. Reversely, Hampton's Native American graduates suffered in health at the school and had little job opportunity back out West. Engs also concluded that Armstrong's work was limited by his reliance on the elite, emphasis on white men deciding black lives, and inability to change his philosophy when his assumptions became outdated. Still, Engs thought that Armstrong succeeded in his intent to [...] "civilize" [...] students at Hampton, though this mattered little, Engs wrote, when white society was unprepared to accept them [...] "no matter how civilized they might be".|$|E
500|$|The critics {{gave the}} work a {{generally}} kinder reception in London, where The Times called Puccini [...] "a master {{in the art}} of poignant expression", and praised the [...] "wonderful skill and sustained power" [...] of the music. In The Musical Times, Puccini's score was admired for its sincerity and [...] "strength of utterance." [...] After the 1903 Paris opening, the composer Paul Dukas thought the work lacked cohesion and style, while Gabriel Fauré was offended by [...] "disconcerting vulgarities". In the 1950s, the young musicologist Joseph Kerman described Tosca as a [...] "shabby little shocker."; in response the conductor Thomas Beecham remarked that anything Kerman says about Puccini [...] "can safely be ignored". Writing half a century after the premiere, the veteran critic Ernest Newman, while acknowledging the [...] "enormously difficult business of boiling [...] play down for operatic purposes", thought that <b>the</b> <b>subtleties</b> <b>of</b> Sardou's original plot are handled [...] "very lamely", so that [...] "much of what happens, and why, is unintelligible to the spectator". Overall, however, Newman delivered a more positive judgement: [...] " [...] operas are to some extent a mere bundle of tricks, but no one else has performed the same tricks nearly as well". Opera scholar Julian Budden remarks on Puccini's [...] "inept handling of the political element", but still hails the work as [...] "a triumph of pure theatre". Music critic Charles Osborne ascribes Toscas immense popularity with audiences to the taut effectiveness of its melodramatic plot, the opportunities given to its three leading characters to shine vocally and dramatically, and the presence of two great arias in [...] "Vissi d'arte" [...] and [...] "E lucevan le stelle". The work remains popular today: according to Operabase, it ranks as fifth in the world with 540 performances given in the five seasons 2009/10 to 2013/14.|$|E
