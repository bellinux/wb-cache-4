50|$|<b>Thioacetazone</b> (INN, BAN), {{also known}} as amithiozone (USAN), is an oral {{antibiotic}} which {{is used in the}} treatment of tuberculosis. It has fallen into almost complete disuse due to toxicity and the introduction of improved anti-tuberculosis drugs like isoniazid. The drug has only weak activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is only useful in preventing resistance to more powerful drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin. It is never used on its own to treat tuberculosis; it is used in a similar way to ethambutol.|$|E

40|$|Summary: 64 hospitalized {{patients}} of pulmonary tuberculosis of North Indian origin were adminis-tered <b>thioacetazone</b> in 3 doses {{along with other}} anti-tuberculosis drugs. Serum <b>thioacetazone</b> levels {{were found to be}} higher in those receiving higher dosages of <b>thioacetazone</b> though the rise in the serum levels was not proportional to the close administered. Assuming an arbitrary concentration of <b>thioacetazone</b> 0. 5 ug/ml for determining the coverage, 2 / 3 rd increase in the exposure was seen when the dose was increased from 150 mg. to 450 mg.

40|$|Following its {{introduction}} {{in the late}} 1940 s, <b>thioacetazone</b> was widely-used as an anti-tuberculosis medicine in the following decades. 1 Reports of cutane-ous hypersensitivity reactions related to its use emerged in the literature soon after {{its introduction}} and by the early 1970 s the association between the medi-cine and the adverse drug reaction was well established. 2 Despite the increased recognition of this risk, <b>thioacetazone</b> remained in use mainly in low-income countries because of its low cost. 3 In the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, reports appeared from Africa describin...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{and the discovery}} of effective new anti-tubercular drugs {{are among the most}} urgent priorities in health organizations all over the world. In the present study, fluorinated analogs {{of some of the most}} important anti-TB agents such as p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), thiacetazone and pyrazinamide were synthesized and tested against TB. The fluorinated analog of thiacetazone was 20 times more potent than the parent compound against M. tuberculosis H 37 -RV, while the fluorinated p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) was almost three times less potent than PAS. A few other halogenated analogs of <b>thioacetazone</b> were also synthesized and subjected to anti-M. tuberculosis screening tests. The best halogen substituent was found to be fluorine which has the smallest size from one hand and the strongest electronegativity from the other hand among the halogen atoms. Fluorine therefore could be considered as a golden substituent to improve the anti-M. tuberculosis activity of <b>thioacetazone...</b>|$|E
40|$|Tyrosinase catalyzes two {{distinct}} sequential reactions in melanin biosynthesis: The hydroxylation of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and the oxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone. Developing functional modulators of tyrosinase {{is important for}} therapeutic and cosmetic purposes. Given the abundance of thiourea moiety in known tyrosinase inhibitors, we studied other thiourea-containing drugs as potential tyrosinase inhibitors. The thiourea-containing drugs in clinical use were retrieved and tested {{for their ability to}} inhibit tyrosinase. We observed that methimazole, thiouracil, methylthiouracil, propylthiouracil, ambazone, and <b>thioacetazone</b> inhibited mushroom tyrosinase. Except for methimazole, there was limited information regarding the activity of other drugs against tyrosinase. Both <b>thioacetazone</b> and ambazone significantly inhibited tyrosinase, with IC 50 of 14 and 15 μM, respectively. Ambazone decreased melanin content without causing cellular toxicity at 20 μM in B 16 F 10 cells. The activity of ambazone was stronger than that of kojic acid both in enzyme and melanin content assays. Kinetics of enzyme inhibition assigned the thiourea-containg drugs as non-competitive inhibitors. The complex models by docking simulation suggested that the intermolecular hydrogen bond via the nitrogen of thiourea and the contacts via thione were equally important for interacting with tyrosinase. These data were consistent with the results of enzyme assays with the analogues of thiourea...|$|E
40|$|The {{last four}} decades have seen {{spectacular}} {{developments in the}} management of pulmonary tuberculosis. The discovery of streptomycin in 1943 by Waksman was soon followed by other drugs with anti-tuberculosis activity, such as PAS, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, <b>thioacetazone,</b> ethambutol, rifampicin and others. The dis-covery of the anti-tuberculosis activity of isonia-zid in 1952 was a great land-mark which re-volutionalised the treatment of tuberculosis. Because of its high efficacy, low toxicity and low cost, isoniazid soon became the drug of choice in tuberculosis. Administered alone daily for 12 months, it has a potential of producing bacteri-ological quiescence in approximately 70 % of pulmonary tuberculosis cases excreting isoniazid-sensitive cultures in their sputum. The con-comitant administration of <b>thioacetazone</b> or PAS daily for 1 year increases the efficacy of the regimen to about 85 %. However, approximately 20 % of the patients with quiescent disease at 1 year have a bacteriological relapse after stopping chemotherapy, so that the overall efficacy of the 2 -drug regimens is reduced to less than 70 % even among those patients who consume the drugs regularly. Such relapses can be prevented by continuing chemotherapy beyond 12 months for another 6 - 12 months. It is, therefore, customary to prescribe regimens of 8 - 24 months to tuberculosis patients...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{reports from}} the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre, Madras, have {{established}} that ambulatory treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis with a standard daily regimen of isoniazid plus PAS for one year yields satisfactory results. However, this regimen may be unsuitable for large-scale use in many developing countries, because PAS is expensive, bulky and unpleasant to take, and has poor keeping qualities, especially in tropical countries. It {{might be possible to}} overcome these disadvantages, by substituting for the PAS a drug which is equally effective but less expensive and more acceptable, or by reducing the daily dosage of PAS and the period for which it is prescribed. This paper presents the results over a II-month period of a controlled comparison of (a) the standard regimen of isoniazid (average 4. 5 mg/kg body-weight) plus sodium PAS (average 0. 22 g/kg), daily in two divided doses; (b) a regimen of isoniazid (average 6. 9 mg/kg) plus <b>thioacetazone</b> (average 3. 4 mg/kg), daily in one dose; and (c) a 2 -phase regimen of isoniazid (average 5. 5 mg/kg) plus sodium PAS (average 0. 17 g/kg), daily in one dose for 6 months, followed by isoniazid alone (average 6. 8 mg/kg), daily in one dose for the second 6 months. The regimen of isoniazid plus <b>thioacetazone</b> was found to be therapeutically as effective as the standard regimen of isoniazid plus PAS; however, it was associated with a higher incidence of minor side-effects, and three cases of exfoliative dermatitis. The 2 -phase regimen of isoniazid plus PAS followed by isoniazid alone was less effective. These findings are encouraging for the large-scale use in developing countries of the relatively inexpensive regimen of isoniazid plus thioacetazone; however, any such step should be preceded by carefully planned studies to investigate, under local conditions, the toxicity and the efficacy of the regimen...|$|E
40|$|A {{random sample}} survey of initial drug {{resistance}} among cases of tuberculosis in Latin America {{was carried out}} {{during the second half}} of the 1980 s and the early 1990 s. A total of 948 cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from patients presumed never before to have been treated for tuberculosis were collected from 30 randomly selected clusters in Latin America and tested for resistance to isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampicin, ethambutol, and <b>thioacetazone.</b> Initial drug resistance, although unevenly distributed, was detected in all the clusters tested and characterized one out of every six tuberculosis cases. Both single and multiple resistance to streptomycin and to isoniazid were the most prevalent forms throughout the region but were not sufficiently frequent to jeopardize significantly the outcome of short-course chemotherapy. However, localized pockets of high drug resistance occurred throughout the region and are cause for concern, especially in the case of rifampicin...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{clinical}} aspects and diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis in developing countries, and summarizes WHO's recommendations for treatment. According to WHO estimates (early 1992) over 4 million persons worldwide {{have been infected}} with HIV and tuberculosis; 95 % {{of them are in}} the developing countries. Clinical features of HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis in adults are frequently atypical, particularly in the late stage of HIV infection, with non-cavitary disease, lower lobe infiltrates, hilar lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion. More typical post-primary tuberculosis with upper lobe infiltrates and cavitations is seen in the earlier stages of HIV infection. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is reported more frequently, despite the difficulties in diagnosing it. WHO's recent guidelines recommend 6 -month short-course chemotherapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis. The older 12 -month regimen without rifampicin is much less effective. Streptomycin should not be used, because of the risk of transmitting blood-borne pathogens through contaminated needles. <b>Thioacetazone</b> should be abandoned, because of severe adverse reactions observed among HIV-infected patients. The roles of preventive chemotherapy and BCG vaccination for prevention of tuberculosis are also briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|At the outset, I {{would like}} to express my sincere {{gratitude}} to the Tuberculosis Association of India for having bestowed upon the coveted Wander-TAI Oration Award. When I think of the illustrious personalities who have preceded me I began to have doubts as to whether I {{will be able to}} do justice to today's occasion. If I fail to come up to your expectations it will not be because of lack of honest efforts on my part - it is because I neither have the scientific stature nor the gray hairs which my predecessors had. I sincerely hope you will view it in the proper spirit and condone any lapses in my presentation. We are about to celebrate the centenary of the discovery of the tubercle bacilli by Robert Koch. It is less than 4 decades since we have had the benefits of chemotherapeutic agents with specific activity against tuberculosis. Nevertheless, the decades following the discovery of streptomycin by Waksman in 1943 have seen spectacular achievements in chemotherapy of tuberculosis. We now have several anti-tuberculosis drugs - isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, PAS, ethambutol, <b>thioacetazone,</b> ethionamide, and a few other drugs. Isoniazid is by far the most potent and most effective drug with a bacteriological activity, with rifampicin being a close second. Streptomycin and pyrazinamide also have bactericidal activity, and like isoniazid and rifampicin, cause death of tubercle bacilli. Drugs such as PAS, ethambutol and <b>thioacetazone</b> have a bacteriostatic activity, that is, they prevent the multiplication of the bacilli, so that the elimination of the bacilli would depend upon the defense mechanism of the host; their utility is limited to their being companion drugs given in combination with isoniazid with the object of preventing the multiplication of isoniazid-resistant mutants. The present day management of tuberculosis consists of treatment with a combination of isoniazid with at least one other drug in appropriate dosages and rhythms for periods upto 24 months. With a judicatious choice of drug regimens containing isoniazid and other drugs it is possible to produce rapid sputum conversion to negativity and to eliminate the possibility of emergence of drug-resistance; further, patients attaining bacteriological quiescence continue to have quiescent disease even after stopping chemotherapy. With inadequate chemotherapy, on the other hand, failures may manifest in one or more ways - sputum may fail to become culture negative, drug-resistance may emerge, or sputum conversion occurs during treatment but culture becomes positive again after treatment is discontinued, that is, the patient has a bacteriological relapse. With the advent of highly effective chemotherapeutic regimens with practically 100...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Several {{species of}} rapidly growing {{mycobacteria}} (RGM) are now recognized as human pathogens. However, limited data on effective drug treatments against these organisms exists. Here, {{we describe the}} species distribution and drug susceptibility profiles of RGM clinical isolates collected from four southern Chinese provinces from January 2005 to December 2012. Methods. Clinical isolates (73) were subjected to in vitro testing with 31 antimicrobial agents using the cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth microdilution method. The isolates included 55 M. abscessus, 11 M. fortuitum, 3 M. chelonae, 2 M. neoaurum, and 2 M. septicum isolates. Results. M. abscessus (75. 34 %) and M. fortuitum (15. 07 %), the most common species, exhibited greater antibiotic resistance than the other three species. The isolates had low resistance to amikacin, linezolid, and tigecycline, and high resistance to first-line antituberculous agents, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, rifapentine, dapsone, <b>thioacetazone,</b> and pasiniazid. M. abscessus and M. fortuitum were highly resistant to ofloxacin and rifabutin, respectively. The isolates showed moderate resistance to the other antimicrobial agents. Conclusions. Our results suggest that tigecycline, linezolid, clofazimine, and cefmetazole are appropriate choices for M. abscessus infections. Capreomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tigecycline, clofazimine, and cefmetazole are potentially good choices for M. fortuitum infections. Our drug susceptibility data should be useful to clinicians...|$|E
40|$|Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and {{extensively}} drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis {{are generally}} {{thought to have}} high mortality rates. However, many cases can be treated with the right combination and rational use of available antituberculosis drugs. This Review describes the evidence available for each drug and discusses the basis for recommendations {{for the treatment of}} patients with MDR and XDR tuberculosis. The recommended regimen is the combination of at least four drugs to which the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate is likely to be susceptible. Drugs are chosen with a stepwise selection process through five groups on the basis of efficacy, safety, and cost. Among the first group (the oral first-line drugs) high-dose isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol are thought of as an adjunct for the treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. The second group is the fluoroquinolones, of which the first choice is high-dose levofloxacin. The third group are the injectable drugs, which should be used in the following order: capreomycin, kanamycin, then amikacin. The fourth group are called the second-line drugs and should be used in the following order: thioamides, cycloserine, then aminosalicylic acid. The fifth group includes drugs that are not very effective or for which there are sparse clinical data. Drugs in group five should be used in the following order: clofazimine, amoxicillin with clavulanate, linezolid, carbapenems, <b>thioacetazone,</b> then clarithromycin...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Slowly growing {{mycobacteria}} (SGM) are prevalent {{worldwide and}} cause an extensive spectrum of diseases. Methods. In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibility of 33 reference strains of SGM to 19 antimicrobial agents {{was tested using}} a modified microdilution method. Results. Cefmetazole (32 / 33) and azithromycin (32 / 33) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity, and dapsone (9 / 33) exhibited the lowest activity against the tested strains. Cefoxitin (30 / 33), cefoperazone (28 / 33), and cefepime (28 / 33) were effective against {{a high proportion of}} strains, and macrolides were also highly effective as well as offering the benefit of convenient oral administration to patients. Linezolid (27 / 33), meropenem (26 / 33), sulfamethoxazole (26 / 33), and tigecycline (25 / 33) showed the highest activity; clofazimine (20 / 33) and doxycycline (18 / 33) showed intermediate activity; and rifapentine (13 / 33), rifabutin (13 / 33), and minocycline (11 / 33) showed low antimicrobial activity, closely followed by <b>thioacetazone</b> (10 / 33) and pasiniazid (10 / 33), against the tested organisms. According to their susceptibility profiles, the slowly growing species Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium simiae were the least susceptible to the tested drugs, whereas Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium asiaticum, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium szulgai, Mycobacterium branderi, and Mycobacterium holsaticum were the most susceptible.

In summary, cephalosporins and macrolides, particularly cefmetazole, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin, showed good antimicrobial activity against the reference strains of SGM...|$|E
40|$|The highest {{burden of}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) related tuberculosis (TB) is in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV complicates several areas of TB control, one of which involves treatment and treatment outcome. Large patient numbers cause congestion on TB wards, there is increased morbidity, {{an increased risk of}} adverse drug reactions, an increased case fatality, and an increased recurrence of TB after treatment completion. TB Control Programmes have responded to these problems by taking actions such as abolishing <b>thioacetazone</b> and decentralising the initial phase of treatment to peripheral health centres and the community. Despite this response, there are three major on-going concerns which need to be addressed by research studies. There is a need to reduce case fatality rates focusing on 1) stronger treatment regimens, 2) adequacy of rifampicin levels when intermittent treatment regimens are used, and 3) adjunctive treatments. There is a need to reduce recurrent rates of TB by 1) determining the relative role of re-infection and reactivation as a cause of recurrence, 2) assessing the importance of duration and type of anti-TB treatment for the first episode of TB, and 3) determining the role of secondary isoniazid preventive therapy. There is a need to evaluate how best to decentralise treatment {{from the perspective of the}} health service and the patient. Research studies should be relevant to the needs and resources of TB control programmes, and should include pharmacokinetic studies, controlled clinical trials and operational research, including economic analysis and social science evaluation...|$|E
40|$|SETTING: Damien Foundation {{tuberculosis}} (TB) control {{projects in}} Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE: To assess {{the effectiveness of}} a 1 -month extension of the intensive phase for smear-positives at 2 months of an 8 -month regimen with a continuation phase consisting of isoniazid (INH) and <b>thioacetazone</b> (Th). DESIGN: A prospective study of two cohorts of newly registered smear-positive cases, with extension of the intensive phase for the control cohort, but not for the study cohort. Culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) of smear-defined failures and relapses and of random samples of new cases. RESULTS: Among 8230 study patients (86. 7 % 2 -month conversion) and 7206 controls (83. 4 % conversion), smear-defined failure or relapse outcome was 3. 0 % for 2 -month smear-negatives vs. 3. 1 % for 2 -month smear-positives with extension (non-significant, NS), and 8. 2 % for 2 -month smear-positives with no extension (P < 0. 00001). Culture-confirmed failure and relapse reached 1. 9 % in 2 -month smear-negatives and 1. 6 % (NS) in 2 -month smear-positives with vs. 3. 7 % (P < 0. 001) in 2 -month smear-positives with no extension. The relative risk (RR) of non-extension in 2 -month smear-positives was 2. 4 (cultures) to 2. 7 (smears). The same RR and borderline significance was found for non-extension of patients with pan-susceptible strains. CONCLUSIONS: Extension of the intensive phase considerably reduces failures and relapses with a weaker regimen in patients smear-positive at 2 months. Its effectiveness may vary with extent of initial drug resistance vs. power of the regimen...|$|E
