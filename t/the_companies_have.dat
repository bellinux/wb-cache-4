5|$|The companies' {{first major}} {{projects}} were Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, which each proved successful enough to launch video game franchises. Since then, {{the majority of}} the games produced by <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> been localized for Western audiences, although the process was not given a high priority at Square until the international success of Final Fantasy VII. A dedicated localization department was consequently created at the company's Tokyo headquarters around 1998. Enix remained without a translation department until its merger with Square in 2003. In recent years, the process of localization has undergone changes, mainly due to difficult experiences with various titles. Most major titles are now developed with localization running in parallel to development, with more simultaneous releases and even occasional titles developed in localized form first in order to appeal to the Western market.|$|E
