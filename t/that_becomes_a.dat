5|$|In glomeromycetes (formerly zygomycetes), haploid hyphae of two {{individuals}} fuse, forming a gametangium, a specialized cell structure <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> fertile gamete-producing cell. The gametangium develops into a zygospore, a thick-walled spore {{formed by the}} union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E

For example, one may assume that the volume of space is limited, which would interfere with translation invariance of a theory, or assume {{that the number of}} virtual particles is limited, which would interfere with the assumption that every virtual particle may split into more virtual particles.

25|$|From a {{morphological}} {{point of}} view, some compound verbs {{are difficult to}} analyze because several derivations are plausible.

Most compound verbs originally have the collective meaning of both components, {{but some of them}} later gain additional meanings that may supersede the original, emergent sense. Therefore, sometimes the resultant meanings are seemingly barely related to the original contributors.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} {{mediation}} in Marxism is {{also referred to}} as the problem of determination, or namely how social actors navigate the social structures that bind them. For Marx, the primary form of mediation is labor, which forms a dialectical relationship between a worker’s body and nature. Labor thus mediates between humans and the natural world. Once labor becomes reified, or made into an abstraction <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> commodity, however, it becomes alienated from the worker who owns it and becomes exchangeable just like any other commodity. Once this occurs, capital becomes the mediating or determining factor, with the capitalist setting the wage rate or exchange-value of labor. The only thing the worker owns in this case, his or her labor power or ability to work, becomes the worker’s sole means of subsistence. The worker must get as much value from his or her labor as is possible on the open market in order to survive.|$|E
25|$|King of Prussia has {{retained}} {{its role as}} an important crossroads throughout United States history. In addition to the Inn, from the earliest days, the intersection supported two general stores. Today, four major highways meet {{in or near the}} center of King of Prussia. The Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) from Center City, Philadelphia, ends in King of Prussia at the Pennsylvania Turnpike, an east-west toll road across the southern portion of the state that heads west towards Harrisburg as part of I-76 and east around the northern suburbs of Philadelphia towards New Jersey as I-276. The US 422 freeway begins at US 202 near the center of town and heads northwest to Pottstown and Reading; thanks to reconstruction in 2000, motorists can now travel directly from Reading to Philadelphia without passing onto US 202. US 202 is the only major highway <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>a</b> surface road through the area, heading southwest towards West Chester as a freeway and northeast towards Norristown as Dekalb Pike, a surface road. Important local roads in King of Prussia include PA 23, which runs through King of Prussia between Valley Forge and Bridgeport along Valley Forge Road; Gulph Road, which runs from PA 23 near Valley Forge National Historical Park and heads southeast to junctions with I-76 and US 202 near the King of Prussia Mall before leading to Gulph Mills; and Henderson Road, a north-south road through King of Prussia that intersects PA 23 and US 202 before ending at Gulph Road near an interchange with I-76.|$|E
