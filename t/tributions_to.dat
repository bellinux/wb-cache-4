We build upon a previous proposal by Mizzaro [11], who proposed a method for substituting and/or complementing peer review in schol- arly publishing. Since articles in Wikipedia are never fin- ished, and their authors change continuously, we define a modified algorithm {{that takes into account}} the different do- main, with particular {{attention to the fact that}} authors con- tribute identifiable pieces of information that can be further modified by other authors. The algorithm assigns quality scores to articles and con- tributors. The scores assigned to articles can be used, for instance, to let the reader understand how reliable are the articles he or she is looking at, or to help contributors in identifying low quality articles to be enhanced. The scores assigned to users measure the average quality of their con- <b>tributions</b> <b>to</b> Wikipedia and can be used, for instance, for conflict resolution policies based on the quality of involved users. Our proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated by analyzing the obtained quality scores on articles for deletion and featured articles, also on six temporal Wikipedia snap- shots. Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm seems to appropriately identify high quality and low quality articles, and that good quality authors produce more long-lived contributions than low quality authors...|$|E

Our construction readily extends to capture the structure of latent factors, similarly to stochastic block- models, while maintaining its power law degree distribution. The BFRY random variables are well approximated by gamma random variables in a variational Bayesian inference routine, which we apply to several network datasets for which power law degree distributions are a natural assumption. By learning the parameters of the BFRY distribution via probabilistic inference, we are able to automatically select the appropriate power law behavior from the data. In order to further scale our inference procedure, we adopt stochastic gradient ascent routines where the gradients are computed on minibatches (i. e., sub- sets) of the edges in the graph. J.

Further, RMA strives to expand the hori- zons and terms of engagement with realism and materialism beyond the primarily philosophical context in which their recent developments have taken place, often under the title “Speculative Realism” (SR). While it is SR that has most stridently challenged critical orthodoxies (even if, as discussed later in this introduction, the positions convened under the SR banner are often discordant and form no uni ed movement), RMA purposefully looks to extend the purview of realist and materialist thought by presenting recent developments in a number of distinct and heteroge- neous practices and disciplines. Cutting across diverse thematic interests and modes of investigation, the con- <b>tributions</b> <b>to</b> RMA demonstrate the breadth and challenge of realist and materialist approaches to received disciplinary categories and forms of practice.

40|$|While {{studying}} Test-First Development (TFD), {{researchers have}} typically com- pared it to Test-Last Development (TLD), across groups or projects, and for relatively short durations. But, we {{have observed that}} teams testing fine-grained changes do not necessarily develop tests for those changes first. And, comparing across groups or projects is difficult, due to the "contextual variables" specific to each. Finally, many "real-life" projects have long durations. Because of TFD's potential to increase team speed or product quality, and because of these previous limitations, we were motivated to design and execute our own related study. Our work on this study has resulted in three original con- <b>tributions</b> <b>to</b> knowledge: (1) our software change model; (2) our measurement method; and (3) our study results. First, {{as part of our}} software model, we defined Test-With Development (TWD) as more general than TFD, and as a step that can be practised to a degree. Then, we defined team speed measures for a developer's product change: initial net size, discards over time, and net size over time. As well, we adopted product quality measures for a developer's product change: change in the number of potential bugs and change in the average method complexity. Second, we defined a measurement method which allowed us to perform two studies, across six open-source projects and thousands of developer changes. With it, we performed an auxiliary study to calibrate our discards over time measure. Then, we used it to perform our main study to compare the effects of TWD product changes on some attributes of team speed and product quality. 2 3 Finally, the results from our main study indicate that there were significant differences between the effects of TWD product changes. We interpret these results to indicate that teams that practice TWD can increase their efficiency, by reducing their product's complexity faster.

Q., which he introduced, or perhaps in connec tion with the study of child language. 2 In fact, William Stern’s con <b>tributions</b> <b>to</b> psychology were massive, both in scope and in signifi cance, and there is much that is still of relevance to us today. William Stern laid the groundwork for many separate subspecialities of psychology. At the same time, and throughout his career, he insisted that the emancipation of psychology from philos ophy did not imply that psychology had no need of philosophy. He himself wrote many papers and three volumes (Person und Sache) (1906, 1908, 1924) in which he articulated a philosophic grounding for psychology. In General Psychology from the Personalistic Standpoint (1938), which he himself regarded as his crowning achievement, philosophical questions arising from the empirical and experimental data are constantly raised. I quote from the intro duction to this work: philosophical problems of psychology do not constitute an isolated prov ince with which empirical psychology need have no concern. On the con trary these problems penetrate the tissue of the empirical sciences of mental life, reducing its findings to order and system, sense and mean ing. On the other hand, as special researchers advance they impose upon philosophical psychology limitations, concrete demands, and controls that protect it from the confusion that formerly characterized speculative, unrealistic psychology. (p. 9) What I propose to do in this paper is to analyze the relation—or bet ter, the interaction—between his empirical and his philosophical endeavors, and to deal with the world-view he articulates, {{in the context of the}} time and the world in which he lived. In doing this I hope to generate questions about the world in which we live, and what this might imply for the way in which we conduct research in the human sciences today...|$|E

The design framework has its theoretical basis in Gibsonian eco- logical psychology, and its founding principles draw heavily on Jens Rasmussen’s skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) taxonomy. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the framework’s applications since Vicente and Rasmussen’s 1992 seminal arti- cle detailing the theoretical foundations of the method. There is variation in terms of both the use of the two fundamental com- ponents of the method as it was first described, and how it has been supplemented with other phases of the cognitive work analy- sis; this review highlights these variations with regard to how the design framework has been applied and how these applications have been reported in the literature.

Much interest has been aroused recently in the possibility of growing microorganism ona large scale to provide a cheap source of protein, food and folk medicine for antitumors and adult diseases. Large-scale culture for mushroom ycelium in submerged liq uid culture has been realized.

Structural control can offer a reliable con- <b>tribution</b> <b>to</b> limit internal forces and displacements in structural elements when extreme events occur. Wind buffeting is {{regarded as one of the}} most important dynamic excitation for long span ﬂexible bridges owing to the low frequency content which characterize its spectrum. In this paper a suspension bridge model with steel frame deck is accounted as a case study for performing numerical simulations and evaluating, at ﬁrst, a wide collection of control strategies, including tuned mass dampers, for mitigat- ing the buffeting dynamic vibrations induced by strong wind loading. Subsequently the scope is extended, with reference to the issue of robustness of control strategies, assessing the proposed control solutions with respect to changes of parameters. The control implementations include optimal tuned mass damper schemes. These are identiﬁed through a reduced two degrees of freedom structural model and their efﬁcacy is tested on the full bridge ﬁnite element model. Such passive control strategy is compared with different ones implementing pas- sive or semi-active hysteretic dampers that link the deck to the piers, as well as with hybrid control schemes that adopt {{at the same}} time tuned mass dampers and hysteretic dampers. The important issue of robustness of control strategies is studied with reference to the proposed con- trol schemes. Hence the proposed control solutions are evaluated with respect their capability to perform with a satisfactorily behavior when damage in some of their elements occurs. Besides the numerical sim- ulations, necessary to derive a quantitative approach, the formulation and evaluation of a robustness index for the control system is explored and the reasons at the base of the satisfactorily behavior observe are highlighted...|$|R

For each house,CR- 39 -based passive devices were exposed in two rooms for the two consecutive six-month periods to account for seasonal variations of radon concentration. Furthermore, in order to correlate the in door ra don with radium in nearby soil and to improve {{the knowledge of the}} natural radioactivity in the region, soil samples near each house were collected and 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K activity concentration were measured. The indoor radon concentration resulted quite high from the average (163 Bq/m 3) and generally it did not differ considerably between the two rooms and the two six-month periods. The natural radionuclides in soil resulted to be distributed quite uniformly. Moreover, the correlation between the 226 Ra content in soil and radon concentration in dwellings resulted to be low (R 2 = 0. 26). The an nual effective dose from radon and its short-lived progeny (5. 5 mSv, in average) was calcu lated by us ing the last ICRP dose conversion factors.

From 0. 5 Ga onward, tungsten mineralization displays a renewed mantle-lead con- <b>tribution</b> owing <b>to</b> the direct or indirect association of post- 0. 5 -Ga tungsten occurrences with subduction-re- lated magmatic rocks of the Phanerozoic orogenic cycles. The data presented also suggest that several tungsten mineralization pulses may have recycled tungsten from older reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{management}} of heterogeneous databases, in integrated or collaborative contexts, always involves {{the need for}} solutions to data programmability issues. In general, data programmability addresses problems dealing with evolving scenarios: changes in a database which collaborates in a heterogeneous envi- ronment often imply a sequence of propagating changes in related databases at any level, model, schema, and data. In this scenario there {{is the need to}} translate data and their descriptions from one model (i. e. data model) to another. Even small variations of models are often enough to create difficulties. For example, while most database sys- tems are now object-relational, the actual features offered by different systems rarely coincide, so data migration requires a conversion. Every new database technology introduces more heterogeneity and thus more need for translations. According to the model management proposal, these problems can be solved conveniently applying the ModelGen operator, that can be defined as follows using our terminology: given two models M 1 and M 2 and a schema S 1 of M 1, ModelGen translates S 1 into a schema S 2 of M 2 that properly represents S 1. In this dissertation we will be presenting our theoretical and practical con- <b>tribution</b> <b>to</b> the development of an effective implementation of a generic (i. e. model independent) platform for schema and data translation. We improve the expressive power of its supermodel, that is the set of models handled and accuracy and precision of such models representation. We show how it is possible to automatically reason on models and schemas and how to find a suitable translation given a source and a target model exploiting a formal system, proved to be sound and complete. Then we propose an exten- sion of Datalog based on the use of hierarchies and a sort of polymorphism, that provides a significant simplification in the definition of translations and a higher level of reuse in the specification of elementary translations. Finally we present a new, lightweight, runtime approach to the translation problem, where translations of data are performed directly on the operational system...|$|R
40|$|We {{predict the}} {{spontaneous}} modulated emission {{from a pair}} of exciton-polariton condensates due to coherent (Josephson) and dissipative coupling. We show that strong polariton-polariton inter- action generates complex dynamics in the weak-lasing domain way beyond Hopf bifurcations. As a result, the exciton-polariton condensates exhibit self-induced oscillations and emit an equidistant frequency comb light spectrum. A plethora of possible emission spectra with asymmetric peak dis- <b>tributions</b> appears due <b>to</b> spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. The lasing dynamics is affected by the shot noise arising from the influx of polaritons. That results in a complex inhomo- geneous line broadening. Comment: 6 page...|$|R

40|$|Score level fusion is an {{appealing}} method for combining multi-algorithms, multi- representations, and multi-modality biometrics {{due to its}} simplicity. Often, scores {{are assumed to be}} independent, but even for dependent scores, accord- ing to the Neyman-Pearson lemma, the likelihood ratio is the optimal score level fusion if the underlying distributions are known. However, in reality, the dis- <b>tributions</b> have <b>to</b> be estimated. The common approaches are using parametric and nonparametric models. The disadvantage of the parametric method is that sometimes it is very dicult to choose the appropriate underlying distribution, while the nonparametric method is computationally expensive when the dimen- sionality increases. Therefore, it is natural to relax the distributional assumption and make the computation cheaper using a semiparametric approach. In this paper, we will discuss the semiparametric score level fusion using Gaussian copula. The theory how this method improves the recognition perfor- mance of the individual systems is presented and the performance using synthetic data will be shown. We also apply our fusion method to some public biomet- ric databases (NIST and XMVTS) and compare the thus obtained recognition performance with that of several common score level fusion rules such as sum, weighted sum, logistic regression, and Gaussian Mixture Model...|$|R

In this study, we estimated the vulnerability of three endangeredMalagasy baobab species (Adansonia grandidieri Baill., Adansonia perrieri Capuron and Adansonia suarezensis H. Perrier) to climate change and the effectiveness of the protected area network (PAN) for the future conservation of these species. To estimate the environmental niche of the species, we used an original data-set based on satellite image analysis to detect species presence and an ensemble modelling approach using three species distribution models (GLM, GAM and MaxEnt). We projected the species distribution in 2050 and 2080 using an ensemble forecasting approach combining the three species distribution models and three global circulation models for climate projections. Mea- sures of connectivity were employed to assess the present and future effectiveness of the existing PAN. Among the three baobab species studied, two are severely threatened by climate change (A. perrieri and A. suarezensis), in part because the present PAN does not overlap with future species distribution areas. Recently, strong efforts have beenmade in designing an optimised PAN to conserveMadagascar outstand- ing biodiversity. Nevertheless, its future effectiveness is questioned by the potential shifts in species dis- <b>tributions</b> due <b>to</b> predicted changes in climate. In the context of climate change, alternative strategies such as ecological restoration would also have to be adopted to conserve biodiversity in Madagasca...|$|R
40|$|International audienceActive {{objects are}} {{programming}} constructs that abstract dis- <b>tribution</b> and help <b>to</b> handle concurrency. In this paper, we extend the multiactive object programming model {{to offer a}} priority specification mechanism. This mechanism allows programmers to have control on the scheduling of requests. The priority representation {{is based on a}} dependency graph which makes it very convenient to use. This article shows how to use this mechanism from the programmer side, and exposes the main properties of the dependency graph. The software architecture of our implementation is also presented, as it can be applied to various scheduling systems. Finally, we validate our approach through a microbenchmark that shows that the overhead of our priority representation is rather low. On the whole, we provide a general pattern to introduce a prioritized scheduling in active objects or in any other con- current systems. The resulting framework is shown to be fine-grained, user-friendly, and efficient...|$|R
