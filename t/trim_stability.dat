50|$|Airflow can {{speed up}} or slow down locally at {{different}} points over an aircraft. In the region around Mach 1, some areas may experience supersonic flow while others are subsonic. This regime is called transonic flight. As the aircraft speed changes, pressure waves will form or move around.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{reformulation}} {{of the study}} of airplane <b>trim</b> and <b>stability</b> intended mainly for teaching purposes. This approach yields a slightly different form of the governing equations with respect to that commonly adopted in the literature and in education programs. Under hypotheses of linear, low subsonic, steady-state aerodynamics in symmetric flight, the constitutive laws for lift and pitching moment are rewritten in a homogeneous form and appropriate characteristic points are introduced: the first is the well known neutral point, while the second is termed the control point. This allows the reduction of the complex system of aerodynamic forces acting on the airplane to an equivalent one consisting in only two applied forces. Basic considerations of <b>trim</b> and <b>stability</b> are easily carried out within this framework by simple, intuitive reasoning upon the resulting force distribution patterns. In order to help the reader to familiarize with this approach, applications to level flight in both the stick-fixed and stick-free settings, as well as to maneuvering flight, are briefly addressed...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the gyroplane, with a few exceptions, is largely {{neglected}} in the literature which is indicative of a niche configuration limited to the sport and recreational market where resources are limited. However the contemporary needs of an informed population of owners and constructors, {{as well as the}} possibility of a wider application of such low-cost rotorcraft in other roles, suggests that an examination of the mathematical modelling requirements for the study of gyroplane flight mechanics is timely. Rotorcraft mathematical modelling has become stratified in three levels, each one defining the inclusion of various layers of complexity added to embrace specific modelling features as well as an attempt to improve fidelity. This paper examines the modelling of gyroplane flight mechanics {{in the context of this}} complexity, and shows that relatively simple formulations are adequate for capturing most aspects of gyroplane <b>trim,</b> <b>stability</b> and control characteristics. In particular the conventional 6 degree-of-freedom model structure is suitable for the synthesis of models from flight test data as well as being the framework for reducing the order of the higher levels of modelling. However, a high level of modelling can be required to mimic some aspects of behaviour observed in data gathered from flight experiments and even then can fail to capture other details. These limitations are addressed in the paper. It is concluded that the mathematical modelling of gyroplanes for the simulation and analysis of <b>trim,</b> <b>stability</b> and control presents no special difficulty and the conventional techniques, methods and formulations familiar to the rotary-wing community are directly applicable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} a theory for flight dynamic analysis of highly flexible flying wing configurations. The analysis {{takes into account}} large aircraft motion coupled with geometrically nonlinear structural deformation subject only to a restriction to small strain. A large motion aerodynamic loads model is integrated into the analysis. The analysis {{can be used for}} complete aircraft analysis including <b>trim,</b> <b>stability</b> analysis linearized about the trimmed-state, and nonlinear simulation. Results are generated for a typical high-aspect-ratio “flying wing ” configuration. The results indicate that the aircraft undergoes large deformation during trim. The flight dynamic characteristics of the deformed aircraft are completely different as compared to a rigid aircraft. For the example aircraft, the phugoid mode is unstable and the classical short-period mode does not exist. Furthermore, nonlinear flight simulation of the aircraft indicates that the phugoid instability leads to catastrophic consequences. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of a nonlinear reduced-order formulation for the simulation of geometrically-nonlinear responses of flexible aircraft and other aeroelastic systems. The theoretical foundation of the formulation will be presented first, based on a modal projection of the intrinsic description for beams, coupled with a 2 -D unsteady aerodynamic description. We will then investigate the preservation of conservation laws in the proposed method and develop the numerical details in a practical implementation of the method in MATLAB. In this work we also developed a method of obtaining coeffcients of the nonlinear modal beam equations by means of a condensation process, based on the direct application of Guyan reduction of a high-fidelity 3 D FE model. Structural and aeroelastic simulations will be presented to verify the implementation of the method against theory and published results, as well as demonstrating the numerical properties of the approach. Static <b>trim,</b> <b>stability</b> analysis and open-loop nonlinear flight simulations using the framework will be demonstrated on a highly-flexible flying wing and compared with published results, as well as carrying out control design and closed-loop nonlinear simulations to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed reduced-order method.

40|$|Compared {{with those}} of a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, the dynamics of a rotorcraft are significantly more complex. One of the major challenges {{in the design of}} an autonomous helicopter is the development of a flight dynamic model, which can be useful for simulation studies and for the design of control law and navigational aspects. There is always a trade-off from the accuracy of the mathematical model to the more simplified model required for a control design as far as the helicopter rotor/fuselage dynamics is concerned. Small-scale helicopters posses a higher bandwidth of dynamics; hence, models developed from the first principle alone do not fulfill the needs, and more-sophisticated mathematical models are thus required. The main objective of the present work is to improve the parameterized identification model by replacing it with a most-general flight dynamic model for a minihelicopter. This model includes the rotor blade flap dynamics, stabilizer bar dynamics, and vehicle dynamics, which will be applicable for a general maneuvering flight. A systematic study is undertaken to analyze the influence of inflow models and flap response on the helicopter <b>trim.</b> <b>Stability</b> of the minihelicopter is also analyzed; except for phugoid, all other modes are stable in hover and high forward flight conditions...|$|E
40|$|Unmanned {{ships are}} a new concept in the {{maritime}} sector. The concept of unmanned ships is driven by safety of life, cost and the shortage in seafarers. However, it is uncertain how the change from manned to unmanned ships in?uences the design and exploitation of the ship. Therefore, the in?uences on the ship will be researched in this thesis. The results from this thesis {{can be used by}} various organizations, researchers, and designers, to determine whether the concept of unmanned ships is feasible. The main question is: What are the in?uences of unmanned shipping on the design considerations and what cost saving can be achieved by removing crew related equipment and the crew itself from merchant ships? First, it has been researched how the design requirements change under international law. The design spiral has been used to identify the parts of the ship design that change, because of the changed requirements. These parts are: deadweight, lightweight, powering, machinery selection, general arrangement and costing. To quantify the change in deadweight, lightweight and powering, a parametric study has been carried out and applied to di?erent sized ships. Additionally, an analysis on what additional equipment should be installed on the ship, to make unmanned shipping possible, has been performed. Furthermore, a cost analysis has been carried out to quantify the cost savings associated with the removal of the equipment which is no longer needed for unmanned shipping. The change in cost is the budget for additional equipment required for unmanned shipping. For the cost analysis, building cost, maintenance cost, fuel saving, manning cost, insurance cost, depreciation cost and interest cost have been taken into account. The cost analysis has been applied to di?erent sizes of ships. Subsequently, the parametric study and cost analysis have been applied to a speci?c case. In addition the change in capacity, dimensions, <b>trim,</b> <b>stability,</b> seakeeping, general arrangement plan and tonnage have been analyzed. To check the sensitivity of the results, a sensitivity study for uncertain parameters has been performed. The di?erent analyses showed that the change in weight and power is minimal, but that the saving in cost is signi?cant. In conclusion, it can be stated that a signi?cant cost reduction can be achieved by removing the accommodation and related systems from ships.

40|$|The {{supporting}} Flight Dynamics research {{contribution to}} the design of Demon, a flapless UAV demonstrator which is the subject of the national research programme FLAVIIR, is described in this thesis. In particular, an integrated flight control and fluidic control system which employs aerodynamic circulation control (CC) to enhance, or replace a conventional aileron is presented. The elimination, or reduction in size, of hinged flight control surfaces on an aircraft offers the possibility of reducing aircraft signature and reducing maintenance requirements; fluidic maneuver effectors provide the opportunity to produce the forces and moments required for flight vehicle maneuvering without using conventional control surfaces. A novel alternative to a conventional single slot trailing edge CC actuator that enables proportional bi-directional control was developed. The CC actuator was manufactured and tested, and experimental evaluation confirmed that bi-directional incremental lift generation comparable to that produced by a mechanical flap of similar trailing edge span is entirely feasible. Wind tunnel tests of a 50 % full-span scale Demon model were carried out to establish a representative aerodynamic model of the vehicle. A high fidelity 6 DoF simulation of the air vehicle was developed, based on the wind tunnel data and was used to assess vehicle <b>trim,</b> <b>stability</b> and control properties. A mathematical model of the flow control actuator, for interfacing the CC system with the flight control system, was developed and incorporated in the dynamic model of the vehicle. The model determined flapless performance and controllability of the aircraft and, in particular, specific saturation limits and their impact on different phases of flight. Also, the requirements for a secondary air supply system for the CC system and practical values of the volumetric air flow requirement have been assessed. A semi-autonomous primary Flight Control System to enable command and control by a remote pilot throughout the flight was developed. A novel re-configurable control architecture that shares control moment demand between conventional flaps and fluidic motivators was designed and demonstrated to provide a sufficient degree of safety and a flexibility to facilitate future experimental flight research. The results of the research study showed the CC actuator to be a practical {{solution to the problem of}} direct flow control at subsonic velocities and, hence, to have significant potential to act as a direct replacement for a flap type control surface. Roll control power equivalent to that of conventional ailerons can be achieved at practical trailing edge slot blowing conditions. Thus, it is concluded that the CC actuator, in combination with conventional elevator and rudder, can effectively control the Demon over its proposed flight envelope.

40|$|The {{bifurcation}} and continuation methodology {{has evolved}} {{over the last two}} decades into a powerful tool for the analysis of <b>trim</b> and <b>stability</b> problems in aircraft flight dynamics. Over the years, bifurcation methods have been employed to deal with a variety of problems in aircraft dynamics, such as predicting high angle of attack behavior, especially spin, and studying instabilities in rolling maneuvers. The bifurcation methodology has served as a tool for the design of flight control systems, and is promising to be a useful tool in the aircraft design, simulation, testing, and evaluation process. In the present paper, we describe the state-of-the-art in the use of bifurcation and continuation methods for the analysis of aircraft <b>trim</b> and <b>stability</b> with a few illustrative examples. Both the standard and extended bifurcation analysis procedures are discussed and typical results for instabilities in high-α flight and in inertia-coupled roll maneuvers are shown. This is followed by several problems in nonlinear flight dynamics where bifurcation and continuation methods have been fruitfully applied to yield effective solutions. Finally, the use of bifurcation theory to arrive at analytical instability criteria is demonstrated for the aircraft roll coupling and wing rock problems. 76 references have been cited in the text.

40|$|A hybrid wingbody (HWB) {{concept is}} being {{considered}} by NASA {{as a potential}} subsonic transport aircraft that meets aerodynamic, fuel, emission, and noise goals in the time frame of the 2030 s. While the concept promises advantages over conventional wing-and-tube aircraft, it poses unknowns and risks, thus requiring in-depth and broad assessments. Specifically, the configuration entails a tight integration of the airframe and propulsion geometries; the aerodynamic impact has to be carefully evaluated. With the propulsion nacelle installed on the (upper) body, the lift and drag {{are affected by the}} mutual interference effects between the airframe and nacelle. The static margin for longitudinal stability is also adversely changed. We develop a design approach in which the integrated geometry of airframe (HWB) and propulsion is accounted for simultaneously in a simple algebraic manner, via parameterization of the planform and airfoils at control sections of the wingbody. In this paper, we present the design of a 300 -passenger transport that employs distributed electric fans for propulsion.
