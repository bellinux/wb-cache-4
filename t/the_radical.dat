His poem, The Masque of Anarchy, subtitled Written on the Occasion of the Massacre at Manchester was sent for publication in <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> periodical The Examiner but because of restrictions on <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> press, was not published until 1832, {{ten years after the}} poet's death.|$|E

5|$|In general, any three {{distinct}} circles {{have a unique}} circle—the radical circle—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; {{the center of that}} circle is <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> center of the three circles. For illustration, the orange circle in Figure6 crosses the black given circles at right angles. Inversion in <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> circle leaves the given circles unchanged, but transforms the two conjugate pink solution circles into one another. Under the same inversion, the corresponding points of tangency of the two solution circles are transformed into one another; for illustration, in Figure6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed into one another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass through the center of inversion, which is <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).|$|E

On warming to room temperature <b>the</b> anion <b>radical</b> decays leaving only <b>the</b> phenoxyl <b>radical.</b> <b>The</b> <b>radicals</b> observed on radiolysis of polyvaline are chain scission radicals formed by cleavage of the N-Cα bond or by loss of a hydrogen atom from the α-carbon.

5|$|Alfonsín {{suffered}} {{a car crash}} in the Río Negro province in 1999, during the campaign of governor Pablo Verani. They were on Route6, and he was ejected from the car {{because he was not}} wearing a seat belt. He was hospitalized for 39 days. DelaRúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. <b>The</b> <b>radical</b> support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions of Carlos Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, who also had ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín's health problems later in the year led him to step down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.|$|E
5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out <b>the</b> <b>Radical</b> Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Nitti, <b>the</b> <b>Radicals</b> {{became part of the}} governing coalition dominated by the Liberals of Giovanni Giolitti, who had positioned his party in the centre-left and supported many <b>Radical</b> reforms, while <b>the</b> <b>Radicals</b> moved to <b>the</b> political centre. Nitti himself was Minister of the Treasury from 1917 to 1919 and Prime Minister from 1919 to 1920.

Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing <b>the</b> <b>Radical</b> MP Henry Labouchère to the Cabinet, so Gladstone {{agreed not to}} appoint him. In 1894, Gladstone retired and, without consulting the outgoing prime minister, Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister. His government was weak, and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister {{for the remainder of}} Victoria's reign.|$|E

50|$|In the 1994 general {{election}} the LP won 3.5% {{of the vote}} (despite not being present in some key regions), below the required threshold, but still had six deputies and two senators elected from FI lists. <b>The</b> <b>Radicals</b> {{were not involved in}} Berlusconi's first government (1994-1999), but <b>the</b> elected <b>Radical</b> deputies and senators sat with FI and Emma Bonino, the Radicals' number two, was appointed to the European Commission. The twisted relationship between Pannella and Berlusconi, whose allies included socially conservative parties opposed to <b>the</b> <b>Radicals</b> (notably including National Alliance), soon ended.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{objects are}} the electrode reactions of <b>the</b> organic <b>radicals</b> adsorbed on <b>the</b> {{surface of the}} metallic electrode. The aim is to investigate the dependence of the rate constants in the electrode reactions of <b>the</b> organic <b>radicals</b> upon electrode potential, proton-donor properties of the medium and solvent nature, to determine the electrode reaction mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>radicals.</b> <b>The</b> electrode reactions of <b>the</b> simple organic <b>radicals</b> in <b>the</b> wide range of the electrode potentials where the rate constants are in the value interval 10 - 10 * 997 s* 99 -* 991 have been investigated firstly. It has been discovered that for all <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> <b>the</b> dependence of the electrode reaction rate constant upon electrode potential is subjected to the equation of slow charge, {{in this case the}} transfer coefficient is constant at change of the free reaction energy up to 0, 8 eV.

5|$|Hol {{stood for}} {{election}} {{again in the}} 1924 parliamentary election, when the voting system had changed completely.

With 2,075 votes in Skien the party prevailed over Labour. However, it fared much worse in the other six cities, carried 4,571 votes in total and lost the election in the Market towns of Telemark and Aust-Agder counties.|$|E

5|$|In August 1917, Capelle banned socialist {{literature}} from the fleet, {{in the aftermath}} of several disturbances. On 9 October 1917, {{in a speech to the}} Reichstag, he accused <b>the</b> <b>radical,</b> independent branch of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPDSocial Democratic Party) of knowingly supporting these revolutionary actions, which drove moderate SPD members closer to <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> independent faction. This led to the toppling of Chancellor Georg Michaelis, who was replaced by Georg von Hertling. On 9 January 1918, Capelle was awarded the Pour le Mérite, Germany's highest military award. By August 1918, Scheer and a group of prominent commanders in the High Seas Fleet had convinced Wilhelm II that the senior officers in the naval high command needed to be replaced by more dynamic individuals. To this end, Wilhelm II requested the resignation of Capelle, Henning von Holtzendorff, the Admiralty Chief, and Karl Alexander von Müller, the head of the Naval Cabinet. Capelle resigned from the Navy in October 1918, shortly before the end of the war. His deputy, Paul Behnke, briefly replaced him but was also forced out due to his opposition to Scheer, who had by this time been promoted to the Seekriegsleitung (Chief of Naval Staff).|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} {{mechanism is}} <b>the</b> method of <b>radicals,</b> {{which uses a}} set of character roots. These roots, or radicals, generally but imperfectly align with the parts used to compose characters by means of logical aggregation and phonetic complex. A canonical set of 214 radicals was developed during {{the rule of the}} Kangxi Emperor (around the year 1700); these are sometimes called <b>the</b> Kangxi <b>radicals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>radicals</b> are ordered first by stroke count (that is, the number of strokes required to write the radical); within a given stroke count, <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> also have a prescribed order.|$|R
