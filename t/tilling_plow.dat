50|$|The Salt Lake Valley {{was founded}} first upon an agrarian system and later {{combined}} this with non-agrarian techniques {{by way of}} manufacturing {{and the use of}} the railroad. The early agrarian development began by appointing crews to “plow, plant, survey, build fences, saw timber, build a public shelter, and explore". Their agrarian system was composed of proper irrigation for successful farming of staple crops. Since it was already late in the season, being July, plowing and irrigating occurred around the clock. Between July 23 and the 28th eighty-four acres had been farmed with corn, potatoes, beans, buckwheat, and turnips. In the north, semi-tropical crops were grown such as cotton, grapes, sugar cane, madder, mulberries, and indigo. The techniques of working, <b>tilling,</b> <b>plowing,</b> and irrigating the earth for planting was vital in the success of their agricultural development. “Brigham Young stressed agriculture as the essential base for developing the Mormon Kingdom” (Hinton, 1988, p. 70). It was also stressed that as a people there would be greater success in developing the valley by working together, rather than individually.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{use of the}} term [...] "tractor" [...] is for the {{vehicles}} used on farms. The farm tractor is used for pulling or pushing agricultural machinery or trailers, for <b>plowing,</b> <b>tilling,</b> disking, harrowing, planting, and similar tasks.|$|R

50|$|Aeration and porosity: Atmospheric air {{contains}} {{elements such as}} oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and others. These elements are prerequisites for life on Earth. Particularly, all cells (including root cells) require oxygen to function and if conditions become anaerobic they fail to respire and metabolize. Aeration in this context refers to the mechanisms by which air is delivered to the soil. In natural ecosystems soil aeration is chiefly accomplished through the vibrant activity of the biota. Humans commonly aerate the soil by <b>tilling</b> and <b>plowing,</b> yet such practice may cause degradation. Porosity refers to the air-holding capacity of the soil. See also characterisation of pore space in soil.|$|R

As {{a matter of fact}} the autumn term opened while we were still hard at work around a threshing machine with no definite hope of release <b>till</b> the <b>plowing</b> and corn-husking were over. Our fathers did not seem to realize that the men of the future (even the farmers of the future) must have a considerable amount of learning and experience, and so October went by and November was well started before parole was granted and we were free to return to our books.|$|R

Simulator runs {{were made in}} the spring and fall of 1981 on two replications of four treatments on three soil types in southeastern Arizona. The treatments were: natural, vegetation removed, erosion pavement and vegetation removed, and <b>tilled</b> (moldboard <b>plowed</b> and disked). Runoff, infiltration, and soil loss varied significantly between treatments and, most interestingly, between the spring and fall runs.

50|$|In {{preparation}} for the independence war, Cabral set up training camps in Ghana {{with the permission of}} Kwame Nkrumah. Cabral trained his lieutenants through various techniques, including mock conversations to provide them with effective communication skills that would aid their efforts to mobilize Guinean tribal chiefs to support the PAIGC. Cabral realized the war effort could be sustained only if his troops could be fed and taught to live off the land alongside the larger populace. Being an agronomist, he taught his troops to teach local crop growers better farming techniques, so that they could increase productivity and be able to feed their own family and tribe, as well as the soldiers enlisted in the PAIGC's military wing. When not fighting, PAIGC soldiers would <b>till</b> and <b>plow</b> the fields alongside the local population.|$|R
40|$|The {{soil surface}} {{roughness}} increases water retention and infiltration, reduces the runoff volume and speed and influences soil losses by water erosion. Similarly to other parameters, soil roughness {{is affected by}} the tillage system and rainfall volume. Based on these assumptions, the main {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of tillage treatments on soil surface roughness (RR) and tortuosity (T) and to investigate the relationship with soil and water losses in a series of simulated rainfall events. The field study was carried out at the experimental station of EMBRAPA Southeastern Cattle Research Center in Sao Carlos (Fazenda Canchim), in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Experimental plots of 33 m(2) were treated with two tillage practices in three replications, consisting of: untilled (no-tillage) soil (NTS) and conventionally <b>tilled</b> (<b>plowing</b> plus double disking) soil (CTS). Three successive simulated rain tests were applied in 24 h intervals. The three tests consisted of a first rain of 30 mm/h, a second of 30 mm/h and a third rain of 70 mm/h. Immediately after tilling and each rain simulation test, the surface roughness was measured, using a laser profile meter. The tillage treatments induced significant changes in soil surface roughness and tortuosity, demonstrating the importance of the tillage system for the physical surface conditions, favoring water retention and infiltration in the soil. The increase in surface roughness by the tillage treatments was considerably greater than its reduction by rain action. The surface roughness and tortuosity had more influence on the soil volume lost by surface runoff than in the conventional treatment. Possibly, other variables influenced soil and water losses from the no-tillage treatments, e. g., soil type, declivity, slope length, among others not analyzed in this study.

50|$|Experiments {{conducted}} in France showed that after spreading oil-based mud cuttings on farmland, followed by <b>plowing,</b> <b>tilling,</b> and fertilizing, approximately 10% {{of the initial}} quantity of the oil remained in the soil. Phytotoxic effects on seed germination and sprouting were not observed, but corn and wheat crop yields decreased by 10%. Yields of other crops were not affected. The percentage of hydrocarbon reduction and crop yield performance will vary from site to site depending on many factors (e.g., length of time after application, type of hydrocarbon, soil chemistry, temperature).|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{equipment}} was introduced {{beginning in the}} 1930s. Tractors first replaced mules for <b>tilling</b> and <b>plowing.</b> The first tractors used were McCormick-Deering/International Harvester models with steel wheels and requiring hand cranking for starting. Mechanical harvesting was not introduced until just prior to World War II, when a McCormick Reaper was adapted for use with rice. Rice on its stalks was cut and bundled by the reaper, assembled by hand into shocks for the initial drying in the field. A mechanical thresher replaced the tractor-driven thresher, {{and the introduction of}} rice dryers allowed the rice to be dried at the field, reducing the risk of loss to birds and rain. In 1946, mechanical combines were introduced that were capable of both reaping and threshing, removing the rice from the stalk in the field and allowing all of the drying process to take place with rice off the stalk in dryers at the mill.|$|R
40|$|Numbers and {{activities}} of microorganisms in no-till and conventionally <b>tilled</b> (<b>plowed)</b> soils were strongly influenced by the percentage of soil pore space filled with water (WFP). Under laboratory conditions, soil water contents equivalent to 60 % WFP provided conditions favorable for optimum aerobic microbial activity, however, percent WFP greater than 60 % favored anaerobic microbial activity. Under field conditions, greater soil bulk densities (lower total soil porosity) combined with the greater soil water contents of surface (0 - 75 mm) no-till soils at several U. S. locations resulted in greater WFP values than those of adjacent plowed soils. Average WFP of these surface soils (0 - 75 mm) were 54. 4 % with no tillage compared to 42. 9 % with plowing. Carbon dioxide (CO(, 2)) and nitrous oxide (N(, 2) O) production from surface 0 - 75 mm no-till soils reflected the greater WFP of these soils with 24 -h CO(, 2) and N(, 2) O values averaging 3. 7 and 9. 4 times greater, respectively, than from plowed soils. Numbers of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, N(, 2) O production following acetylene blockage (denitrification potential), and dehydrogenase activity were also greater from surface 0 - 75 mm no-till soils in comparison to plowed soils. ^ Below 75 mm, WFP in plowed soils averaged close to 60 % whereas in no-till soils this value was often exceeded. Accordingly, CO(, 2) production and aerobic microbial numbers at 75 - 150 mm in plowed soils increased with respect to surface values. Under no tillage, CO(, 2) production and aerobic microbial numbers at 75 - 150 mm decreased from the surface values. Numbers of anaerobic microorganisms in plowed soils also increased at 75 - 150 mm, however, numbers of these organisms under no tillage remained close {{to those in the}} surface 0 - 75 mm. As a result, no significant difference in anaerobic microbial numbers occurred between tillage treatments at 75 - 150 mm, as was also the case for denitrification and dehydrogenase activity. ^ These observations indicate the presence of a less-oxidative environment in no-till surface soils and a greater potential for denitrification and biological immobilization of plant available nitrogen compared with plowed surface soils. Development to techniques designed to improve the efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer with the no-till system appear justified. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work lies in {{studying}} the composition, {{physical and chemical properties}} of the second fraction of the humic acid (HA 2) extracted from the typical black soil, depending on the intensity of the soil tillage. Physical and chemical properties of HA 2 have been studied by using ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). It has been demonstrated that increase of the tillage intensity of the typical black soil leads to decrease in the total carbon content and the HA 2 content due to displacement of balance between the conjugated processes of humus synthesis and decay towards destruction. UV spectroscopy indicates intense absorption of humic acids in the near UV region, that corresponds to the donor-acceptor mechanisms π-π* electrons of double bonds. Maximum absorption has been observed for the HA 2 isolated from the black soil <b>tilled</b> by <b>plowing.</b> Moreover, the highest content of oxygen-containing functional groups and low quantity of aliphatic structures has been observed in the same sample. It has been shown that the nature of paramagnetic centers of the HA 2 represented by chelate paramagnetic Fe 3 +-complex formed by rearrangement π-electron system of double bonds, depending on the tillage intensity of the typical black soil.

40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} research farm of The University of Agriculture Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 2011, to investigate the effects of different tillage practices and sowing methods on productivity of wheat and mungbean cropping system on silty clay loam soil. The factors consisted of tillage practices i. e. tine cultivator twice plowed (TC 2), chisels plow followed by rotovator (CR), mouldboard plow followed by rotovator (MR), disk plow followed by rotovator (DR) and tine cultivator followed by rotovator (TCR) in the main plots and sowing methods i. e. sowing with single box seed drill (SD), combined drill (CD) and broadcast (BC) in the sub plots. The performance of different tillage implements during seedbed preparation in term of soil depth of cut, wheel slippage, fuel consumption and effective field capacity were statistically significant. Maximum soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth recorded with CR and MR tillage practices, while maximum soil bulk density, soil penetration resistance, at 20 and 40 cm depth, fresh and dry weed biomass were obtained in plots tilled with tine cultivator twice (TC- 2). However, minimum soil penetration resistance and fresh/ dry weed biomass were obtained in plots of CR and MR tillage practices, respectively. Higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depth was observed when sowing was done with seed drill and combined drill, respectively. Data regarding wheat crop indicated that higher number of tillers m- 2 (403) and grain yield (4. 6 t ha- 1) were obtained in plots <b>tilled</b> with disk <b>plow</b> followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum biological yield (10. 4 t ha- 1) was recorded in plots that were <b>tilled</b> with mouldboard <b>plow</b> followed by rotavator. Sowing by combined seed drill resulted in higher emergence, number of tillers, straw yield and biological yield. Similarly, higher number of grains spike- 1, spike length, grain yield and harvest indices were recorded when sowing was done with seed drill. Maximum total nitrogen in soil was noted in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, sowing by seed drill and combine drill recorded greater total nitrogen in soil and wheat straw. The data relating to mungbean crop indicated that chisel plow followed by rotavator resulted in higher soil moisture content at 20 and 40 cm depths, higher emergence m- 2, plant height, pod length and total nitrogen in grains. Plots tilled with tine cultivator twice delayed flowering and maturity, increase in fresh and dry weed biomass, soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depth and soil penetration resistance at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant - 1, biological yield, soil total nitrogen were higher in plots <b>tilled</b> with moldboard <b>plow</b> followed by rotavator. The maximum grain yield of mungbean and soil organic matter were recorded in plots tilled with tine cultivator followed by rotavator. Similarly, maximum harvest indices and total nitrogen in straw were recorded in plots <b>tilled</b> with disk <b>plow</b> followed by rotavator. Higher emergence, plant height, pod length, hundred grain weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest indices, total soil nitrogen, and total nitrogen in mungbean grain and straw were recorded in plots sown with seed drill. Plots sown with broadcast method delayed flowering and maturity, increase fresh and dry weed biomass and greater soil bulk density at 20 and 40 cm depths. Number of branch plant - 1, pods plant- 1, soil organic matter and total nitrogen in soil were greater in plots that were sown with a combined seed drill. Economic analysis of wheat and mungbean showed that maximum net revenue of wheat was obtained with mouldboard plow followed by rotavator (MR) tillage practices and the highest net revenue of mungbean was found with tine cultivator followed by rotavator (TCR) while minimum net revenue were obtained with tine cultivator (TC- 2). Similarly, sowing by seed drill (SD) and combine drill (CD) resulted in maximum net revenue as compared to broadcast (BC) sowing method. It is concluded from the studies that all tillage implements when followed by rotavator for seedbed preparation resulted better yield and net economic revenue from wheat and mungbean crops {{as compared to the}} sole used of tine cultivator plowed twice. Similarly sowing by seed drill and combined drill showed a higher grain yield and net revenue than broadcast methods...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} work in {{this genre}} seems to be Erotopolis: The Present State of Bettyland (1684) probably by Charles Cotton.

[...] Sometimes, the metaphor of female form equals landscape changes, but the objectification of the female body remains intact; only the image is changed, as when, for example, in another passage, the novel's narrator, Roger Pheuquewell, describes the uterus ("Utrs," [...] as the author simply contracts vowels without graphical indication) as resembling [...] "one of our common pint bottles, with the neck downwards." [...] It is remarkable, he says, for expanding infinitely, the more it is filled, and contracting when there is no crop to hold. Similarly, in Charles Cotton's Erotopolis: The Present State of Bettyland, the female body is an island farmed by men.|$|R

40|$|Glacier {{motion and}} {{sediment}} transport are attributed commonly to pervasive shearing of subglacial till to high strains (the bed-deformation hypothesis). However, {{the processes that}} control bed deformation are difficult to observe beneath modern glaciers, and observations of the geologic record have not been sufficient to determine whether tills have been sheared to the high strains required by this hypothesis;The shear strength of the ice-till interface controls whether a glacier slips over its bed or shears it pervasively over much of its thickness. When clasts gripped by basal ice plow through the bed, the ice-till interface is weakened. Results of experiments using a ring-shear device in which hemispheres were pushed through water-saturated till indicate a progressive decrease in resistive force on hemispheres with increasing plowing speed. This effect {{is due to the}} generation of high pore-water pressures in front of the hemispheres at fast plowing speeds (e. g. 380 m y- 1), which weakens till and reduces resistive forces. These results indicate that increases in glacier sliding speed will reduce resistive forces exerted by <b>till</b> on <b>plowing</b> clasts, which will promote decoupling of the ice from the bed and inhibit pervasive bed deformation. In addition, this positive pore-pressure feedback may constitute a flow instability that promotes fast glacier flow;The ring-shear device was also used to develop criteria at microscopic scales for identifying highly sheared tills. Results of experiments indicate that the alignment (fabric) of elongate, sand-sized particles becomes strong at high strains. Furthermore, microshears become more abundant and align progressively with the shearing direction as strain increases. Magnetic fabrics calibrated to strain in an ancillary ring-shear study and sand-particle fabrics were used to test the till-deformation model as applied to the Batestown advance of the Lake Michigan Lobe. Results indicate that magnetic and sand-particle fabrics are not sufficiently strong to support the bed-deformation model. Furthermore, consistent changes in fabric direction with depth and fabric patterns around cobbles and small boulders indicate that the till likely sheared only in thin zones near the glacier sole during till accretion to the bed from ice. Bed shearing likely contributed only minimally to sediment transport...|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{respiratory}} disease from dust exposure {{in the agricultural}} workplace have focused on allergic diseases caused by inorganic dusts, specifically occupational asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Exposures to inorganic (mineral) dusts among farmers and farm workers may be substantial. Such exposures are most frequent in dry-climate farming regions. In such locations farming activities that perturb the soil (e. g., <b>plowing,</b> <b>tilling)</b> commonly result in exposures to farm operators of 1 - 5 mg/m 3 respirable dust and 2 20 mg/m 3 total dust. The composition of inorganic dust in agriculture generally reflects the soil composition. Crystalline silica may represent up to 20 % of particles, and silicates represent up to 80 %. These very high concentrations of inorganic dust are likely to {{explain some of the}} increase in chronic bronchitis reported in many studies of farmers. Pulmonary fibrosis (mixed dust pneumoconiosis) has been reported in agricultural workers, and dust samples from the lungs in these cases reflect the composition of agricultural soils, strongly suggesting an etiologic role for inorganic agricultural dusts. However, the prevalence and clinical severity of these cases are unknown, and many exposures are to mixed organic and inorganic dusts. Epidemiologic studies of farmers in diverse geographic settings also have observed an increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease morbidity and mortality. It is plausible that agricultural exposure to inorganic dusts is causally associated with chronic bronchitis, interstitial fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the independent contribution of mineral dusts beyond the effects of organic dusts remains to be determined.

Our objectives were to evaluate {{the performance of a}} corn row- crop planter equipped with two planter attachments (smooth/toothed coulters) at six wheat residue management systems (three tillage systems and two levels of surface residue) at two forward speeds of 5 and 7 km h- 1. Residue retained after planting, seeding depth, emergence rate index (ERI) and seed spacing indices were determined. The baled residue plots <b>tilled</b> by chisel <b>plow</b> followed by disc harrow (BRCD) resulted in minimum residue after planting as compared to other residue treatments. Furthermore, the maximum values of the ERI and uniformity of plant spacing pertained to this treatment. Other results showed that the ERI increased up to 18 % for the toothed coulter as compared to the smooth coulter. The toothed coulter also established a deeper seed placement as compared to the smooth coulter. Planting at forward speed of 5 km h- 1 resulted in deeper seeding depth as compared to a forward speed of 7 km h- 1. However, lower values of miss and precision indices were obtained at forward speed of 7 km h- 1, indicating a more uniformity of plant spacing. Results of this study showed that equipping the conventional planter with toothed coulter and planting in soil prepared under the BRCD residue management system can result in a satisfactory conservation crop production system...|$|R
5000|$|Non-synchronous {{transmissions}} are engineered {{with the}} understanding that a trained operator will be shifting gears in a known coordination of timing. Commercial vehicle operators use a double-clutching technique that is taught in driver's trade schools. The most skillful drivers can shift these transmissions without using the clutch by bringing the engine to exactly the right rpm in neutral before attempting to complete a shift, a technique called [...] "float-shifting." [...] With payloads of cargo ranging in commercial freight of 80,000 lbs (40 tons (short) or 36.3 tonnes) or more, some heavy haulers have over 24 ″gears″ (i.e., combinations of gear ratios) that an operator will shift through before reaching a top cruising speed of 70 mph (113 km/h). Many low-low (creeper) gears are used in farm equipment to <b>plow,</b> <b>till,</b> or harvest. Also see Engineering vehicle. An inexperienced operator could suddenly find a piece of heavy equipment stuck in the wrong gear under full power, or even worse unable to shift a runaway vehicle from neutral into a gear for braking effect when headed down a steep slope, unless he or she possessed the synchronizing skill and understood torque issues in non-synchronous transmissions. Many mountain roads require heavy equipment operators to remain in gear and not shift while operating down a steep grade. For more details about steep grade operation see either jake brake, or engine brake. Many other circumstances face operators of non-synchronous transmissions. Safety and operator skills need to be learned before operating any of these types of vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Development {{dramatically}} {{alters the}} hydrologic cycle {{by changing the}} relative percentage of precipitation that contributes to groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, and runoff. As land is developed, infiltration tends to decrease and stormwater runoff increases in both rate and volume due to increases in impervious area, soil crusting, and soil compaction. One problem with trying to infiltrate runoff on the remaining permeable land after development is that the soil is often heavily compacted by construction activities, preventing acceptable rates of infiltration. Three practices were evaluated in a field study for their effectiveness in reducing excess runoff volume caused by soil compaction. Twelve plots were installed in the early summer of 2002 on a silty soil that had been compacted to simulate construction activities. The plot treatments each had three replications and included a control with no other practices performed, deep <b>tilling</b> only; chisel <b>plowing</b> and deep tilling; and compost-amendment, chisel plowing; and deep tilling.

The chisel-plowed and deep-tilled treatment reduced the volume of runoff by 36 to 53 percent. When compost was added, the reduction in runoff volume increased substantially to 74 to 91 percent. The deep-tilled only treatment was shown to increase runoff in all situations other than the rainfall simulation. The increases in runoff volume ranged from 11 to 64 percent.

The latter, {{of the order of}} 0. 01 – 0. 02 m/a, has been proved to be related to soil CO 2 efflux due to organic matter oxidation. A series of CO 2 emission measurement campaigns has been performed between the years 2003 and 2005. The non-steady-state chamber method was employed to assess the efflux spatial variability and detect its relationship with the main hydrological parameters controlling the oxidation reaction, i. e., soil temperature, soil moisture, and organic matter content. The measurements, carried out in two sites located 1. 5 km apart, point out a great variability of the CO 2 emissions both in space and time. While the time-dependent behavior {{can be explained by the}} seasonal fluctuation of soil temperature, spatial variability shows a weak correlation with the variation of environmental variables. Statistical data analyses show that CO 2 efflux can be considered lognormally distributed and that the process is stationary within each site but not in the whole basin, though the properties of the outcropping peat layer and the soil surface seem apparently uniform. A geostatistical analysis reveals two different spatial correlation structures, with scales of spatial dependence of ≈ 30 m and ≈ 180 m. Finally, the collected data show that invasive agricultural practices such as deep <b>plowing,</b> <b>tilling,</b> and harrowing, largely used in the Zennare Basin, induce significant disturbances that are not easily recognizable during the flux surveys and that casually affect the temporal and spatial variability of the oxidation process...|$|R

A three year {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of seven tillage systems on some soil (fine-loamy mixed, Typic Haplocambids) physical characteristics and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) root morphology. Tillage treatments included moldboard plowing + disking (MD) as con-ventional tillage, chisel plowing + disk (CD), chisel <b>plowing</b> + rotary <b>tilling</b> (CR), chisel <b>plowing</b> (twice) + disking (2 CD), plowing with a khishchi (a regional rigid cultivator) (KD), as non-inversion methods, and till planting with cultivator combined drill (TP), and no-tillage (NT) as direct drilling methods. Soil texture, bulk density (BD), organic matter (OM) and compactness (CI) were determined. At the depths 0 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 0. 2, 0. 2 - 0. 3 and 0. 3 - 0. 4 m, root mass density (RMD) was obtained, root length density (RLD) was determined and average root diameter (RD), surface area density (RSD), and root fineness (RF) were calculated. A randomized complete block design consisting of four blocks (replications) was used. For all treatments, the upper layer (0 - 0. lm) contained a higher quantity of RMD, RLD and RSD, but the reverse was observed for the lower layer (0. 3 - 0. 4 m).

40|$|Systematic {{drainage}} of farmed organic soils {{is responsible}} for the occurrence of land subsidence, caused by loss of organic mass in form of CO 2 efflux to the atmosphere. This results in an increased risk of surface flooding, accompanied by higher drainage and pumping costs. A field experimental study has been performed in a drained cropped peatland located in the Zennare Basin (south of the Venice Lagoon, Italy), to measure land subsidence due to peat oxidation and to address the primary relationships between the hydrological regime, the soil mass loss, and the settlement rate. The latter, of the order of 1 – 2 cm/year, has been proved to be related to soil CO 2 efflux due to organic matter oxidation. Quantifying this process is thus extremely important for the management and protection of these areas. A series of CO 2 emission surveys has been performed between the years 2003 and 2005 by means of the non- steady-state chamber method, to measure the efflux spatial variability and detect its relationship with the main hydrological parameters controlling the oxidation reaction, i. e., soil temperature, soil moisture, and organic matter content. The measurements, carried out in two sites located 1. 5 km apart, highlight a significant spatial and temporal variability of the CO 2 emissions. While the time-dependent behavior {{can be explained by the}} seasonal fluctuations of soil temperature, spatial variability shows a weak correlation with the variation of environmental variables. Statistical data analyses show that CO 2 efflux can be considered log- normally distributed and that the process is stationary within each site but not in the whole basin, though the properties of the outcropping peat layer and the soil surface seem apparently uniform. A geostatistical analysis reveals two different spatial correlation structures, with scales of spatial dependence of ~ 30 m and ~ 180 m. Finally, the collected data show that invasive agricultural practices such as deep <b>plowing,</b> <b>tilling,</b> and harrowing, largely used in the Zennare Basin, induce significant disturbances that are not easily recognizable during the flux surveys and that casually affect the temporal and spatial variability of the oxidation process...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Long term no-till (NT) farming {{can improve}} the CH 4 {{oxidation}} capacity of agricultural lands through creation of a favorable soil environment for methanotrophs and diffusive gas transport. However, limited data is available to evaluate the merit of that contention. Although the potential for biological CH 4 oxidation may exist in NT soils, restricted diffusion could limit expression of that potential in fine-textured soils. A {{study was conducted to}} assess the CH 4 oxidation potential and gaseous diffusivity of soils under <b>plow</b> <b>till</b> (PT) and NT for > 50 years. Intact cores and composite soils samples (0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm) were collected from NT and PT plots located at a well-drained site (Wooster silt loam) and at a poorly-drained (Crosby silt loam) site in Ohio. Adjacent deciduous forest soils were also sampled to determine maximum rate expected in undisturbed soils in the region. Regardless of study sites and soil depth, CH 4 oxidation rate (measured at near ambient CH 4) and oxidation potential (Vmax, measured at elevated CH 4) were 3 - 4 and 1. 5 times higher in NT than in PT soils, respectively. Activity in the NT soils approached (66 - 80 %) that in the forest soils. Half saturation constants (Km) and threshold for CH 4 oxidation (Th) were lower in NT (Km: 100. 5 µL CH 4 L- 1; Th: 0. 5 µL CH 4 L- 1) than in PT soils (Km: 134 µL CH 4 L- 1; Th: 2. 8 µL CH 4 L- 1) suggesting a greater affinity of long-term NT soils for CH 4, and a possible shift in methanotrophic community composition. CH 4 oxidation rates were lower in intact soil cores compared to sieved soils, suggesting that CH 4 oxidation was limited by diffusion, a factor that could lead to lower field-measured CH 4 uptake than suggested by biological oxidation capacity measured in the laboratory. Regardless of soil drainage characteristic, long-term NT resulted in significantly higher (2 - 3 times) CH 4 diffusivity (mean: 2. 5 x 10 - 3 cm 2 s- 1) than PT (1. 5 x 10 - 3 cm 2 s- 1), probably due to improved soil aggregation and greater macro-pores volume in NT soils. Overall, these results confirm the positive impact of NT on the restoration of the biological (Vmax, Km and Th) and physical (diffusivity) soil attributes essential for CH 4 uptake in croplands. Long-term implementation of NT farming can therefore contribute to the mitigation of CH 4 emission from agriculture...|$|R

These factors {{play a key role}} on soil erosion. The aim of this work is to identify different erosive periods in function of the temporal changes in rainfall and runoff characteristics (erosivity, maximum intensity and number of erosive events), soil properties (soil erodibility in relation to freeze-thaw processes and soil moisture content) and current tillage practices in a set of agricultural fields in a mountainous area of the Central Pyrenees in NE Spain. To this purpose the rainfall and runoff erosivity (R), the soil erodibility (K) and the cover-management (C) factors of the empirical RUSLE soil loss model were used. The R, K and C factors were calculated at monthly scale. The first erosive period extends from July to October and presents the highest values of erosivity (87. 8 MJ mm ha ? 1 h ? 1), maximum rainfall intensity (22. 3 mm h ? 1) and monthly soil erosion (0. 10 Mg ha ? 1 month ? 1) with the minimum values of duration of erosive storms, freeze-thaw cycles, soil moisture content and soil erodibility (0. 007 Mg h MJ ? 1 mm ? 1). This period includes the harvesting and the plowing tillage practices. The second erosive period has a duration of two months, from May to June, and presents the lowest total and monthly soil losses (0. 04 Mg ha ? 1 month ? 1) that correspond to the maximum protection of the soil by the crop-cover (C factor = 0. 05) due to the maximum stage of the growing season and intermediate values of rainfall and runoff erosivity, maximum rainfall intensity and soil erodibility. The third erosive period extends from November to April and has the minimum values of rainfall erosivity (17. 5 MJ mm ha ? 1 h ? 1) and maximum rainfall intensity (6. 0 mm h ? 1) with the highest number of freeze-thaw cycles, soil moisture content and soil erodibility (0. 021 Mg h MJ ? 1 mm ? 1) that explain the high value of monthly soil loss (0. 09 Mg ha ? 1 month ? 1). The interactions between the rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and cover-management factors explain the similar predicted soil losses for the first and the third erosive periods in spite of the strong temporal differences in the values of the three RUSLE factors.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{can alter}} the root environment positively or negatively, depending on soil physical properties and weather conditions. Two experiments were performed to assess the effects of agricultural traffic on soil physical properties that affect the plant root environment;Crawler-tracked tractors {{have the potential for}} causing less soil compaction because the tracks usually have a greater surface area than wheels of tractors with equivalent power ratings. The objective of the first experiment was to determine the effect of tracked and wheeled tractors on soil physical properties. Compaction plots were established on a Chequest silty clay loam soil (Typic Haplaquoll) in Lee County, IA in 1984. Uhland cores (75 mm diam.) were collected in August 1987 at 50 - 125 mm and 125 - 200 mm depths from untrafficked areas and from areas trafficked by steel-tracked, rubber-belted, two-wheel drive, and four-wheel drive tractors. The untrafficked cores had lower bulk densities and higher air-filled porosities than trafficked cores at both depths, but lower bulk density was associated with lower ground pressure only for the 50 - 125 mm depth, which had been field cultivated after trafficking. The untrafficked cores had greater porosity, compared to the trafficked cores, at both depths due to pores 3 ̆e 30 [mu]m equivalent pore diameter. The only difference in pore-size distribution among trafficked cores was a greater porosity for the steel-tracked tractor compared with the wheeled tractors for the 60 - 300 [mu]m pores at the upper depth;The second experiment examined the effect of tillage with controlled wheel traffic on a Tama silty clay loam (Typic Argiudoll) for a field study in central Iowa. The main plot treatments were tillages: no-till, ridge <b>till,</b> and chisel <b>plow.</b> Uhland cores were sampled on five dates from the 50 - 125 mm depth in three row positions: trafficked interrow, plant row, and untrafficked interrow. The bulk densities of the trafficked interrow positions were high enough to restrict, but probably not exclude, root growth. Soil strength followed similar trends as bulk density, with the trafficked interrow position having the highest strength. The lowest bulk densities and strengths were found for the ridge-till plant row and chisel plow untrafficked-interrow positions. The trafficked interrows generally had less than 0. 10 m[superscript] 3 m[superscript]- 3 air-filled porosity at 1. 0 m soil water tension, which is below that required for adequate plant root aeration. Trafficked interrows had substantially less macroporosity (3 ̆e 60 [mu]m pore diameter) than most non-trafficked row positions for both dates. In summary, the largest difference in physical properties was between trafficked and non-trafficked row positions. Trafficked interrows were uniformly compacted and poorly aerated in all tillage systems. This is advantageous to support agricultural vehicles, but the compacted condition may limit root growth...|$|R

40|$|The Global and U. S. National Heritage Programs {{give the}} lark bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys) a {{conservation}} ranking of G 5 and N 5 respectively, {{which indicates that}} the species is widespread and secure. The Canadian National Heritage Program designates the lark bunting as N 4, which indicates the species is uncommon but apparently secure with some cause for concern over the longterm (NatureServe 2005). The lark bunting is a Management Indicator Species on the Pawnee National Grassland, which is managed by the Rocky Mountain Region (Region 2) of the USDA Forest Service (USFS). A recent study suggests that lark bunting populations on the Pawnee National Grassland may be declining (Yackel Adams et al. in revision), but the supporting data are not conclusive. Our matrix model suggests that survival of adult lark buntings has {{the greatest impact on}} population growth; adult survival rate data are needed in the Pawnee and other areas of its range to validate these estimations. Within Region 2, the greatest threats to lark buntings include habitat loss and habitat fragmentation due to conversion of native grassland to cropland, urbanization, and oil and gas extraction. The World Wildlife Fund classifies most breeding habitats of lark buntings as critical or endangered, with conversion to cropland being the major cause of habitat loss. While lark buntings will nest in some agricultural fields, activities such as <b>plowing,</b> <b>tilling,</b> discing, mowing, and use of pesticides can be very harmful during the nesting period. Human population growth, particularly along the Front Range of Colorado, will likely put increasing demands on lark bunting habitat over the next several decades as grassland is converted to a suburban environment. Current and future increases in oil and gas extraction will continue to fragment and degrade lark bunting habitat in Wyoming and Colorado, and the impacts of these activities will need to be assessed. Heavy grazing by cattle in shortgrass prairie can be detrimental to lark buntings as it reduces the cover required for nesting. Conversely, the lack of grazing in some taller grasses limits the number of lark buntings found in that habitat. Management of grasslands involving moderate grazing and prescribed fire to maintain the mosaic habitat typical of native prairie prior to European settlement would benefit the lark bunting as well as other grassland species. Protection of large tracts of land from agricultural development would help to limit habitat fragmentation and potentially lessen the impacts of nest predation and brood parasitism on lark buntings. Most lark bunting habitat is privately owned, a fact that is unlikely to change in the future. Therefore, landowner incentive programs (e. g., Conservation Reserve Program) and partnerships among conservation organizations, government agencies, and landowners will be needed to increase and preserve lark bunting habitat in the future. On the wintering grounds of the lark bunting, outside of Region 2, potential threats include habitat loss due to urbanization and cropland conversion and habitat degradation in the form of woody species encroachment onto playas. Playas are important areas for feeding and roosting in much of this species’ winter range. Little research has examined lark bunting wintering ecology and the threats specific to its conservation. Study of the impacts of habitat modifications on wintering grounds should be a priority for this species...|$|R
