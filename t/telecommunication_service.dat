40|$|This study {{examines}} the critical influence of advertising on consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria. The advertisement {{played a key}} role in providing the consumers with product information. The study investigates the effect of marketing medium of telecommunication as a proxy for advertisement on preference of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> as a proxy for consumer choice in Nigeria. The Binary Logit Model (BLM) and descriptive analytical frameworks are used to evaluate the statistical importance of advertisement, quality of services, income of the consumer, product’s self and related service charges for a consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> through Wald test. The findings show that product’s self service charge and service quality are statistically significant for a consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria at 1 percent significance level. And, related product’s service is statistically significant for a consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria at 5 percent significance level. While advertisement and income of the consumer are statistically significant for a consumer choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria at 10 percent. The study concludes that advertisement is important for the choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria but having less impact. And, product’s self service charge and service quality are hugely significant for the choice of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria. Therefore, the sector of telecommunications needs more investment in advertisement so as to have telecommunications’ products information spread in order to stimulate the increase in demand for <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria...|$|R

The findings from the analysis of 363 survey responses indicate that traditional and contemporary <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> offer different specializations to satisfy their consumers. Overall, mobile <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> partially replace wired services, on personal gratifications dimensions in particular. The system gratifications dimensions of the wired <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> facilitate the existence of wired <b>services.</b> New <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> (3 G and VoIP) partially replace old <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> (home landline and 2 G) in providing greater satisfaction in entertainment.

According to <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> characteristics, MdTSMF extends the CIM (Computation Independent Model) of MDA. In PIM (Platform Independent Model) phase, UML Profile {{is used to}} abstract service related meta-model, including <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> meta-model, SLA based QoS meta-model and service supporting function meta-model.

25|$|On 23 April 2014, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was {{reported}} to be considering a new rule that will permit ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing their earlier net neutrality position. A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be municipal broadband, according to Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School. On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, permit fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassify broadband as a <b>telecommunication</b> <b>service,</b> thereby preserving net neutrality. On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality. On 16 January 2015, Republicans presented legislation, {{in the form of a}} U.S. Congress H.R. discussion draft bill, that makes concessions to net neutrality but prohibits the FCC from accomplishing the goal or enacting any further regulation affecting Internet service providers. On 31 January 2015, AP News reported that the FCC will present the notion of applying ("with some caveats") Title II (common carrier) of the Communications Act of 1934 to the internet in a vote expected on 26 February 2015. Adoption of this notion would reclassify internet service from one of information to one of the telecommunications and, according to Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, ensure net neutrality. The FCC is expected to enforce net neutrality in its vote, according to the New York Times.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the development of}} the Brazilian <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> sector in the neo-Schumpeterian Evolutionary Theory perspective. We sought to determine whether the Brazilian technological regime characteristics fits into the international scene; to map the innovation environment in which <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> operate; and to consider whether the state post-privatization of the sector encouraged the construction of a technological regime and innovation environment capable of promoting the development of Brazil. The research was developed based on documental analysis and on the Technological Innovation Research (PINTEC) data for 2005 and 2008. The technological regime was established according to Marsili’s (2001) taxonomy. The paper concludes that the technological regime of Brazilian <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> has similarities with the U. S. standard and tends to be a supplier dominated sector. The innovation environment showed that the legal-organizational structure specific to the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>services</b> sector does not accompany the innovative dynamism of the sector.
