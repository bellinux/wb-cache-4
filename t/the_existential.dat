5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find <b>the</b> <b>existential</b> truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.|$|E
5|$|Single-sensed souls, however, called nigoda, and element-bodied souls pervade all {{tiers of}} this universe. Nigodas are souls {{at the bottom}} end of <b>the</b> <b>existential</b> hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even {{individual}} bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas {{can also be found}} in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara.|$|E

40|$|Leibniz’s {{question}} “why {{is there}} something rather than nothing?”, also known as <b>the</b> Primordial <b>Existential</b> Question, has often {{been the focus of}} intense philosophical controversy. While some authors take it to pose a profound metaphysical puzzle, others denounce the alleged lack of meaning or the inconceivability of the idea of nothingness. In a series of articles, Adolf Grünbaum develops an empirically informed critique with the aim to demonstrate that <b>the</b> Primordial <b>Existential</b> Question poses a “non-issue” which does not require explanation. Grünbaum’s critique prompted heated debates in the recent literature. In this paper, I examine each step of Grünbaum’s reasoning and argue that it fails to show that <b>the</b> Primordial <b>Existential</b> Question is ill-founded. Moreover, I identify and rebut several strategies that one may employ to amend Grünbaum’s critique. In doing so, I address various issues related to <b>the</b> Primordial <b>Existential</b> Question, including <b>the</b> alleged need for its proponents to rely on contentious metaphysical presuppositions and the purported availability of empirical evidence which answers or dissolves such a question...|$|R

25|$|In general, {{determining}} the crossing number of a graph is hard; Garey and Johnson showed in 1983 {{that it is}} an NP-hard problem.

25|$|In {{determining}} the time complexity of algorithms {{for the decision}} problem for <b>the</b> <b>existential</b> theory of the reals, {{it is important to}} have a measure of the size of the input. The simplest measure of this type is the length of a sentence: that is, the number of symbols it contains. However, in order to achieve a more precise analysis of the behavior of algorithms for this problem, it is convenient to break down the input size into several variables, separating out the number of variables to be quantified, the number of polynomials within the sentence, and the degree of these polynomials.|$|E
25|$|Any monadic Boolean algebra can be {{considered}} to be an interior algebra where the interior operator is the universal quantifier and the closure operator is <b>the</b> <b>existential</b> quantifier.

In other words, they are precisely the interior algebras in which every open element is closed or equivalently, in which every closed element is open. Moreover, such interior algebras are precisely the semisimple interior algebras. They are also the interior algebras corresponding to the modal logic S5, and so have also been called S5 algebras.|$|E
