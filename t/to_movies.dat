5|$|He {{funded the}} {{formation}} of a Young Men's Christian Association in Kokomo where he and his son became active. Haynes taught swimming classes and regularly took underprivileged young boys <b>to</b> <b>movies</b> and bought them dinners. After several years of active membership at the local level, he was elected president of the national YMCA in 1919 and served two one-year terms. His primary focus during his tenure was the launching of several successful membership drives. In 1920, he was appointed to the Indiana State Board of Education by Governor James P. Goodrich where he advocated increased state funding for vocational education.|$|E
5|$|Marketing {{included}} an MS-DOS computer game, {{part of an}} increasing trend of game tie-ins <b>to</b> <b>movies.</b> J.M. Dillard wrote the film's novelization, which was on The New York Times Best Seller list for four weeks. Paramount sold Star Trek-branded apparel through catalogues, and Kraft made a Star Trek-branded marshmallow dispenser. While Star Trek had a built-in fan market, marketing tie-ins were risky {{at the time and}} even high-grossing films could not guarantee success of related merchandise. Unlike other summer blockbusters, Star Trek had no mass-market appeal and no major food or beverage promotions, but sold pins and posters in theaters, bypassing retailers.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went <b>to</b> <b>movies</b> or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E

5|$|The Venezuelan intern Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) {{falls in}} love with April (Aubrey Plaza), who convinces him she is feared and very powerful. Jhonny is crazy and fell in love for April and sent her his car to pick her up but she used his car to go <b>to</b> <b>movies</b> with her friends. Meanwhile, Leslie tells the Venezuelans that she is seeking to raise $35,000 to fill in a pit to make a park. Raul and his colleagues start to laugh, telling her they have so much money from oil, they can build {{whatever}} they want. Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them. Instead, they are disgusted, and Raul mistakes the park for the aforementioned pit. Leslie later takes them to a public meeting to show them democracy in action, but all of the citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders where are the armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer to nobody, she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Text information, {{which plays}} {{important}} role in news video concept detection, has been ignored in state-of-the-art movie analysis technology. It is so because movie subtitles are speech of roles which do not directly describe content of movie and contributes little <b>to</b> <b>movie</b> analysis. In this paper, we import collaborative-editing synopsis from professional movie sites for movie analysis, which gives detailed descriptive text of movie. Two aligning methods, subtitle alignment and RoleNet alignment, are proposed complementarily to align synopsis <b>to</b> <b>movie</b> <b>to</b> get scene-level text information of movie. The experiment show that proposed methods can effectively align synopsis <b>to</b> <b>movie</b> scene and the imported text information can give a more user-preferred summarization than merely using audiovisual feature...|$|R

The sexual subject matter of the uncensored period was found within many movie genres, most especially in dramas, crime films, exotic-adventure films, comedies and musicals.|$|E

25|$|A {{member of}} the maiden cohort of New York's Actors Studio, Lumet began his directorial career in Off-Broadway productions, then became a highly {{efficient}} TV director. His first movie was a courtroom drama centered on tense jury deliberations in 12 Angry Men (1957). From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other political and social drama films along with adaptations of literary plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading {{the first wave of}} directors who made a successful transition from TV <b>to</b> <b>movies.</b>|$|E
25|$|Now, the interracial {{blending}} of some native French and newcomers {{stands as a}} vibrant and boasted feature of French culture, from popular music <b>to</b> <b>movies</b> and literature.

The French culture might have been already blended in from other races and ethnicities, in cases of some biographical research on the possibility of African ancestry on a small number of famous French citizens.

For example, he was flown to the premiere of Godzilla, and gave the movie a wildly positive review, while a vast majority of critics disliked the film. Knowles later reversed himself and panned the film after the ensuing outcry. Knowles and his defenders, however, have noted that he has given mixed reviews <b>to</b> <b>movies</b> for which he has been sent to junkets and premieres, and in any case is often out of step with mainstream critics. Knowles also gave a negative review to the film Monkeybone, in which he made a cameo appearance.|$|E
