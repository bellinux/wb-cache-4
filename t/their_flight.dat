5|$|Moulting is {{very slow}} and complex. Black {{cockatoos}} appear to replace <b>their</b> <b>flight</b> feathers {{one at a}} time, their moult taking two years to complete. This process is much shorter in other species, such as the galah and long-billed corella, which each take around six months to replace all <b>their</b> <b>flight</b> feathers.|$|E
5|$|The moult of <b>their</b> <b>flight</b> {{feathers}} {{can cause}} serious problems for birds, {{as it can}} impair their ability to fly. Different species have evolved different strategies for coping with this, ranging from dropping all <b>their</b> <b>flight</b> feathers at once (and thus becoming flightless for some {{relatively short period of}} time) to extending the moult {{over a period of several}} years.|$|E
50|$|The {{division}} operate <b>their</b> <b>flights</b> as VFR and use VFR {{flight rules}} throughout {{the majority of}} <b>their</b> <b>flights.</b> Some flights however, either operating/ferrying internationally or for longer distances fly using IFR rules.|$|R

5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler shift of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in <b>their</b> <b>flight</b> speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to <b>their</b> <b>flight</b> speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
5|$|Starlings and mynas {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} Old World passerine birds with strong feet. <b>Their</b> <b>flight</b> {{is strong and}} direct and most are very gregarious.

5|$|Storm petrels {{are small}} birds which {{spend most of}} their lives at sea, coming ashore only to breed. They feed on planktonic {{crustaceans}} and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering or pattering across the water. <b>Their</b> <b>flight</b> is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E
5|$|The storm petrels are the {{smallest}} seabirds, {{relatives of the}} petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. <b>Their</b> <b>flight</b> is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.

5|$|Apollo Robbins medallions {{were also}} struck, in very small numbers, in 14k gold.

For {{the duration of the}} Apollo program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) were flown into space.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. <b>Their</b> <b>flight</b> pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when <b>their</b> <b>flight</b> zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E

5|$|Physically, some insects move <b>their</b> <b>flight</b> muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects {{with direct}} flight, the wing muscles directly {{attached to the}} wing base, so that a small downward movement of the wing base lifts the wing itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the thorax, causing the wings to move as well.|$|E
