5|$|In 1523, Hernán Cortés {{organised}} two expeditions towards Central America from Mexico, one by {{land and}} the other by sea. He commissioned the first to Pedro de Alvarado and the second to Cristóbal de Olid. Alvarado initiated <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Guatemala, and then set out on an expedition into Honduras. Olid began <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Honduras' interior, arriving in 1524, but soon set himself up independently of Cortés.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> western and central Honduras until 1539. Once he had established Spanish control there, he headed east to pacify the Olancho valley. Although <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> the west and centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, resistance in the east took much longer to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout the colonial period.|$|E

5|$|The sources {{describing}} the Spanish conquest of Guatemala include those {{written by the}} Spanish themselves, among them two letters written by conquistador Pedro de Alvarado in 1524, {{describing the}} initial campaign to subjugate the Guatemalan Highlands. Gonzalo de Alvarado y Chávez wrote an account that mostly supports that of Pedro de Alvarado. Pedro de Alvarado's brother Jorge wrote another account to the king of Spain that explained {{it was his own}} campaign of 1527–1529 that established the Spanish colony. Bernal Díaz del Castillo wrote a lengthy account of <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Mexico and neighbouring regions, the Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España ("True History of <b>the</b> <b>Conquest</b> <b>of</b> New Spain"); his account of <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Guatemala generally agrees with that of the Alvarados. He also included his own description of Cortes' expedition, and an account of <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> the Chiapas highlands. Conquistador Diego Godoy accompanied Luis Marín on his reconnaissance of Chiapas, and wrote an account of the battle against the inhabitants of Chamula. Hernán Cortés described his expedition to Honduras in the fifth letter of his Cartas de Relación. Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas wrote a highly critical account of the Spanish conquest of the Americas and included accounts of some incidents in Guatemala.|$|E

Later that year, he participated in the Battle of Hunayn and the Siege of Ta'if.|$|E

They marched independently and captured Edessa, Amida (Diyarbakır), Malatya and raided Byzantine Armenia up to Ararat region and also reportedly raided central Anatolia.

5|$|During his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle {{until age}} 16. After Philip's {{assassination}} in 336BC, he succeeded {{his father to}} the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army.

In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and {{began a series of}} campaigns that lasted ten years. Following <b>the</b> <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela.
