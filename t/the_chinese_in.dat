5|$|Since then Kasahara has {{proposed}} a definition between these two. He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers actively engaged in combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies were more like one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>in</b> Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed {{a large number of}} Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E

5|$|The {{silk road}} toward the west was opened by <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>in</b> the 2nd century CE. The main road left from Xi'an, going either to the north or south of the Taklamakan desert, {{one of the most}} arid in the world, before {{crossing}} the Pamir Mountains. The caravans that employed this method to exchange silk with other merchants were generally quite large, including from 100 to 500 people as well as camels and yaks carrying around 140 kg (300 lb) of merchandise. They linked to Antioch and the coasts of the Mediterranean, about one year's travel from Xi'an. In the South, a second route went by Yemen, Burma, and India before rejoining the northern route.|$|E

5|$|Various {{forms of}} Chinese {{architecture}} exist throughout Indonesia with marked differences between {{urban and rural}} areas and among the different islands. Architectural developments by <b>the</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia differ from those in mainland China. By blending local and European (Dutch) design patterns, numerous variations of fusion styles emerged. Chinese architecture in Indonesia has manifested in three forms: religious temples, study halls, and houses. Cities during the colonial period were divided into three racial districts: European, oriental (Arabs, Chinese, and other Asians), and indigenous. There usually were no physical boundaries among the zones, except for rivers, walls, or roads in some cases. Such legal boundaries promoted high growths in urban density within each zone, especially in the Chinese quarters, often leading to poor environmental conditions.|$|E
