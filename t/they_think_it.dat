5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how longer <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will take to prepare it. The chefs are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} Jackass, Peter and his friends, Cleveland, Quagmire, and Joe are impressed into filming {{their own}} highly dangerous stunts. In one stunt, Peter attempts to jump a lake but instead crashes into a tree, {{causing him to}} fall into the lake and become incapacitated. Brian swims out to save him from drowning, but strains his back during the rescue and also ends up stranded in the water along with Peter, before being rescued by Joe. Lois berates Peter for his actions, since Brian is becoming old and has been smoking and drinking. Peter begins to grow upset about Brian's age so he obtains another dog and names him New Brian. His positive attitude and desirable personality make Brian feel like an outcast and Brian becomes sad that he is now unloved, and rejected. For example in one scene, when the Griffins hear New Brian fart, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is cute and when Brian does it, they get furious and kick him out. He ultimately decides to leave the residence, while his family begins to miss him.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> has to be true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E

25|$|Mearsheimer wrote a {{book that}} {{analyzes}} lying in international politics.

For example, he maintains that President Franklin D. Roosevelt lied about the Greer incident in September 1941, because he was deeply committed to getting the United States into World War II, which he thought was in America's national interest.|$|E

25|$|During the Late Period {{huge numbers}} of scarabs {{with the name of}} Khufu were sold to the citizens, {{possibly}} as some kind of lucky charms. More than 30 scarabs are preserved. At Isis' temple a family tree of the Isis-priests is on display, which lists the names of priests from 670 to 488 BC. From same period comes the famous Inventory Stela, which names Khufu and his wife Henutsen. However, modern egyptologists question whether Khufu's was still personally adored as a royal ancestor at this time; <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> more likely that Khufu was already seen as a mere symbolic foundation figure for the history of the Isis-temple.|$|E
25|$|The {{second part}} is signed by {{those from the}} first signing and in {{addition}} by professors Ulrich Kridweiss of Esslingen, Konrad Vorn of Kampen, Cornelius Pays of Breda and Dietrich of Balveren (Bummel). Signatories attest that: 1) The Masters of Holy Theology written below commend the Inquisitors into Heretical Depravity appointed by {{the authority of the}} Apostolic See in conformity with the Canons, and urge that <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> right to carry out their office zealously.2) The proposition that acts of sorcery can happen with God's permission through sorcerers or sorceresses when the Devil works with them is not contrary to the Catholic Faith, but consonant with the statements of Holy Scripture. Indeed, according to the pronouncements of the Holy Doctors it is necessary to admit that such acts can sometimes happen.3) It is therefore erroneous to preach that acts of sorcery cannot happen, because in this way preachers impede, {{to the extent that they}} can, the pious work of the inquisitors, to the prejudice of the salvation of souls. Nonetheless, secrets that are heard at any time by inquisitors should not be revealed to everyone.4) All princes and Catholics should be urged to think it right to assist such pious vows on the part of the Inquisitors in defense of the Holy Catholic Faith.|$|E
500|$|First Aristotle, then Cicero and Laertius each {{alluded to}} a {{connection}} between the conatus and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> [...] "good", but rather <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> [...] "good" [...] because they want to do it. In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the conatus.|$|E

"I {{keep trying}} to {{convince}} people in the movement that the charge of sickness is perhaps our greatest problem ... we can't really progress in other directions until the unsubstantiated assumption of sickness...is demolished! It's almost always there, however slyly or covertly or even unconsciously, however 'sympathetic' the person: the attitude that homosexuality is somehow undesirable, some sort of twist or malfunction or failure or maladaptation or other kind of psychic sickness. And in our society sick people, by any definition of sick, just DO not get equal treatment. Equal treatment— no more, no less— is what we want! And compassion— which many homosexuals gladly swallow because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> represents an improvement in attitudes toward them— is not equal treatment." ...|$|E

The stuttering can help you create a new groove", he said. The track starts with a [...] "strummy" [...] acoustic guitar introduction, as described by Michael Paoletta from Billboard, on the four-chord progression of Bm–Fm–A–E sequence. The folk rock inspired song has elements of electronica and folk at its core. Its rhythm is [...] produced by a four piece bass drum—which fades in and out abruptly—and atmospheric synth-strings, which are added later in the song.|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} she {{had been}} cast, Reed hired a personal trainer and practiced a healthier diet to prepare herself for her revealing costumes in which she exposes her midriff as the character. In the musical, Jasmine resembles an even stronger, more spirited character than the film version, specifically {{the way in which}} she fights against marriage laws and men who wish to control her. Reed believes her character changed the most during workshops as the show traveled from Seattle to Toronto, and finally Broadway, including the replacement of an original musical number with [...] "These Palace Walls", which composer Alan Menken wrote specifically for Reed. Described by Reed as [...] "a really beautiful song" [...] that [...] "sets up her character", [...] "These Palace Walls" [...] narrates Jasmine's desire to explore the world beyond the confines of the palace, despite being grateful for everything her father has already provided her with. Reed originally found performing [...] "A Whole New World" [...] particularly daunting because, as the film's most famous song, [...] "everyone has these very specific ideas of what <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> should look like or sound like", in addition to feeling pressured to match Salonga's performance, of whom she is a fan.|$|E
