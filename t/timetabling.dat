5|$|Domestic {{high-speed}} {{services on}} High Speed 1 are operated by Southeastern. Having been in planning since 2004, a preview {{service of the}} British Rail Class 395 trains, popularly known as Javelins, started in June 2009, and regular services began on 13 December 2009. The quickest journey time from Ashford to London St Pancras is 35 minutes, compared with 80 minutes for the service to London Charing Cross via Tonbridge. This service on Section 2 of the CTRL, known previously as CTRL-DS, {{was a factor in}} London's successful 2012 Olympic Bid, promising a seven-minute journey time from the Olympic Park at Stratford to the London terminus at St Pancras. Although the Class 395 has a maximum speed of , for <b>timetabling</b> purposes a 10% lower speed is assumed. These trains have faster acceleration than the Eurostar units.|$|E

The work won a Department for Transport Community Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed {{a support group for}} the station, and improved the provision of <b>timetabling</b> information through the use of simplified departure timetable posters. In 2008, they helped to renovate and repaint the station building. It was decorated in 2009 by students from Fairfield School, who created a mural of Victorian characters with incongruous details such as mobile phones, sunglasses and funny hats. The work won a Community Rail Award.|$|E

First Great Western offered a £500 reward for identifying the persons responsible, and stated they planned to install CCTV cameras. Students from Fairfield High School repainted the mural with help from professional graffiti artist Richard Minchin. Artist Wei Ong repainted the mural in 2015.

40|$|In highly-interconnected <b>timetables</b> or dense railway traffic, {{a single}} delayed train may cause a domino effect of {{secondary}} delays {{over the entire}} network, which is a main concern to planners and dispatchers. This paper describes a stability theory to analyse <b>timetables</b> on sensitivity and robustness to delays based on a linear system description of a railway <b>timetable</b> in max-plus algebra. The max-plus model includes train interdependencies resulting from the <b>timetable,</b> logistics, and the shared infrastructure. Stability is the self-regulatory behaviour of the railway system {{to return to the}} steady state of the railway <b>timetable</b> after disruptions. The proposed approach evaluates <b>timetable</b> realizability and stability using max-plus spectral analysis and quantifies robustness using critical path algorithms. Moreover, delay propagation of initial delay scenarios over time and space is effectively computed by explicit recursive equations taking into account zero-order dynamics. The max-plus approach enables a real-time analysis of large-scale periodic railway <b>timetables.</b> A case-study of the Dutch national railway <b>timetable</b> illustrates the potential of the developed methodology to support the design of reliable railway <b>timetables</b> in dense railway traffic networks. ...|$|R

40|$|Real-time railway {{operations}} {{are subject to}} stochastic disturbances. However, a railway <b>timetable</b> is a deterministic plan. Thus a <b>timetable</b> should be designed {{in such a way}} that it can cope with the stochastic disturbances as well as possible. For that purpose, a <b>timetable</b> usually contains time supplements in several process times and buffer times between pairs of consecutive trains. This paper describes a Stochastic Optimization Model that can be used to allocate the time supplements and the buffer times in a given <b>timetable</b> {{in such a way that}} the <b>timetable</b> becomes maximally robust against stochastic disturbances. The Stochastic Optimization Model was tested on several instances of NS Reizigers, the main operator of passenger trains in the Netherlands. Moreover, a <b>timetable</b> that was computed by the model was operated in practice in a <b>timetable</b> experiment on the so-called “Zaanlijn”. The results show that the average delays of trains can often be reduced significantly by applying relatively small modifications to a given <b>timetable...</b>|$|R
