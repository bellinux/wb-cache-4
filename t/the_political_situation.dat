5|$|A {{creation}} date {{at the beginning}} of the second millennium BCE places the relief into a region and time in which <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> was unsteady, marked by the waxing and waning influence of the city states of Isin and Larsa, an invasion by the Elamites, and finally the conquest by Hammurabi in the unification in the Babylonian empire in 1762BCE.|$|E

5|$|The East Angles formed one of {{the seven}} kingdoms known to post-mediaeval historians as the Heptarchy, a scheme used by Henry of Huntingdon in the twelfth century.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Henry, however, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in England became less stable, with both Stephen of England and the Empress Matilda laying claim to the throne. Brien had {{originally}} been considered a supporter of Stephen, but in 1139 Matilda travelled to England and Brien announced his allegiance to her, joining forces with Miles of Gloucester and other supporters in the south-west. Wallingford Castle was now the most easterly stronghold of the Empress's faction – it was either the closest base to London, or the first in line to be attacked by Stephen's forces, depending on one's perspective.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> deteriorated, Whitlam and his {{government}} continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got {{at least as far}} as breaking into the prison within the castle. As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> remained unstable, and new plots appear to have been formed to free him.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1990 {{parliamentary}} election, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) had {{a majority}} in six municipalities of Bosanska Posavina. However, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in the region, especially {{by the end of}} 1991, was marked with obstructions by the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) that established parallel authorities. Throughout 1991, the SDS established six autonomous regions (SAOs) in Serb-inhabited municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The SAO Northern Bosnia, proclaimed in Doboj in November, covered 17 municipalities, including Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Odžak, Bosanski Šamac, Modriča, Gradačac and Orašje. These SAOs were joined into Republika Srpska on 9 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Yugoslav {{president}} Josip Broz Tito in 1980, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> in Yugoslavia deteriorated, with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further. Some of Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina, intent on achieving independence from Croatia.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Mexican {{authorities}} {{gave the}} settlers of Gonzales a small cannon {{to help protect}} them from frequent Comanche raids.

5|$|In 2005, {{the copper}} {{deposits}} in the Katanga Province (former Shaba province) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were the top producer of cobalt with almost 40% world share, reports the British Geological Survey.

5|$|One {{matter in}} which he {{invested}} much effort was <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In Peru, power struggles between conquistadors and the viceroy became an open civil war in which the conquistadors led by Gonzalo Pizarro rebelled against the New Laws and defeated and executed the viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela in 1546. The Emperor sent Pedro de la Gasca, a friend of Las Casas, to reinstate the rule of law, and he in turn defeated Pizarro. In order to restabilize <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>situation</b> the encomenderos started pushing {{not only for the}} repeal of the New Laws, but for turning the encomiendas into perpetual patrimony of the encomenderos – the worst possible outcome from Las Casas's point of view. The encomenderos offered to buy the rights to the encomiendas from the crown, and Charles V was inclined to accept since his wars had left him in deep economic troubles. Las Casas worked hard to convince the king {{that it would be a}} bad economic decision, that it would return the viceroyalty to the brink of open rebellion, and could result in the crown losing the colony entirely. The Emperor, probably because of the doubts caused by Las Casas's arguments, never took a final decision on the issue of the encomiendas.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan in December 1979 and threatened {{boycott of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup.

A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) would participate in such an event.|$|E
