5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E

5|$|However, an {{analysis}} of the distribution of megalodon over time suggests that climate change did not {{play a major role in}} its extinction.

5|$|Netball is an Olympic {{recognised}} sport, {{a status}} attained in 1995 after a twenty-year period of lobbying. It {{has never been}} played at the Summer Olympics, but with recognition a formal requirement for inclusion is met. The absence at the Olympic Games was seen by the netball community as a hindrance to the global growth of the game, depriving it of media attention and funding. Inclusion is hampered, because it is mainly played by women, and mostly in Commonwealth countries. When the sport gained recognition, it opened up sources of funds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> netball community {{had not been able}} to access before, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), national Olympic committees and sports organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Global</b> Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E

5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> financial system is {{on a path}} to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

25|$|The {{instrumental}} temperature record {{does not}} cover the entire globe: there are areas of incomplete or missing data, particularly in polar regions and parts of Africa. The main temperature datasets take different approaches to allowing for this: HadCRUT does not extrapolate, and assumes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> mean applies. When these regions have a different trend to the global average as at present, this causes a bias in the result which understates overall warming. The other datasets interpolate, producing differing trends. A 2014 study introduced a more sophisticated method of Kriging from the UAH satellite dataset, and found that this considerably reduced the hiatus.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} whereby African nations export {{crops to}} the West while millions {{on the continent}} starve has been blamed on developed countries including Japan, the European Union and the United States.
