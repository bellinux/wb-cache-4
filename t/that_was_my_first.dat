They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the electricity – Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Tony Benn reiterated his {{previous}} opposition to European integration. Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, {{they will tell you}} what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E
500|$|Sondheim later {{expressed}} {{his view of}} de Mille's directing, calling her [...] "a horror. [...] She treated the actors and singers like dirt and treated the dancers like gods... I think, an extremely insensitive woman, an excellent writer, and a terrible director, in terms of morale, anyway. [...] <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> experience of bad behavior in the theatre." [...] However, Rufus Smith, who played the minor role of the football coach, stated, [...] "Never again in my life will I experience {{what it is like}} to stop a show cold, by doing exactly what she taught me". [...] The immense job of directing the play finally proved too big for de Mille, who stated [...] "I can't do the new dances and the new songs and the new book," [...] and Hammerstein stepped in to direct the dialogue. [...] According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, at this point the cast was up in arms over de Mille's treatment of them. [...] James Mitchell, one of the dancers in the production, later stated that de Mille was better at directing dancers than actors, as actors come to the stage with preconceived notions about how to play a part, and dancers do not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Order {{has got to}} be {{maintained}} in this school," [...] he said finally, as he faced them. [...] "If we did not have order, the whole institution would go to pieces. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> point. <b>My</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> two Wrongs have never yet made a Right, and instead of taking matters into your own hands, as you did, after having trouble with Professor Lemm, you should have come to me and told me what was wrong.|$|R
60|$|He {{might have}} added <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> command, too. He did {{probably}} {{think of that}} fact, for he checked himself. It was very present to my mind.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{always had}} a {{suspicion}} <b>that</b> theatre <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> love. <b>My</b> body proved <b>that</b> suspicion. It <b>was</b> deeply upsetting, but I have faith that the hours spent at the piano will someday pay off.".|$|R
2500|$|At the 43rd People's Choice Awards in January 2017, American actress Blake Lively {{dedicated}} her [...] "Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress" [...] {{award to}} [...] "girl power" [...] in her acceptance speech, and credited the Spice Girls, saying: [...] "What was so neat about them was that they’re all so distinctly different, {{and they were}} women, and they owned who they were, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> introduction into girl power." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We were like, [...] "Yeah, okay!” My dad {{took me to}} a {{pawn shop}} and got me a Sears Roebuck guitar with a little {{matching}} amp. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> rig -- a complete and total thrill. Jean and I flipped a coin to see who would play bass in the band. (laughs) I won, so I got to stay on guitar. We learned to play by listening to the radio and by hanging out with boys who were in bands. We were 15 or 16 at the time.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{earliest}} influence on comedy, Chappelle said, [...] "You know who was a big influence on me that is really weird is Bugs Bunny, That's just weird. If you {{watch a lot of}} the stuff I do, you can almost see the influence in it, Because these animators would animate these performances that were off the hook, And the guy that, the guy that did the voices was Mel Blanc. This guy was like some kind of savant or genius or something, But they had some kind of real big comedic influence on me, like I liked those cartoons, I think <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> real big comedy influence, was a rabbit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Sureflint--a parent {{would not}} know his own child, when he saw {{him for the first}} time. If I am owner here, you will {{remember}} <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> visit to the spot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came as a}} critic," [...] he answered, [...] "but I am a very incompetent one. Perhaps {{you will}} {{appreciate}} my ignorance more when I tell you <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> visit {{behind the scenes of}} a theatre." ...|$|R
60|$|Guess again. Perhaps it {{was there}} always, from the {{beginning}} of the world? My dear child, you have no proof of that either. Everything round you is changing in shape daily and hourly, as you will find out the longer you live; and therefore it is most reasonable to suppose that this glen has changed its shape, as everything else on earth has done. Besides, I told you not that Madam How had made the glen, but <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> making it, and as yet has only half finished. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> guess; and <b>my</b> next guess <b>is</b> <b>that</b> water <b>is</b> making the glen--water, and nothing else.|$|R
60|$|THE DENTIST (putting {{it down on}} {{the ledge}} of his cabinet of instruments). <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> tooth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Rokens, man," [...] {{interrupted}} Glynn, as {{he pulled}} off his jacket, [...] "the loss is greater to me than to you, for <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> whale!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{not exactly}} a sailor; though I may say I have worked as one before the mast both out and home. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> experience; and I suppose one takes longer than that to get the regular {{nautical}} manner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I may thank Captain Forster for that, at least," [...] {{she said}} to herself, as she angrily wiped a tear from her cheek; [...] "he has opened my eyes in time. What should I have felt if I had found too late that I had come to love {{a man who was}} a coward--who had left the army because he was afraid? I should have despised myself as much as I should despise him. Well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> lesson. I shall not trust in {{appearances}} again. Why, I would rather marry a man like Captain Forster, even if everything they say about him is true, than a man who is a coward. At least he is brave, and has shown himself so." ...|$|R
5000|$|James Darren {{later said}} of the movie, [...] "Fred Sears was a {{wonderful}} director. <b>That</b> really <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> break because I started getting 400-500 letters a month from that film. You're {{not talking about a}} major film here. So, that kind of put me on a different level at the studio and they took notice." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “And as a {{young boy}} who liked planes and cars, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> one of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{indications}} that things wouldn’t necessarily go smoothly,” says Cordes. “That made me sad.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> train robbery, and it {{was about}} as easily done as any of the ones that followed. But that was the last and only time I ever went through the passengers. I don't like that part of the business. Afterward I stuck {{strictly}} to the express car. During the next eight years I handled a good deal of money.|$|E
60|$|RANKIN. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> hasty conclusion, Captain Kearney. But {{it appears}} that the compact between them was that Captain Brassbound should escort {{travellers}} under the Sheikh's protection at a certain payment per head, provided none of them were Christians. As I understand it, he tried to smuggle Sir Howrrd through under this compact, and the Sheikh found him out.|$|E
60|$|I reached home {{very late}} and very sick. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> dissipation, and, as a lesson, {{it has been}} of more {{practical}} use to me than all the good books and sermons {{in the world could}} have been. I can remember to this day {{standing in the middle of}} the room in my night-shirt, trying to catch my bed as it came round.|$|E
5000|$|He replied: “Tough question. All my wins {{mean the}} world to me. If you were to push bamboo under my nails, I would answer <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> win 1976 when I sang the songs ‘Ah Put On Meh Guns Again’ and ‘Why Smut’ on the record as, ‘No Smut For Me’. That {{put me on the}} map and people sat up and took me seriously.” ...|$|R
60|$|Seeing, therefore, no remedy, I {{was obliged}} to {{withdraw}} my hand from him, <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> destroyer, and reserve the assistance that I intended to have given him for another more desirable opportunity. All that I had now {{to do was to}} keep myself out of his sight, which was not {{very difficult for me to}} do, considering in what station he lived.|$|R
500|$|Mankiewicz created Sheriff J.W. Pepper {{to add a}} {{comic relief}} character. Portrayed by Clifton James, Pepper {{appeared}} again in The Man with the Golden Gun. Live and Let Die is also {{the first of two}} films featuring David Hedison as Felix Leiter, who reprised the role in Licence to Kill. Hedison had said [...] "I <b>was</b> sure <b>that</b> would <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> and last", before being cast again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I warned ye," [...] said Dan, as {{the drops}} fell thick and fast on the dark, oiled planking. [...] "Dad ain't noways hasty, but you fair earned it. Pshaw! there's no sense takin' on so." [...] Harvey's {{shoulders}} were {{rising and falling}} in spasms of dry sobbing. [...] "I know the feelin'. First time dad laid me out was the last--and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> trip. Makes ye feel sickish an' lonesome. I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wanted ye {{to see the}} place," [...] said he. [...] "Yon's the stane. Euphemia Ross: {{that was}} my goodwife, your grandmither--hoots! I'm wrong; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> yin; I had no bairns by her;--yours is the second, Mary Murray, Born 1819, Died 1850; that's her--a fine, plain, decent sort of a creature, tak' her a'thegether. Alexander Loudon, Born Seventeen Ninety-Twa, Died--and then {{a hole in the}} ballant: that's me. Alexander's my name. They ca'd me Ecky when I was a boy. Eh, Ecky! ye're an awfu' auld man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Eh, but I must ha' been a silly lad.' Wilfrid {{spoke with}} a sudden thick burr in his voice. He coughed, and took up his silvery tones again. 'There was no fight really. My men thumped a few of them, but the tide rose {{half an hour before}} its time, with a strong wind, and we backed off. What I wanted to say, though, was, that the seas about us were full of sleek seals {{watching}} the scuffle. My good Eddi--my chaplain--insisted that they were demons. Yes--yess! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> acquaintance with the South Saxons and their seals.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Lord {{calls me}} hence. It {{is only for}} a little time I have been with you, and now I am going away, and you will know me no more. Too great has <b>been</b> <b>my</b> pride because I was your minister, but He who sent me to labor among you is slow to wrath; and He ever bore in mind <b>that</b> you <b>were</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> charge. <b>My</b> people, I must say to you, 'Farewell.'" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{any rate}} {{the end was}} sudden. I threw the stone, whereat a great trunk shot out from between the tusks and caught me. Round and round I went in the air, {{reflecting}} as I did so, for I suppose at the time my normal consciousness had not quite left me, <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> encounter with the elephant Jana, also <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> very foolish to try to oblige a female regardless of personal risk....|$|R
5000|$|On May 16, 2016, when Larry Bird {{was asked}} about his {{priorities}} heading into free agency, he said, [...] "Burke been {{a very important part}} over 19 years of what we’ve done here. It’s important for me <b>that</b> he would <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> free agent." ...|$|R
60|$|This book is {{more than}} a mere reprint of Birds in a Village first {{published}} in 1893. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> book about bird life, with some impressions of rural scenes, in England; and, {{as is often the case}} with a first book, its author has continued to cherish a certain affection for it. On this account it pleased me when its turn came to be reissued, since this gave me the opportunity of mending some faults in the portions retained and of throwing out a good deal of matter which appeared to me not worth keeping.|$|E
60|$|A {{figure in}} an {{indefinite}} tweed suit, carrying brown-paper parcels. That {{is what we}} met suddenly, at the bend of a muddy Dorsetshire lane, and the roan mare stared and obviously thought of a curtsey. The mare is road-shy, with intervals of stolidity, {{and there is no}} telling what she will pass and what she won’t. We call her Redford. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> meeting with Judkin, and the next time the circumstances were the same; the same muddy lane, the same rather apologetic figure in the tweed suit, the same—or very similar—parcels. Only this time the roan looked straight in front of her.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{encounter}} with the short-eared owl, a world- wandering species, known familiarly to the sportsman in England as the October or woodcock owl; an inhabitant of the whole of Europe, also of Asia, Africa, America, Australasia, and many Atlantic and Pacific islands. No other bird has so vast a range; yet nobody in the house could tell me anything about it, excepting {{that it was an}} owl, which I knew, and no such bird was found in our neighbourhood. Several months later I found out more about it, and this was when I began to ramble about the plain on my pony.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps <b>that</b> <b>was</b> really <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{moment of}} genuine encouragement, for {{there had been}} a little break in her voice, {{something}} in her tone not altogether natural. If only we had been alone--if even another summons to the telephone had come just then for her father! Fortune, however, <b>was</b> not on <b>my</b> side. Instead, the waiter appeared with the bill and diverted my attention. Eve and her father whispered together. The moment had passed.|$|R
5000|$|In 1951, {{he be able}} {{to attend}} a two-week course at Cambridge University given by Dr. Maurice Wilkes, the {{developer}} of the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). Gilchrist recalls <b>that</b> [...] "this <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> real exposure to computer programming, the problems of debugging, etc.".|$|R
60|$|So <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> {{visit to}} Sir Thomas Rossiter, the famous beetle-hunter, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> also <b>my</b> <b>first</b> step upon {{the ladder of}} success, for Lady Rossiter and Lord Linchmere {{have proved to be}} staunch friends, and they have never {{forgotten}} my association with them in the time of their need. Sir Thomas is out and said to be cured, but I still think that if I spent another night at Delamere Court, I should be inclined to lock my door upon the inside.|$|R
