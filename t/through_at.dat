5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to glucocorticoids, which activate the GR to work <b>through</b> (<b>at</b> least) two signal transduction pathways, SEGRAMs activate the GR {{in such a}} way that it only operates through one of the two main possible pathways.|$|E

5|$|After a few warm up gigs {{towards the}} end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scotts, London on 1 May. Realising the opera's {{narrative}} was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played Tommy all the way <b>through</b> <b>at</b> full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the audience would all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of Tommy had a significant positive response.|$|E
5|$|Cordelia {{remained}} with the 4th LCS <b>through</b> <b>at</b> least 1 February 1919. Later that month, she {{was reduced to}} reserve at Devonport.

5|$|During their U.S. tours, the Beatles were {{introduced}} to both Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. Strongly influenced by Presley since before their formation, the band had tried to meet him in the past, but arrangements had fallen <b>through.</b> <b>At</b> Presley's suggestion, guitars were set up {{in his living room}} and the gathering played music for an hour, following which they discussed the music business and exchanged anecdotes. The other meeting, with Dylan, influenced the music subsequently produced by the Beatles as well as shaping Dylan's own musical style. This was made evident both in Dylan's controversial adoption of electric guitar, and in changes that were apparent in Lennon's vocal and guitar-playing styles.|$|E

Several months later his cell was changed again after guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in it.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass <b>through</b> <b>at</b> a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E

In 2007, Rodríguez walked in only 1.8 percent of his plate appearances, the lowest {{percentage}} in the major leagues. On October 9, the Tigers announced that they were picking up the fifth-year, 13-million-dollar option on Rodríguez's contract, keeping him on the Tigers team <b>through</b> <b>at</b> least the 2008 season.

5|$|On July 1, 1919, M-74 ran between Pioneer and M-55 west of Merritt. There {{it turned}} east running {{concurrently}} with M-55 to Merritt where it turned south to Moddersville and terminated. The spur south of Merrit remained a state highway <b>through</b> <b>at</b> least late 1938. Late that year or early the next, the roadway between Merritt and Moddersville was {{turned back to}} local control and removed from the highway system. By late 1939, the entire highway was decommissioned in its entirety. The highway designation has not been used since.|$|E
5|$|Stations in {{the city}} center are located close to large {{employment}} centers as well as connection possibilities to other modes of transport, such as tram, rail and bus. All stations can be identified at ground level by signs with a blue T in a circle. Stations outside the center are unmanned since the 1995, with ticket machines for fare purchase; some stations feature kiosks. A system of turnstiles have been installed, but will never be activated due to security issues. All stations have step-free accessibility <b>through</b> <b>at</b> least one entrance (except the inbound platform at Frøen), and the platform height is aligned with the train cars.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 ACC Championship Game {{was held}} in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, on December 6, 2008. Virginia Tech won by a score of 30–12, {{becoming}} the first ACC team to win consecutive ACC championship games. Tampa also hosted the 2009 ACC Championship Game which was won by Georgia Tech over Clemson. Poor attendance in both of the Florida locations caused a move to Charlotte, North Carolina's Bank of America Stadium for the 2010 and 2011 games. Charlotte hosted the game again in 2012 and 2013. In February 2014 {{it was announced that}} Charlotte would continue to host the game <b>through</b> <b>at</b> least 2019.|$|E

5|$|The British fleet {{approached}} the French line in an oblique manner, leading to individual engagements as the British ships attempted to break <b>through</b> <b>at</b> several points. Around 9:30, the British flagship HMS Queen Charlotte cut the French line aft of Montagne, firing a devastating raking broadside that killed Montagnes commander, Captain Bazire. The ship astern of Montagne, Jacobin, attempted to prevent Queen Charlotte breaking through by accelerating {{to close the}} gap between herself and her flagship; this left a gap behind her, between Jacobin and Achille, that HMS Brunswick, under Captain John Harvey, attempted to exploit to cut the line and assist Queen Charlotte. Achille accelerated and closed the gap, and Brunswick turned her fire against Vengeur, while Achille engaged HMS Ramillies and Valiant.|$|E
5|$|The Maple Leafs, {{struggling}} once again, {{decided to}} start a rebuild in early 2015. Thus Phaneuf, a veteran defenceman with a lengthy contract, began being shopped around. On March 2, 2015, Phaneuf was almost traded to the Detroit Red Wings, however the deal fell <b>through</b> <b>at</b> the last minute when Toronto refused to retain {{a large portion of}} Phaneuf's salary. He would play {{the rest of the year}} in Toronto. When Toronto hired head coach Mike Babcock the following season, Phaneuf excelled, experiencing fewer penalty minutes and better defensive play under his reduced minutes.|$|E

5|$|The Saxons conquered Bath {{following}} the Battle of Deorham in 577, and the border was probably established {{along the line}} of the Wansdyke {{to the north of the}} Mendip Hills. Then Cenwalh of Wessex broke <b>through</b> <b>at</b> Bradford-on-Avon in 652, and the Battle of Peonnum possibly at Penselwood in 658, advancing west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett. In 661 the Saxons may have advanced into what is now Devon as a result of a battle fought at Postesburh, possibly Posbury near Crediton.|$|E
5|$|The present period began about 150,000years ago and {{involved}} {{the development of}} the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000years, Nevado del Ruiz passed <b>through</b> <b>at</b> least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.|$|E
5|$|The role of Rachel was {{originally}} offered to actresses Téa Leoni, the producer's first choice, and Courteney Cox, {{both of whom}} declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom The Naked Truth, and Cox in favor of playing Rachel's best friend Monica in Friends. A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned {{for the role of}} Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. After acquiring the role and before Friends aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, Muddling <b>Through,</b> <b>at</b> the time, which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends.|$|E
