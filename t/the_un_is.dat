He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of Radical Islam, and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never was about the establishment of a Palestinian state but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E

25|$|On 29 January, {{riot police}} in Gabon fired tear gas {{to break up}} a protest by around 5,000 {{opposition}} supporters, where according to witnesses, up to 20 people were wounded. It was the second such protest since opposition leader Andre Mba Obame declared himself president on January 25 and urged people to take inspiration from Tunisia's uprising. Obame subsequently hid out in the local United Nations Development Programme office, while President Bongo shut down TV stations and allegedly kidnapped members of the opposition. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> accusing Gabon's police of invading and beating students within the university.

25|$|The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) {{published}} {{a paper in}} 2005 offering specific policy solutions for alleviating {{the spread of the}} HIV virus in the MSM population for specific regions around the world. They pointed to “a profound lack of knowledge” and stigma about sexual identity as worldwide barriers to preventing transmission and encouraging those infected to seek treatment. The UNAIDS program has recommended that the South African government implement “sex positive” policies to reduce societal stigma around homosexuality and promote the use of water-based lubricants. Particularly in Morocco, the program has advocated distributing condoms in prisons. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to acknowledge the sexuality of its constituents. According to UNAIDS, the “Government has made significant progress in recognizing the issue of male-to-male sexual health and HIV.” In Latin America, outreach to rural areas is critical to ensuring care to all individuals. The United Nations also emphasizes a focus on LGBT populations that are most vulnerable in Latin American nations. In Jamaica, as in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is outlawed so there are unique challenges to HIV prevention in the MSM community. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> trying to implement community-based strategies in Jamaica while still ensuring the anonymity of the people served. In Norway, UNAIDS has observed an increasing number of MSM who have untreated sexually transmitted infections, and their emphasis is on promoting condom use within the gay community. Despite Canada’s “liberal and progressive” reputation on the world stage, HIV-related stigma is still related to the gay community. The United Nations believes the United States needs to recognize sexual education as a fundamental human right. Additionally, better research on MSM in the U.S. would positively affect funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs.|$|E

500|$|The United Nations (UN) is an {{intergovernmental}} organization tasked to promote international co-operation {{and to create}} and maintain international order. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was [...] established on 24 October 1945 after World War II {{in order to prevent}} another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> in Manhattan, New York City, and is subject to extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> the largest, most familiar, most internationally represented and most powerful {{intergovernmental organization}} in the world.|$|E
500|$|Another {{primary purpose}} of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> [...] "to achieve {{international}} co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character".

The group was founded 15 June 1964 by the [...] "Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries" [...] issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The group held its first major meeting in Algiers in 1967, where it adopted the Charter of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures.|$|E
50|$|For Colban {{the primary}} aim of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> {{as well as}} of the League of Nations was keeping the peace. Unlike the League of Nations, it was to be a {{permanent}} organization, but also a world organization, in order to be able to preserve peace. He saw the reason for the fail of the League of Nations in the fact, that important nation states were not members. In order to be able to do better, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>was</b> to include all states willing to participate and work against the possibility of countries of resigning. This opinion of Colban was also to be understood against the background of the Cold War. He sensed, that if <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>was</b> not able to keep the Soviet Union as a member, this would endanger peace. He even proposed, if the statutes of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>was</b> to be updated, member resignation should be made impossible. At the same time, he was contemplating weakening the veto, with which USSR was making things difficult. He thought that the specialized agencies of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>were</b> a very important part of the organisation, their work indirect, but indispensable for world peace.|$|R

500|$|In 1948, the General Assembly {{adopted a}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights, drafted by a {{committee}} headed by Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor, and including the French lawyer René Cassin. The document proclaims basic civil, political, and economic rights common to all human beings, though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting. The Declaration serves as a [...] "common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations" [...] rather than a legally binding document, but {{it has become the}} basis of two binding treaties, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In practice, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution, though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses.|$|E
500|$|Since its founding, {{there have}} been many calls for reform of the UN but little {{consensus}} on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work. There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council's membership to be increased, for different ways of electing the UN's Secretary-General, and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly. Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the North–South split" [...] between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations. Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez-faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.|$|E
500|$|Another {{frequent}} {{demand is}} that the UN become [...] "more democratic", and a key institution of a world democracy. This raises fundamental questions {{about the nature and}} role of the UN. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> not a world government, rather a forum for the world's sovereign states to debate issues and determine collective courses of action. A direct democracy would request the presidential election of the UN Secretary-General by direct vote of the citizens of the democratic countries (world presidentialism) as well as the General Assembly (just as cities, states and nations have their own representatives in many systems, who attend specifically to issues relevant to the given level of authority) and the International Court of Justice. Others have proposed a combination of direct and indirect democracy, whereby national governments might ratify the expressed will of the people for such important posts as an empowered World Court.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to peacekeeping, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> also active in encouraging disarmament. Regulation of armaments {{was included in}} the writing of the UN Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation. The advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter, resulting in the first resolution of the first General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for [...] "the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction". The UN has been involved with arms-limitation treaties, such as the Outer Space Treaty (1967), the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968), the Seabed Arms Control Treaty (1971), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), the Chemical Weapons Convention (1992), and the Ottawa Treaty (1997), which prohibits landmines. Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues: the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission.|$|E
500|$|But {{there is}} some {{opposition}} {{to the idea of}} an empowered global parliament. A 2007 BBC poll of approximately 12,000 respondents asked, [...] "How likely would you be to support a Global Parliament, where votes are based on country population sizes, and the global parliament is able to make binding policies?" [...] Of those polled, 19.1% responded [...] "Very unlikely–it is a bad idea"; 14.9% responded [...] "Quite unlikely–but it might work"; 23.1% said [...] "Quite likely–but with reservations"; and 14.4% said [...] "Very likely–it is a good idea". The poll was broken out by country, and the U.S. and Australia showed the strongest opposition. Potential challenge to the UNPA are political organizations such as the U.S. Constitution Party, and politicians such as 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Ron Paul, which favor withdrawal from the United Nations and other multilateral organizations altogether due to sovereignty concerns. Canadian Action Party leader Connie Fogal also opposes the UNPA, saying, [...] "It is very revealing to see the NDP and the Greens as part of and promoting this...Further, the European assembly {{has proven to be a}} rubber stamping mechanism of bureaucratic decisions. This is not democracy." [...] In addition, a Civicus article warns, [...] "With an unexpected backlash against civil society in the offing (despite the good efforts of the UN General Assembly President, Jan Eliasson, to reverse the trend), citizen participation at <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>is</b> diminishing quickly. It would be safe to assume that Member States as a whole are not in the mood to consider a Parliamentary Assembly at this time." ...|$|E
