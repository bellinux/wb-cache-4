2500|$|Lathes {{have four}} main {{components:}} the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the tailstock. [...] The bed is a precise & very strong base {{which all of}} the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's spindle secures the workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a line shaft, modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened cutting tool is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the <b>toolpost.</b> The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. The tailstock can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|The <b>toolpost</b> is {{the part}} of a {{metalworking}} lathe which either holds the tool bit directly or holds a toolholder which contains the tool bit. There are a great variety of designs for toolposts (including basic toolposts, rocker toolposts, quick-change toolposts, and <b>toolpost</b> turrets) and toolholders (with varying geometry and features).|$|E

50|$|Turrets can {{be added}} to non-turret lathes (bench lathes, engine lathes, toolroom lathes, etc.) by {{mounting}} them on the <b>toolpost,</b> tailstock, or both. Often these turrets are not as large as a turret lathe's, and they usually do not offer the sliding and stopping that a turret lathe's turret does; but they do offer the ability to index through successive tool settings.|$|E
50|$|Metalworking lathes have a {{carriage}} (comprising a saddle and apron) {{topped with a}} cross-slide, which is a flat piece that sits crosswise {{on the bed and}} can be cranked at right angles to the bed. Sitting atop the cross slide is usually another slide called a compound rest, which provides 2 additional axes of motion, rotary and linear. Atop that sits a <b>toolpost,</b> which holds a cutting tool, which removes material from the workpiece. There {{may or may not be}} a leadscrew, which moves the cross-slide along the bed.|$|E
50|$|The {{tool bit}} is {{mounted in the}} <b>toolpost</b> (1) which may be of the American lantern style, {{traditional}} four-sided square style, or a quick-change style such as the multifix arrangement pictured. The advantage of a quick change set-up is to allow an unlimited number of tools to be used (up {{to the number of}} holders available) rather than being limited to one tool with the lantern style, or to four tools with the four-sided type. Interchangeable tool holders allow all tools to be preset to a center height that does not change, even if the holder is removed from the machine.|$|E
5000|$|A box tool {{is mounted}} on the turret of a turret lathe or screw machine. It is {{essentially}} a <b>toolpost</b> that brings its follower rest along with it. A tool bit (or several tool bits) and a compact follower rest (usually V-shaped or with two rollers) are mounted opposite {{each other in a}} body which surrounds the workpiece (forms a [...] "box" [...] around it). As the tool bit puts a lateral deflecting force on the workpiece, the follower rest opposes it, providing rigidity. A different and popular type of box tool uses two rollers rather than a follower rest. One roller is called a [...] "sizing roller" [...] and the other roller is called a [...] "burnishing roller". The rollers turn with the stock to reduce scarring on the finished turn. Opposing tool bits may be used (instead of a rest) to cancel each other's deflecting forces (called a [...] "balanced turning tool"), in which case the box tool begins to overlap in form, function, and identity with a hollow mill.|$|E

40|$|A simple, linear, {{system model}} is {{presented}} for a lathe with a <b>toolpost</b> that incorporates active vibration suppression. The <b>toolpost</b> model is built from linear dynamic {{models of the}} component parts of the <b>toolpost</b> design: the actuator and drive circuitry, and the mechanical <b>toolpost.</b> The <b>toolpost</b> model is then combined with linear models for the lathe dynamics and cutting process to produce {{a model of the}} entire mechanical system. This model is used as the basis for a controller design that uses a measurement of the actuator current for a sensor signal, and the voltage applied to the actuator by the power amplifier as a control signal. The controller design uses the H 1 design methodology. The performance criteria for the <b>toolpost</b> design are interpreted as measures on transfer functions associated with the system model, and predictions of the performance of the design are {{made on the basis of}} these measures.

40|$|A {{simulation}} model is developed {{to study the}} dynamic characteristics of intermittent turning operations. Factors such as chip load, free-vibration of the <b>toolpost</b> structure, and nonhomogeneous hardness distribution in the material being cut are incorporated in the model. The principle of superposition {{is used in the}} formulation of the simulation algorithm. The impact between the cutting tool and the workpiece at the start of every cutting period during machining is treated as an initial value problem. The {{simulation model}} provides a quantitative evaluatior of the tool vibratory motion during the intermittent turning process. Study of the cutting dynamics based on the simulation results not only confirms the experimental findings, but also indicates that increasing the static stiffnes of the <b>toolpost</b> structure is an effective approach to control the tool vibratory motion. The determination of a probability of tool breakage under various spindle speed settings is presented as an example to demonstrate the practical applications of the simulation model developed in this work...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{intensive}} {{research has}} been conducted concerning the use of smart materials for active vibration control and also vibration attenuation for machine tools. This research merges the two research topics and investigates vibration control of a machining operation using actuators made of smart materials. In this thesis, the effectiveness of using electrostrictive actuators for active vibration control during a turning process on a conventional engine lathe is investigated. The actuators are made of Lead Magnesium Niobate (PMN) and are in a multi-layered configuration. The test bed is a steel structure, called the Smart <b>Toolpost.</b> It is designed to be a key component of a conventional engine lathe machine tool and its purpose is to transmit compensating energy from the actuators to the tool tip during machining. The unique characteristics of PMN actuators to provide accurate displacements ensure the performance of vibration cancellation on the micron scale. The focus of this research is the design of a control system for performance optimization. This research combines both analytical and experimental approaches. In the analytical aspect, optimal, and adaptive control schemes are proposed. Mathematical models of the smart <b>toolpost,</b> based on first principles, are derived and evaluated. In the experimental aspect, system identification of the toolpost's dynamics as well as the actuator's dynamics is performed. Results from computer simulations are compared with the data obtained from machining experiments, showing good agreements. Results from this thesis show that PMN actuators are good smart material, candidates for active vibration control. Optimal, and adaptive control, designs are critical to achieve effective broad band vibration compensation. This thesis gives a systematic presentation of the Smart Toolpost's system modeling, control system design, and real-time microprocessor implementation. But most of all, this thesis illustrates that the use of PMN ceramic material as actuators does indeed have practical applications in precision machining...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{compensating}} the dynamic effects of vibration between cutting tool and workpiece which characterises metal-cutting operations employs a direct measurement of such disturbances at {{their point of}} influence. Figure (1) shows the head (3) of a turning centre in which the workpiece (2) is chucked to the spindle (1) and rotates (n) against the cutting tool (4) in the travelling (Vf) <b>toolpost</b> (5). During a pass along the workpiece (2) the small mutual displacements between its periphery and the tool (4) are registered by a capacitive sensor (7) to yield a mathematical model. The model is then used to control the compensating movements of a piezoelectric or other suitable actuator (6) to minimise the surface roughness of the workpiece.

40|$|These {{are many}} sources {{vibration}} during turning operation. One of these vibration is mass unbalance. The excessive vibration will increase rougness {{and reduce the}} quality of geometric of product. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} analyze the dynamic behavior of lathe machine. In this study, we analyze the dynamic behavior of lateh machine using ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench In this research, principal structures and their material which influence the stiffness of the lathe machine were modeled with help of software Catia V 5 R 14. The lathe machine was modeled in three configuration of tailstock position to determine the FRF. The analysis uses 100 N of excitation force. While mass unbalance with different spindle speed was simulated and compared to normal condition The simulation shows that the biggest displacement response (receptance) was occurred in <b>toolpost</b> with 4. 60. 10 - 7 m/N and 88. 916 Hz of frequency of resonant.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} air-borne signal, {{the cutting}} tool vibration, and the stochastic component of the tribo emf signal produced by single point continuous turning operations have been analysed using statistical techniques. The correlation between variation in their statistical function values {{and the degree of}} cutting tool flank wear has been considered to determine to what extent they may be applied to "in-process" tool wear identification. The test program used a range of cutting parameters typical for the cutting of mild steel and high tensile cast iron using high speed steel and carbide cutting tools. The acoustic sound and the tool vibration have been shown to have limited potential as a means of accurate tool wear identification. The tribo emf signal showed a greater dependence on the tool condition, and accurate assessment was carried out using high tensile cast iron workpieces. The statistical variations of the tribo emf signal obtained for cutting mild steel were highlighted using pseudo random binary sequence slotted test workpieces. The method was developed, using a comparable sequence defined as a quasi random binary sequence, to investigate the response characteristics of the tribo emf by means of correlation analysis, and also to highlight the dynamic response of the lathe through spectral analysis of vibration measured at the <b>toolpost.</b> A mathematical model of the contact conditions at the tool workpiece interface was proposed and tested; showing good correlation with monitored spectral variation of the tribo emf for the cutting of cast iron. Finally, conclusions have been made concerning the potential of the various stochastic signals for the purpose of in-process tool wear identification...|$|E
