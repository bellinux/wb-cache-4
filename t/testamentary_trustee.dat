5000|$|Israel Friedlander, Julius Wellhausen, {{and most}} particularly, Leone Caetani, assert that Sayf {{fabricated}} the episode about killing of Uthman to [...] "exonerate {{the people of}} Medina from participation in the caliph's murder" [...] and as Friedlander adds finding a [...] "scapegoat for the troubles surrounding Uthman" [...] and any complicity in the strife resulting {{in the death of}} third caliph. [...] Tucker asserts that although {{it may have been the}} case, there is no concrete evidence supporting this theory. They note that sources older than al-Tabari are silent on Ibn Saba' and his role in the agitation against Uthman. [...] "They aver that the movement for supporting Ali as heir and <b>testamentary</b> <b>trustee</b> of the prophet did not exist in the time of Uthman as Ibn Saba' had alleged. Therefore they refuse to accept the authenticity of Ibn Saba's claim that Ali was the heir of prophet". Caetani noted that a religious conspiracy may have been created around the person of Ibn Sabaʾ even though he may have been just a political supporter of Ali.|$|E
