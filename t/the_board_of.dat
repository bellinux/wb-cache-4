40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the pattern of ex-ante control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> Education by mayors under <b>the</b> new <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education system, using the principal-agent theory. In particular, I focus on the council on {{educational}} policy and the educational outline for annual performance in prefectures and designated cities, using an analysis of aggregate data. According to the principal-agent theory, this system gives them a power to control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> Education by mayors. The following is the finding of this research. In some municipalities, mayors tend to strengthen a control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> Education: on <b>the</b> other hand, in the other municipalities, mayors tend to loosen a control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> Education. As a result, mayors do not always exert power to control <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> Education...|$|R

5|$|Sledd {{played a}} key role in the {{formation}} and ultimate success of the new university, but his time as its president was a relatively short four years. His political backing ended with the retirement of Governor Broward, and the inauguration of his successor Albert Gilchrist in January 1909. The Florida Board of Education, which then consisted of the governor and the state's elected cabinet members, oversaw <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Control and made no secret of its desire to remove Sledd, in part because members of <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education believed that Sledd's admissions standards were too high and that the university was not growing quickly enough. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Control continued to back Sledd, and its members threatened to resign in protest. Seeking to avoid an unwinnable political controversy, Sledd resigned, and <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Control replaced him with Albert Murphree, the political favorite of several legislative leaders and <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education.|$|E

5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible.

He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished.
