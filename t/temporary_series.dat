The data were set up by using a strategy that classifies the terms of the series into parts with the same quantity of elements. Each part is called a window. The IFS was trained by using a group of windows, which is called a set of training windows. Next, the IFS was applied to solve several problems related to the evaluation of structural integrity. The IFS was applied as an identification strategy and forecast of parameters in a flexible structure. Additionally, by using the IFS we have developed a new strategy to analyze the <b>temporary</b> <b>series</b> obtained from vibrations of flexible structures with the distribution of variable mass. The results obtained in this research, using the IFS applied as an identification strategy and forecast of parameters in a flexible structure, show the effectiveness of the IFS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to carry out a {{comprehensive}} examination of the univariate statistical properties in ASEAN macroeconomic time series from 1960 to 2010 using a battery of endogenous break ADF-type unit root tests. Our empirical findings show that number of rejections of a unit root null is relatively higher when considering structural breaks than without breaks in the models. Most index and rate variables can be treated as trend-stationary processes in Indonesia and Malaysia particularly. However, macroeconomic time series under US Dollar and Local currency terms have an opposite findings. As in ZA models, the US Dollar terms denomination series are more favorable of trendstationary processes. Alternatively, the series under Local Currency terms tend to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root for all ASEAN countries except Thailand in LP models. Hence, the shocks to macroeconomic time <b>series</b> are <b>temporary,</b> these <b>series</b> will return to their long run trend rate of growth. Moreover, the break points are closely associated with global economic events such as the first oil shock of 1973 - 1975, the second oil shock in 1979 - 1980, the commodity crisis in 1985 - 1986 and the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 1998. To this extent, if the shocks to series are transitory, then the macroeconomic stabilization policies may not be over-implemented in ASEAN countries particularly for index and rate variables in Indonesia and Malaysia. The policy authorities may use the historical information to forecast future movements in macroeconomic time series.

A <b>series</b> of 22 cases with a 12 -month follow-up is presented. Twenty-two patients (15 women and 7 men; mean age 39 years) who needed a single tooth replaced because of vertical or horizontal root fracture, caries, endodontic lesions, or periodontal disease were treated with immediate postextraction implant placement. The implant was then restored with a screw-retained prosthetic restoration within 24 hours. Radiographic assessments were made at baseline and 12 months after implant placement. Clinical parameters, such as plaque score, mucositis score, probing attachment level, mucosal margin position, variation of gingival level, and variation of papilla position, were also measured at baseline and after 12 months of follow-up. At 12 months, no implants had failed. Radiographic examination revealed mean bone resorption of 0. 5 mm at 12 months compared to baseline. The mean variation of gingival level, compared to the neighboring teeth, was - 0. 75 mm. Probing attachment levels were 0. 79, 0. 45, and 0. 54 mm at proximal, buccal, and lingual sites, respectively. The values for the mucosal margin position were 2. 9, 2. 2, and 2. 4 mm at proxi. mal, buccal, and lingual sites, respectively. Regarding variation of papilla position, according to Jemts index, 27 papillae presented with a score of 2 (61 %) and 17 with a score of 3 (39 %). An examination of oral hygiene and peri-implant soft tissue conditions at the 12 -month follow-up visit revealed an overall frequency of plaque-carrying implant surfaces of 13 %. Furthermore, mucositis (score 2) was not observed {{at any of the}} peri-implant units. Primary implant stability did not significantly increase over time. The immediate restoration of dental implants placed into fresh extraction sockets was shown to be a safe and predictable procedure. The success rate and radiographic and clinical results were comparable to those obtained following the standard protocol. Within the limits of the present investigation, immediate restoration of single-tooth implants placed in fresh extraction sockets can be considered a valuable option to replace a missing tooth. However, long-term clinical trials are needed to confirm the present results...|$|R

40|$|As RNA Temporais, em função de sua estrutura, consideram o tempo na sua operação, incorporando memória de curto prazo distribuída na rede em todos os neurônios escondidos e em alguns dos casos nos neurônios de saída. Esta classe de redes é utilizada para representar melhor a natureza {{temporal}} dos sistemas dinâmicos. Em contraste, a RNA estática tem uma estrutura apropriada para tarefas de reconhecimento de padrões, classificação e outras de natureza estática ou estacionária tendo sido utilizada com sucesso em diversas aplicações. O objetivo desta tese, portanto foi estudar a teoria e avaliar o desempenho das Redes Neurais Temporais em comparação com as Redes Neurais Estáticas, em aplicações de sistemas dinâmicos. O desenvolvimento desta pesquisa envolveu 3 etapas principais: pesquisa bibliográfica das metodologias desenvolvidas para RNA Temporais; seleção e implementação de modelos para a avaliação destas redes; e estudo de casos. A pesquisa bibliográfica permitiu compila e classificar os principais trabalhos sobre RNA Temporais. Tipicamente, estas redes podem ser classificadas em dois grupos: Redes com Atraso no Tempo e Redes Recorrentes. Para a análise de desempenho, selecionou-se uma redee de cada grupo para implementação. Do primeiro grupo foi selecionada a Rede FIR, onde as sinapses são filtros FIR (Finite-duration Impulse Response) que representam a natureza temporal do problema. A rede FIR foi selecionada por englobar praticamente, todos os outros métodos de sua classe e apresentar um modelo matemático mais formal. Do segundo grupo, considerou-se a rede recorrente de Elman que apresenta realimentação global de cada um dos neurônios escondidos para todos eles. No estudo de casos testou-se o desempenho das redes selecionadas em duas linhas de aplicação: previsão de séries temporais e processamento digital de sinais. No caso de previsão de séries temporais, foram utilizadas séries de consumo de energia elétrica, comparando-se os resultados com os encontrados na literatura a partir de métodos de Holt-Winters, Box & Jenkins e RNA estáticas. No caso da aplicação das RNA em processamento digital de sinais, utilizou-se a filtragem de ruído em sinais de voz onde foram feitas comparações com os resultados apresentados pelo filtro neural convencional, que é uma rede feed-forward multicamada com o algoritmo de retropropagação para o aprendizado. Este trabalho demonstrou na prática que as RNA temporais conseguem capturar as características dos processos temporais de forma mais eficiente que as RNA Estatísticas e outros métodos tradicionais, podendo aprender diretamente o comportamento não estacionário das séries temporais. Os resultados demonstraram que a rede neural FIR e a rede Elman aprendem melhor a complexidade dos sinais de voz. This dissertation {{investigates the}} development of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the solution of problems where the patterns presented to the network have a temporary relationship to each other, such as time series forecast and voice processing. 	Temporary ANN considers the time in its operation, incorporating memory of short period distributed in the network in all the hidden neurons and in the output neurons in some cases. This class of network in better used to represent the temporary nature of the dynamic systems. In contrast, Static ANN has a structure adapted for tasks of pattern recognition, classification and another static or stationary problems, achieving great success in several applications. Considered an universal approximator, Static ANN has also been used in applications of dynamic systems, through some artifices in the input of the network and through statistical data pre- processings. 	The objective of this work is, therefore to study the theory and evaluate the performance of Temporal ANN, in comparison with Static ANN, in applications of dynamics systems. The development of this research involved 3 main stages: bibliographical research of the methodologies developed for Temporal ANN; selection {{and implementation of the}} models for the evaluation of these networks; and case studies. 	The bibliographical research allowed to compile and to classify the main on Temporal ANN, Typically, these network was selected, where the synapses are filters FIR (Finite-duration Impulse Response) that represent the temporary nature of the problem. The FIR network has been selected since it includes practically all other methods of its class, presenting a more formal mathematical model. On the second group, the Elman recurrent network was considered, that presents global feedback of each neuron in the hidden layer to all other neurons in this layer. 	In the case studies the network selected have been tested in two application: forecast of time series and digital signal processing. In the case of forecast, result of electric energy consumption time series prediction were compared with the result found in the literature such as Holt-Winters, Box & Jenkins and Static ANN methods. In the case of the application of processing where the comparisons were made with the results presented by the standard neural filter, made of a multilayer feed-forward network with the back propagation learning algorithm. 	This work showed in practice that Temporal ANN captures the characteristics of the temporary processes in a more efficient way that Static ANN and other methods, being able to learn the non stationary behavior of the <b>temporary</b> <b>series</b> directly.

40|$|O objetivo {{principal}} deste trabalho foi o de explorar a possibilidade de usar uma metodologia capaz de decompor uma série temporal via ondaletas, conjuntamente com os modelos econométricos e de redes neurais já existentes de previsão e comparar a qualidade de previsões obtidas para sucessões cronológicas não lineares simuladas. A proposta foi alcançada principalmente pela elaboração de um fluxograma para tratamento das previsões de sucessões cronológicas para colocar um rigor quantitativo mais adequado. O diferencial deste trabalho esteve na realização das previsões dentro das sub-séries decompostas por uma ondaleta em até dois níveis, e obtendo-se a previsão da série original via reconstrução da série para modelos construídos por processos geradores de dados de sucessões cronológicas não-lineares. Foram simulados séries de um processo ARIMA-GARCH, um processo ARIMA, um processo bilinear e uma série de um movimento browniano. O trabalho principal constituiu-se na elaboração da fase de pré-processamento e das previsões estática em separado para cada uma das sub-séries encontradas sendo feitas para 10 e 200 observações futuras. Além das previsões pontuais foi verificada também o envelopamento dos dados, que consiste em comparar o modelo de previsão através de um intervalo de confiança para os valores previstos em mil séries simuladas pela mesma semente. Os resultados apontaram que para um modelo ARIMA(1, 0, 0) -GARCH(1, 1), pode-se observar que o pré-processamento pela ondaleta foi melhor para apenas uma etapa de separação de altas e baixas freqüências tanto pela correlação quanto pelos critérios do TIC sendo este reduzido e pelo MAPE menor para as previsões de curto prazo. Já para os modelos de redes neurais uma diferença importante que deve ser ressaltada entre as redes neurais recorrentes e as redes com algoritmo de retropropagação é a capacidade de previsão das redes recorrentes para dados não-lineares com 2 níveis de pré-processamento e para previsões de curto prazo. Todavia, já para o critério do envelopamento, os melhores resultados foram para as redes recorrentes na previsão do processo ARIMA-GARCH e bilinear e pré-processamento com 1 nível. Todos os dados também foram comparados com as previsões feitas sem pré-processamento, as quais se mostraram impróprias com MAPE perto de 100 % para previsões de longo prazo. Também checou-se neste trabalho as alterações que a mudança da escolha de uma ondaleta por outra, poderia impactar nos resultados das previsões futuras. Constatou-se que a troca da forma de onda no pré-processamento que se pareça mais visualmente com a forma dos dados da série, reduz as medidas de acurácia em 48 %, deixando evidências que possa haver melhoras nos resultados. Na análise prática para o IBOVESPA, os resultados não foram satisfatórios, visto que os melhores resultados ficam para redes recorrentes com 1 nível de pré-processamento. Outrossim, da análise deste trabalho, emerge a importância dada ao fluxograma implementado para as previsões e o papel das previsões em separado por ondaletas como redutores dos erros nos processos estocásticos, e da implementação das bandas de previsões para redes recorrentes para sucessões cronológicas não-lineares. The {{main objective}} of this work was it of exploring the possibility to use a methodology capable to decompose a <b>temporary</b> <b>series</b> through ondaletas, jointly with the econometrics models and of neural network already existent of forecast and to compare the quality of forecasts obtained for chronological successions no lineal simulated. The proposal was reached mainly by the elaboration of a flowchart for treatment of the forecasts of chronological successions to put a more appropriate quantitative rigidity. The differential of this work was in the accomplishment of the forecasts inside of the sub-series decomposed by an ondaleta in up to two levels, and being obtained the forecast of the original series through reconstruction of the series for models built by generating processes of data of no-lineal chronological successions. They were simulated series of a process ARIMA-GARCH, a process ARIMA, a process bilinear {{and a series of}} a movement browniano. The main work was constituted in the elaboration of the pré-processing phase and of the forecasts static in separate for each one of the found sub-series being done for 10 and 200 future observations. Besides the punctual forecasts it was also verified the envelopamento of the data, that it consists of comparing the forecast model through a trust interval for the values foreseen in a thousand simulated series by the same seed. The results appeared that for a model ARIMA(1, 0, 0) -GARCH(1, 1), it can be observed that the pré-processing for the ondaleta went better so much for just a stage of separation of discharges and low frequencies for the correlation as for the criteria of TIC being this reduced and for smaller MAPE for the forecasts of short period. Already for the models of nets neurais an important difference that it should be emphasized between the nets appealing neurais and the nets with retropropagação algorithm is the capacity of forecast of the appealing nets for no-lineal data with 2 pré-processing levels and for forecasts of short period. Though, already for the criterion of the envelopamento, the best results went to the appealing nets in the forecast of the process ARIMA-GARCH and bilinear and pré-processing with 1 level. All the data were also compared with the forecasts done without pré-processing, which were shown inappropriate with MAPE close to 100 % for forecasts of long period. It was also checked in this work the alterations that the change of the choice of an ondaleta for other, was able to impactar in the results of the future forecasts. It was verified that the change in the wave way in the pré-processing that if it seems more visually with the form of the data of the series, it reduces the acurácia measures in 48 %, leaving evidences that it can have improvements in the results. In the practical analysis for IBOVESPA, the results were not satisfactory, because the best results are for appealing nets with 1 pré-processing level. Likewise, of the analysis of this work, the importance emerges given to the flowchart implemented for the forecasts and the paper of the forecasts in separate for ondaletas as reducers of the mistakes in the processes estocásticos, and of the implementation of the bands of forecasts for appealing nets for no-lineal chronological successions...|$|E
40|$|Following recent {{research}} linking executive functioning to children 's skills, this thesis explores {{the relationship between}} children's inhibition effciency and mathematical ability. This relationship was initially explored using six Stroop task variants containing verbal, numerical or pictorial stimuli. The results indicated that, in the numerical variants only, children of lower mathematical abilty possess less effcient inhibition mechanisms, compared to children of higher mathematical ability. Thus, it is proposed that low-abilty mathematicians may possess a domain-specifc problem with the inhibition of numerical information. The increased interference scores of the lowability mathematicians, however, were only evident under those conditions which also required a degree of switching between <b>temporary</b> strategies. A <b>series</b> of experiments also examined children's ability to inhibit prepotent responses and switch between strategies whilst performing mental arithmetic. The aim of these experiments {{was to provide a}} more naturalistic and appropriate exploration of the hypothesized relationship between mathematical abilty and inhibition effciency. These results also indicated that low-ability mathematicians possess fewer executive resources to cope with increased inhibition demands. A further systematic manipulation of switching and inhibition demands revealed that the low-abilty mathematicians experienced a particular difculty when both types of inhibitory demands (i. e. inhibiting a prepotent response and inhibiting an established strategy) were present. This suggests that their reduction in inhibition effciency stems from the amount of demands, rather than the type of demands placed on the executive system. Furthermore, the results indicated that inhibition effciency may be a specifc element of mathematical ability rather than an element of intellectual ability in general. The final study involved a group of low-abilty mathematicians and examined the disturbing impact of irrelevant information on their arithmetic word problem solving abilty. This study revealed that irrelevant numerical (IN) information has a more detrimental impact on performance than irrelevant verbal (IV) information. It is proposed that it is more difcult to inhibit IN information, as it appears more relevant to intentions, and thus, enters WM with a higher level of activations. In sum, the results indicate that low-abilty mathematicians have a reduced domainspecific working memory capacity, characterized by ineffcient inhibition mechanisms.
