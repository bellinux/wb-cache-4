5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level. In {{less than three years}} Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative with the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio {{for a longer period of}} time, as he was the seventh minister in <b>the</b> <b>portfolio</b> in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over <b>the</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E

5|$|Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold {{reserves}} shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as Brown Bottom.

The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5billion.

5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of <b>the</b> <b>portfolio</b> (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low equity risk, and passive management.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require <b>the</b> <b>portfolio</b> manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{return and}} {{volatility}} spillover effects between the FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap equity indices using the multivariate GARCH framework. We find that return and volatility transmission mechanisms between {{large and small}} stocks in the UK are asymmetric. In particular, there are significant spillover effects in both returns and volatility from <b>the</b> <b>portfolios</b> of larger stocks to <b>the</b> <b>portfolios</b> of smaller stocks. For volatility, {{there is also evidence}} of limited feedback from <b>the</b> <b>portfolios</b> of smaller stocks to <b>the</b> <b>portfolios</b> of larger stocks, although sub-period analysis suggests that this is to some extent period-specific. Simulation evidence shows that non-synchronous trading potentially explains some, but not all, of the spillover effects in returns, and that it explains none of the spillover effects in volatility. These results are consistent with a market in which information is first incorporated into the prices of large stocks before being impounded into the prices of small stocks.
