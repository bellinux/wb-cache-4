5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena {{as a candidate for}} governor of Kentucky in 1891.

Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term.|$|E
