Such features of a property are essential to it, and properties sharing all of their causal features are identical. Causal necessity is thus a special case of metaphysical necessity. Appeals to imaginability have no more force against this view than they do against the Kripkean view that statements like “Gold is an element” are metaphysically necessary...|$|R

25|$|The Macclesfield Canal is a canal in east Cheshire, England. There were various {{proposals}} for a canal {{to connect the}} town of Macclesfield to the national network from 1765 onwards, {{but it was not}} until 1824 that a scheme came to fruition. There were already suggestions by that date that a railway would be better, but the committee that had been formed elected for a canal, and the engineer Thomas Telford endorsed the decision. The canal as built was a typical Telford canal, constructed using cut and fill, with numerous cuttings and embankments to enable it to follow as straight a course as possible, although Telford had little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> construction, which was managed by William Crosley.|$|E
25|$|The Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was noted}} for its poetry, perhaps {{especially}} {{the development of the}} Ci form; indeed, the ci as a poetic form perhaps reached a high point during the Song Dynasty. The ci is a kind of lyric poetry using a poetic meter based upon certain patterns of fixed-rhythm formal types, of which there were about 800 of these set patterns, each associated with a particular title. Originally ci were written to be sung to a specific tune of that title, with set rhythm, rhyme, and tempo. However, over time the actual tunes seem to have disappeared (similarly to the case of English ballads). Thus, the title of a certain ci may have nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> contents, although the poetic meter is the same. It is common for several ci to share the same title. As developed during the Song poetic period, the ci was a versatile verse form.|$|E

25|$|In January 2008, Swiss {{economics}} magazine Bilanz, {{a subsidiary}} of Groupe Edipresse, published an interview with Le Rosey Director-General Philippe Gudin that revealed the school is seeking to sell its Gstaad winter campus and build a new campus in another location. Gudin is in negotiations with the local authorities in Schönried, a suburb of Gstaad located a few minutes away, to construct a new main campus on an undeveloped piece of land, but has run into difficulties due to zoning restrictions. Reasons for moving to a new campus, according to the Director-General, include {{the fact that the}} school's personnel, who typically live on campus, are at maximum capacity, and that the student body can no longer increase in size {{due to the lack of}} space. Gudin stated that for the moment the new winter campus location will be in Switzerland, but he has not ruled out the French Alps. The 100,000m² (approximately 25 acres) of prime real estate that the school occupies on Ried Hill in the centre of Gstaad is estimated to be worth several hundreds of millions of USD, considering the International Herald Tribune reports that the price per square meter in Gstaad starts at 20,000 CHF (19,000 US$) and can rise to 45,000 CHF (43,000 US$). Gudin asserts that the high value of the Gstaad winter campus has nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> planned sale.|$|E

500|$|To {{eliminate}} dialogue {{trees from}} System Shock, the team prevented the player from ever meeting a living non-player character (NPC): {{the plot is}} instead conveyed by e-mail messages and log discs, {{many of which were}} recorded by dead NPCs. Here, Grossman took influence from Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology, a collection of poems written as the epitaphs of fictional individuals. Grossman later summarized the idea as [...] "a series of short speeches from people, that when put together, gave you a history of a place." [...] The removal of conversations was an attempt by the team to make the game a more [...] "integrated whole" [...] than was Ultima Underworld--one with a greater focus on immersion, atmosphere and [...] "the feeling of 'being there'". They sought to [...] "plunge [...] into the fiction and never provide an opportunity for breaking that fiction"; and so they tried to erase the distinction between plot and exploration. Church considered this direction to be an organic progression from Ultima Underworld, and he later said, [...] "On some level it's still just a dungeon simulator, and we're still just trying to evolve that idea." [...] Shortly before production began, Tribe bassist Greg LoPiccolo was contracted to work on the game's music. He had visited his friend Rex Bradford at the company, and was spontaneously asked by the game's programmers—many of whom were fans of the band—if he would take the role. The game entered production in February 1993. Although Grossman was heavily involved in the game's early planning, he had little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> production, aside from providing assistance with writing and voice acting.|$|E
