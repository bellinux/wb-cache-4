Apart from plant-based materials (such as sisal, hemp, jute, bamboo and palm fibre), animal-based fibre is a kind of sustainable natural materials for making novel composites. Silkworm silk fibre extracted from cocoon has been well recognized as a promising material for bio-medical engineering applications because of its superior mechanical and bioresorbable properties. However, when producing silk fibre reinforced biodegradable/bioresorbable polymer composites, hydrophilic sericin has been found to cause poor interfacial bonding with most polymers and thus, it results in affecting the resultant properties of the composites. Besides, sericin layers on fibroin surface may also cause an adverse effect towards biocompatibility and hypersensitivity to silk for implant applications. Therefore, a proper pre-treatment should be done for sericin removal. Degumming is a surface modification process which allows a wide control of the silk fibre's properties, making the silk fibre possible to be used for the development and production of novel bio-composites with unique/specific mechanical and biodegradable properties.

40|$|Background: The flower bug Orius sauteri is an {{important}} polyphagous predator that is widely used for the biological control of mites and aphids. However, the optimal conditions for mass rearing of this insect are still unclear, thus limiting its application. Methodology: In this study, we investigated the optimal ingredients of an artificial diet for raising O. sauteri using a microencapsulation technique. The ingredients included egg yolk (vitellus), whole-pupa homogenate of the <b>Tussah</b> <b>silk</b> moth (Antheraea paphia), honey, sucrose, rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen and sinkaline. We tested 25 combinations of the above ingredients using an orthogonal experimental design.

Principal Findings: The results showed that, although different artificial diet formats significantly influenced the development and reproductive ability of O. sauteri, the complete development of O. sauteri to sexual maturity could only be achieved by optimizing the artificial diet according to specific biological characters. In general, pupae of A. paphia had more influence on O sauteri development than did artificial components.

40|$|Silkworm {{silk fibre}} is {{one kind of}} well {{recognized}} animal fibres for bio-medical engineering and surgical operation applications because of its mechanical, biocompatible and bio-resorbable properties. Recently, the use of natural fibre as reinforcement for bio-polymers to enhance the stiffnesses of scaffolds and bone fixators has been a hot research topic. However, their mechanical and biodegradable properties {{have not yet been}} fully understood by many researchers, scientists and bio-medical engineers although these properties would govern the usefulness of resultant products. Considering the increasing demand and potential use of biodegradable and bioresorbable polymers in coming centuries, elevated environmental awareness of the general public in reducing carbon footprints and non-naturally decomposed solid waste, as well as foreseeable drawbacks of using metallic materials for biomedical engineering, a comprehensive study on the mechanical and materials properties of a silkworm silk fibre reinforced Polylactic acid (PLA) composite is conducted through experimental and theoretical approaches in this project. Current study aims at investigating various properties of degummed and non- degummed silkworm silk fibres and, the effect on the mechanical and thermal properties and biodegradability of their reinforced PLA composites. An extensive review is provided to introduce the properties of the natural fibres and degradable polymers. Some critical issues including poor wettability, biodegradability and bonding properties at the fibre/matrix interface and, damage of the fibre during the manufacturing processes which are the main causes of the reduction of the composites‟ strength are addressed. Furthermore, different manufacturing processes and their suitability for natural fibre composites, based on the materials, mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres and matrics are discussed in detail. The potential applications on the degradable fibre reinforced polymer composites are also addressed. Following the comprehensive review, results obtained from preliminary experimental studies are given. The hybridization of a glass fibre reinforced composite is achieved by using short silkworm silk fibre as a medium to enhance its cross-ply strength. The comparison on the tensile and impact properties of the glass fibre composite reinforced by the short silkworm silk fibre with a neat glass fibre composite sample is conducted. Experimental results indicated that the higher Young's modulus and ductility index (DI) of a silkworm silk fibre reinforced glass fibre composite was obtained as compared with the neat sample. Moreover, the visual examination on drop-weight test samples proved that the impact resistance of the silkworm silk fibre reinforced glass fibre composite was better than that of the neat sample as well. Nevertheless, as the non-fully biodegradable issue rose from the ultilization of glass fabrics and resin, the combination of the silkworm silk fibre and a biodegradable polymer- PLA is chosen for the following study. Mechanical properties of different silkworm silk fibres including Bombyx mori, twisted Bombyx mori, and <b>Tussah</b> <b>silk</b> fibres were investigated. Their ultimate tensile strength, elongation at break, and Young's modulus were examined by performing a uniaxial tensile test on a single fibre. The apparent diameters of the silkworm silk fibres were measured for stress-strain analysis. Based on the experimental results, it was found that <b>Tussah</b> <b>silk</b> fibre has a relatively high extensibility as compared to Bombyx mori silk fibre. When producing a biodegradable silkworm silk fibre reinforced PLA composite, hydrophilic sericin has been found to cause poor interfacial bonding with most polymers and thus, it results in affecting the resultant properties of the composite. Besides, a sericin layer on fibrils surface may also cause an adverse effect toward biocompatibility and hypersensitivity to silkworm silk fibre for implant applications. Therefore, degumming should be done for sericin removal. Different degumming processes and their influences on silkworm silk fibre are discussed. The effectiveness of degumming parameters including degumming time and temperature on <b>Tussah</b> <b>silk</b> by using boiling water are discussed. Based on the results obtained, {{it was found that the}} mechanical properties of <b>Tussah</b> <b>silk</b> are affected by the degumming time due to the change of fibre structure and fibrils alignment. It was also found that the degumming time has a little effect on the thermal properties and the secondary structure of the fibre. Besides, silkworm silk fibre was degummed by different concentrations of NaHCO 3 (Sodium Bicarbonate) solution to study its tensile properties. Measurement of weight loss, tensile property test and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analysis were conducted to elucidate the effect of NaHCO 3 to the fibre. Experimental results revealed that the disruption of hydrogen bonds (water effect) dominated the effect of the fibre at low NaHCO 3 concentration. Increasing the concentration of NaHCO 3 resulted in increasing the pH level and thus, distorted the binding force between fibrils of the fibre. DSC analysis revealed that the fibre degummed in the solution over 5 wt% NaHCO 3 requires higher energy for melt and thermal decomposition from their crystalline states. However, using NaHCO 3 would minimize the risk of damage of silkworm silk fibrils as compared with commonly used strong alkali solutions for degumming. A microbond test of the composite was conducted to investigate the bonding effect of the silkworm silk fibre with/ without the sericin layer. The results showed that the fibres degummed by both processes increased the interfacial shear strength. A novel biodegradable composite for biomedical engineering applications was developed by mixing chopped silkworm silk fibre and PLA through the injection moulding process. A study on the mechanical properties and biodegradability of a silkworm silk fibre reinforced PLA composite was conducted. It was found that the Young's and flexural moduli of the composite increased with the use of silkworm silk fibre as reinforcement while their tensile and flexural strengths decreased. This phenomenon is attributed to the disruption of inter- and intra- molecular bonding on the silkworm silk fibre with PLA during the mixing process, and consequent reduction of the strength of the composite. Bio-degradability tests showed that the silkworm silk fibre altered the biodegradable properties of the composite as compared with a pristine PLA sample. The initial storage modulus of the composite increased while its glass transition temperature decreased as compared with the PLA sample. Besides, the coefficient of linear thermal expansions (CLTE) of the composite was reduced by 28 %. This phenomenon was attributed to the fibre-matrix interaction that restricted the mobility of polymer chains to adhere to the fibre surface, and consequently reduced the Tg and CLTE. As compared with the composite, it was found that the degraded composite exhibited lower initial storage modulus, loss modulus and tan delta (Tan(δ)) but the Tg had higher than that of a non-degraded sample. A linear, elastic and isotropic theoretical model to evaluate the differential stress between a core fibre and a sericin layer with different thicknesses of the layer is firstly introduced in this report. The influence of moisture absorption during the early degradation stage, on shear stress between the fibre and the sericin is also discussed. Finally, concluding remarks and the suggestions for the further study in the development of the silkworm silk fibre reinforced PLA composite for fracture bone fixator are addressed. ...|$|E
40|$|Silk {{in ancient}} Africa? Most {{of us think}} of ancient Africans {{as members of a}} tribe, living by {{subsistence}} farming or herding, in villages of grass houses. But Nubia, the ancient Kush, located along the Nile in southern Egypt and {{the northern part of the}} Sudan, (Fig. l) was inhabited by an African people who, by 1800 BC, had developed their own high civilization. The Kushites were suppliers of ivory, ebony, gold, ostrich feathers, animal skins, and slaves to ancient Egypt and elsewhere in the Mediterranean world. In exchange they received a wide variety of manufactured goods. By the fourth century AD the center of Kushite power had moved from much farther 9 south to the northern part of Nubia. Although the Kushites at that time were illiterate, the economy of their kingdom was based largely on trade with Byzantine Egypt. Animal products, ebony, gold, and slaves were sent north, and in exchange, luxury manufactured goods were traded into Nubia. Among the bronzes, glass vessels, carpets, and wine imported into Nubia, we also find silk. Late Classical Period: 300 - 500 AD. The earliest silk specimens found so far in Nubia are dated between 300 - 500 AD. Two examples come from Qustul (Fig. 1), a royal cemetery whose barbaric splendor stunned the archaeological world when it was discovered in 1931. The many- chambered tombs were constructed like houses, with rooms full of furnishings. The most surprising finding was the large number of human and animal sacrifices, a practice abandoned in Egypt for 3000 years. The wealth and power of the royal family was evident from the amount and quality of jewelry, silver horse trappings, silver and bronze vessels, tools, games, bronze tables, tripods and folding chairs, lamps, leather work, glass, weighing instruments, and textiles. We have no structural descriptions of the two Qustul silks, only their colors. One was red and yellowish, the other was black and the same yellow color.
