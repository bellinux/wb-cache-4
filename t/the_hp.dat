40|$|Protein D is a surface-exposed {{lipoprotein}} of the {{gram-negative bacterium}} Haemophilus influenzae with affinity for human immunoglobulin D myeloma protein. The gene encoding protein D (hpd) in a serotype b strain of H. influenzae was cloned. Escherichia coli carrying <b>the</b> <b>hpd</b> gene bound human myeloma immunoglobulin D. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified an 1, 092 -bp {{open reading frame}} {{that was more than}} 99 % identical to <b>the</b> <b>hpd</b> gene from a nontypeable H. influenzae strain. In the deduced amino acid sequences for protein D, only 2 of 364 amino acid residues differed. The restriction fragment length polymorphism of <b>the</b> <b>hpd</b> region in different strains was analyzed by Southern blot analyses of PstI- or EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from 100 H. influenzae strains. The analysis was performed by using isolated fragments of <b>the</b> cloned <b>hpd</b> gene, originating from the nontypeable H. influenzae 772, as probes. All strains tested had DNA sequences {{with a high degree of}} homology to <b>the</b> <b>hpd</b> probes. <b>The</b> analysis also showed that restriction endonuclease sites within the gene were more conserved than sites adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>hpd</b> gene. An interesting difference between type b strains and unencapsulated strains was observed. The majority of type b strains seem to have a 1. 4 -kbp DNA fragment upstream of <b>the</b> <b>hpd</b> gene that is absent in nontypeable strains. On the basis of the high degree of conservation of <b>the</b> <b>hpd</b> gene among H. influenzae strains, we conclude that protein D is a possible vaccine candidate...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} diversity of protein D of nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae strains isolated from persistently infected {{patients with chronic}} bronchitis was studied by sequencing <b>the</b> <b>hpd</b> gene of four independently obtained isolates.

5|$|In an {{analysis}} of its components, IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16GB model of the Nexus7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 more per unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>HP</b> TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E
5|$|Sora, {{along with}} his allies, both possess a Hit Point (HP) meter and a Magic Point (MP) meter, which {{increase}} as they gain experience and level up. The MP meter is divided into various sections that are used up whenever that character performs magic, with more powerful magic using more MP. MP can be replenished by performing melee attacks or using items. <b>The</b> <b>HP</b> meter determines the character's health, reducing whenever a character takes damage, although it can be replenished by using healing items or spells. If one of Sora's allies runs out of health, they will be knocked out temporarily until someone heals them. However, if Sora loses all of his health, the game ends and the player must resume play {{from the beginning of}} an area or boss.

40|$|Abstract Background Hydrophobic protein from soybean (HPS) is an 8 kD cysteine-rich {{polypeptide}} {{that causes}} asthma in persons allergic to soybean dust. HPS is synthesized in the pod endocarp and deposited on the seed surface during development. Past {{evidence suggests that}} the protein may mediate the adherence or dehiscence of endocarp tissues during maturation and affect the lustre, or glossiness of the seed surface. Results A comparison of soybean germplasm by genomic DNA blot hybridization shows that the copy number and structure of <b>the</b> <b>Hps</b> locus is polymorphic among soybean cultivars and related species. Changes in Hps gene copy number were also detected by comparative genomic DNA hybridization using cDNA microarrays. <b>The</b> <b>Hps</b> copy number polymorphisms co-segregated with seed lustre phenotype and HPS surface protein in a cross between dull- and shiny-seeded soybeans. In soybean cultivar Harosoy 63, a minimum of 27 ± 5 copies of <b>the</b> <b>Hps</b> gene were estimated to be present in each haploid genome. The isolation and analysis of genomic clones indicates that <b>the</b> core <b>Hps</b> locus is comprised of a tandem array of reiterated units, with each 8. 6 kb unit containing a single HPS open reading frame. Conclusion This study shows that polymorphisms at <b>the</b> <b>Hps</b> locus arise from changes in the gene copy number via gene amplification. We present a model whereby Hps copy number modulates protein expression levels and seed lustre, and we suggest that gene amplification may result from selection pressures imposed on crop plants. </p...|$|R
