5|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, Kanō combined the throwing {{techniques of the}} Kitō-ryū and the choking and pinning techniques of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū. As such, judo's Koshiki no Kata preserves the <b>traditional</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> the Kitō-ryū with only minor differences from the mainline tradition. Similarly, many of the techniques (but not the forms) of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū are preserved in the Kime no Kata.|$|E
5|$|In this, the milieu is {{interested}} in developing unified world views to discover {{the nature of the}} divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement—most notably Fritjof Capra in his The Tao of Physics (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and <b>traditional</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Joehana {{appears to}} have been {{familiar}} with the traditional literatures of Maritime Southeast Asia, drawing on the Ramayana for Nangis Wibisana. Wayang characters such as the clown Cepot are referred to in his writings, and he draws on traditional Sundanese storytelling techniques, such as the pantun form of poetry common in wayang golek performances. However, there are significant shifts. His writings depart from the <b>traditional</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> literature such as wawacan, instead embracing the novel, a European literary form. Unlike the formal language used in traditional literature, Joehana wrote in everyday Sundanese. The grammar and structure shows evidence of influence from other languages, and the vocabulary is likewise not purely Sundanese; some Dutch (the language of the colonial government) is mixed in.|$|E

5|$|Ragnall disappears from record {{after he}} and his sons were {{defeated}} by his brother Áengus. Ragnall's death-date is unknown, although certain dates between 1191 and 1227 are all possibilities. Surviving contemporary sources reveal that Ragnall was a significant patron of the Church. Although his father appears to have aligned himself with <b>traditional</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> Christianity, Ragnall himself is associated with newer reformed religious orders from the continent. Ragnall's now non-existent seal, which pictured a knight on horseback, also indicates that he attempted to present himself as an up-to-date ruler, not unlike his Anglo-French contemporaries of the bordering Kingdom of Scots.|$|E
5|$|A study {{undertaken}} between 1999 and 2001 in New Zealand by lexicographers Laurie and Winifred Bauer on <b>traditional</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> play included truce terms. The terms {{they described}} {{in their study}} were regional and the most common were pegs (widespread), twigs (Taranaki), gates (Auckland), tags (Nelson Marlborough), and nibs (Otago-Southland). In Wellington schools the dominant term was fans, recorded in New Zealand before 1920, which the authors state derives from fains or fain it as described by the Opies, itself dating back to Chaucerian times. The most widespread term was pegs, derived from pax. Apparently unrecorded before World War II this appears to have first changed to pags, probably from being shouted out at length, and then further mutated by virtue of broad New Zealand accents to pegs. The Bauers thought the most likely hypothesis {{for the use of}} this rather upper class term from the UK, was that it derived from books and stories about UK public schools. Similarly they thought nibs derived from nix, possibly via nigs, originally from South Africa though unknown to the Opies save for a very small area of nicks possibly from nicklas. Nix is also UK public school slang though not as a truce term. Nixs and flix were recorded as having been described by a South African boy as prevalent in South Africa, and were thought by a South African linguist to have derived from an Afrikaans term.|$|E

Originally performed to mark important agricultural occasions, yangge had been adapted by the CPC for its own uses as a propaganda tool. Performances often helped relieve tensions between {{the party and the}} peasantry during times when food was scarce, although during the more repressive period of the Cultural Revolution, yangge was itself banned along with many other <b>traditional</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> expression.|$|E
25|$|As fashions {{changed over}} time, the Quaker ideal of plain dress stood out against {{contemporary}} clothing.

They may also try to buy only the clothing they need, and pay more for fairly traded clothing that has been made ethically.|$|E

Actual charge offs are no more frequent than with <b>traditional</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> credit, as the majority of payday loans are rolled over into new loans repeatedly without any payment applied to the original principal.|$|E
