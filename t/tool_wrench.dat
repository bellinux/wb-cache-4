Though overall energy efficiency of pneumatics tools is low and they require access to a compressed-air source, there are several advantages over electric tools. They offer greater power density (a smaller pneumatic motor can provide the same amount of power as a larger electric motor), do not require an auxiliary speed controller (adding to its compactness), generate less heat, and can be used in more volatile atmospheres as they do not require electric power [...] and do not create sparks. They can be loaded to stop with full torque without damages.|$|R

50|$|An {{impact socket}} wrench is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool {{with a female}} opening to fit over a nut or bolt head, and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an Impact wrench or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the driving tool {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection). The use of power <b>tools</b> and ratchet <b>wrenches</b> with sockets makes tightening and removing bolts incredibly easy over alternative methods like combination wrenches and other manual methods.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered socket wrenches which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered <b>tools</b> are impact <b>wrenches</b> {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.|$|R
40|$|In a {{chilling}} experiment conducted by Keith Payne, when primed {{with pictures of}} Blacks, participants more often misclassify a <b>tool</b> (pliers, <b>wrench,</b> or adrill) asagun,comparedwithsubjectswhohavebeenprimedwithpictures of Whites. 1 From this result, we know that whatever psychological state the prime puts the subjects in, it influences their answers on the classification task. But how is their visual experience affected? How do the pliers look to the subjects, when they see them? The experiment does not speak directly to this question. There are several (combinable) options. A first option is cognitive penetration: subjectsseethe pliers, but nonetheless the pliers look to them like a gun, whereas to subjects given the Whites prime the pliers have their normal appearance. A different option is that the prime generates a selection effect, whichcaninfluenceeither the content of experience, or the role of experience. In selection of features for experience, subjectsseethepliers,butduetotheprime,theyattendonlyto those features that pliers share with guns, such as being metallic and shiny. Here they have neither a pliers-experience nor a gun-experience, but rather an experience with more impoverished contents, and they end up jumping {{to the conclusion that}} it is a gun. Adifferentselectioneffectisanti-selection of experience for uptake. Here,when participants see the pliers, they look just like pliers, but due to the prime, this experience is ignored when subjects form the belief that the stimulus was a gun.

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket wrenches include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking <b>wrench</b> <b>tools</b> with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R
40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the spanner nuts required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque <b>wrench</b> <b>tool</b> adapter that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face spanner wrench, contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut...|$|R
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Servicing Missions have {{demonstrated}} that extravehicular activity (EVA) power tools need a hand (non-powered) ratcheting capability to accomplish delicate and unforeseen tasks. Depending on the pitch, or spacing of the teeth on a conventional ratcheting hand socket wrench, sometimes more then 1 / 8 th of a turn in the backward direction can be required to engage the next tooth. This minimum motion requirement of the ratcheting device causes the wrench to work inefficiently in confined spaces. Furthermore, the bulkiness of an astronaut’s space suit and gloves causes additional range-of-motion problems when ratcheting <b>wrench</b> <b>tools</b> are used for EVA tasks. Therefore, removing the ratchet from the design can increase the usability of future EVA tools. No successful ratchet-less wrench has been developed to date. However, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has developed and patented a special three dimensional (3 -D) roller locking Sprag technology that, when used {{in place of the}} traditional ratcheting mechanism, results in a device with infinite indexibility and infinitely small range-of-motion. This unique geometry permits construction of compact locking mechanisms that can withstand large loads because the Sprags are very small but have large contact radii and therefore, low contact stress. During the summer of 1997, GSFC developed and tested the use of this 3 -D sprag technology in commercial hand “ratcheting ” tools to create a commercial “ratchetless ” Sprag wrench. The Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) at the University of Maryland is extending this commercial Sprag wrench development to EVA tools. In order for the Sprag mechanism to become an EVA tool it must first be tested in a weightless environment to evaluate performance when used for certain tasks. During the two week period from March 21 st to April 4 th a tea...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or {{electric impact wrench}} or impact driver to deliver the amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an impact wrench there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The impact wrench is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical impact wrenches deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger impact wrenches such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] across flats. Even if the socket attached to the impact wrench does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the impact wrench's internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. Impact wrenches are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with hand ratchet <b>wrench</b> <b>tool</b> sets are not suitable for this kind of high load impact application. Hand sockets, when used with an impact wrench, can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an impact wrench. Impact sockets are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most impact sockets made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many impact sockets are made with swivel type socket—socket wrench attachment geometry. These impact sockets are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, impact sockets are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard impact wrench use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with impact wrenches, impact sockets can be used with hand socket wrenches and other hand drivers.|$|R
