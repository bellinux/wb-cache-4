25|$|In April 1959 Iran {{altered the}} legal status of the strait by {{expanding}} its <b>territorial</b> <b>sea</b> to 12-nautical-mile (22km) and declaring that it would recognize only transit by innocent passage through the newly expanded area. In July 1972, Oman expanded its <b>territorial</b> <b>sea</b> to 12nm by decree. Thus, by mid-1972, the Strait of Hormuz was completely “closed” by the combined territorial waters of Iran and Oman. During the 1970s, neither Iran or Oman attempted to impede the passage of warships through the strait, but in the 1980s, both countries asserted claims that were different with customary (old) law. Upon ratifying UNCLOS in August 1989, Oman submitted declarations confirming its 1981 royal decree that only innocent passage is permitted through its <b>territorial</b> <b>sea.</b> The declarations further asserted that prior permission was required before foreign warships could pass through Omani territorial waters. Upon signing the convention in December 1982, Iran entered a declaration stating “that only states parties to the Law of the Sea Convention shall be entitled to benefit from the contractual rights created therein”, including “the right of transit passage through straits used for international navigation”. In May 1993, Iran enacted a comprehensive law on maritime areas, several provisions of which conflict with UNCLOS provisions, including a requirement that warships, submarines, and nuclear-powered ships obtain permission before exercising innocent passage through Iran’s territorial waters.The United States does not recognize any of the claims by Oman and Iran and has contested each of them.|$|E

50|$|In a {{separate}} opinion, Judge Álvarez argued that warships were {{not entitled to}} innocent passage except where such passage was {{to take part in}} a UN enforcement action. Judge Krylov's dissenting opinion argued that there was no customary international law allowing passage, and that straits could be regulated by the coastal state. Judge Azevedo also dissented, arguing that <b>territorial</b> <b>seas</b> within international straits were treated the same as any other <b>territorial</b> <b>seas,</b> but that a special regime was needed for international straits.|$|R
25|$|The {{national}} territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, {{with all the}} islands and waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial, and aerial domains, including its <b>territorial</b> <b>sea,</b> the seabed, the subsoil, the insular shelves, and other submarine areas. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Generally, a state's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} is an area beyond and adjacent to the <b>territorial</b> <b>sea,</b> extending seaward to a distance {{of no more than}} 200 nautical miles (370km) out from its coastal baseline. The exception to this rule occurs when {{exclusive economic zone}}s would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nautical miles (740km) apart. When an overlap occurs, {{it is up to the}} states to delineate the actual maritime boundary. Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.|$|E

Dumping of foreign radioactive waste and development of nuclear weapons {{in the country is}} outlawed. Despite common misconception, this act does not make nuclear power plants illegal, nor does it make radioactive medical treatments produced in overseas reactors illegal. A 2008 survey shows that 19% of New Zealanders favour nuclear power as the best energy source, while 77% prefer wind power as the best energy source.|$|E
25|$|The {{continental}} shelf claim {{limit of the}} two countries do not coincide because of the different maritime baselines each country uses to calculate the equidistant line. This has resulted in an area of overlapping claims. The Vietnamese {{continental shelf}} limit was proclaimed in 1971 by the then South Vietnamese government and was the equidistant line between the Malaysian and Vietnamese mainlands without taking into account offshore islands. Malaysia's claim is made through a <b>territorial</b> <b>sea</b> and continental shelf map published by its Mapping and Survey Department in 1979 showing the boundary, drawn as the equidistant line between Malaysia's Redang Island and the Vietnamese shore, ignoring islands off its coast.|$|E
25|$|A state's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} starts at the seaward edge of its <b>territorial</b> <b>sea</b> and extends outward to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370.4km) from the baseline. The {{exclusive economic zone}} stretches much further into sea than the territorial waters, which end at 12 nmi (22km) from the coastal baseline (if following the rules {{set out in the}} UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). Thus, the exclusive economic zones includes the contiguous zone. States also have rights to the seabed of what is called the continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles (648km) from the coastal baseline, beyond the exclusive economic zones, but such areas are not part of their exclusive economic zones. The legal definition of the continental shelf does not directly correspond to the geological meaning of the term, as it also includes the continental rise and slope, and the entire seabed within the exclusive economic zone.|$|E

25|$|A marine {{border dispute}} with Russia in the Barents Sea since 1978 was settled when Stoltenberg and President of Russia Dimitry Medvedev signed an {{agreement}} on 27 April 2010 in Oslo. The agreement is a compromise, which divides a disputed area of around 175,000 km2 (68,000 sq mi) into two approximately equally sized parts. However, the agreement still needs ratification by the State Duma and the Parliament of Norway {{in order to be}} implemented. Whereas Norway had previously insisted on a border in accordance with the equidistance principle, which is recognized in international law, specifically the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea Article 15 and the Convention on the <b>Territorial</b> <b>Sea</b> and the Contiguous Zone Article 6, Russia invoked a Stalin-era decree of the Soviet Union from 1926, which was not recognised by any other country. The new agreement replaced a controversial temporary agreement negotiated by Jens Evensen and Arne Treholt, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy and who aided the Soviet Union in the negotiations. Most of the disputed area was within what would normally be considered Norwegian according to the relevant international treaties.|$|E
25|$|Tiwari {{was one of}} {{the first}} legal {{officers}} who specialized in public international law when the International Affairs Division of the Attorney-General's Chambers was established. He was part of the Singapore team to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and helped to frame important provisions in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which Singapore acceded to on 17 November 1994. He also headed negotiations which culminated in the signing of a pact in 1994 delineating a new boundary between Malaysia and Singapore in the Straits of Johor. Tiwari was on Singapore's legal team in a case brought by Malaysia to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for provisional measures against alleged damage to its territorial waters due to land reclamation by Singapore in Tuas. On 8 October 2003, the Tribunal declined to prescribe provisional measures, stating that Malaysia had not shown that there was a situation of urgency or any risk that its rights to its <b>territorial</b> <b>sea</b> would suffer irreversible damage pending consideration of the merits of the case. Having been involved in the territorial dispute between Singapore and Malaysia over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge for almost 30 years, including leading bilateral negotiations to attempt a settlement and later to conclude the special agreement submitting the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), he was part of the team that presented Singapore's case before the ICJ in 2007. The following year, the Court ruled that Singapore had sovereignty over Pedra Branca. Tiwari was also legal adviser to the delegation which negotiated the agreement establishing diplomatic relations between Singapore and the People's Republic of China, and was a member of the Hindu Endowments Board (from 2 May 1983), the Hindu Advisory Board which advises the Government and the Hindu Endowments Board on matters relating to the Hindu religion and custom, and the board of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.|$|E
500|$|On 21 July 2008, in {{response}} to questions from Singapore Members of Parliament about Pedra Branca, the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Balaji Sadasivan stated that the maritime territory around the island included a <b>territorial</b> <b>sea</b> of up to [...] and an Exclusive Economic Zone. This was condemned by Malaysia's Foreign Minister Rais Yatim as [...] "against the spirit of Asean and the legal structure" [...] as the claim was [...] "unacceptable and unreasonable and contradicts the principles of international law". In response, a Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Singapore first stated its claim to a <b>territorial</b> <b>sea</b> and Exclusive Economic Zone on 15 September 1980, and reiterated this claim on 23 May 2008 following the ICJ's judgment. Both statements had made clear that if the limits of Singapore's <b>territorial</b> <b>sea</b> or Exclusive Economic Zone overlapped with the claims of neighbouring countries, Singapore would negotiate with those countries to arrive at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law. In August 2008, Rais said Malaysia took the view that Singapore was not entitled to claim an Exclusive Economic Zone around Pedra Branca as it considered that the maritime feature did not meet internationally recognised criteria for an island, that is, land inhabited by humans that had economic activity.|$|E
