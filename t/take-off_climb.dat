40|$|In general, {{jet engines}} operate with choked nozzle during <b>take-off,</b> <b>climb</b> and cruise, whereas unchoking occurs while landing and taxiing (when engine is not running at full power). Appropriate thrust in an {{aircraft}} in {{all stages of}} the flight, i. e., <b>take-off,</b> <b>climb,</b> cruise, descent and landing is achieved through variation in the nozzle exit area. This paper describes the effect on thrust and IR radiance of a turbojet engine due to variation in the exit area of a just choked converging nozzle (M-e = 1). The variations in the nozzle exit area result in either choking or unchoking of a just choked converging nozzle. Results for the change in nozzle exit area are analyzed in terms of thrust, mass flow rate and specific fuel consumption. The solid angle subtended (Omega) by the exhaust system is estimated analytically, for the variation in nozzle exit area (A(ne)), as it affects the visibility of the hot engine parts from the rear aspect. For constant design point thrust, IR radiance is studied from the boresight (phi = theta degrees, directly from the rear side) for various percentage changes in nozzle exit area (%Delta A(ne)), in the 1. 9 - 2. 9 mu m and 3 - 5 ism bands.

30|$|The VarMission {{software}} considers taxiing on the ground, <b>take-off,</b> <b>climb,</b> {{cruise and}} descent flight phases. The fuel consumption of a flight is calculated iteratively, reducing the aircraft mass (due to fuel burn) in each calculation step. Since the take-off mass of a flight is initially unknown, the program performs the calculation process “backwards”, i.e. starting with the aircraft’s empty weight plus payload, considering reserve fuel quantities and analysing all flight phases in reverse order. The flight distance of each flight was estimated by applying an empirical “inefficiency” factor to the great-circle distance between origin and destination airports.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, some effort {{is made to}} {{identify}} whether empennage buffet is a relevant factor {{in the design and}} operation of the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). Based on some results of the only operational supersonic transport, Concorde and the innumerable studies that exist on the tail buffet of high performance airplanes, CFD analyses on the HSCT as well as low speed wind tunnel tests on models, it appears as though buffet will be a factor that needs attention in the proper design of empennage structure. Utilizing the existing empirical relation between the reduced frequency of the leading edge vortices and the geometric parameters, it is estimated that the characteristic frequencies of the vortices from the wing cranks are in the range of certain fundamental frequencies of the wing-fuselage-empennage structure. Buffet is believed to be critical during <b>take-off,</b> <b>climb,</b> descent and landing. Computational and experimental data available in open literature indicate coherent vortex flow structure in the empennage region at supersonic cruise speeds.

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} such as the depletion {{of the ozone layer}} and air pollution demand a change in traditional means of propulsion that is sensitive to the ecology. Solar powered propulsion is a favorable alternative that is both ecologically harmless as well as cost effective. Integration of solar energy into designs ranging from futuristic vehicles to heating is beneficial to society. The design and construction of a Multi-Purpose Remotely Piloted Vehicle (MPRPV) seeks to verify the feasibility of utilizing solar propulsion as a primary fuel source. This task has been a year long effort by a group of ten students, divided into five teams, each dealing with different aspects of the design. The aircraft was designed to <b>take-off,</b> <b>climb</b> to the design altitude, fly in a sustained figure-eight flight path, and cruise for approximately one hour. This mission requires flight at Reynolds numbers between 150, 000 and 200, 000 and demands special considerations in the aerodynamic design in order to achieve flight in this regime. Optimal performance requires a light weight configuration with both structural integrity and maximum power availability. The structure design and choice of solar cells for the propulsion was governed by the weight, efficiency, and cost considerations. The final design is a MPRPV weighting 35 N which cruises 7 m/s at the design altitude of 50 m. The configuration includes a wing composed of balsa and foam NACA 6409 airfoil sections and carbon fiber spars, a tail of similar construction, and a truss structure fuselage.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. The {{operation}} of fast jet military aircraft spans a large flight and atmospheric envelope. This {{study is the}} analysis of an avionic thermal management system for a typical fast jet military aircraft across changing operating conditions. The system which governs avionic module temperature is only partially active; therefore the efficiency and heat rejection capability is almost completely dependent on the system inputs of flight and atmospheric conditions. The thermal sensitivity to variation in system inputs is assessed {{with the use of}} experimental testing, one-dimensional thermodynamic modelling and energy flow calculations. The avionic module is the final component of the thermal management flow path and to understand the performance at component level, every subsystem upstream must be considered through a complete systemic approach. The facility used to deliver this analysis considers the total system energy consumption, Environmental Control System (ECS), cabin and three avionic subsystems as a single airflow path. The system is subjected to a typical fast jet flight profile, including a <b>take-off,</b> <b>climb,</b> cruise, combat, landing and ground operation cases. The flight profile is considered across three atmospheric conditions; ISA standard, hot and cold. It is found that the system heat rejection is stable with variations in flight conditions; therefore the system efficiency is inversely proportion to total energy consumption. The highest system efficiency is delivered at high altitude low load cruise conditions, with the lowest efficiency found at high speed low attitude flight. The system is most efficient when thermal safety factor is lowest. This is hot atmospheric and low load conditions, where the ECS bypass flow rate is low and avionic module exhaust temperatures are high. The ground ops condition in a hot atmosphere is the worst case scenario for avionic module exhaust and cabin temperatures. Considerable system gains could be made by introducing an element of active control, such as limiting bleed and ram air consumption when avionic temperatures are low and ECS bypass flow rate is high...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{aerodynamics}} optimisation of a generic two-dimensional three element high-lift configuration. Although the high-lift system is applied only during take-off and landing in the low speed phase of the flight the cost efficiency of the airplane is strongly influenced by it [1]. The ultimate goal of an aircraft high lift system design team is to define the simplest configuration which, for prescribed constraints, will meet the <b>take-off,</b> <b>climb,</b> and landing requirements usually {{expressed in terms of}} maximum L/D and/or maximum CL. The ability of the calculation method to accurately predict changes in objective function value when gaps, overlaps and element deflections are varied is therefore critical. Despite advances in computer capacity, the enormous computational cost of running complex engineering simulations makes it impractical to rely exclusively on simulation for the purpose of design optimisation. To cut down the cost, surrogate models, also known as metamodels, are constructed from and then used in place of the actual simulation models. This work outlines the development of integrated systems to perform aerodynamics multi-objective optimisation for a three-element airfoil test case in high lift configuration, making use of surrogate models available in MACROS Generic Tools, which has been integrated in our design tool. Different metamodeling techniques have been compared based on multiple performance criteria. With MACROS is possible performing either optimisation of the model built with predefined training sample (GSO) or Iterative Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO).
