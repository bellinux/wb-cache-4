25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to <b>turn</b> <b>smoothly</b> for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|E
25|$|To tune a violin, the A string {{is first}} tuned to a {{standard}} pitch (usually 440Hz). (When accompanying or playing with a fixed-pitch instrument such as a piano or accordion, the violin tunes to it.) The other strings are then tuned {{against each other in}} intervals of perfect fifths by bowing them in pairs. A minutely higher tuning is sometimes employed for solo playing to give the instrument a brighter sound; conversely, Baroque music is sometimes played using lower tunings to make the violin's sound more gentle. After tuning, the instrument's bridge may be examined to ensure that it is standing straight and centered between the inner nicks of the f-holes; a crooked bridge may significantly affect the sound of an otherwise well-made violin. After extensive playing, the holes into which the tuning pegs are inserted can become worn, which can lead the peg to slip under tension. This can lead to the pitch of the string dropping, or if the peg becomes completely loose, to the string completely losing tension. A violin in which the tuning pegs are slipping needs to be repaired by a luthier or violin repairperson. Peg dope or peg compound, used regularly, can delay the onset of such wear, while allowing the pegs to <b>turn</b> <b>smoothly.</b>|$|E

50|$|Today alpine skis often {{feature a}} {{combination}} of rocker and camber. This is often subtle, with natural camber at the waist, and rocker at the tip and tail.

50|$|Vital to {{the sound}} and {{playability}} of the instrument is setup, which includes adjusting the neck angle if needed, fitting the pegs so they <b>turn</b> <b>smoothly</b> and hold firmly, dressing the fingerboard to the proper scooped shape, fitting the soundpost and bridge, adjusting the tailgut and installing the tailpiece, and stringing up. A removable chinrest may be put on at this time.|$|E
5000|$|Peg dope serves two {{different}} (and almost conflicting) purposes.

5000|$|NGC 1672 is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} located in the {{constellation}} Dorado. It was originally {{thought to be a}} member of the Dorado Group, however, this membership was later rejected. [...] NGC 1672 has a large bar which is estimated to measure around 20 kpc. [...] It has very strong radio emissions emanating from its nucleus, bar, and the inner portion of the spiral arm region. [...] The nucleus is Seyfert type 2 and is engulfed by a starburst region. The strongest polarized emissions come from the northeastern region which is upstream from its dust lanes.

50|$|Downhill skiing {{technique}} {{focuses on}} the use of <b>turns</b> to <b>smoothly</b> <b>turn</b> the skis from one direction to another. Additionally, the skier can use the same techniques to turn the ski away from the direction of movement, generating skidding forces between the skis and snow which further control the speed of the descent. Good technique results in a flowing motion from one descent angle to another one, adjusting the angle as needed to match changes in the steepness of the run. This looks more like a single series of S's than turns followed by straight sections.|$|R
5000|$|The Boot Room {{was also}} used for the {{training}} of future Liverpool managers. It became known as [...] "the Liverpool Way" [...] to promote from within so that the wheels would carry on <b>turning</b> <b>smoothly</b> {{in the event of}} a manager leaving. Paisley, Fagan and Ronnie Moran, who stepped in as caretaker manager on several occasions, were all trained in the Boot Room. Although Kenny Dalglish was not [...] "educated" [...] in the Boot Room, he realised the values that it brought and kept it during his tenure. The Boot Room was eventually demolished to make way for a press room during Graeme Souness' reign as manager in 1993. It produced yet another manager in Roy Evans when Souness left the club. Evans took over at the helm after a long education that began under Shankly. Contrary to popular belief the renovation of the boot room was a requirement rather than a request by Graeme Souness to demolish it.|$|R

50|$|Longboard {{bearings}} are {{all about}} reducing unnecessary friction to allow flawless stunt. Bearings connect the wheel to <b>turn</b> <b>smoothly.</b> Bearings can be made of many materials, including steel (which is most prevalent), titanium, or ceramics. Ceramic bearings are the most expensive. Bearings are usually rated in the ABEC scale. The ratings run from 1-9, using only odd numbers. The higher the rating, the more precise tolerances the bearing has been machined to. However, ABEC rating is not compulsory and not all bearings use ABEC ratings. Some companies will use other methods to describe the bearings' resistance and durability. Optionally, longboarders add bearing spacers between the bearings in the wheels. This allows for the axle nut to be tightened {{all the way down}} eliminating the high frequency wobbles and increasing the lifetime of the bearings.|$|E
50|$|Tightening a {{threadless}} headset requires {{tightening the}} preload bolt (or cap bolt) in {{the cap on}} the top of the stem. This bolt is connected to a star nut driven down into the steerer tube that acts as an anchor by gripping the inside of the steerer tube with a downward force. The star nut may be replaced by a self expanding wedge in some designs. The bolt compresses the stem down onto spacers, usually aluminum, which in turn compress the headset bearing cups. The preload bolt does not hold the fork onto the bike; after the preload is set, the stem bolts must be tightened to secure the fork in place. The adjustment must be made such that there is no play in the bearings, but allow the fork to <b>turn</b> <b>smoothly</b> without binding or excessive friction.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} human motion tracking from multiple image se-quences. The human body is described by five articulated mechanical chains and human body-parts are described by volumetric primitives with curved surfaces.

First, we describe a parameterization of an extremal-contour point velocity for the case of developable surfaces. Second, we use the zero-reference kinematic represen-tation and we derive an explicit formula that links extremal contour velocities to the angular velocities associated with the kinematic model.

Temporal retinal ganglion cell growth cones exposed to a localized collapsing stimulus from nasal retinal ganglion cell axons frequently <b>turn</b> <b>smoothly</b> away from the axons without collapsing. Turning is rare on contact with retinal axons that are unable to induce collapse. In a separate series of experiments, dorsal root ganglion growth cones tend {{to turn away from}} beads coated with a brain extract enriched for the motility-inhibiting protein collapsin. Many turns are accomplished with filopodial contact alone. Growth cones do not turn away from control beads coated with heat-inactivated collapsin.

40|$|A {{wideband}} strip-helical antenna with 1. 1 turns is analyzed numerically and experimentally. By {{replacing the}} traditional wire helix with wide metallic strip, the forward traveling current {{on the strip}} helix with about one <b>turn</b> <b>smoothly</b> decays to the minimum value at the open end of the helix. Therefore, the strip helix can excite a wideband circular polarization (CP) wave with 50 -ohm impedance matching. The proposed antenna is printed on a hollow-cylinder with a substrate relative permittivity of εr= 2. 2 and a thickness of h= 0. 5 [*]mm. A 50 [*]Ω coaxial cable is directly connected to excite the strip-helical antenna without any additional impedance matching section. The ground plane is placed below the antenna {{in order to provide}} a directional radiation pattern. To demonstrate this method, a prototype of 1. 1 -turn strip-helical antenna is tested.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a solidification sequence of graphite eutectic cells of A and D types, {{as well as}} globular and cementite eutectics. The morphology of eutectic cells in cast iron, the equations for their growth and the distances between the graphite precipitations in A and D eutectic types were analyzed. It is observed a critical eutectic growth rate at which one type of eutectic transformed into another. A mathematical formula was derived that combined the maximum degree of undercooling, the cooling rate of cast iron, eutectic cell count and the eutectic growth rate. One type of eutectic structure <b>turned</b> <b>smoothly</b> into the other at a particular transition rate, transformation temperature and transformational eutectic cell count. Inoculation of cast iron {{increased the number of}} eutectic cells with flake graphite and the graphite nodule count in ductile iron, while reducing the undercooling. An increase in intensity of inoculation caused a smooth transition from a cementite eutectic structure to a mixture of cementite and D type eutectic structure, then to a mixture of D and A types of eutectics up to the presence of only the A type of eutectic structure. Moreover, the mechanism of inoculation of cast iron was studied...|$|R

40|$|Until the 1950 s {{timekeeping}} {{was based}} on the apparent motion of the Sun that in turn reflected the rotation of the Earth on its axis.

The revolution began in June 1955 with the operation of the first successful atomic clock and was complete by October 1967 when the atomic second ousted the astronomical second as the international unit of time. Splitting the Second: The Story of Atomic Time presents the story of this revolution, explaining how atomic clocks work, how more than 200 of them are used to form the world's time, and why we need leap seconds.

This device has never been tested on any patient yet since it was a new design. Application of elbow hinge fixator is easy and effective in reducing contractures of the PIP joint by soft tissue distraction. An external elbow hinge fixators can be applied as a neutralization device after open or pericutaneous reduction. It will act as an active reduction device using universal hinge mechanisms between fixation blocks. Beside that it will also act as an external scaffold which incorporates the placement of multi-axial fixing element with shanz pin to apply force through humeral. The concept of fixation rod and multiaxial placement of pins is introduced. External elbow hinged fixators are used to provide some combination of easy mobilization, and stability, as well as gradual rotating elbow motion. In open procedure situations, the external elbow hinged fixator maintains a concentric motion of the humeral articulation throughout a full range of active elbow motion. During the postoperative period a controlled gradual stretch is applied using the stopper pin on the device.

40|$|The {{spiral galaxy}} NGC 6946 was {{observed}} in total intensity and linear polarization in five radio bands between 3 cm and 21 cm. At the inner edge of the inner gas spiral arm the ordered magnetic field is only mildly compressed and <b>turns</b> <b>smoothly,</b> to become aligned along the gas arm. Hence the field is not shocked and is probably connected to the warm, diffuse gas. At larger radii, two bright magnetic arms between the optical arms are visible in polarized intensity. The field in the northern magnetic arm is almost totally aligned. Faraday rotation measures (RM) in these arms {{are consistent with the}} superposition of two low azimuthal dynamo modes. Three more magnetic arms are discovered in the outer galaxy, located between HI arms. Due to strong Faraday depolarization the galaxy is not transparent to polarized waves at 18 cm and 20 cm. The large-scale asymmetry in depolarization with respect to the major axis may be another indication of large-scale helical fields. Three depolarization rings of almost zero polarization seen at 20 cm are probably generated by differential Faraday rotation in HII complexes in NGC 6946 of 300 - 500 pc size. - In the gas/optical spiral arms, the total (mostly turbulent) magnetic field is amplified to ≃ 20.
