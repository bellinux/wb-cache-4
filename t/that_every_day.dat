5|$|In {{the poem}} Grímnismál, the god Odin, in {{disguise}} as Grímnir, and tortured, starved and thirsty, imparts {{in the young}} Agnar cosmological lore, including that Thor resides in Þrúðheimr, and <b>that,</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> Thor wades through the rivers Körmt and Örmt, and the two Kerlaugar. There, Grímnir says, Thor sits as judge at the immense cosmological world tree, Yggdrasil.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, Sava wrote that the entry's climax, featuring Moe explaining that BMO was built to understand fun was [...] "an interesting insight into the philosophy behind this series" [...] because the [...] "childlike mentality of fun and play is an enlightened state in Adventure Time, and BMO reaches <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> with Finn and Jake." ...|$|E

500|$|... "A Quiet Night In" [...] was {{submitted}} to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), but was not nominated for a 2015 BAFTA award. In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did {{think it was a}} shame that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing that. I get told <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|In chapter 15 of Gylfaginning, Just-As-High {{says that}} Bifröst is also called Asbrú, and <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> the gods ride their horses across it (with the {{exception}} of Thor, who instead wades through the boiling waters of the rivers Körmt and Örmt) to reach Urðarbrunnr, a holy well where the gods have their court. As a reference, Just-As-High quotes {{the second of the}} two stanzas in Grímnismál that mention the bridge (see above). Gangleri asks if fire burns over Bifröst. High says that the red in the bridge is burning fire, and, without it, the frost jotnar and mountain jotnar would [...] "go up into heaven" [...] if anyone who wanted could cross Bifröst. High adds that, in heaven, [...] "there are many beautiful places" [...] and that [...] "everywhere there has divine protection around it." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri {{says that}} Valhalla {{must be an}} immense building, yet it must often be crowded around the doorways. High {{responds}} that {{there are plenty of}} doors, and that crowding doesn't occur around them. In support, High again quotes a stanza from Grímnismál. In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E

500|$|Octavius's death devastated his father; Walpole wrote [...] "the King {{has lost}} another little child; a lovely boy, they say, of whom their Majesties were dotingly fond." [...] Shortly afterward, King George said [...] "There {{will be no}} Heaven for me if Octavius is not there." [...] The day after his son's death, the King passed through a room where artist Thomas Gainsborough was {{completing}} {{the finishing touches on}} a portrait of the family. The King asked him to stop, but when he found out that the painting was of Octavius, allowed the painter to continue. When this same painting was exhibited a week later, Octavius' sisters were so upset that they broke down and cried in front of everyone. Three months after Octavius' death, his father was still dwelling on his son, writing to Lord Dartmouth <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> [...] "increases the chasm I feel for want of that beloved object [...]" [...] In later years, King George imagined conversations with his two youngest sons. During one of the king's bouts of madness in 1788, George mistook a pillow for Octavius, who by that time had been dead for five years.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the music}} on Eat a Peach that was {{recorded}} after Duane's death directly dealt with the tragedy. [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More" [...] was written by Gregg Allman for his brother, Duane, immediately following his death. The song was composed on an 110-year-old Steinway piano in Studio D of Criteria. [...] "Ain't Wastin'" [...] was composed when Duane was still alive, but the lyrics deal with his passing, as well as veterans coming home from the Vietnam War. The song relates to the theme that [...] "death is an inescapable inevitability — <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> is precious." [...] "Les Brers in A Minor" [...] is an instrumental penned by Dickey Betts, and its title is [...] "bad French" [...] for [...] "less brothers." [...] When writing the song, all in the band felt something was familiar about the song; {{it turned out to}} be a solo of Betts's from live renditions of [...] "Whipping Post." [...] It resurfaced many years later on a bootleg recording. [...] "Les Brers" [...] began recording in the newly constructed Studio C of the recording complex at Criteria, but the band disliked the sound captured in the room and moved to Studio A. As a result, the recording contains a slight pitch variation due to the difficulty of matching the original speed of the instruments when the intro was spliced onto the master tape.|$|E
500|$|Greatly {{concerned}} {{by what he}} {{perceived to be the}} degeneracy of British society, Wilberforce was also active in matters of moral reform, lobbying against [...] "the torrent of profaneness <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> makes more rapid advances", and considered this issue and the abolition of the slave trade as equally important goals. At the suggestion of Wilberforce and Bishop Porteus, King George III was requested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to issue in 1787 the Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice, as a remedy for the rising tide of immorality. The proclamation commanded the prosecution of those guilty of [...] "excessive drinking, blasphemy, profane swearing and cursing, lewdness, profanation of the Lord's Day, and other dissolute, immoral, or disorderly practices". Greeted largely with public indifference, Wilberforce sought to increase its impact by mobilising public figures to the cause, and by founding the Society for the Suppression of Vice. This and other societies in which Wilberforce was a prime mover, such as the Proclamation Society, mustered support for the prosecution of those who had been charged with violating relevant laws, including brothel keepers, distributors of pornographic material, {{and those who did not}} respect the Sabbath. Years later, the writer and clergyman Sydney Smith criticised Wilberforce for being more interested in the sins of the poor than those of the rich, and suggested that a better name would have been the Society for [...] "suppressing the vices of persons whose income does not exceed £500 per annum". The societies were not highly successful in terms of membership and support, although their activities did lead to the imprisonment of Thomas Williams, the London printer of Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason. Wilberforce's attempts to legislate against adultery and Sunday newspapers were also in vain; his involvement and leadership in other, less punitive, approaches were more successful in the long-term, however. By the end of his life, British morals, manners, and sense of social responsibility had increased, paving the way for future changes in societal conventions and attitudes during the Victorian era.|$|E
