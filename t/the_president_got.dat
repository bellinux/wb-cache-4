5000|$|The {{schedule}} was extremely tight nonetheless four cars could be completed {{and two of}} these cars (cream and black coloured) were shipped to Ankara for the Republic Day celebrations. Polishing paint of the black car was done while on the train to Ankara. None of the cars had gasoline in them, as a safety precaution, and the cars were filled with little fuel, only for maneuvering. Since the compression rate had been increased to boost engine performance, high octane fuel was needed to run the engines without engine knock. High octane fuel was only available in Ankara back then. On {{the day of the}} celebrations, President Cemal Gürsel got into the black car before it was refuelled for a ceremonial ride. After proceeding approximately a hundred meters, the vehicle came to a halt. Then <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>got</b> off from the black car and got onto the cream colored car at the back (which had been filled up earlier) and went to Anıtkabir with it.

5000|$|On June 11, Governor Wallace {{stood in}} the doorway of Foster Auditorium to prevent the black {{students}} from registering for classes. Shortly after noon Kennedy, unsure of what Wallace would do, requested that the Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) clear time to broadcast a statement at 8:00 PM. White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger fulfilled the task, in the process alerting the two largest national wire services, the Associated Press and United Press International. Less than three hours after the standoff began, Wallace yielded to Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and National Guard General Henry V. Graham. Kennedy and his staff watched the situation resolve on television in the White House afterwards. Kennedy's speechwriter, Ted Sorenson, figured that with the confrontation over, no speech would be given. But Kennedy thought the moment was opportune to educate the public on civil rights and follow through with appropriate legislation. Turning his chair towards Sorenson, Kennedy said, [...] "We better give that civil rights speech tonight." [...] Deputy Attorney General Burke Marshall said of Robert Kennedy's influence on the decision, [...] "He urged it, he felt it, he understood it, and he prevailed.

5000|$|In 1868, in {{response}} to stories then circulating in the press about the Baltimore plot, Kane wrote a lengthy account of {{his view of the}} events of February 21-23, 1861. He believed the President and his family would arrive in Baltimore as planned on the Northern Central Railroad at its Calvert Street Station (later after 1950, the site of the Baltimore Sun's offices and printing plant, by Bath Street and the overhead Orleans Street Viaduct) at 12:30 p.m. on February 23, and depart on a 3 p.m. train from the Camden Street Station on the southwest side of town. That left {{two and a half hours}} to fill in a City in which <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>got</b> only about 1000 votes, and most of those, according to Kane, from “the very scum of the city.” In other words, there were no sizable numbers of upper crust Lincoln supporters who might be counted on to rally around the President in a public display, and entertain him, as had continually happened on the President’s previous stops coming East in New York, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia on his triumphal parade through the North from his home in Springfield, Illinois. Kane came up with a plan, which he implemented, in which John S. Gittings, who owned the Northern Central Railroad, would travel to the village of Maryland Line (on the Mason-Dixon line, border between Maryland and Pennsylvania), get on the President’s train, and accompany him to Baltimore. Once in Baltimore, the train would make an unscheduled stop at North Charles and Bolton Streets, where Kane would meet it with carriages that would carry the new President and his family to Gittings’ mansion on Mt. Vernon Place. There a sumptuous meal would be served. This plan avoided the Calvert Street Station altogether and kept the President-elect largely out of view of possible [...] "rabble rousers". According to his own account, Kane carried out his plan exactly, with the only exception being that the new President was not aboard the train. In actuality, President-elect Lincoln having possibly already anticipated the possible plot through the information secured by and presented to him by the noted new detective Allan Pinkerton, (1819-1884), and Samuel Morse Felton, Sr., (1809-1889), President of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, and confirmed by some other sources. So after leaving his party in Harrisburg, Lincoln boarded a night express back to Philadelphia with Ward Hill Lamon, (1828-1893), his trusted aide, and traveled that evening back east and had his car attached to the end of a last evening P.W. & B. train running southwest to Baltimore arriving at the east-side President Street Station at 3 a.m. With his lonely night car pulled slightly west along Pratt Street to the Camden Street Station, where it was held for a short while then placed at the end of a Baltimore & Ohio Railroad train to Washington where the sleepy President-elect and his bodyguard (and possibly another armed man arrived at the B. & O. Station in the Nation's Capital at 6 a.m. taking up residence in the noted Willard's Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue three blocks from the White House of out-going 15th President James Buchanan. Newspaper accounts variously described Mrs. Lincoln and the boys being met by an unruly crowd in the Calvert Street Station disappointed in not seeing the new President were reported in various ways. They later also followed on the B. & O. later that day. Kane, in his memoirs of the Plot and 1861, claimed this was erroneous and that Mrs. Lincoln was not jostled by the crowd, but that she had already alighted and left the station before they assembled.|$|E
40|$|The current French {{president}} has more possibilities to strengthen his {{position within the}} political system of the Fifth republic than his predecessors before the year 2000. This is the conclusion of this paper. At {{the turn of the}} millennium, French citizens have approved in a referendum the reduction of presidential term from seven to five years. In addition french prime minister initiated the change of the electoral calendar. Thanks to these reforms the probability that the system freezes in the period of cohabitation decreased significantly. In that context, this paper examines in what extend the role of the president became more important and how the last three french heads of state (Chirac, Sarkozy and Hollande) managed to behave within this new constitutional settlement. According to the results of this study, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>got</b> wider possibilities especially in the field of practical execution of his mandate. It is because he can be more certain that the parliamentary majority will support him during his whole five year term. This means that the constitutional reform in 2000 (and next revisions in 2007 and 2008) made the political system clearer and it also stabilized the electoral calendar.

40|$|Introducing {{the discussions}} and {{practices}} of Polish etatism in 1930 's, this article presents the historical process that the state control was strengthened and etatism became a main development strategy of the Polish government. One of the main problems of the economic policy of interwar Poland was economic backwardness and stagnation. The economic liberalism was a main current of economic ideology in the government (as an at least official standpoint), {{as well as the}} industrial world and academic circles. However, the economic liberalism and the political democratization couldn't solve these economic problems. The political situation was stabilized by Pilsudski's Coup D'etat, but the economic structural problem was still left (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 introduces arguments about interventionism and the controversy over an economic planning. The thoughts of an economic planning of the Polish Communist Party of Poland (KPP), the Polish cooperatism, the economic calculation debate, and the development policy of technocrats, would be worth paying attention. The so called "April Constitution" (1935) and the Great Depression (1929 − 1935) are analyzed in Chapters 3 and Chapter 4. The Great Depression shook the trust in market and the fundamental idea of economic liberalism. In 1935, new constitution was promulgated, and <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>got</b> a strong authority. Such a situation strengthened the tendency to etatism. In Chapter 5, the Central Industrial Region (COP) constructed on the base of etatistic ideology is empirically analyzed. It seemed effective not only in temporary economic stabilization, but in structural change of Polish economy that stands in long−term perspective. However, the construction of the Central Industrial Region was interrupted by World War II...|$|E
