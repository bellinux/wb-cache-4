50|$|The Brazilian {{tax system}} is {{a legacy of the}} Empire, a period that was {{initially}} focused on taxes on imports. It had its first significant change only with the Constitution of 1934, when internal <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>products</b> began to gain projection. In 1960 a reform in order to increase the storage capacity of the state and increase the economic efficiency of the system was introduced. After 1960, alterations were made only in the sense of raising the storage capacity and reduce the degree of distribution of taxes between the federal entities. The end result is that the system is caught in a vicious circle, where tax rates are high and taxes are created. The Brazilian tax reality is notoriously complex, bringing a huge financial cost to the taxpayer, and also causing the constant insecurity of being or not complying with all obligations required by the tax authorities.|$|E
50|$|A {{study on}} the {{macroeconomic}} effects of the German government’s building rehabilitation programs has been conducted {{to assess the impact}} from the investment projects on the public revenue, the housing industry and the climate policy. The analysis focused on short-term effects (the effects taking place in the corresponding year). For the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, the analysis took into account the program cost (the opportunity cost of providing funds for the KfW promotional programs instead of using them elsewhere), and calculated the revenues from the value added tax paid by investors, net <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>products,</b> net taxes on production, payroll tax and SSC (Social Security Contributions) including solidarity surcharge, corporate income tax, and other income taxes including solidarity surcharge. Because {{it is not clear whether}} the additional demand for labour is met through overtime work or through additional jobs, the analysis provides two scenarios; one named “overtime”, where the demand impulse does not create additional jobs, and the second named “jobs”, where the opposite is true. In the latter, the avoided cost of unemployment is added as a revenue.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the decade of 2000, among the capitals of the Northeast, Fortaleza had the third largest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), being surpassed by Recife and Salvador. It was estimated that, in 2011, Fortaleza would have the largest GDP in the region, according to the nominal increase that had been occurring in recent years; But this happened in 2010, when the economy of the capital of Ceará grew by more than 5 billion reais, reaching a GDP of R$37.1 billion and surpassing expectations. In 2012, the GDP of Fortaleza reached the value of 43.4 billion Reais, which consolidated the municipality as the richest in the Northeast region, the tenth of the country and the eighth among the capitals. In the same year, the value of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>products</b> net of subsidies at current prices was R $6,612,822,000 and the municipality's GDP per capita was R$17.359,53.

40|$|In this paper, the {{application}} of INFORGE as an analyzing tool for fiscal policy shocks is introduced by using the example of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>products.</b> In recent times, variations of tax rates on product taxes have become rather popular {{because it is a}} simple method to consolidate state budget. A detailed modelling of <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>products</b> is important for further two reasons: (i) they are an important component for the transition from demand at purchasers 2 ̆ 019 prices to demand at basic prices. (ii) <b>Taxes</b> <b>on</b> <b>products</b> can be classified in general and specific consumption taxes. Both tax types affect categories of goods in a different way and have to be modelled accordingly.
