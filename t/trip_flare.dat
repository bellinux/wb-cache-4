5000|$|Under {{the cover}} of night, the men don German uniforms and sneak into the port depot to plant their explosives, {{but one of them}} sets off a <b>trip</b> <b>flare</b> and they are quickly surrounded; an officer on a {{loudspeaker}} calls each of them out by name, revealing Masters' betrayal. The men scatter as the depot is detonated; Leech and Douglas manage to slip away while the rest are caught and killed. After taking shelter, Leech admits to Douglas that he is being kept alive only because Masters is paying him £2000 for his safe return.|$|E
25|$|By mid-December, {{the troops}} were well dug in and had wired their {{positions}} with <b>trip</b> <b>flares</b> and barbed wire. They covered their fox holes with felled timbers. The weather was unusually calm and bone-chilling cold. Between 19 December 1944 and 31 January 1945, the average maximum temperature {{on the front lines}} in Europe was 33.5°F. (0.83°C.), and the average minimum temperature 22.6°F. (−5.2°C.).|$|R
50|$|A tripflare is {{a device}} used by {{military}} forces to secure an area and {{to guard against}} infiltration. It consists of tripwire around the area, linked {{to one or more}} flares. When the tripwire is triggered, as by someone unsuspectingly disturbing it, the flare is activated and begins burning. The light from the flare simultaneously warns that the perimeter may have been breached and also gives light for investigating. In defensive operations, <b>trip</b> <b>flares</b> are usually placed in predetermined kill zones with machine guns sighted on them.|$|R
500|$|From early May, the VC's 1st Regiment {{began to}} tighten its noose around the Ngok Tavak position. On 6 May, a platoon-sized patrol from Ngok Tavak {{made contact with}} VC units about [...] south of the garrison. On the evening of 7 May, enemy {{soldiers}} were believed to have set off <b>trip</b> <b>flares,</b> which prompted the Nung soldiers to hurl grenades at the perimeter. On 8 May, White ordered the Marines to pull their artillery guns inside the defensive perimeter, so they could better defend their position {{from the top of}} the -high hill feature. The Marines spent the entire evening of 8 May taking the first howitzer completely apart in order to take it up the hill. That night, enemy soldiers set off <b>trip</b> <b>flares</b> and again the Nung soldiers threw grenades in response. On 9 May, Captain Chris Silva flew to Ngok Tavak to discuss the reliability of his troops with his Australian counterpart, but was prevented from returning to Khâm Đức due to poor weather. On that day, the second howitzer was dragged into the garrison, so the Nungs and Marines both guarded the perimeter of Ngok Tavak. Infantry protection was provided by the 1st and 2nd Nung platoons, which held the eastern side of the garrison, while the suspect Montagnard CIDG soldiers guarded the eastern entrance. Overlooking them were some Marines of Battery D, 2nd Battalion.|$|R
5|$|The NK 6th Division shifted {{its axis}} of attack {{and its main}} attacking effort to the {{northern}} part of the Chinju-Masan corridor just below the Nam River in the 35th Infantry's sector. The 35th Infantry set to work to cover its front with <b>trip</b> <b>flares,</b> but they were in short supply and gradually it became impossible to replace them. Illuminating flares were also in short supply, and the reserve stocks had deteriorated to such a degree that only about 20 percent of the supply issued to the regiment was effective. Even when employed, the time lapse between a request for them and delivery by the big howitzers allowed some North Korean infiltration before the threatened area was illuminated.|$|R
50|$|The American {{lines at}} X-Ray were harassed {{during the night}} of 15 November by NVA probes. Shortly before 04:00 of the third day grenade booby traps and <b>trip</b> <b>flares</b> set by Capt. Diduryk's Bravo Company (1/7) began to erupt. At 04:22 the NVA {{launched}} a fierce assault against Diduryk's men. Bravo fought off this attack by an estimated 300 NVA in minutes. A decisive factor in this stand, in addition to rifle and machine gun fire from B Company's lines, was the skilled placement of artillery strikes by Diduryk's forward observer, Lt. Bill Lund. Making use of four artillery batteries, Lund organized fire into separate concentrations along the battlefield with devastating consequences for the waves of advancing NVA.|$|R

500|$|That evening, the 27th Infantry placed two belts of antipersonnel {{mines and}} <b>trip</b> <b>flares</b> {{across the road}} and stream bed [...] and [...] in front of its {{positions}} in the valley. After dusk, the North Koreans began shelling the general area of the 27th Infantry positions until just before midnight. ROK troops had planned to mount an attack, but {{it became apparent that}} the North Koreans would hit first. Then the KPA 13th Division launched a major attack against the entire UN front in and around the valley. Nine US tanks supported the infantry troops in the valley. Because it was on higher ground and positioned in front of all the other American units, C Company on the left of the road usually was the first to detect an approaching attack. That evening the C Company commander telephoned the regimental headquarters that he could hear tanks. When the artillery fired an illuminating shell he was able to count 19 North Korean vehicles in the attacking column on the road. The tanks and self-propelled guns approached the American positions, firing rapidly. Most of their shells landed in the rear areas. North Korean infantry moved forward {{on both sides of the}} road. Simultaneously, other North Korean units attacked the ROK troops on the high ridges flanking the valley.|$|R
50|$|In late 1944, Hamilton was a Major and {{temporary}} Commanding Officer of the 11th Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry. At {{that time the}} battalion was broken up with the soldiers and officers dispersed as reinforcements to other units. Hamilton {{was transferred to the}} Duke of Wellington's Regiment 1/7th Battalion, as second in command under Lt Col Wilsey, in November. During December when the battalion was stationed at the bridgehead at Nijmegen he took temporary command of the 1/7th, on 2 December, whilst Wilsey took temporary command of the Brigade for a week. On the day he took command the battalion came under attack from German units at Haalderen, in an attempt to retake the bridge. A German officer, 2/Lt Heinich, 5 Coy 16 Parachute Regiment 6 Parachute Division, was captured by members of 'B' company, who were laying <b>trip</b> <b>flares.</b> Hamilton quickly organised a defence, using his Bren Gun Carriers to hold back the Germans. The attack continued for several days during which the battalion received heavy artillery and mortar fire. Large numbers of prisoners were taken from the 5th, 7th and 10th companies of the German 16 Para Regiment. Fighting intensified, taking in house to house action throughout Haalderen, where the German forces took heavy losses in killed and wounded. 'D' company of the Royal Scots Fusiliers moved in to support the 1/7th on 4 December. German artillery fire intensified on the battalion positions. By 7 December the main attack had been repulsed, though artillery, mortar and sniper attacks continued until the battalion was withdrawn to Nijmegen on 22 January. For his actions and leadership Hamilton was awarded a DSO. A few weeks later, in January 1945, Hamilton was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and took command of the 1/7th Battalion, when Lt Col Wilsey became the Brigade Commander.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{accounts}} of the attack state that the defenders [...] "failed to safeguard the perimeter" [...] of the FSB. The only single volume study written about the attack contests this position, pointing out that [...] "historians [...] got it wrong." [...] Even with this new perspective, {{there are indications that}} alertness at Mary Ann was not as good as it could have been. Many accounts by men stationed at Mary Ann mention that perimeter security was uneven at best. One member of the 1-46th Headquarters Company stated that [...] "I don't think Captain Knight [...] had a clue as to how lax the security was...because in that area, and only that area, Knight wasn't diligent. He left it up to his lieutenants and sergeants to check the bunker line." [...] In many cases they failed to do so, and the failure was compounded by Charlie Company being understrength and unable to man all the perimeter bunkers. Manning bunkers was not the only problem. <b>Trip</b> <b>flares</b> located in the concertina wire around the base were not always reset or replaced when they went off, a common occurrence caused in some cases by the rotor wash created by large CH-47 Chinook helicopters bringing in supplies or backhauling material as 1-46th Inf prepared to hand the base over to the ARVN. This lax attitude, combined with the skill of the attacking sappers, had fatal consequences for many in Charlie Company. Although not [...] "cringing in their bunkers", the defenders of Mary Ann were not prepared for a ground attack. This lack of readiness was not noted by the 196th LIB commander, Colonel William S.

50|$|The 1/6th and 1/7th battalions of the {{regiment}} were both {{assigned to the}} 147th Infantry Brigade, alongside the 1/5th West Yorkshire Regiment, which itself {{was part of the}} 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division. The brigade did not see service {{with the rest of the}} division in the Norwegian Campaign, but were instead sent to Iceland after it was invaded in 1940, and remained there until May 1942 when it was transferred back to the United Kingdom. On 28 February 1943, both battalions lost the '1/' prefix, becoming, simply, the 6th and 7th battalions, respectively. They both landed in Normandy on 12 June 1944 shortly after the D-Day landings of 6 June. They fought in the Battle of Normandy as part of the British Second Army in its attempts to capture the city of Caen. In particular, the 6th Battalion was severely mauled during Operation Martlet and, due to the heavy casualties sustained, was returned to the United Kingdom and disbanded, most of its men being sent to the 7th Battalion. They were replaced in the brigade by the 1st Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment. The 7th DWR continued to fight in the Normandy Campaign in the Second Battle of the Odon, and clearing the Channel Ports in Operation Astonia. After the failure of Operation Market Garden, the 7th Battalion was stationed at the Nijmegen bridgehead, in late November, and around Haalderen. Just after midnight of 1 December the Battalion was being hit by heavy artillery, mortar and Spandau fire. As the night progressed they came under attack from multiple infantry elements of the German 6th Parachute Division in an attempt to capture the Nijmegen bridge. Fighting intensified, taking in house to house action throughout Haalderen and Gendt During the nights of 3-4 December house to house fighting with small arms and grenades took in almost every house in Haalderen, with the Dukes 'A Company' Headquarters in the village school. Fighting was very confused and movement limited due to heavy flooding of the ground from the breached canals and river. A German officer, 2nd Lieutenant Heinich, 5 Coy 16 Parachute Regiment, was captured by members of 'B' company, who were laying <b>trip</b> <b>flares.</b> Major Denis Hamilton (who was in temporary command of the battalion) quickly organised a defence, using his Bren Gun Carriers, to hold back the Germans. Over 100 prisoners, with a further 50 killed or wounded were taken from the 5th, 7th and 10th companies of the German 16 Para Regiment. By 6 December the attack had died out and the Dukes were relieved by the 11th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. 7DWR moved into reserve in Bemmel where they received sporadic shelling from heavy artillery, whilst putting out patrols to guard against a potential water borne attack on the Nijmegen bridge. The next notable service seen by the battalion was in the Liberation of Arnhem in April 1945, shortly before Victory in Europe Day.|$|R
