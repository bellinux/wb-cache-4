5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|The buttonquails are small, drab, running birds which {{resemble}} the true quails. The female is <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> {{of the sexes}} and initiates courtship. The male incubates the eggs and tends the young.|$|E
5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> horizon created by {{the reflection of the}} moon and starlight off the water's surface.|$|E

5|$|Gamma Circini is {{a binary}} star 450light-years away, whose {{components}} need a telescope of 150mm to be seen, {{as they are}} only 0.8 arcseconds apart. <b>The</b> <b>brighter</b> component is a bluish Be star of spectral type B5IV+ and magnitude 4.51, while the dimmer component is a yellow star of magnitude 5.5. They orbit each other every 180 years. Delta Circini is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5.1 and 13.4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3.9 days. <b>The</b> <b>brighter</b> component is a close eclipsing binary (specifically, a rotating ellipsoidal variable), with a minor dip of magnitude (0.1). Both are hot blue stars of spectral types O7III-V and O9.5V, respectively, and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times the Sun's mass. Over 3600light-years away, this system would outshine Venus at magnitude −4.8 if it were 32light-years (10parsecs) distant. The two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds, resolvable {{to the naked eye}} for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with a telescope.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> {{stars in}} galaxies {{have been used}} as {{distance}} indicators since Hubble(1936). However, the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> stars for distance estimates has been controversial. Recently, Rozanski and RowanRobinson (1994) argued large errors in the distance determination : 0. 58 mag and 0. 90 mag, respectively, for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> red stars and <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> blue stars, while Karachentsev and Tikhonov(1994) suggested much smaller errors in the distance determination : 0. 37 mag for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> red stars and 0. 46 mag for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> blue stars. <b>The</b> reasons for these conflicting results are not yet known. We have investigated the accuracy of this method using a sample of 17 galaxies(LMC, SMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, M 31, IC 10, M 33, WLM, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, LeoA, NGC 2403, M 81, IC 4182, M 101) for which Cepheid distances are known and reliable photometry of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> stars are available (Figure 1).

The contrast between <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others.

5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} {{are thought to}} occur in the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brighter</b> {{star of the}} Pleione binary pair, {{component}} A, is a hot type B star 190 {{times more}} luminous than the Sun. It is classified as Be star with certain distinguishing traits: periodic phase changes and a complex circumstellar environment composed of two gaseous disks at different angles to each other. The primary star rotates rapidly, close to its breakup velocity, even faster than Achernar. Although some research on the companion star has been performed, stellar characteristics of the orbiting B component are not well known.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E

5|$|The star Lambda (λ) Tauri is an {{eclipsing binary}} star. This system {{consists}} of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star.

Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1 astronomical units, so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit.|$|E
5|$|There are 37 stars {{brighter}} than apparent magnitude6.5 in the constellation; three are {{brighter than}} magnitude4.5. 46Leonis Minoris, an orange giant of magnitude3.8, is located some 95light-years from Earth. At magnitude4.4, Beta Leonis Minoris is the second-brightest star {{and the only}} one in the constellation with a Bayer designation. It is a binary star, <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white main sequence star. The third-brightest star is 21Leonis Minoris, a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star of average magnitude4.5.

5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble categorized M87 {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> globular nebulae, as {{it lacked}} any spiral structure, but appeared {{to belong to the}} same family of non-galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization of nebulae, with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra-galactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0). By 1931, Hubble had identified M87 {{as a member of the}} Virgo Cluster, for which he gave a provisional estimate of 1.8 million parsecs from Earth. At the time it was the only known example of an elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved. M87 continued to be called an extragalactic nebula for many years thereafter, but by 1956 it had been identified as an E0-type galaxy.|$|E

Figure  2 b shows that <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel is not the frontal bone but the right side that faces the light. Therefore, the straight line from the center to <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel is not the bridge of the nose. Under this condition, human eyes are nonsymmetrical relative to the straight line from the center to <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixels. Thus, JEER uses Step 2 (necessary condition for existence of the eye region area) to determine whether human eyes might be present in the possible areas of the eye region chosen by Step 1.|$|R

5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of <b>the</b> <b>brighter</b> colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E

In July 2006, Cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas, the largest of which is almost {{the size of the}} Caspian Sea.

5|$|Four star {{systems are}} known to harbour planets. HD 330075 is a sunlike star around 164light-years distant that is orbited by a hot Jupiter every 3.4days.

40|$|Quantitative {{precipitation}} estimation {{based on}} weather radar data {{suffers from a}} variety of errors. During stratiform events, a region of enhanced reflectivity, called <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band, leads to large positive biases in the precipitation estimates when compared with ground measurements. The identification of <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band is an important step when trying to correct weather radar data for this effect. In this study we investigate three different methods to identify <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band from profiles measured by a vertically pointing K-Band Micro Rain Radar (MRR). The first tries to fit a piecewise linear function to <b>the</b> profile. <b>The</b> <b>bright</b> band characteristics are then derived from the fitted function parameters. The second uses only reflectivity information, while the third makes additional use of the falling velocity, which is also measured by the MRR. This last method shows the greatest skill in identifying <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band height, followed by the function fit and the pure reflectivity methods. A comparison with data from a scanning radar shows that the height estimated in this way corresponds well with <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band features observed in the radar scan...|$|R
