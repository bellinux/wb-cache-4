5|$|The {{colocation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> and Apostles {{as well as}} the affinity {{between them}} suggest that both Tamagnino and Cairano obtained early ownership of the internal works at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, though at the end, it devolved to Cairano. Technically, however, <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> of Tamagnino are far superior to the Apostles. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>Angels,</b> Tamagnino also delivered four busts for the pendentive of the first dome of the church, titled Dottori della Chiesa, and two smaller roundels for the frieze of the nave. But for these constructions, three of which were monumental, and <b>the</b> <b>Angels,</b> the sculptor received a smaller compensation than Cairano did for his Apostles.|$|E

5|$|After the 1962 season, the Yankees sold Turley to the Los Angeles Angels for cash, in {{the first}} move made by new Yankees' general manager Roy Hamey, who sought to rebuild the Yankees {{pitching}} staff. The move was conditional; <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> could return Turley {{if they were not}} satisfied with him. <b>The</b> <b>Angels</b> chose to retain Turley {{at the start of the}} 1963 season. Turley struggled, winning two games while losing seven, and <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> released him in July. A week later, he signed with the Boston Red Sox.

The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E

He deduces that <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them.

Tony Phillips led off the ninth for <b>the</b> <b>Angels</b> with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E
