Her role as a villain received positive attention, while Patterson's acting was cited as over-exaggerated. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of Christy's morality and her status as the season's antagonist {{have been the subject}} of debate among television critics and the series' fans.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{presided over}} the {{organisation}} of his diocese into prebends to support the cathedral clergy; he established at least one new prebend and augmented two others. He also attended the church councils in 1127 and 1129 that were convened by William de Corbeil, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Later, during 1133 and 1134, he and the archbishop quarrelled, but <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of their dispute is unknown.

On 21 July 1870, Tréhot gave birth to a baby girl named Jeanne (d. 1934) who was given to a wet nurse to raise as her own. Renoir continued to secretly support Jeanne financially until he died (and after his death with the help of Ambroise Vollard), but never publicly or legally acknowledged that she was his daughter during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome {{is primarily a}} 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{response}} to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized {{his relationship with}} Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; {{it was the first}} depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of Chad's sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself.

5|$|Governance of the Jerseys {{also created}} {{problems}} for Andros. James had awarded the territory {{west of the}} Hudson River to proprietors John Berkeley and George Carteret, and Berkeley had then deeded the western portion (which became known as West Jersey) to a partnership of Quakers. Berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights to this group, and <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> of the rights James had given both Berkeley and Carteret was disputed, in part because James believed that the second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode the earlier grants he had made to Berkeley and Carteret.|$|E

In addition, initial parasite–host contact, host-cellinvasion and host-cell responses are described. The roles of parasite and host-cell-derived components in the invasion process are examined, as is the question of whether Cryptosporidium actively invades cells and to what extent host-cell responses are involved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} three distinctions {{pertaining}} to knowledge representation, namely, the rules vs facts distinction, roles vs fillers distinction, and predicates vs types distinction.

5000|$|One {{viewpoint}} on {{this question}} is that cause and effect are of {{one and the same}} kind of entity, with causality an asymmetric relation between them.

In this view, one opinion, proposed as a metaphysical principle in process philosophy, is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process, event, becoming, or happening. An example is 'his tripping over the step was the cause, and his breaking his ankle the effect'.
