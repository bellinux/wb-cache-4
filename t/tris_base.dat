40|$|In {{order to}} improve Boer goat semen quality during {{cryopreservation}} process, the influence of sugar supplementation on semen characteristics of sperm were investigated. Three experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of (a) addition of two monosaccharides (fructose and glucose) and two disaccharides sugars (trehalose and sucrose) (b) sugar combination (fructose and trehalose, sucrose and trehalose, glucose and trehalose), and control (glucose without trehalose) (c) different concentrations of trehalose on cryopreservation using <b>Tris</b> <b>based</b> extender. The total motility, forward motility, viability, normal spermatozoa, acrosome integrity and membrane integrity were assessed subjectively. Differences were not detected among monosaccharides, but glucose increased (P 0. 05) among disaccharide sugar supplementation. Combination of glucose and trehalose significantly improved the characteristics of Boer spermatozoa after cryopreservation (P< 0. 05). Supplementation of trehalose (198. 24. mM) into the glucose extender significantly increased total motility, forward motility, live spermatozoa, acrosome integrity and membrane integrity following cryopreservation (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, glucose had the better ability to support Boer sperm motility and movement patterns. Combination of monosaccharide (glucose) and disaccharide (trehalose) improved semen quality following cryopreservation.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe {{discovery}} of cell free foetal DNA (cffDNA) in 1997 {{allows for the}} combination of accuracy as well as non-invasiveness for prenatal diagnosis. This non-invasive genetic test requires only a maternal blood sample from which the cffDNA can be isolated and analysed. In this work cffDNA was isolated from a maternal blood sample using a micro-fluidic device which was fabricated using hot embossing and laser ablation techniques. The DNA sample was first pre-concentration by electrokinetic trapping (EKT) and then isotachophoresis (ITP). The concentrated sample was then separated by size using capillary electrophoresis (CE), all in a single device. All parameters and processes concerned with the micro-fluidic device were optimised sequentially. These parameters include both the chemical components {{as well as the}} physical processes which occur. The DNA used for the optimisation protocol was analysed using fluorescence spectroscopy, agarose gel electrophoresis as well as an Agilent Bioanalyser. The optimised protocol included a 9 % acrylamide/pDMA matrix, 3 M N,N-dimethylurea as a denaturing agent, with <b>tris</b> <b>based</b> buffers for pre-concentration steps and 1 X TBE (tris/borate/EDTA) buffer for capillary electrophoresis. The applied voltage of ITP was 300 V and CE was carried out at 180 V. The timing at which DNA was extracted from the device was kept at time = 60 s intervals. The optimised protocol was then used for real sample analysis and these samples were obtained from mothers pregnant with male foetuses. The DNA extracted from the micro-fluidic device was then analysed using real time PCR (RT-PCR) in order to distinguish which was maternal and which was foetal. This was carried out by amplification of male and general (present in male and female) genes respectively.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{creatine}} liberated in the creatine kinase reaction is conveniently measured by {{formation of a}} fluophor with ninhydrin in strongly alkaline solution. The method is rapid and sensitive. The incubation conditions developed are more nearly optimal than those in previous methods. SERUM CREATINE KINASE activity has beell measured by determining the amount of creatine liberated in the following reaction: ADI + creatine phosphate ATP + creatine. The Voges-Proskauer reactioii, pro-duction of a color by reaction of creatille with diacetyl alid-naphthol, has heeii used to measure enzymatically released creatine (1 - 5). The presence of a sulfhydryl compound in tile incubatioii mixture, necessary {{for the maintenance of}} a linear reaction rate, interferes with subsequent color development (2, 3, 6). This difficulty has been overcome by addi-tion of the sulfhydryl reagent, p-chloromercuribenzoate, alid by pro-longing the reaction time to 60 miii. (. 2). in 1960, Conll reported a pro-cedure for the determination of creatine, based upon the production of a fluophor with ninhydrin in strongly alkaline solution (7). His obser-vations, that the method is less sensitive to sulfhydryl interference than is the Voges-Proskauer reaction, and that creatine phosphate is non-fluorogenic, suggested that the procedure might be readily adaptable to measurement of creatine kinase activity. This report describes such an application. Materials and Methods Creatine hydrate was purchased from Mann Research Laboratories, New York, N. Y. and purified by recrystallization from warm water. ADP sodium, <b>Tris</b> (Trizma <b>Base),</b> and phosphocreatine sodium (crea-tin e-free) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.; imidazole, triketohydrindene hydrate, and 2 -mercaptoethaiiol, fro...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} factors known to {{influence}} quality and fertility of bovine cryopreserved semen is the extender used. In this matter, a great worldwide interest has been directed {{to the development of}} chemically defined media, free of animal origin products. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the efficacy of three bovine semen extenders: Tris–fructose (TRIS, control with 20 % egg yolk), Botu-Bov® (BB; 20 % egg yolk), and Botu-Bov®-soy lecithin (BB-L; 1 % soy lecithin). Towards this aim, post-thaw computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA), sperm membrane and acrosome integrity were evaluated (Experiment 1). Additionally, cryopreserved samples were used in a fixed time artificial insemination program aiming to evaluate in vivo fertility (pregnancy per insemination—P/AI; Experiment 2). Despite the higher straightness and linearity found for samples cryopreserved in BB and BB-L when compared to those cryopreserved in <b>TRIS,</b> egg yolk <b>based</b> extenders provided higher total and progressive motilities, percentage of rapid sperms and intact membrane cells (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, P/IA was higher in samples cryopreserved in egg yolk based extenders when compared to soy lecithin [TRIS= 59. 26 a (64 / 108), BB= 62. 37 a (58 / 93), and BB-L= 36. 45 b (35 / 96) ]. Although soy lecithin represents an alternative for the development of chemically defined extenders with decreased risk of biological contamination, egg yolk based extenders are more efficient on the preservation of bovine post-thaw sperm viability and fertility...|$|R
