5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the <b>tangency</b> portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the <b>tangency</b> portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} recovering epipolar geometry from spheres. Previous works have exploited epipolar <b>tangencies</b> induced by frontier points on the spheres for motion recovery. It will be shown in this paper that besides epipolar <b>tangencies,</b> N 2 point features can be extracted from the apparent contours of the N spheres when N> 2. An algorithm for recovering the fundamental matrices from such point features and the epipolar <b>tangencies</b> from 3 or more spheres is developed, with the point features providing a homography over the view pairs and the epipolar <b>tangencies</b> determining the epipoles. In general, {{there will be two}} solutions to the locations of the epipoles. One of the solutions corresponds to the true camera configuration, while the other corresponds to a mirrored configuration. Several methods are proposed to select the right solution.

5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external <b>tangency</b> is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal <b>tangency</b> is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of <b>tangency</b> would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining <b>tangency.</b> Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E

5|$|In general, any three {{distinct}} circles {{have a unique}} circle—the radical circle—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; {{the center of that}} circle is the radical center of the three circles. For illustration, the orange circle in Figure6 crosses the black given circles at right angles. Inversion in the radical circle leaves the given circles unchanged, but transforms the two conjugate pink solution circles into one another. Under the same inversion, the corresponding points of <b>tangency</b> of the two solution circles are transformed into one another; for illustration, in Figure6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed into one another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass through the center of inversion, which is the radical center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their <b>tangency)</b> until one given circle is shrunk {{to a point}} P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , which {{is the problem of}} finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal homothetic centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be shrunk to a point for different solutions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). Their point of <b>tangency</b> is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E

Moreover, they admit principal symbolic extensions, and the topological entropy and metrical entropy vary continuously with the map.

25|$|The two diagonals {{and the two}} <b>tangency</b> chords are concurrent. One way to {{see this}} is as a {{limiting}} case of Brianchon's theorem, which states that a hexagon all of whose sides are tangent to a single conic section has three diagonals that meet at a point. From a tangential quadrilateral, one can form a hexagon with two 180° angles, by placing two new vertices at two opposite points of tangency; all six of the sides of this hexagon lie on lines tangent to the inscribed circle, so its diagonals meet at a point. But two of these diagonals {{are the same as}} the diagonals of the tangential quadrilateral, and the third diagonal of the hexagon is the line through two opposite points of <b>tangency.</b> Repeating this same argument with the other two points of <b>tangency</b> completes the proof of the result.|$|E
25|$|In the {{transformed}} chain, the tangent points between adjacent {{circles of}} the Steiner chain all lie on a circle, namely the concentric circle midway {{between the two}} fixed concentric circles.
