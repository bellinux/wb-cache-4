50|$|While wider tracheids with robust walls make it {{possible}} to achieve higher water transport pressures, this increases the problem of cavitation. Cavitation occurs when a bubble of air forms within a vessel, breaking the bonds between chains of water molecules and preventing them from pulling more water up with their cohesive tension. A <b>tracheid,</b> once cavitated, cannot have its embolism removed and return to service (except in a few advanced angiosperms that have developed a mechanism of doing so). Therefore, it is well worth plants' while to avoid cavitation occurring. For this reason, pits in <b>tracheid</b> walls have very small diameters, to prevent air entering and allowing bubbles to nucleate. Freeze-thaw cycles are a major cause of cavitation. Damage to a tracheid's wall almost inevitably leads to air leaking in and cavitation, hence the importance of many tracheids working in parallel.|$|E
40|$|Vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> {{are defined}} as <b>tracheids</b> present {{adjacent}} to vessels in a wood which also possesses libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids as imperforate tracheary elements. Vasculartracheids would correspond with this definition, but {{are defined as}} occurring only in latewood, whereas vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> occur throughout a growth ring or in wood of a diffuse-porous species. V asicentric <b>tracheids</b> offer a subsidiary conducting system which can supply stems and leaves when the vessels to which vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> are adjacent fail because of air embolisms. True <b>tracheids</b> (present as the sole imperforate tracheary element type in the woods in which they occur) have much the same physiological effect, maximizing potential safety in conduction. Vasicentric <b>tracheids,</b> vascular <b>tracheids,</b> and true <b>tracheids</b> are alike in being imperforate tracheary elements bearing relatively large bordered pits approximately like those on lateral walls of vessels in density. Libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids also occur in woods in which vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> or vascular <b>tracheids</b> are present. Vascular <b>tracheids,</b> by virtue of occurrence {{only at the end}} of a growth ring (where they grade into narrow vessel elements), maintain water columns in stems, which thereby persist through dry seasons, but may not adequately supply leaves, which may wilt as drought progresses. Vasicentric <b>tracheids,</b> by safeguarding the conduction of all parts of a growth ring, seem related to the evergreen habit which many shrubs possessing vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> have. Phylads with true <b>tracheids</b> are relatively few in dicotyledons, and only a small part ofthese groups have evidently succeeded in adapting to dry climates. The numerous phylads which instead have libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids have developed comparable safety by evolving vasicentric <b>tracheids.</b> Therefore genera with vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> bulk large in the floras of areas in which evergreen drought-tolerant shrubs are adaptive, the Mediterranean-type areas of the world. In southern California, 26 families (17 reported for the first time) have vasicentric tracheids; notable genera include Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Prunus, Quercus, and Salvia. Desert shrubs have vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> to a somewhat lesser degree. Other Mediterranean-type areas are surveyed for both vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> and true <b>tracheids.</b> The regions so analyzed are central Chile, southern Australia, the lands adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, and southern Mrica. Genera in these areas with vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> include Banksia, Carissa, Eucalyptus, Grevillea, Hakea, Protea, Quercus, Rosmarinus, etc. New Zealand and Japan are wetter and have fewer genera with vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> but more with true <b>tracheids.</b> Many drought-tolerant evergreen shrubs have vasicentric <b>tracheids.</b> A new listing of families and genera with vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> is provided for the world flora, with new reports documented and pertinent literature cited. This new listing includes 68 families (33 newly reported in this paper), which represents a considerable advance on the 32 families listed by Metcalfe and Chalk in their compendia of 1950 and 1983, and includes some large and diverse families for the first time (e. g., Ericaceae, Pittosporaceae, Rosaceae). The lack of reports on occurrence of vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> may in part relate to difficulty in identifying these cells; suggestions for analysis are given...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tracheids</b> are {{elongated}} {{cells in}} the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts. <b>Tracheids</b> are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. <b>Tracheids,</b> unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.|$|R

50|$|The genus Sequoia first {{appears in}} the fossil record as Sequoia jeholensis, found in Jurassic {{deposits}} of South Manchuria. By the late Cretaceous it was already established in Europe, parts of China, and western North America. Comparisons among fossils and modern organisms suggest that by this period Sequoia had already evolved a greater <b>tracheid</b> diameter that allowed it to reach the great heights characteristic of the modern Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood).|$|E
50|$|The xylem {{consists}} of vessels in flowering plants and tracheids in other vascular plants, which are dead hard-walled hollow cells arranged to form files of tubes that function in water transport. A <b>tracheid</b> cell wall usually contains the polymer lignin. The phloem however {{consists of}} living cells called sieve-tube members. Between the sieve-tube members are sieve plates, which have pores to allow molecules to pass through. Sieve-tube members lack such organs as nuclei or ribosomes, but cells next to them, the companion cells, function {{to keep the}} sieve-tube members alive.|$|E
50|$|During the Devonian, maximum xylem {{diameter}} {{increased with}} time, with the minimum diameter remaining pretty constant. By the Middle Devonian, the <b>tracheid</b> diameter of some plant lineages had plateaued. Wider tracheids allow water {{to be transported}} faster, but the overall transport rate depends also on the overall cross-sectional area of the xylem bundle itself. The increase in vascular bundle thickness further seems to correlate with the width of plant axes, and plant height; it is also {{closely related to the}} appearance of leaves and increased stomatal density, both of which would increase the demand for water.|$|E

Then actin filaments disappeared in the differentiating ray <b>tracheids</b> adjacent to ray <b>tracheids</b> that lacked nuclei, and, finally, the nuclei disappeared.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} progressive changes in patterns of cavitation in the sapwood of three species of conifer (Larix kaempferi, Abies sachalinensis, and Picea jezoensis) that were growing in a sub-frigid zone. In all three conifers, all <b>tracheids</b> of the newly forming outermost annual ring were filled with water or cytoplasm {{during the period from}} May to August. However, many <b>tracheids</b> in the transition zone from earlywood to latewood lost water in September, presumably through drought-induced cavitation. Cavitated <b>tracheids</b> tended to be continuously distributed in a tangential direction. Subsequently, some earlywood <b>tracheids</b> of the outermost annual ring lost water during the period from January to March. This was associated with freeze-thaw cycles. In the second and third annual rings from the cambium of all three conifers, the lumina of most <b>tracheids</b> in the transition zone from earlywood to latewood contained no water. In contrast, some latewood <b>tracheids</b> near the annual ring boundary and many earlywood <b>tracheids</b> retained water in their lumina. The third annual ring had more cavitated <b>tracheids</b> than the second annual ring. Our observations indicated that cavitation progressed gradually in the <b>tracheids</b> of the conifers and that they were never refilled once cavitation had occurred. The region involved in water transport in conifers did not include the entire sapwood and differed among annual rings...|$|R
2500|$|Tree {{rings are}} {{records of the}} [...] of {{environmental}} conditions, their anatomical characteristics record growth rate changes produced by these changing conditions. The microscopic structure of conifer wood consists of two types of cells: parenchyma, which have an oval or polyhedral shape with approximately identical dimensions in three directions, and strongly elongated <b>tracheids.</b> <b>Tracheids</b> {{make up more than}} 90% of timber volume. The <b>tracheids</b> of earlywood formed {{at the beginning of a}} growing season have large radial sizes and smaller, thinner cell walls. Then, the first <b>tracheids</b> of the transition zone are formed, where the radial size of cells and thickness of their cell walls changes considerably. Finally, the latewood <b>tracheids</b> are formed, with small radial sizes and greater cell wall thickness. This is the basic pattern of the internal cel structure of conifer tree rings.|$|R
50|$|Tracheids {{end with}} walls, which impose {{a great deal}} of {{resistance}} on flow; vessel members have perforated end walls, and are arranged in series to operate as if they were one continuous vessel. The function of end walls, which were the default state in the Devonian, was probably to avoid embolisms. An embolism is where an air bubble is created in a <b>tracheid.</b> This may happen as a result of freezing, or by gases dissolving out of solution. Once an embolism is formed, it usually cannot be removed (but see later); the affected cell cannot pull water up, and is rendered useless.|$|E
50|$|Fibres usually {{originate}} from meristematic tissues. Cambium and procambium are their main centres of production. They are {{usually associated with}} the xylem and phloem of the vascular bundles. The fibres of the xylem are always lignified, while those of the phloem are cellulosic. Reliable evidence for the fibre cells' evolutionary origin from tracheids exists. During evolution {{the strength of the}} <b>tracheid</b> cell walls was enhanced, the ability to conduct water was lost {{and the size of the}} pits was reduced. Fibres that do not belong to the xylem are bast (outside the ring of cambium) and such fibres that are arranged in characteristic patterns at different sites of the shoot.|$|E
50|$|Xylem {{appeared}} {{early in}} the history of terrestrial plant life. Fossil plants with anatomically preserved xylem are known from the Silurian (more than 400 million years ago), and trace fossils resembling individual xylem cells may be found in earlier Ordovician rocks. The earliest true and recognizable xylem consists of tracheids with a helical-annular reinforcing layer added to the cell wall. This is the only type of xylem found in the earliest vascular plants, and this type of cell continues {{to be found in the}} protoxylem (first-formed xylem) of all living groups of plants. Several groups of plants later developed pitted <b>tracheid</b> cells, it seems, through convergent evolution. In living plants, pitted tracheids do not appear in development until the maturation of the metaxylem (following the protoxylem).|$|E

40|$|The middle Devonian aneurophytalean progymnosperms are {{generally}} accepted candidates as {{ancestors of the}} earliest seed plants. Their wood is composed of rather broad <b>tracheids</b> with crowded bordered pits on all walls and homocellular, tall and narrow rays. Suggested evolutionary trends include: 1) a decrease in diameter of <b>tracheids</b> (in both arborescent archaeopteridaleans progymnosperms and pityans seed plants), 2) inversely an increase in diameter of <b>tracheids</b> in the other early seed plants; 3) a decrease in pit seriation in archaeopteridalean, protopityans and some early seed plants; 4) a restriction of pitting to the radial wall of <b>tracheids</b> in early seed plants; 5) an increase in mean width of rays in archaeopterialeans and seed plants. Some characters are rare (ray <b>tracheids,</b> xylem parenchyma) or so variable in the ancestral group (ray height) that their polarity is difficult to establish.

40|$|Types of xylem {{histology}} in vines, {{rather than}} types of cambial activity and xylem conformation, form {{the focus of}} this survey. Scandent plants are high in conductive capability, but therefore have highly vulnerable hydrosystems; this survey attempts to see what kinds of adaptations exist for safety and in which taxa. A review of scandent dicotyledons reveals that a high proportion possesses vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> (22 families) or true <b>tracheids</b> (24 families); the majority of scandent families falls in these categories. Other features for which listings are given include vascular <b>tracheids,</b> fibriform vessel elements, helical sculpture in vessels, starch-rich parenchyma adjacent to vessels, and other parenchyma distributions. The high vulnerability of wide vessels is held to be countered by various mechanisms. True <b>tracheids</b> and vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> potentially safeguard the hydrosystem by serving when large vessels are embolized. Many vines and lianas have many narrow vessel elements (often fibriform vessel elements) in addition to wide vessel elements. The narrow vessel elements are held to increase safety. In comparing scandent with nonscandent genera within a family, one finds in some cases that <b>tracheids</b> occur in the scandent species, whereas fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers occur in the nonscandent ones. The same is true of vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> in vining species as compared to nonvining relatives; vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> are so abundant in some families (Passifloraceae) that libriform fibers have been lost partially or wholly. New familial records for presence of vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> include Cucurbitaceae and Polygonaceae, and new generic records include Antigonon, Lycopersicon, and Mandevilla. Various xylem features suggest presence of auxiliary conductive capabilities when main vessels fail. Parenchyma distributions in vines, especially those in which parenchyma surrounds fiber-sheathed vessels, may offer mechanical flexibility in vines, just as presence of wide rays does. However, starch-rich axial parenchyma adjacent to vessels may provide not merely a means of storing to facilitate growth events but, additionally, a way in which hydrolysis of starch could result in movement of sugar into vessels, permitting osmotic entry of water into given areas. Adaptations which seem to lend safety to the hydrosystem are much less in vines and lianas of perpetually moist tropical regions than they are in taxa subject to periods of drought or frost...|$|R
5000|$|From {{the early}} twentieth century, the {{anthophyte}} hypothesis was the prevailing explanation for seed plant evolution, based on shared morphological characters between the gnetophytes and angiosperms. In this hypothesis, the gnetophytes, along with the extinct order Bennettitales, are sister to the angiosperms, forming the [...] "anthophytes". [...] Some morphological characters that were suggested to unite the anthophytes include vessels in wood, net-veined leaves (in Gnetum only), lignin chemistry, the layering of cells in the apical meristem, pollen and megaspore features (including thin megaspore wall), short cambial initials, and lignin syringal groups. However, most genetic studies have rejected the anthophyte hypothesis. Several of these {{studies have suggested that}} the gnetophytes and angiosperms have independently derived characters, including flower-like reproductive structures and <b>tracheid</b> vessel elements, that appear shared but are actually the result of parallel evolution.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Wood=== The fibrillar {{structure}} of wood {{is said to}} {{play a significant role}} in both the mechanical stability and ability of wood to possess channels to transport minerals and water. Sprucewood (Picea abies), among others, are reported to possess cellulose fibrils with a normalized diameter of 2.5 nm. There is also a reported link between the age of the wood and the spiral angle of the fibrils with respect to the longitudinal direction. Earlywood is said to have a consistent 4.6 ± 0.6° rest angle, whereas latewood is said to have a transition region from 4.6° to 19.8 ± 0.7°. [...] In latewood, the two spiral angle regions of cellulose fibrils are not continuous, meaning that there are two independent <b>tracheid</b> structures in “older” trees meeting different mechanical requirements. Moreover, longitudinally oriented fibrils improve tensile strength, whereas the addition of 20° tilted fibrils, exclusive to latewood tracheids, provides stability against compression.|$|E
5000|$|In most plants, pitted tracheids {{function}} as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the <b>tracheid,</b> is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes. The presence of vessels in xylem has been considered {{to be one of}} the key innovations that led to the success of the angiosperms. However, the occurrence of vessel elements is not restricted to angiosperms, and they are absent in some archaic or [...] "basal" [...] lineages of the angiosperms: (e.g., Amborellaceae, Tetracentraceae, Trochodendraceae, and Winteraceae), and their secondary xylem is described by Arthur Cronquist as [...] "primitively vesselless". Cronquist considered the vessels of Gnetum to be convergent with those of angiosperms. Whether the absence of vessels in basal angiosperms is a primitive condition is contested, the alternative hypothesis states that vessel elements originated in a precursor to the angiosperms and were subsequently lost.|$|E

Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and <b>tracheids</b> are dead at maturity. <b>Tracheids</b> have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends.

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 11 collections of eight taxa. Diameter {{and length of}} <b>tracheids</b> are related to plant size, but populations in cooler locations have narrower and shorter <b>tracheids</b> than one would expect {{on the basis of}} plant size and age, and smaller <b>tracheids</b> are believed to be of selective value in these environments because of their resistance to embolisms. Vesturing is absent from <b>tracheids</b> in taxa from warmer localities but pronounced in colder places; this, too, is a probable mechanism for resistance to embolism formation. Helical thickenings are reported for one collection of T. insipida; these thickenings, otherwise known in the family only from Pseudowintera, may play a role similar to vesturing. Scalariform pitting on end walls of <b>tracheids</b> occurs during {{the first three years of}} secondary xylem formation, and may also occur after cambial trauma. Axial parenchyma is scarce to absent, and diffuse when present. Rays in Tasmannia wood have relatively few procumbent cells. A summary wood description for the family is presented, and a key to the eight genera is given. Although wood anatomy does contain some features of generic value, data from floral morphology, pollen structure, and leaf anatomy more strongly support the recognition of eight genera. Some species have very distinctive features, but genera are difficult to define; pending acquisition of chemical data, eight genera may be provisionally recognized. The only feature considered as a possible phylogenetic trend in wood within the family is an increased tendency for alternate pits to supplant scalariform pits on end walls of <b>tracheids.</b> <b>Tracheids</b> of Winteraceae demonstrate that scalariform pitting is pervasive and preserved in a flexible way; alternate pits are hypothesized to have been evolved in the family for increased wall strength.

The results also support the latitudinal gradient of C3 and C4 grasses. The stereomicrowear analyses for N. platensis exhibited average scratch and pit values, which place it within the extant mixed-feeder morphospace and the higher frequency of fine scratches indicated the ingestion of C3 grasses. Alternatively, the presence of coarse and hypercoarse scratches along with gouges and large pits suggests the ingestion of foliage and lignified portions. The plant microfossil analysis recovered fragments of conifer <b>tracheid</b> and vessel elements with a ray of parenchyma cells, which corroborates the consumption of wood plants, pollen grains, spores, and fibers. The Aguas de Araxa gomphotheres were feeding generalists and consumed wood elements, leaves, and C3 grasses.

Vessel grouping does occur to various degrees in taxa with fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers; the degree of grouping is related to likelihood or seriousness of vessel failure by air embolisms because of either drought or frost. Grouping of vessels {{is regarded as a}} way of providing alternate conduits whereby water can be carried in the same pathways in case one or several vessels in a group are incapacitated by air embolisms. Presence of vascular <b>tracheids,</b> if sufficiently abundant, is held to be correlated with smaller degree of vessel grouping because vascular <b>tracheids</b> can form a subsidiary conductive system; small numbers of vascular <b>tracheids</b> do not affect vessel grouping patterns. Species which possess vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> possess a subsidiary conductive system ideally located around vessels and have solitary vessels or else (ifvasicentric <b>tracheids</b> are less common) a low degree of vessel grouping. Species with very large vessels at the beginning of growth rings tend to have little grouping in the earlywood vessels but more grouping in latewood vessels; this dimorphism is held to relate to enhanced safety oflatewood vessels, since earlywood vessels have little safety and the latewood is thereby the wood portion where safety mechanisms are concentrated. Fiber-tracheids do not have sufficient conductive capabilities to form a subsidiary conductive system; borders on pits of fiber-tracheids are rapidly lost during evolution, and such loss generally pr~cedes appearance of septate or nucleated conditions or is simultaneous with it. Relative selective value of the various vessel grouping types (clusters, radial multiples, diagonal bands, tangential bands) as well as of larger aggregations remains a topic for more investigation, as does significance of grouping of primary xylem vessels...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{kinetics}} of embolus formation and {{collapse in the}} <b>tracheids</b> of Thuja occidentalis L. stem segments. Radial wood sections were trimmed to 4 mm long paralleling the <b>tracheids</b> by 1 mm wide and 0. 1 mm thick. They were observed under a dissecting microscope at 128 x while sections were dehydrated and rehydrated. During dehydration, cavitations resulted {{in the formation of}} emboli in <b>tracheids,</b> but we concluded that the cavitated <b>tracheids</b> did not immediately fill with air at atmospheric pressure. This conclusion was based on the time required for the emboli to collapse after the rewetting of the dehydrated segment. By hypothesis, the time for the emboli to collapse should be proportional to the amount of air in the emboli. The time for all the emboli to collapse was a linear function of the dehydration time for times up to 15 min. For dehydrations greater than 80 min, the time for collapse after rewetting was constant, and we concluded that the <b>tracheids</b> have saturated with air by 80 min of dehydration. The kinetics of embolus formation is discussed in terms of the air-seeding hypothesis for cavitation, and collapse is discussed in terms of the physics of gas dissolution and diffusion. Embolus formation and dissolution in intact herbaceous and woody plants should follow the same physical laws...|$|R
