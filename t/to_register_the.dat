5|$|The airline sent an {{application}} <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> Caravelle in April, but the application was cancelled {{later in the}} month, and the aircraft was subsequently registered in Sweden. By June the airline had still not received permission to operate, causing problems for Vestlandsreiser, who had to make last-minute leases of aircraft, and had to terminate all flights from Stavanger.|$|E
5|$|Drivers had two hours, split {{over two}} days, Friday and Saturday, <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> fastest {{possible}} time. The driver who could register the fastest time would start on pole position, {{giving them a}} headstart of eight metres over the second-fastest driver, who started {{on the opposite side}} of the track. Third place would start eight metres behind the second-fastest driver and on the side of the track where the first placed car is. This practice continues until twenty-sixth place, and the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth placed cars are not allowed to race.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{acquired}} 18 E-3As {{and support}} equipment for a NATO air defense force. Since all aircraft must be registered {{with a certain}} country, {{the decision was made}} <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> 18 NATO Sentries with Luxembourg, a NATO member that previously did not have any air force. The first NATO E-3 was delivered in January 1982. The eighteen E-3s were operated by Number 1, 2 and 3 Squadrons of NATO's E-3 Component, based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen. Presently, 16 NATO E-3As are in the inventory, since one E-3 was lost in a crash and one was retired from service in 2015 (see below).|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a {{campaign}} began <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> Glamorgan sausage under the European Union geographical indications and traditional specialities scheme. This {{would have resulted}} in only Glamorgan sausages that were made in Glamorgan being labelled as such. The move was led by Greta Watts-Jones, who runs the Cwrt Newydd company in Cowbridge, which was the only major manufacturer in the area. Her main competitor, Cauldron Foods, is based in Bristol, England. This protection had previously been extended to Welsh lamb and beef. The vote to gain this status, alongside Caerphilly cheese, was held in March 2006 at the European Parliament, but was not passed into law.|$|E
5|$|Shiva {{instantly}} agrees {{and drives}} her to Mumbai. Shiva {{tries to get}} into a conversation with Charulatha. She initially refuses to talk, but eventually gives in and tells him about her background. It comes to light that Charulatha's mother, who had always supported her daughter, died after a violent altercation with her father; since then her father has tried to force Charulatha to marry an unknown man of his choice. Not willing to bow to her father's wishes, she had escaped from home, but was later found by her father's business partner, Jayaraman, her supposed uncle. He was about to take her <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> marriage arranged by her father when Charulatha tried to escape, leaving him behind at the filling station. Now she wants to head to Mumbai to stay at her grandmother's home.|$|E
5|$|The Dubna team {{repeated}} the experiment in 2012, creating seven atoms of element 117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element 118 (produced {{after some time}} when a significant quantity of the berkelium-249 target had beta decayed to californium-249). The results of the experiment matched the previous outcome; the scientists then filed an application <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> element. In May 2014, a joint German–American collaboration of scientists from the ORNL and the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element. The team {{repeated the}} Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element 117.|$|E

5|$|Under Canadian law, miners {{first had}} to get a license, either when they arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay claim to mining rights over it. To stake a claim, a prospector would drive stakes into the ground a measured distance apart and then return to Dawson <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> claim for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a claim in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|E
5|$|In November 1380, Parliament {{was called}} {{together}} again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, {{and the risk}} of the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons were told that the colossal sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples) which they estimated would raise £66,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing <b>to</b> <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> marriages in a registrar office.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and allowed herself to be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{soundtrack of}} Ocarina of Time {{was published by}} Pony Canyon and released in Japan on December 18, 1998. It comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks. A US version was also released, although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork. Many critics praised the music in Ocarina of Time, although IGN was disappointed that the traditional Zelda overworld theme was not included. In 2001, {{three years after the}} initial release of Ocarina of Time, GameSpot labeled it {{as one of the top}} ten video game soundtracks. The soundtrack, at the time, was not released in Europe or Australia. In 2011, however, a 51-track limited edition soundtrack for the 3DS version was available in a free mail out through a Club Nintendo offer to owners of the 3DS edition, as an incentive <b>to</b> <b>register</b> <b>the</b> product. The original musical theme for the Fire Temple area was altered before release of the game, due to Nintendo's policy of not including real religious references in their products, with the altered theme simply removing the chanting samples.|$|E
