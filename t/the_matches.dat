Hardy dominated earlier part of <b>the</b> <b>match</b> until X-Pac got control of <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> Throughout <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> Hardy and X-Pac did cruiserweight action. In the closing moments of <b>the</b> <b>match,</b> X-Pac hit Hardy with an X-Factor and pinned him. However, as <b>the</b> <b>match</b> ended, <b>the</b> referee realized that Hardy's foot {{was on the}} rope and <b>the</b> <b>match</b> continued. Hardy executed a Swanton Bomb and got the pinfall to retain the Light Heavyweight Championship.|$|R
5|$|The {{pay-per-view}} {{also included}} two other title matches. Mr. Perfect lost his WWF Intercontinental Championship to the Texas Tornado, {{who was a}} substitute for Brutus Beefcake, who had been injured in a real-life parasailing accident. The Hart Foundation won the WWF Tag Team Championship from Demolition in a {{two out of three}} falls match. Each of <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> was built up through feuds scripted by the WWF's writers, and <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> that took place at the event had pre-determined outcomes that had been decided by the WWF.|$|E
5|$|The series usually {{alternates}} between England and West Indies, {{and within}} each country each of <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> is {{held at the}} following grounds.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>match</b> {{finished}} 2-2 after 90 minutes, and was {{marred by}} a pitch invasion during <b>the</b> <b>match</b> half-time, with considerable amount of fans staying around the pitch during the second half, occasionally disrupting <b>the</b> <b>match.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>match</b> itself, Maccabi took the a 2-0 by the 48th minute and Hakoah equalized by scoring twice within the last 15 minutes of <b>the</b> <b>match.</b>|$|R
25|$|If an umpire or match {{official}} deems that a bowler is contravening law 24.3, he details this in <b>the</b> <b>match</b> report {{which is}} passed on <b>the</b> <b>match</b> referee.

5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after <b>the</b> <b>matches,</b> the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E

5|$|In late 1970, Young's brother, Chris died aged 31, {{an event}} which {{affected}} Young deeply. His performances for Manchester City suffered as a result.

5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms in which all <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> are compatible with each other. A special case of this method {{is the use of}} the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E
