25|$|In a {{classroom}} {{there may be}} many different guided instruction groups. Each group may be working on a different skill or at a different level. Fisher's model recommends meeting with groups 1–3 times per week, with some groups meeting more frequently and other stronger groups meeting less often. The size of the groups will also vary {{depending on how much}} face time is required for the particular skill. It is a common misconception that guided instruction is only for struggling students. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for teachers to provide enrichment for strong students. Guided instruction is based on the pedagogical principles of scaffolding.|$|E

500|$|Barrons {{attained}} general officer {{status in}} 2008, {{when he was}} promoted to the substantive rank of major general and appointed Deputy Commanding General, Multi-National Corps – Iraq. He was posted to Baghdad, where he had responsibility for overseeing joint operations conducted by the multinational force and the Iraqi Army. Having served in Iraq, he returned to the UK to take up a staff post in April 2009 as chief of staff to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), but the appointment was short-lived as, in October 2009, he deployed to Afghanistan at short notice to establish a force reintegration unit, {{part of an effort to}} persuade Taliban fighters to rejoin society by offering alternatives to fighting, such as jobs and training—a role for which he was hand-picked by U.S. Army General Stanley A. McChrystal, then commander of all troops in Afghanistan. Barrons defended the controversial scheme in interviews, saying that it was not [...] "about buying insurgents off the battlefield" [...] and that [...] "the idea is that you get the whole community benefiting and turning against the insurgency". In a later interview, Barrons also said [...] "I am absolutely convinced it can be done, and that the time is right. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> the Afghan people aren't going to get again.

I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for me to have a chance at it again."

50|$|Even {{with the}} {{application}} of 1926 laws, the election result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> deadlock. Since no party totaled 40%, it became impossible to form government.

The ECB would not agree, arguing that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for players to showcase their ability to the first-class counties. The squad has endured some criticism, not least for the Unicorns moniker; sports journalist Peter May said that what {{was intended to be}} a Minor Counties Select XI, featuring some of the best amateurs in the country, has included a disproportionate number of players from London with MCC or ECB connections.
