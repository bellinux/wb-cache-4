5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are found}} in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> four {{parathyroid}} glands, while other types of animals <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> six. The removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle contractions.|$|E

5|$|As in the US, large Canadian {{newspapers}} <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> a page {{of comic}} strips in their daily editions and a full-colour Sunday comics section on Saturdays or Sundays. Editorial cartoonists are also common; the Association of Canadian Editorial Cartoonists is a professional association founded in 1988 to promote their interests.|$|E

5|$|Because {{species of}} aetosaurs <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> {{restricted}} fossil ranges and are {{abundant in the}} strata they are found in, they are useful in biochronology. Osteoderms {{are the most common}} remains associated with aetosaurs, so a single identifiable scute can accurately date the layer it is found in.|$|E
5|$|Fish <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> {{quite small}} brains {{relative}} to body size {{compared with other}} vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry {{is useful}} in the diagnosis and {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E

5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> high melting and boiling points, and {{are hard}} and brittle. As solids {{they are almost}} always electrically insulating, but when melted or dissolved they become highly conductive, because the ions are mobilized.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an extremely high Q with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose Q {{is limited by the}} resistance of the inductor coils.|$|E
5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying {{adjacent}} territory form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while others are not. Adjacent dialects <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> relatively high degrees of mutual intelligibility, but the degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.|$|E

5|$|Most starfish {{have five}} arms that radiate from a central disc, {{but the number}} varies with the group. Luidia ciliaris has seven arms, members of the Solasteridae have ten to fifteen while the Antarctic Labidiaster annulatus can have up to fifty. It is not unusual in species that <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> five arms for some {{individuals}} to possess six or more through abnormal development.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous carcinomas are a rare form of endometrial cancer, {{making up}} less than 1–2% of all {{diagnosed}} endometrial cancer. Mucinous endometrial carcinomas are most often stage I and grade I, giving them a good prognosis. They <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> well-differentiated columnar cells organized into glands with the characteristic mucin in the cytoplasm. Mucinous carcinomas must be differentiated from cervical adenocarcinoma.|$|E

5|$|Speech {{assessment}} {{also contributes}} to assessment of mood, for example people with mania or anxiety may have rapid, loud and pressured speech; {{on the other hand}} depressed patients will <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow, quiet and hesitant manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} {{is the most}} common human disease and affects people all over the globe. Adults <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> two to five infections annually, and {{children}} may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.|$|E
5|$|When two {{distinct}} types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> intermediate traits (e.g., one plant parent has red flowers, {{the other has}} white, and the hybrid, pink flowers). Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a bird hybrid might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).|$|E

5|$|With plants: Fungi have a {{cell wall}} and vacuoles. They {{reproduce}} by both sexual and asexual means, and like basal plant groups (such as ferns and mosses) produce spores. Similar to mosses and algae, fungi <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> haploid nuclei.|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees <b>typically</b> <b>have</b> many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
