To {{improve the}} working {{reliability}} of the high-speed gears of full mounted converter <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> and to avoid resonance during working, the dynamics modeling of the high-speed gears is concerned. The three-dimensional model of the high-speed gears is established by using Pro/E, and the vibration modal analysis under definition contact and not definition contact are processed by using Ansys. The natural frequency and natural vibration mode of lower order vibration are obtained by the analysis, {{and it can be}} found that there has essential difference between definition contact and not definition contact.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the design of}} an automobile <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> for tilting of automobile bodies at mechanical workshops, when the need for maintenance arises; especially welding to be performed beneath them is always achieved using an existing traditional tilting technique. The traditional technique involves manual lifting and positioning of the automobile body with one of its sides on the work floor, after which supporting implements such as wooden bars, metal rods, worn-out tyres and pestles are used to keep the tilted bodies at the desired position. This technique has always been resulting to higher worker fatigue and much risk of worker injury, endangering the lives of mechanics. The designing and selection of the automobile <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> components {{were based on the}} application of machine design and hydraulic principles and laws. The height and the degree of tilt of the device are controlled by the position of the control lever of the direction control valve regulating the fluid flow into the tilting and lifting cylinders. This hydraulic automobile <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> is designed to provide a more effective and efficient technique for tilting and supporting tilted automobile bodies, thereby minimizing and eliminating the risks involved when employing the existing traditional technique.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} measuring the credit risk in portfolios of loans, bonds, and other instruments subject to possible default under multi-factor models. Due {{to the amount of}} the portfolio, the heterogeneous effect of obligors, and the phenomena that default events are rare and mutually dependent, it is difficult to calculate portfolio credit risk either by means of direct analysis or crude Monte Carlo under such models. To capture the extreme dependence among obligors, we provide an efficient simulation method for multi- factor models with a normal mixture copula that allows the multivariate defaults to have an asymmetric distribution, while most of the previous literature focuses on simulating one dimensional cases. To this end, we first propose a general account of an importance sampling algorithm based on a two-parameter exponential embedding. Note that this innovative <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> is more suitable for the multivariate normal mixture model than traditional one-parameter tilting methods and is of independent interest. Next, by utilizing a fast computational method for how the rare event occurs and the proposed importance sampling method, we provide an efficient simulation algorithm to estimate the probability that the portfolio incurs large losses under the normal mixture copula. Here our proposed simulation device is based on importance sampling for a joint probability other than the conditional probability used in previous studies. Theoretical investigations and simulation studies, which include an empirical example, are given to illustrate the method. Comment: 27 page...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} {{two main}} parts : (i) A compilation of flow {{properties of the}} most difficult bulk solid materials handled by the Raw Materials area of Australian Iron 2 ̆ 6 Steel, and a check on the various bin designs used in this area of the plant to predict flow behaviour with these materials. (ii) A study of the effect of vibration on the strength of bulk solid materials and on the frictional forces between a surface and a material such as exists in vibrating baffles or vibrating panels. The first part of the work was done using the experimental methods of Jenike, a pioneer in this field. The vibration section involved the construction of a suitable vibrating machine and shaking samples of ore in the Jenike shear cell either before shearing or during shearing. To get more accurate results when shearing was taking place during vibration, a special <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> was used in preference to the Jenike machine It may be concluded from {{the first part of the}} work that many bins are not designed properly for the material they are expected to handle, and only the use of mechanical flow promoting devices and frequent cleaning particularly in wet weather keep the materials flowing. The vibration work showed two contrasting points: (a) that a confined sample of material gains considerable strength due to over-consolidation during vibration, and (b) the same confined sample has a considerably lower wall friction when the wall is being vibrated...|$|E
40|$|Under {{physiological}} conditions, mammalian oocytes and embryos {{appear to}} be stimulated not only chemically but also mechanically, such as by compression, shear stress and/or friction force in the follicle and female reproductive tract. The present study was undertaken {{to examine the effects}} of kinetic culture with a <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> in chemically defined media during in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes and in vitro culture (IVC) following in vitro fertilization (IVF) on the early developmental competence and quality of blastocysts. After culture in a chemically defined IVM medium, modified porcine oocyte medium (mPOM) containing gonadotropins and dibutyryl cAMP for 20 h, the mean diameter of the cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) was larger in the tilting culture than in the static controls, whereas the diameter of the oocytes did not differ. When culture of the COCs was continued additionally in a fresh medium without gonadotropins and dibutyryl cAMP for 24 h, the incidences of oocytes completing GVBD and developing to the metaphase-II stage did not differ between the tilting and static culture systems. Furthermore, the sperm penetration after IVF and developmental competence of the oocytes to the blastocyst stage were not different between the tilting and static systems during IVM and IVC. However, tilting culture during both IVM and IVC had a significant positive effect on the number of cells per blastocyst (P< 0. 05). These observations indicate that tilting culture during IVM and IVC in chemically defined media improves the quality of blastocyst, as determined by the number of cells per blastocyst, without any effects on penetrability and developmental competence...|$|E

40|$|The {{resolution}} {{along the}} optical axis {{is much less}} than the lateral resolution in both confocal and conventional fluorescence light microscopy. To correct for the anisotropy in resolution one may generate tilted views from the same object and subsequently merge these tilted views into one image with improved isotropic resolution. It has been suggested to obtain tilted views in confocal theta microscopy with double observation by illuminating the object from one side and simultaneously detecting the emitted light in the direction parallel to the illumination direction and in a direction with an angle theta to the illumination direction. Alternatively, one might use the usual optical set-up of a light microscope together with a <b>tilting</b> <b>device</b> to rotate the object under the microscope. With this method the object can be viewed from all directions (axial tomography). In this paper we investigate two methods for merging tilted views. If the image sets obtained from the different tilt angles are interpreted as statistic samples of one and the same object, a gain in resolution along the optical axis is accompanied by a significant trade-off in lateral resolution. An optical interpretation of the image formation in each single object point by retaining the frequencies with the highest amplitudes in the different tilted views provides a gain in axial resolution without significant decrease in lateral resolution. We will describe a quantitative method to determine the gain in resolution dependent on the number and geometry of the tilted views. It will be demonstrated that a previously suggested reconstruction method implying a multiplication of tilted views in the spatial domain does not improve resolution. Simulated reconstructions based on measured point spread functions in axial tomography and confocal theta microscopy with double observation will demonstrate the validity of our reconstruction methods...|$|E
40|$|Steel {{point and}} line rocker {{bearings}} {{are used in}} civil engineering, especially in bridge construction. Technical literature does not provide any data of the rolling-off resistance in the rocker parts of such bearings. Therefore the experimental determination of this resistance was the main objective of this research project. Using a special <b>tilting</b> <b>device,</b> tests were conducted on point rocker sliding bearings with pressure contact plates of steel St 52 and stainless steel whereby the level of loading (Hertzian stress in the contact surfaces) and the thickness' of the contact components were varied. The rolling-off resistance at rocker's maximum rotation of tan a= 0. 01 were calculated from the measured results and presented in diagrams. Also permanent deformations of the contact plates were measured. In addition the Hertzian formulas and the material stress' for point contact were described in more detail. Rolling-off and rolling resistance were compared using empirically derived formulas. Test results show the following: The rolling-off resistance is influenced significantly by the Hertzian stress' in the contact surfaces, the material quality, the level of preloading, plastic deformations and thickness of the contact components {{as well as the}} rotation angle. Contrary to present regulations, not only the geometric excentricity but also the rolling-off resistance should be taken into account when Hertzian stress' in the contact surface are significantly higher than those at local yielding of the contact plates. According to the present state of knowledge, the permissible Hertzian stress' given in different standards should be reduced for rocker bearings. As for roller bearings, the permissible contact pressure should be correlated with the amount of the rolling-off resistance. At the tilting angles investigated, the rolling-off resistance of rocker bearings is significantly smaller than the rolling resistance of roller bearings. The rolling-off resistance was experimentally determined {{for the first time with}} the investigations presented here. In view of the numerous factors of influence, several questions could not be answered in a complete and final manner. (orig.)
