5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group would have to produce the assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. The designs were frozen in July. Green Bamboo was also nominally frozen, but <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> design continued. On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another ₤1.5 million.|$|E
25|$|Of late, {{he came in}} for {{criticism}} for his <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> batting lineup and unorthodox cricket coaching methods. Several senior Indian players whom Chappell coached have come out to criticize his methods, including Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh, and Zaheer Khan His comments also did not go down well with the Indian public. However, his coaching and methods were not very effective as India crashed out of the World Cup in the first round, {{the first time since}} 1992. Embattled coach Greg Chappell resigned after reports that none of the senior players, including Tendulkar, were happy with him and his coaching methods. His rift with arguably India's most successful captain, Sourav Ganguly and poor performance of team in 2007 world cup, made Chappell, a dark figure in the history of Indian Cricket.|$|E
25|$|Subrahmanyam long {{argued for}} {{revamping}} India's national security decision-making apparatus, {{and was also}} vociferous in his criticism of several governments' efforts at <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> system. He was particularly critical of successive Indian governments' lackadaisical approach to long-term strategic planning, and their similar attitudes {{to the creation of}} specialised positions and resources. One noted target of such criticism was his civil service batch mate Brajesh Mishra, who served as both National Security Adviser—when that post was created—and Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 1998 to 2004. Subrahmanyam repeatedly called for bifurcating both key posts, in commentary sometimes so strong that it even appeared to precipitate a public spat between the two. This bifurcation of posts was finally done by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in consultation with Subrahmanyam, upon assuming office in 2004. The establishment of a National Defence University by the government is also something he long demanded. Despite several recommendations, including those from a government committee Subrahmanyam himself chaired, this is yet to be set up.|$|E

500|$|The {{first five}} hundred years of Omni-Tek's control of Rubi-Ka were marked with an {{exemplary}} worker treatment record. However, as time passed, their policies degraded. Their scientists' <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mutating effects of Notum on the colonists in a quest for efficiency lead to large numbers of failed experiments. Survivors of these experiments became the game's four playable races, or Breeds, each designed by Omni-Tek to specialize in a type of work. Together with the original [...] "Solitus" [...] race, the genetically engineered Herculean [...] "Atrox," [...] the intelligent [...] "Nanomages," [...] and the nimble [...] "Opifexes," [...] they continued their labor {{in the midst of}} an increasingly hostile and totalitarian culture. This caused a significant number of workers to rebel, and begin to trade stolen Notum to a rival corporation. These rebel groups, collectively calling themselves the Clans, fought a series of wars with Omni-Tek over the next several centuries.|$|E

500|$|Mullally {{revealed}} that the show's writing team was [...] "notorious for <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> script's laugh lines", even during the actual taping of the episodes. She hoped they would resist that urge for the live episode. Messing, however, was sure that the writers would interfere during the broadcasts; [...] "I have a gut feeling that, like, 10 minutes before we go they'll be like, 'Oh, no, no, you know what? Change this line to this. Now we're locked – go.'" [...] Prior to the live episode, the cast had shot the second, third and fourth episodes of the season. Shortly before this episode, Mullally injured her foot {{and was unable to}} walk without crutches. The writers therefore had to put Mullally's character, Karen, in a cast and a motorized scooter, ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe.|$|E
500|$|Bilson and DeMeo then {{submitted}} their seven-page film {{treatment to}} Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that [...] "Disney {{felt that they}} needed {{a different approach to}} the script, which meant bringing in someone else. But those scripts were thrown out and we were always brought back on". They found the studio's constant <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> screenplay to be a frustrating process as [...] "executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had been thrown out two years ago were put back in. What was the point"? DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid cliché aspects that would stereotype Jenny as a damsel in distress. The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. Joe Johnston, a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and pre-production started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally greenlighted The Rocketeer.|$|E
500|$|The Commission's final report, Powers for a Purpose was {{published}} on 18 March 2014, setting out recommendations {{that would be}} implemented if Scotland voted no in the referendum, and Labour were elected in 2015. The proposals included allowing the Scottish Parliament to raise as much as 40% of its annual revenue, and giving it greater leeway to vary income tax rates {{from those in the}} rest of the UK. The plans would build on the powers devolved under the 2012 Scotland Act, which legislated for an increase in responsibility over taxation from 2016, in exchange for a 10% reduction in the grant received from Westminster. The Commission also recommended devolving responsibility in some other fiscal areas, such as the payment of Housing Benefit and the possible levy of a mansion tax in Scotland, but decided against taking charge of other financial matters, including state pensions, National Insurance and tariffs on North Sea oil. Other proposals were to retain the Barnett formula, give Scotland control over its railways, and transfer authority for dissolving parliament and holding elections from Westminster to Holyrood. Lamont described the proposals as [...] "the right balance between fiscal accountability and insuring us against risk". Ben Thomson, chair of the cross-party Devo Plus think tank argued the plans were [...] "just <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> current system" [...] and would allow the SNP to [...] "say that the unionist parties aren't interested in real devolution". Deputy First Minister Sturgeon welcomed the prospect of increased devolution, but said a vote for independence was the only way to ensure greater powers for Scotland as [...] "there [...] no guarantee that any new powers would be delivered in the event of a no vote". The proposals were subsequently endorsed by delegates at Scottish Labour's 2014 party conference.|$|E

2500|$|After <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{project for}} a further three weeks, the Department {{returned}} to the beach.

Despite these failures, Shute and his team persevered, removing the third wheel and attaching steel cables to the remaining two wheels as a basic form of steering. Panjandrum proved to be too powerful however, snapping the cables and whipping them back across the beach when they were used. More weeks were spent testing every conceivable variable from thicker cables to heavier rocket-clamps without success before the DMWD received notification that the weapon was only required to be consistently able to travel {{in the general direction of}} the enemy.

Heil replaced the 15-inch speakers with JBL D140s, and added an array of four radial horns and ring tweeters all driven by McIntosh amplifiers. He has stated [...] "That made a huge difference. It was like a big 'hi-fi' system. Except for Bill Hanley of Hanley Sound (Medford, MA) no one was putting radial horns into PA systems; they were just doing speakers in columns, like the Vocalmaster.

[...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly magazine rated the album [...] "A-" [...] {{and called it}} their best album, while Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, wrote a mixed review explaining [...] "Viva la Vidas mild <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> formula represents a failure of imagination: perhaps it's hard to {{think outside the box}} when the box is the size of the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena. Equally, however, there's a genuine conviction about its contents, a huge advance both on its predecessor and their legion of imitators." [...] Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that [...] "Coldplay's desire to unite fans around the world with an entertainment they can all relate to is the band's strength, and a worthy goal. But on Viva la Vida, a record that wants to make strong statements, it's also a weakness. Sometimes, to say what needs to be said, you need to risk pissing people off." [...] Melodic magazine's critic Kaj Roth gave the album 4/5 and felt that [...] "the typical Coldplay trademark is there too with beautiful atmospheric melodies that will embrace the heart". Spin magazine's critic Mikael Wood said in a positive review of the album, [...] "For all of Coldplay's experimentation, though, there's no doubting that Viva la Vida, with its sturdy melodies and universal themes -- think love, war and peace -- is an album meant to connect with the masses (arenas have been built for less than the climax of [...] "Death and All His Friends"). The band's triumph lies in how exciting they make that prospect seem". IGN gave the album 9.3/10 and Q said [...] "...So some habits die hard, but on every other level Viva La Vida...is an emphatic success...radical in its own measured way but easy to embrace..."
