5|$|Queen Ranavalona {{continued}} the military incursions initiated under Radama I to pacify neighboring kingdoms and maintain their submission to Merina rule. These policies had a strongly {{negative effect on}} economic and population growth during her reign. Fanompoana labor among the population of Imerina could include conscription into the military, enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers. This army, which was sent on repeated expeditions into neighboring provinces, exacted harsh penalties against communities resistant to Merina domination. Mass executions were common, {{and those who were}} spared their lives were commonly brought back to Imerina as slaves (andevo) and their valuables seized as booty to increase the wealth of the Crown. Approximately one million slaves entered Imerina from coastal areas between 1820 and 1853, constituting one-third of the total population in the central highlands and <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> residents in Antananarivo.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003 general {{elections}} were held again, and the CPP won. However, {{they failed to}} secure <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> parliamentary seats, {{as required by the}} constitution to form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed both parties to change their decision, stating that he would abstain from presiding over the ceremony as well if they did not comply with his wishes. Both parties eventually backed off from their threats, and the swearing-in ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a unity government jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{provided}} about <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the ordnance {{used by the}} Allies {{in terms}} of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition. Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition. While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so. To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers; Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.|$|E

5|$|A {{hypothesis}} of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers, {{but have not}} been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus, and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps {{the result of the}} physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of senescence. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceros. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality.|$|E
5|$|Linfield and Glentoran {{have been}} the two most {{successful}} clubs in Northern Irish football to date, regularly being the two main contenders for honours.

In comparison, Glentoran have won 23 league titles, 22 Irish Cups and seven League Cups. Almost half (47.4%) of the 135 Irish Cup competitions to date have been won by one of the two clubs, with {{at least one of the}} clubs reaching the final on 88 occasions (65.2% of all finals), winning the cup a combined 64 times. Of those 88 finals, the two clubs have met in 15 of them – making it the most common final. Linfield have won eight of the head-to-head final meetings compared to Glentoran's seven wins, with the most recent meeting between the two clubs in the final occurring in 2006, when Linfield won 2–1 to lift the Cup for the 37th time. Approximately <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Irish League titles have been won by one of the Big Two.

5000|$|Proposition 218 {{does not}} legally authorize any local {{government}} to levy a sales tax. [...] The legal authority to levy a local sales tax {{must come from}} a state statute.

5000|$|An {{example of}} an {{additional}} statutory restriction is a supermajority vote requirement of the governing body of the local government to place a local tax measure on the ballot.

[...] A <b>two-thirds</b> vote <b>of</b> <b>all</b> members <b>of</b> the legislative body of the local government is also generally required before a local sales tax measure may be presented to voters at an election. [...] With a typical local governing body of five members, this generally means that four affirmative votes (instead of the usual three affirmative votes) are needed to place a local tax on the ballot when a two-thirds supermajority vote is required.
