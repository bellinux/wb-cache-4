5|$|Muslim {{scholars}} divided inference {{into three}} types. The {{first is the}} expression of the connection existing between one proposition and another without any specific effective cause. Next, inference could mean presumption that a state of <b>things,</b> <b>which</b> is not proved to have ceased, still continues. The final type of inference is the authority as to the revealed laws previous to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Hemming's {{introduction}} {{to his work}} (Prefatio) claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about the <b>things</b> <b>which</b> have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} with developmental disabilities, occurrence of self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these <b>things</b> <b>which</b> they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E

5|$|Married people, however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati. It {{is said that}} her worship creates a feeling of wanting {{solitude}} and distaste of worldly <b>things,</b> <b>which</b> is considered as highest characteristics of a spiritual quest. Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at the end}} of the 14th century, {{no doubt}} on account of the devastation caused mid-century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many <b>things</b> <b>which</b> would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E
5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition {{meant more}} to Floyd even than trade advantages and justice; {{it was another}} step in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political plexus which had {{made it impossible for}} one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, without creating a corresponding movement in each of the others. He was tired of negotiating the <b>things</b> <b>which</b> related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E

Siddhu is attracted by her cheerful nature and energy, {{and the couple}} begin to meet on a regular basis. As the days go by, Siddhu grows to admire the ever-friendly Hasini as someone who does what she loves, and he discovers many small <b>things</b> <b>which</b> make him happy {{to be in her}} company; he realizes that he has fallen in love with her.|$|E
5|$|Chizuru, nicknamed Chii-chan, {{is a tall}} {{girl who}} first appears as a classmate of Shuichi when they both enter junior high school. She is Momoko's {{childhood}} friend, and has a stylish demeanor, highlighted by her stature and long hair, which captivates both Shuichi and Yoshino when they first meet her. Chizuru {{is described as a}} free spirit, someone who enjoys doing unconventional, often outrageous <b>things</b> <b>which</b> surprise those around her; she frequently acts without thinking, and as a result projects a childish personality. Her impulsive behavior sometimes gets her in trouble with other characters, but she quickly becomes ashamed when she realizes the consequences. She tries to be everyone's friend, though Saori strongly dislikes her impulsiveness. Chizuru joins the girls' basketball team in junior high. Her family runs a soba restaurant.|$|E
5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had <b>things</b> <b>which</b> he wanted to do with the team.|$|E

5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of <b>things</b> <b>which</b> the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Trenggalek, Sudirman and {{his group}} were stopped by TNI {{soldiers}} belonging to 102Battalion. These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman– who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding them– was a prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, <b>things</b> <b>which</b> may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent {{to pick up the}} general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.|$|E
