30|$|Taking {{off from}} a {{stakeholder}} perspective, this paper has studied environmental practices as reflected in offerings and requirements on the logistics market. In addition to a systematic literature review, two empirical data sets (one <b>home</b> <b>page</b> scan and one case study of four LSP–shipper relationships) {{have been included in}} the research. The empirical results point to a wider scope of environmental practices as offerings and requirements on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> than in actual business relationships between LSPs and shippers. Further, the environmental practices presented on <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> are to a large extent of general character, whereas the practices are found to be relationship specific in some of the cases. Explanations for some of these discrepancies are suggested to be found in stakeholder theory; <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>pages</b> are a form of mass communication with the potential to reach a wide variety of stakeholders and information needs to be adjusted to such a context, whereas the environmental practices offered and required in the specific relationships mainly need to suit the relationship at hand.|$|R

Analysis of the guest-book messages also revealed that the readers of <b>the</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Pages</b> were responding to these attempts at initiating a relationship.
