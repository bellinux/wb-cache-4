50|$|The Beer Luggers, which {{normally}} have the <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sail</b> set {{to a small}} bowsprit where untacking it is difficult, will have the lazy sheet forward of the luff <b>of</b> the <b>sail</b> and will use it haul the whole sail around its own luff, leaving the old working but now lazy sheet again forwards around the luff <b>of</b> the <b>sail.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> a square-rigged <b>sail</b> {{is a line}} {{attached}} to its lower corner. This {{is in contrast to}} the more common fore-and-aft sail, whose tack is a part <b>of</b> the <b>sail</b> itself, the corner which is (possibly semi-permanently) secured to the vessel.|$|R
5000|$|... and, the tack line, {{whose purpose}} is to secure the <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> the junk <b>sail</b> {{assembly}} in the vertical direction. It typically runs from the boom down to the deck or a block on the deck.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept has}} spread rapidly through the <b>sailing</b> world. The <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sail</b> may be {{attached}} at the bow like a genoa but is frequently {{mounted on a}} bowsprit, often a retracting one. If the spinnaker is mounted to a special bowsprit, it is often possible to fly the spinnaker and the jib at the same time; if not, then the spinnaker will be shadowed by the jib, and the jib should be furled when the spinnaker is in use.|$|R
50|$|The {{symmetric}} one is {{the most}} classic type, running symmetrical alongside the boat controlled by lines known as a sheet and a guy running from the lower two corners <b>of</b> the <b>sail.</b> The windward line, or guy, {{is attached to the}} corner called the <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sail,</b> and is stabilized by a spinnaker pole. The leeward (downwind) line is called the sheet. It attaches to the clew of the spinnaker and is used to control the shape <b>of</b> the <b>sail.</b> The spinnaker pole must be moved in each gybe, and is quite difficult for beginners to use. However, it can be sailed in all downwind wind directions.|$|R
5000|$|... the tack parrel and tack line {{secure the}} <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> the junk <b>sail.</b> The tack parrel {{will hold the}} tack into its {{horizontal}} position (parallel to the deck) as a snotter tensions a sprit. The tack line will hold the tack in its vertical position (down to the deck). The tack parrel and tack line can be rigged with either standing or running rigging. The latter, if chosen, will rarely be adjusted.|$|R
5000|$|Tacking {{or coming}} {{about is a}} {{maneuver}} by which a sailing craft turns its bow into and through the wind (called the [...] "eye of the wind") so that the apparent wind changes {{from one side to}} the other, allowing progress on the opposite <b>tack.</b> The type <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> rig dictates the procedures and constraints on achieving a tacking maneuver. Fore-and-aft rigs allow their sails to hang limp as they tack; square rigs must present the full frontal area <b>of</b> the <b>sail</b> to the wind, when changing from side to side; and windsurfers have flexibly pivoting and fully rotating masts that get flipped from side to side.|$|R
50|$|Jibing or gybing is a sailing {{maneuver}} {{by which}} a sailing craft turns its stern past {{the eye of the}} wind so that the apparent wind changes {{from one side to the}} other, allowing progress on the opposite tack. As with <b>tacking,</b> the type <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> rig dictates the procedures and constraints for jibing. Fore-and-aft sails with booms, gaffs or sprits are unstable when they point into the eye of the wind and must be controlled to avoid a violent change to the other side; square rigs as they present the full area <b>of</b> the <b>sail</b> to the wind from the rear experience little change of operation from one tack to the other; and windsurfers again have flexibly pivoting and fully rotating masts that get flipped from side to side.|$|R
50|$|Parrel beads (also spelled parral or parrell) are {{an element}} <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> rigging, usually {{deployed}} at {{the jaws of}} a gaff on a gaff rigged or gunter rigged craft, or on the <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> a spinnaker rigged over a furled jib.|$|R

50|$|A boomkin {{is a short}} spar {{that may}} project either fore or aft on a sailing vessel, {{depending}} on its function.

In {{order to}} study {{influence}} of the variation of both viscosity and <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> the ink on the ink–transferring ratio. viscosity reducer and varnish to adjust ink viscosity and <b>tack,</b> the influence <b>of</b> the volume on tack volume and viscosity are obtained and also the influence of on the ink-transferring ratio by vatiation <b>of</b> the <b>tack</b> volume and viscosity. The results show that, the viscosity and <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> ink are both decrease {{with the amount of}} varnish and viscosity reducer increase. But varnish has a little effect on tack. Adding different proportion of varnish, ink-transferring ratio will reach best when the proportion of varnish is 2 %. when addition more than 4 %,the ink-transferring ratio will decrease instead. Adding different proportions of viscosity reducer, ink-transferring ratio will reach best when the proportion of viscosity reducer is 4 %. When the amount of viscosity reducer more than 6 %,the ink-transferring ratio will reduce instead...|$|R
