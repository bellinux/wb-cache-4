5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Territorial</b> Army and Militia Act 1921 changed <b>the</b> <b>Territorial</b> Force into <b>the</b> <b>Territorial</b> Army, and the Special Reserve {{returned}} to its old title of Militia. The Air Force (Constitution) Act 1917 had created a reserve and an auxiliary force for the newly constituted Royal Air Force, and the Auxiliary Air Force and Air Force Reserve Act 1924 modified the 1907 Act so as to allow County Associations to administer <b>the</b> <b>Territorial</b> Army and the Auxiliary Air Force. The Auxiliary and Reserve Forces Act 1949 gave the County Associations responsibility for the Army Cadet Force.|$|E
5|$|After {{hostilities}} {{broke out}} on the frontier between the Americans and the native tribes, culminating in the Battle of Tippecanoe in November 1811, Jennings successfully promoted passage of a bill to grant compensation to veterans of the battle and to give pensions for five years to the widows and orphans {{of those who were}} killed. Privately, Jennings lamented the battle, while his friends in the territory faulted Harrison for agitating the situation and causing the needless loss of life. As calls for war with Great Britain increased, Jennings was not among the war hawks, but ultimately accepted the arrival of the War of 1812. Early in the war, Harrison was commissioned as a military general and dispatched to defend the frontier and invade Canada, which caused him to resign from his post as territorial governor in 1812. Prior to Harrison's resignation, Jennings and his allies moved quickly {{to take advantage of the}} situation and initiated efforts to weaken the governor's authority. In 1811 <b>the</b> <b>territorial</b> legislature voted to move the capital away from Vincennes, a pro-Harrison stronghold, and began a shift in political power from <b>the</b> <b>territorial</b> governor to the delegates in <b>the</b> <b>territorial</b> legislature and its elected officials. John Gibson, the elderly, acting governor, whose territorial duties largely dealt with military affairs, did not challenge <b>the</b> <b>territorial</b> legislature. When Harrison's successor, Thomas Posey, was confirmed on March 3, 1813, Jennings's party in <b>the</b> <b>territorial</b> legislature had become entrenched and began to advance their request for statehood.|$|E

In addition, Haldane saw <b>the</b> <b>territorials</b> as a source of reinforcements for the regular army. Six months following mobilization, during which time the troops would have come up to an acceptable training standard, Haldane was confident that up to a quarter of the men would opt to go and fight abroad.|$|R

5|$|By 1815 Jennings and <b>the</b> <b>territorial</b> {{legislature}} {{were ready}} {{to embark on a}} course for statehood. In December 1815 Jennings's introduced a petition from <b>the</b> <b>territorial</b> legislature to Congress that requested statehood for Indiana. The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63,000, more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11, 1816. The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution. <b>The</b> <b>territorial</b> governor, Thomas Posey, expressed concern that the territory was too under-populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government. In a letter to President Madison, he recommended that the president veto the bill and delay statehood for another three years, which would allow him to finish his term as governor. Madison signed the bill, ignoring Posey's plea.|$|E
