5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels <b>the</b> <b>column</b> upwards. As air is drawn into <b>the</b> <b>column,</b> the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, <b>the</b> <b>column</b> will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of <b>the</b> <b>column</b> and thus the pressure on the water below.

5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within <b>the</b> <b>column.</b> Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as <b>the</b> <b>column</b> moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, the British moved out. No one {{except the}} commanders {{knew of the}} plan.

5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} air had mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum.

This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if <b>the</b> <b>column</b> of mercury was supported by air then <b>the</b> <b>column</b> ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that <b>the</b> <b>column</b> was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E
