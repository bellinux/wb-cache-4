40|$|Image {{inpainting}} is {{a challenging}} problem as {{it needs to}} fill the information of <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions. Most of the existing inpainting algorithms assume that the positions of <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions are known. Different from the existing methods that usually make some assumptions on <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions, we present an efficient blind image inpainting algorithm to directly restore a clear image from a corrupted input. Our algorithm is motivated by the residual learning algorithm which aims to learn the missing infor- mation in corrupted regions. However, directly using exist- ing residual learning algorithms in image restoration does not well solve this problem as little information is available in <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions. To solve this problem, we introduce an encoder and decoder architecture to capture more useful information and develop a robust loss function to deal with outliers. Our algorithm can predict the missing information in <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions, thus facilitating the clear image restoration. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental demonstrate that our algorithm can deal with <b>the</b> <b>corrupted</b> regions of arbitrary shapes and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing {{a number of}} pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and <b>the</b> <b>Corrupt</b> Practices Act did much to end electoral bribery.

Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} years, Parliament adopted several more minor reforms.

Parliament also passed several laws aimed at combatting corruption, including <b>the</b> <b>Corrupt</b> Practices Act 1854, though these measures proved largely ineffectual. Neither party strove for further major reform; leading statesmen on both sides regarded the Reform Act as a final settlement.|$|E

5|$|The {{publication}} of the Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884, both of which extended suffrage for men in the United Kingdom, led to large-scale political organisation. These combined with the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>Corrupt</b> Practices Act of 1883, which prevented the payment of canvassers, led to both Conservative and Liberal Parties approaching female supporters to aid them in political campaigning. The Conservatives were first to offer a political role for women in Wales {{with the opening of}} branches of the Primrose League, but campaigning for women's rights was not its priority and merely aimed to 'interest women in politics'.|$|E
5|$|A Dainty Politician is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on corruption political activity during a political convention in which a corrupt politician is running for re-election to the United States Congress. The votes are tallied and the challenger ties with <b>the</b> <b>corrupt</b> Congressman Casey, but a third candidate holds the balance of power. Casey bribes the third candidate to retire in his favor, but the plot is uncovered and the two are ejected from the convention by a reporter {{who falls in love}} with challenger's daughter. The film was released on August 23, 1910, and saw a wide national release. Little is known of the actual production, but it received mixed reaction for the plausibility of its plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Louis Salinger, of Interpol, and Eleanor Whitman, an Assistant District Attorney from Manhattan, are {{investigating}} the International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC), which funds activities such as money laundering, terrorism, arms trading, and the destabilization of governments. Salinger's and Whitman's investigation takes them from Berlin to Milan, where the IBBC assassinates Umberto Calvini, an arms manufacturer who is an Italian prime ministerial candidate. The bank's assassin diverts suspicion to a local assassin with political connections, who is promptly killed by a corrupt policeman. Salinger and Whitman get a lead on the second assassin, but <b>the</b> <b>corrupt</b> policeman shows up again and orders {{them out of the}} country.

5|$|Needing more {{information}} {{to solve the}} case, Batman breaks into the GCPD to access its national criminal database. While escaping, he encounters Captain James Gordon, who is distrusting of Batman, and <b>the</b> <b>corrupt</b> SWAT team, who hope to collect the bounty money for themselves. Following advice from Gordon's daughter Barbara, Batman enters the sewers beneath the GCPD for permanent access to the database and finds Black Mask's crew planting explosives. Using the database, Batman deduces that Black Mask was kidnapped by the Joker, presumably to access the Gotham Merchants Bank. At the bank, Black Mask removes his disguise for Batman and reveals himself as the Joker; having assumed Black Mask's identity several days prior, the Joker seized his criminal empire and imposed the bounty on Batman. Batman chases the Joker to the Sionis Steel Mill, where he frees Black Mask and defeats the poisonous assassin Copperhead.|$|E

5|$|The {{town had}} descended into {{lawlessness}} {{with a number}} of saloons, brothels, dancing halls, and widespread gambling. The town had no law enforcement officers, and the local government officials had become bar keepers. Governor West had extended prohibition laws, but they were widely ignored in Copperfield. Some local residents had appealed to the state government for assistance. Over half the residents of the town had signed a petition, addressed to West, alleging that saloons owned by the mayor and City Council members were selling liquor to minors and staying open later than their posted hours. Governor West responded by ordering county officials to restore order, close the saloons, and force the resignations of <b>the</b> <b>corrupt</b> city leaders by December 25, 1913.|$|E

5|$|In 1821, Don Diego De La Vega (Anthony Hopkins), a Californio nobleman fights {{against the}} Spanish in the Mexican War of Independence as Zorro, a mysterious swordsman who defends the Mexican peasants and commoners of Las Californias. Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson), <b>the</b> <b>corrupt</b> {{governor}} of the region, learns of De La Vega's alter ego, and attempts to arrest him. De La Vega's wife Esperanza is killed during the scuffle. Montero imprisons De La Vega and takes his infant daughter, Elena, as his own before returning to Spain. Twenty years later Montero returns to California as a civilian, alongside Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who {{has grown into a}} beautiful woman and resembles her late mother. Montero's reappearance motivates De La Vega to escape from prison. He encounters a thief, Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), who, as a child, once did Zorro a favor. De La Vega decides that fate has brought them together, and agrees to make Alejandro his protégé, grooming him to be the new Zorro.

5|$|Increasing exports {{during the}} First World War {{led to a}} boom in {{industry}} and declining living standards in the industrial areas, particularly Catalonia and the Basque country. There was high inflation. The industrial sector resented its subjugation by the agrarian central government. Along with concerns about antiquated promotion systems and political corruption, the war in Morocco had caused divisions in the military. Regenerationism became popular, and the working class, industrial class, and the military were united in their hope of removing <b>the</b> <b>corrupt</b> central government. However, these hopes were defeated in 1917 and 1918 when the various political parties representing these groups were either appeased or suppressed by the central government, one by one. The industrialists eventually backed the government {{as a way to}} restore order. After the formation of the Communist International in 1919, there was a growing fear of communism within Spain and growing repression {{on the part of the}} government through military means. The PSOE split, with the more left-wing members founding the Communist Party in 1921. The Restoration government failed to cope with an increasing number of strikes amongst the industrial workers in the north and the agricultural workers in the south.|$|E
