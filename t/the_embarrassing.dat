Papers indicating {{the nature of}} the Alsos Mission were removed or destroyed. Although Strasbourg was not abandoned by the Allies, and ultimately did not fall, the Alsos Mission departed the city on 8 January 1945. Pash even ordered an evacuation plan to be prepared for the Alsos Mission's main headquarters in Paris. <b>The</b> <b>embarrassing</b> series of intelligence failures that had led up to the Battle of the Bulge cast doubts on the Alsos Mission's own findings. A four-man team under Eckman was sent to investigate a suspiciously devastating V-2 explosion near Antwerp, and Fred Wardenburg had to confirm {{that it was not a}} small nuclear explosion. Rumors that Germany had an atomic bomb persisted as late as March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Like his father, Adams {{embarked}} on a political career {{with the support of}} the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than £8,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of £1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and <b>the</b> <b>embarrassing</b> situation did not lessen his influence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the run-up}} to the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Hunt fell out of favor of Army of the Potomac {{commander}} Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and lost direct command of the Artillery Reserve, reducing him in effect to an administrative staff role.

They claimed that the action was a result of dissatisfaction on the part of junior officers, who found it extremely difficult to obtain promotions and resented the generals' corrupt and decadent lifestyles.

25|$|The defeats of the Russian Army and Navy {{shook up}} Russian confidence. Throughout 1905, the Imperial Russian {{government}} was rocked by revolution. The population was against {{escalation of the}} war. The empire was certainly capable of sending more troops but this would make little difference in the outcome due to the poor state of the economy, <b>the</b> <b>embarrassing</b> defeats of the Russian Army and Navy by the Japanese, and the relative unimportance to Russia of the disputed land made the war extremely unpopular. Tsar Nicholas II elected to negotiate peace so he could concentrate on internal matters after the disaster of Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905.|$|E
25|$|After {{this series}} of {{imperial}} advances, on 5 November a Prussian corps under Frederick engaged Soubise's much larger force {{near the village of}} Rossbach in Saxony. The ensuing Battle of Rossbach ended in a stunning Prussian victory, in which Frederick lost fewer than 1,000 men, while the Franco-German force under Soubise lost around 10,000. This victory secured Prussia's control of Saxony for the time, and its effect on the morale of both sides was dramatic. After <b>the</b> <b>embarrassing</b> defeat at Rossbach, French interest in the Silesian War declined sharply; with the signing of Third Treaty of Versailles in March 1758, France greatly reduced its financial and military contributions to the Austrian coalition, leaving Rossbach as the only battle between the French and Prussians during the entire war.|$|E

25|$|His name became {{connected}} {{with the passing of}} the Ground Game Act 1880 and the Arms (Ireland) Act 1881. As Home Secretary {{at the time of the}} Phoenix Park murders and the subsequent London bombings he reacted rapidly, and the Explosive Substances Act 1883 was passed through all its stages in the shortest time on record. His robust stand on law and order brought him into conflict with the Irish members. In 1884 he introduced an aborted bill for unifying the municipal administration of London. and was responsible for demanding the prosecution in the survival cannibalism case of R v. Dudley and Stephens. In 1885 he was responsible for commuting John 'Babbacombe' Lee's death penalty to life imprisonment after his execution failed three times.

25|$|Four {{years into}} the 20th century saw the Russo-Japanese War with the Battle of Port Arthur {{establishing}} the Empire of Japan as a world power. The Russians were in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy {{as well as for}} maritime trade. The Manchurian Campaign of the Russian Empire was fought against the Japanese over Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the Yellow Sea. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the distribution of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. <b>The</b> <b>embarrassing</b> string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} largely {{reported}} by the press {{to have been a}} flop: badly thought-out, badly executed, and leaving the government with <b>the</b> <b>embarrassing</b> question {{of what to do with}} it afterwards. During 2000 the organisers repeatedly asked for, and received, more cash from the Millennium Commission, the Lottery body which supported it. Numerous changes at management and Board level, before and during the exhibition, had only limited, if any, results. Jennifer Page was sacked as chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company just one month after the dome's opening. Press reports suggested that the then Prime Minister Tony Blair personally placed a high priority on making the Dome a success. But part of the problem was that the financial predictions were based on an unrealistically high forecast of visitor numbers at 12 million. During the 12 months it was open there were approximately 6.5 million visitors – significantly fewer than the approximately 10 million paying visitors that attended the Festival of Britain, which only ran from May to September. Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 held in Glasgow attracted more than 12 million visitors being open May to October. Unlike the press, visitor feedback was extremely positive. It was the most popular tourist attraction in 2000, second was the London Eye; third was Alton Towers, which had been first in 1999.|$|E
