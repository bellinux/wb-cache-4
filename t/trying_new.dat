5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for <b>trying</b> <b>new</b> methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Upon the submarine's {{return to}} Kure, Hashimoto was {{detached}} and {{assigned to the}} advanced course at Submarine School on 1 February 1942, to prepare him for command of a submarine. Graduating from this course on 30 June, Hashimoto was given command of submarine Ro-31, a coastal defense vessel. For the remainder of 1942, Hashimoto operated his ship in home waters off Yokosuka training crews and <b>trying</b> <b>new</b> equipment and doing research {{for the development of}} Japanese submarine doctrine. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 November. In 1943, he was given command of submarine I-158 for coastal defense, and later in the year was given command of submarine Ro-44 for the same duties.|$|E

40|$|The {{freedom to}} <b>try</b> <b>new</b> things plays {{a vital role}} for {{employees}} engaging in creative endeavors. This freedom can be influenced by one's relationship with her supervisor, relationship with her team, and various work pressures. One of the first steps to reaching creative output {{is to have a}} playful attitude toward work where there is encouragement and processes that allow individuals to take risks and <b>try</b> <b>new</b> things. However, we argue that what allows someone to <b>try</b> <b>new</b> things earlier in their career and when they are more established might be different. Noteworthy {{progress has been made in}} conceptualizing the multi-level factors that are important for creativity. In the current study, we identified variables associated with a willingness to <b>try</b> <b>new</b> things, part of the exploration phase of creativity, and divided them by the early and established careers of 59 Nobel Prize winners. Using a historiometric approach, we rated individual and team-level variables to identify what makes someone <b>try</b> <b>new</b> things either earlier or later in her career. Findings indicate that willingness to <b>try</b> <b>new</b> things is related to autonomy, the relationship with one's mentor, team climate, and team network, but not to personal initiative. ...|$|R

Some Balinese gamelan groups {{constantly}} change their music by taking older pieces they know and mixing them together, as well as <b>trying</b> <b>new</b> variations of the music. Their music constantly changes because they believe that music should grow and change; the only exception to this is with their most sacred songs which they do not change.

The same year Léonce directed L'Enfant de Paris, the film that would {{mark the end of}} his financial difficulties and make his {{reputation as one of the}} best French directors of his era. L'Enfant de Paris was subsequently remade several times. Léonce demonstrated with this film that French filmmaking technique rivaled that of the Americans, even the technique of the eminent American director D. W. Griffith.|$|E
25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to <b>trying</b> <b>new</b> entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, never would have let the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E

[...] Despite the rapid decline of the pulp market, several new science fiction magazines were launched in pulp format during these years. [...] In 1950, Avon Publications experimented with a format that included several pages of comics, <b>trying</b> <b>new</b> pulp magazines in three genres: romance, westerns, and science fiction. The sf pulp, titled Out of This World Adventures, lasted for two issues; the others for only one.|$|E

[...] Aidan Reynolds from Drowned in Sound noted [...] "California {{sounds like the}} work of a band filled with the joy of existence, giving in to every pop indulgence or production trick that could stuff in one more hook before the end.

That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us."

500|$|Reception to Revelation was positive, {{with some}} critics {{regarding}} the album {{as one of}} Third Day's best albums to date.

He felt that the change of environment [...] "intimidated [...] for the better", making them not settle for [...] "middle of the road" [...] songs. He described the album's sound as [...] "muscular" [...] and [...] "anthemic... unquestionably populist, yet the closest Third Day has come to replicating the Southern-fried goodness of Time". He regarded Revelation as [...] "the best album Third Day has released this decade" [...] and considered the album a return to the [...] "unbridled fervor" [...] Third Day was characterized by early in their career.|$|E

Thorson lived with a developer he met through 's community and the two eventually moved in with Holowka in [...] "Indie House", a Vancouver house whose occupants are all indie developers. The close community of indie gamers and their interest in <b>trying</b> <b>new</b> game ideas was both a product and generator of their living arrangements. Though Holowka dropped back from the project shortly after the game jam, leaving the project to Thorson, he stepped in to demo the game at the 2013 Game Developers Conference {{at the last minute}} when Thorson's passport was expired. With an increase in press attention following an exhibition at PAX East, Thorson entered an agreement with Ouya's Kellee Santiago to release exclusively on the microconsole. Critics saw this as being the action the new console needed to compete with existing consoles, and Thorson felt the release for Ouya to be less [...] "intimidating" [...] than if for the PlayStation 3. The game also fit Ouya's emphasis on couch co-op gaming. Thorson originally did the artwork himself but was not satisfied with the results and hired MiniBoss to finish the graphics. Holowka composed the music, and Thorson hired Power Up Audio to make the sound effects.|$|E

[...] A spokesman for 10:10 also denied that the withdrawal had been planned from the beginning in order to generate publicity. After removing the video from YouTube, 10:10 issued a statement: [...] "We won't be making any attempt to censor or remove other versions currently in circulation on the internet".

The more I think about it, the more pleasure I find in it. It was an episode full of laughs, action and the kind of emotional tug the series has been missing of late." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste gave the episode a rating of 8.7/10 and wrote: [...] "Judging from this episode and the last it seems like Futurama is intentionally straying away from its old groupings and <b>trying</b> <b>new</b> things.

[...] Though he felt the episode was weaker with its jokes, he noted that this [...] "is frequently the case in with episodes that deal more with the characters and less about making jokes in a wacky world. But this isn't something I think will bother real fans, as that's part of what's given Futurama its cult audience in the first place: that the show gives a damn about its characters." ...|$|E

[...] Marc Hogan of magazine Spin said that Bieber [...] "wants to sex you up" [...] with the track, but thought that [...] "Bieber might be a wealthy suitor, but he's not grown up just yet." [...] A Rap-Up reviewer complimented [...] "Boyfriend" [...] for showcasing a mature Bieber and urban sound on it. The A.V.
