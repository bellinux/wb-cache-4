5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> {{ruled that}} Cranston had acted {{improperly}} by {{interfering with the}} investigation by the FHLBB. He had received {{more than a million}} dollars from Keating, including $850,000 to the voter registration groups closely affiliated with him; he had done more arm-twisting than the other Senators on Keating's behalf; and he was the only senator officially rebuked by the Senate in this matter.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, it {{was also}} {{revealed}} that Hatfield had failed to report a number of expensive gifts {{from the president of}} the University of South Carolina, James B. Holderman. Again, he apologized. But <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> rebuked Hatfield for the latter act.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee's</b> {{investigation}} {{began on}} November 17, 1989. It focused on all five senators and lasted 22 months, with 9 months of active investigation and 7 weeks of hearings. The committee {{was composed of}} three Democratic senators, Howell Heflin (chair), David Pryor, and Terry Sanford, and three Republican senators, Warren Rudman (vice chair), Trent Lott, and Jesse Helms. Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett was appointed as special outside counsel to the committee, tasked with conducting the investigation.|$|R
5000|$|Bennett is also {{famous for}} {{representing}} Judith Miller in the Valerie Plame CIA leak {{grand jury investigation}} case, Caspar Weinberger, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, during the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, Clark Clifford in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal, and Paul Wolfowitz in the World Bank Scandal. He served as special counsel for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee's</b> 1989-1991 investigation of the Keating Five. In 2008, Bennett was hired by John McCain to defend allegations by The New York Times of an improper relationship with a Washington lobbyist.|$|R
5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Glenn, charging {{that he had}} improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial charges against the five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a public interest group, who asked for the U.S. Justice Department and <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> to investigate {{the actions of the}} senators relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated the rules of the Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House Banking Committee, whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours of hearings into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E
25|$|At various times, Stevens {{also served}} as Chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee,</b> the Arms Control Observer Group, and the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress.|$|E
25|$|Following the AP report, Allen asked <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> for {{an opinion}} on whether he should have {{disclosed}} his options. The ethics committee ruled than Allen was not required to disclose his stock options, and did not err in not doing so.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Bachmann {{was under}} {{investigation}} by the House <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee,</b> the Federal Election Commission, <b>the</b> Iowa <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee,</b> <b>the</b> Urbandale Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation because of alleged campaign finance violations in her 2012 campaign for President.|$|R
5000|$|On May 25, 2007, Veja {{magazine}} accused Calheiros {{of accepting}} funds from a construction industry lobbyist, to {{pay child support}} for a child from a previous extramarital affair with broadcast journalist [...] In trying to justify {{the origin of the}} funds, subsequent investigations into Calheiros' business dealings led to other revelations of income tax fraud and the use of a proxy to buy a stake in a radio station. Calheiros was subject to a disciplinary inquiry by <b>the</b> <b>senate's</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> on four different counts. On September 12, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> voted by secret ballot against impeaching Calheiros on the lobbyist funds accusation. He still faces three separate inquiries on other charges. After the vote public outrage forced congress to eliminate secret ballot voting for ethics violations, meaning Calheiros' three other inquiries, if approved by the <b>ethics</b> <b>committee,</b> will be subject to an open ballot vote in <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> floor.|$|R
500|$|Hatfield {{received}} another rebuke from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> after <b>the</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> investigated two {{gifts that}} he had received {{in the form of}} forgiven loans from a former congressman and a California businessman.|$|R
25|$|In May 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> {{identified}} Coburn {{in their}} {{report on the}} ethics violations of Senator John Ensign. The report stated that Coburn knew about Ensign's extramarital affair and was {{involved in trying to}} negotiate a financial settlement to cover it up.|$|E
25|$|That {{same week}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> began an {{investigation}} into the matter, but dropped it the following month concluding that the dealings did not violate the Senate's standards of conduct or conflict-of-interest rules. Later that same month the Chronicle reported on another dealing by the Senator. Since 1999, Perata's campaign fund and various other political committees had paid Exit Strategies more than $743,000, according to campaign finance documents. Exit Strategies, a political direct mail firm, was launched in 1999 by Perata's son, Nick, and based at his father's Alameda County home. By their own accounting, Exit Strategies paid the senator nearly $138,000 during the same period for rent and consulting fees. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> again ruled that this was not an actionable violation, but it raised questions into the propriety of the relationship.|$|E
25|$|On November 17, 1989, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> {{investigation}} began of the Keating Five, Alan Cranston (D–CA), Dennis DeConcini (D–AZ), John Glenn (D–OH), John McCain (R–AZ), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (D–MI), {{who were}} accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.|$|E
50|$|An ethics {{complaint}} was filed against Hartsell with <b>the</b> North Carolina <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> alleging conflict-of-interest {{based on his}} past legal representation of a developer and the Water and Sewer Authority of Cabarrus County. The {{complaint was}} dismissed by the North Carolina State <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> {{due to lack of}} probable cause.|$|R
2500|$|In 1967 Dodd {{became the}} first Senator censured by <b>the</b> US <b>Senate</b> since Joseph McCarthy in 1954, {{and was one of}} only six people censured by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in <b>the</b> 20th century. The {{resulting}} censure was a condemnation and finding that he had converted campaign funds to his personal accounts and spent the money. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee's</b> formal disciplinary action, other sources (such as investigative journalist Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson's Congress in Crisis) suggest Dodd's corruption was far broader in scope, and there were accusations of alcoholism. In response to these accusations, Dodd filed a lawsuit against Pearson claiming that Pearson had illegally interfered with his private property. [...] Although the district court granted a partial judgment to Dodd, the appellate court ruled in favor of Pearson on the grounds that Dodd's property had not been physically abused. [...] In 1970, the Democrats endorsed for his seat Joseph Duffey, who won the nomination in the primary. Dodd then entered the race as an independent, taking just under a quarter of the vote, in a three-way race which he and Duffey lost to Lowell Weicker.|$|R
50|$|Three {{days after}} his {{conviction}} for extortion, on February 28, MacKenzie resigned as Assistant Minority Floor Leader. However, he refused to resign his <b>Senate</b> seat. <b>The</b> conduct of MacKenzie and DiCarlo was referred to <b>the</b> newly formed <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee,</b> and on March 31, 1977, {{the day before the}} committee was to issue its report, MacKenzie resigned from <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
25|$|He is {{a member}} of the Republican Party. He rose to chair of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, but {{resigned}} after six months on June 17, 2009 in the wake of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> investigation. Ensign and his family returned to Las Vegas after his resignation from the U.S. Senate, where he renewed his practice as a veterinarian and works at Boca Park Animal Hospital.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>{{committee}}</b> {{needed someone}} to review Republican senator Bob Packwood's diaries, the committee chose Starr. In 1990, Starr was the leading candidate for the U.S.Supreme Court nomination after William Brennan's retirement. He encountered strong resistance from the Department of Justice leadership, which feared that Starr might not be reliably conservative as a Supreme Court justice. George H. W. Bush nominated David Souter instead of Starr.|$|E
25|$|From 1999 to 2005, Reid {{served as}} Senate Democratic Whip, as {{minority}} whip from 1999 to 2001, and again from 2003 to 2005.

After {{pursuing}} gun restrictions, the outraged firearms industry, which Dodd represented, investigated Dodd for any mishaps.

5000|$|The {{official}} {{invitation for}} the event read: [...] "While this trip has proven itself to be an enjoyable one for delegation members in the past, it is, nevertheless, an official trip authorized by <b>the</b> House and <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> [...] [...] [...] intended to {{provide an opportunity for}} Members of Congress and Congressional staff to inspect and evaluate the manner in which federal funds have been used to strengthen the area's tourism industry." ...|$|R
25|$|While Senator Pete Domenici had {{declared}} that he would seek re-election in New Mexico, {{he changed his mind}} and announced on October 4, 2007 that he was retiring {{at the end of his}} current term due to a degenerative brain disorder. Domenici normally would have been expected to win re-election easily, having won his current term with the support of two out of three New Mexico voters; however, he is to be investigated by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> for his role in firing U.S. Attorney David Iglesias. Domenici's role in the developing scandal had reduced the probability he would have been re-elected, and a SurveyUSA poll showed his approval ratings at 41%, with 54% disapproving. The potential scandal may have also contributed to his decision to leave the Senate.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> {{ruled that}} the {{involvement}} of Glenn in the scheme was minimal, and {{the charges against him}} were dropped. He was only criticized by the Committee for [...] "poor judgment." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> conclusions. Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, which had initially demanded the investigation, thought {{the treatment of the}} senators far too lenient, and said, [...] " [...] action by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> is a cop-out and a damning indictment of the committee," [...] and [...] "The U.S. Senate remains on the auction block to the Charles Keatings of the world." [...] Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, called it a [...] "whitewash". Jonathan Alter of Newsweek said it was a classic case of the government trying to investigate itself, labeling <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> [...] "shameless" [...] for having [...] "let four of the infamous Keating Five off with a wrist tap." [...] The New York Times ran several editorials criticizing the Ethics Committee for having let the senators off lightly. Margaret Carlson of Time suspected the committee had timed its first report to coincide with the run-up to the Gulf War, minimizing its news impact. One of the San Francisco bank regulators felt that McCain had gotten off too lightly, saying that Keating's business involvement with Cindy McCain was an obvious conflict of interest.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2009, Emmanuel Egboga, {{special adviser}} on {{petroleum}} to President Umaru Yar'Adua alleged that [...] some senators and labor union leaders {{may have been}} bribed {{on a trip to}} Ghana to frustrate effort to reform the oil and gas sector [...] <b>The</b> <b>senate</b> directed its <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> to hold a public hearing to investigate the allegation. Senators named by Egboga included Mohammed Kabiru Jibril.|$|R
2500|$|He {{was known}} as a law-and-order senator, {{sponsoring}} legislation requiring inmates to serve at least 85% of their sentences before becoming eligible for parole. He supported teacher salary increases, charter schools, and a specialty license plate for Everglades conservation. With Crist as chairman, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> and Elections <b>Committee</b> investigated actions of then-governor Lawton Chiles amid allegations that Chiles' campaign had made [...] "scare calls" [...] to senior citizens days before the 1994 gubernatorial election. Chiles testified before the committee and admitted that his campaign had made the calls.|$|R
50|$|In August 2013, {{conservative}} activist Dennis Fusaro {{claimed that}} Sorenson backed Ron Paul in the 2012 presidential campaign after demanding {{money from the}} Paul campaign. State senate rules prohibit campaigns from paying senators directly or indirectly. <b>The</b> Iowa <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> assigned a state special investigator, who reported “probable cause” that Sorenson had broken Senate rules by accepting money for presidential campaign work. The 566-page report stated that Sorenson had in fact received the alleged payments from a $25,000 check from a top official of Paul’s presidential campaign, {{as well as from}} a political action committee connected to the Bachmann campaign. Sorenson switched from Bachmann’s campaign to Paul’s in the closing days of the GOP caucuses. Bachmann claimed {{at the time that he}} defected to her competitor’s team because they were paying him to do so. Sorenson had long denied being paid by any of the presidential campaigns. The investigator’s report said Sorenson’s denials may have violated state law - a class D felony for felonious misconduct by a public official.|$|R
500|$|Regardless of {{the level}} of their involvement, both {{senators}} were greatly affected by it. McCain would write in 2002 that attending the two April 1987 meetings was [...] "the worst mistake of my life". Glenn described <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> investigation as the low point of his life.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> {{ruled that}} Riegle and DeConcini had acted {{improperly}} by {{interfering with the}} investigation by the FHLBB. Specifically, it said that even though neither of them violated any Senate rule, their conduct [...] "gave the appearance of being improper." [...] DeConcini was especially faulted for having {{taken the lead in}} the two meetings with the FHLBB.|$|E
500|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> {{members were}} {{concerned}} that letting the senators off lightly would harm their own reputations. Nevertheless, the existing Senate rules did not specifically proscribe the actions taken by DeConcini, Riegle, Glenn, and McCain. Vice-chair Rudman defended the committee's actions, saying: [...] "Given the news media frenzy surrounding , the easiest thing for the committee to do {{would have been to}} find them guilty of something and recommend sanctions. ... The politically difficult thing, the one requiring backbone, was what we did — to review all the evidence and reach a predictably unpopular conclusion based only on fact." ...|$|E
50|$|Since 1993, {{members of}} Congress pay their own travel and lodging {{expenses}}, but the Institute pays for other expenses including staff costs as approved by <b>the</b> House or <b>Senate</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees.</b> Lobbyists have been barred from programming since 2006, though dues-paying {{members of the}} Institute are invited to a reception and dinner the final night of the retreat.In addition to the annual Republican retreat, the Institute sponsors Congressional staff training events and sponsored bipartisan retreats in the 1990s. The Institute partners with Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government on the Bipartisan New Member Orientation, which is a 4-day conference held biannually in which new members of Congress are able to meet each other and learn about policy issues from academics, analysts, and former members of Congress.|$|R
5000|$|On April 1, 2010, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), {{a liberal}} {{watchdog}} group, {{filed a complaint}} with <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and House <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> alleging that Senators and Representatives lodging in C Street received below market rents constituting [...] "improper gifts from C Street Center, Inc., the entity that runs the house and is affiliated with the Fellowship, a shadowy religious organization."
