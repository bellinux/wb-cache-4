40|$|The {{objective}} of this lab is to help students understand cross-site-request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) attacks. A CSRF attack involves a victim user, a <b>trusted</b> <b>site,</b> and a malicious site. The victim user holds an active session with a <b>trusted</b> <b>site</b> and simultaneously visits a malicious site. The malicious site injects a HTTP request for the <b>trusted</b> <b>site</b> into the victim user session compromising its integrity. In this lab, you will be attacking a web-based project management system using CSRF attacks. The open-source project management application called Collabtive is vulnerable to the CSRF attacks. 2 Lab Environment You need to use our provided virtual machine image for this lab. The name of the VM image that supports this lab is called SEEDUbuntu 11. 04 -Aug- 2011, which is built in August 2011.
