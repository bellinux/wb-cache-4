Torrealba claimed that his attack on the umpire was because of a disputed <b>strike</b> call prior <b>to</b> <b>striking</b> <b>out.</b> As a result, the league suspended Torrealba for 66 games, which did not carry over to Major League Baseball or any other baseball circuit.|$|R

For his performance in July 2013, Fernández was named the Rookie of the Month for the National League, leading all qualified rookie pitchers in ERA. He followed up his July by compiling a 1.15 ERA with 49 strikeouts in 39 innings pitched in August, which resulted him in receiving a second consecutive Rookie of the Month Award.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{was born}} and raised in Longview, Texas. He {{attended}} Navarro Junior College and was selected by the Texas Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft. Davis ascended quickly through the Rangers' minor league system, getting named their Minor League Player of the Year in 2007. He was called up in the middle of 2008 and had a strong start to his major league career. He was the Rangers' starting first baseman for 92 games in 2009 and hit 21 home runs, but a low batting average and a tendency <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> left the Rangers dissatisfied with him. Because of this, the Rangers sent Davis back and forth between the minors and the majors over the next two years and left him off their playoff roster in 2010. On July 30, 2011, they traded him to the Baltimore Orioles with Tommy Hunter for Koji Uehara.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{was traded}} to the Minnesota Twins on November 16, 2003. The Giants sent Nathan to the Twins along with {{pitchers}} Boof Bonser and Francisco Liriano for catcher A. J. Pierzynski and cash. The Twins decided to make Nathan their closer starting in 2004, risky move considering that Nathan had notched only one save in six opportunities as a Giant, but he won the job over J. C. Romero and Jesse Crain in spring training. He was signed to a three-year deal on March 4, 2004 and agreed to an incentive-laden contract with a base salary of $440,000. He started off the season strong, allowing no runs in 20 appearances and earning 14 saves from April 15 to June 4. He was named AL Co-Player of the Week starting on May 10 with four saves in four innings and four appearances, facing the minimum number of batters each time. His credentials {{for the first half of}} the season, 23 saves in 24 opportunities with a 1.19 ERA in 26 appearances, earned him his first All-Star appearance in the 2004 MLB All-Star Game. He was the only Twin on the squad and pitched a perfect seventh inning, getting Bobby Abreu <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>out,</b> Mike Lowell to fly out and Miguel Cabrera <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>out.</b> His numbers were impressive through the rest of the season, allowing no runs between June 9 and August 18, and between August 25 and September 16. and finishing 2004 with 44 saves in 47 opportunities and an ERA of 1.62. The Twins won the AL Central division and faced the New York Yankees in the ALDS. Nathan picked up his first postseason save in Game 1, but blew his second opportunity in Game 2 as the Twins went on to lose the ensuing three games. His outstanding season earned him MVP and Cy Young votes, finishing fourth for Cy Young and 12th for MVP. His first child, a son named Cole, was born on November 9, 2004.|$|E

5|$|After {{getting one}} {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent Mayne and Armando Ríos respectively.

Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E

However, he rebounded nicely and by August, he was putting up good pitching numbers. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in August, going 5–1 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher of the Month again in September, going 6–0 with a 1.89 ERA. During those last two months of the season, Zito went a combined 11–1 with a 1.32 ERA, best in baseball.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Sánchez {{made the}} Giants' {{starting}} rotation out {{of spring training}} as the fifth starter. In only his second start of the season, he struck out a career high ten batters against the San Diego Padres in a game the Giants eventually won 1–0. Sánchez struck out ten batters again in a 3–1 victory against the Cincinnati Reds on April 25, becoming the first Giants left-handed pitcher since Shawn Estes <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> at least ten batters in a game {{more than once in}} a season. From May 28 through June 12, Sánchez won a career best four straight starts. On June 12, in a 10–7 victory over the Colorado Rockies, he became the first Giants' starter to allow seven runs and win a game since Russ Ortiz did it in 2000. In his next start, on June 17 against the Detroit Tigers, Sánchez took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but he was ultimately the losing pitcher in a 5–1 loss. Sánchez finished the first half with an 8–5 record and 115 strikeouts, which were the most ever {{in the first half of}} a season by a Giants' left-hander during the Giants' tenure in San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} the 2010 season strong, the Dodgers named Kershaw as the Opening Day Starter for the 2011 season. On May 29, he pitched the second complete-game shutout of his career, striking out 10 while winning a two-hitter against the Florida Marlins, 8–0; {{he also had}} two singles and an RBI, scoring twice in the game. He produced his third career shutout on June 20, a two-hit, 11-strikeout effort against the Detroit Tigers. Kershaw became the first Dodgers starter <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> <b>out</b> the side in the 9th inning since Sandy Koufax's perfect game. In his next start, on June 26, Kershaw pitched another complete game (against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). He became the first Dodger starter to have back-to-back complete game victories since Jeff Weaver in the 2005 season and the first Dodger to have double-digit strikeouts in consecutive starts since Chan-Ho Park in the 2000 season. He was awarded the National League Player of the Week award for the week of June 20–26 {{as a result of}} those two starts. Midway through June, Kershaw had amassed 32 career victories, a 3.15 ERA and 593 career strikeouts in 568.2 innings. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Kershaw was the first 23-year-old pitcher to have that many victories, an ERA that low and an average of more than one strikeout per inning since ERA became an official statistic in 1910.|$|E

He was selected as the National League Pitcher of the Month after going a perfect 4–0 with a 1.29ERA and 58strikeouts in 56innings during July. Throughout much of August, his season ERA hovered below 3.00, and he averaged well over a strikeout per inning. On August 21, in an 8–3 victory over the Chicago Cubs, he broke Don Wilson's 1969 club record of 235strikeouts. In the final two months of the season, Richard's strikeout average dramatically increased, and he struck out a double-digit number of batters in three of his last five starts. In his third-to-last start, Richard broke Tom Seaver's NL record of 290strikeouts by a right-hander when he struck out Bob Horner. In his final outing of the season, Richard reached the 300-strikeout pinnacle by striking out Rowland Office in a September 28 victory over the Braves. He also hit his seventh career home run, making him the Astros' career leader in home runs by a pitcher.

5000|$|As {{observers}} expected, Giles {{began the}} 2014 {{season with the}} Reading Phillies after spending some time with the major league club during spring training. Through his first seven appearances, he allowed only two hits, and routinely reached over 100 mph with his fastball. His primary focus was developing a secondary pitch, namely a slider, and working on locating his fastball within the strike zone. With the worst bullpen in the major leagues, the Phillies faced mounting pressure to accelerate Giles' ascent through the minor leagues, but both manager Ryne Sandberg and general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. preached patience, asserting that he needed more time to develop. On May 9, Giles was promoted to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs to further hone his skills, and receive the chance to face better hitters, closer to what he would eventually face in the major leagues. In 11 appearances at Triple-A, he posted a 2.63 ERA, but struck out just nine in comparison to eight walks issued. In regards <b>to</b> <b>striking</b> <b>out</b> fewer batters, Giles said, [...] "They (Triple-A hitters) were more experienced, but I wasn't trying to do too much. I wasn't trying <b>to</b> <b>strike</b> everyone <b>out</b> kind of thing. I just tried to make good pitches and get outs. Get out of innings as quick as possible. The less pitches I had, the better." ...|$|R
