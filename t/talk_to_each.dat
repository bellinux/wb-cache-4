5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E
5|$|On {{a normal}} afternoon, Marge wants Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie {{to go for}} a walk. They agree when faced with the threat of having to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, and arrive at a Fortune Megastore, a venture of wealthy Arthur Fortune (modelled on British {{entrepreneur}} Richard Branson). Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{learns that}} Idris {{contains}} {{the personality of}} the TARDIS' matrix and that they can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other for the first time. Without House's support meanwhile, Uncle and Auntie die, and Idris's body only has a short time before it too will fail. Idris reveals that House had stranded many TARDISes before, and that its universe is hours away from collapsing. The Doctor and Idris work together to construct a makeshift TARDIS from scraps, and then pursue House.|$|E

5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Rihanna is walking towards a {{dressing}} room mirror while {{preparing for a}} show. This is intercut with scenes of Rihanna with her boyfriend in a restaurant. While they <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, Rihanna's boyfriend leaves the table and is absent for some time, during which Rihanna watches the other tables. One diner writes a note and gives it to a waiter, who passes it to Rihanna, who reads and quickly hides the note as her boyfriend returns to the table. Rihanna starts to sing the song's lyrics while she leaves the dressing room and approaches the stage, where she continues singing while a man plays a piano on the stage. The arena is empty and it appears as though Rihanna is rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|The Jackson-Rowe {{friendship}} {{would last}} for several years, {{during which time}} Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to have felt trapped by. Rowe and the musician would both <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other about their unhappy marriages; his with Presley and hers with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when {{he was accused of}} child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} panning view of a fence and people with {{umbrellas}} on the left, eventually zooming out on an audience looking through it in the rain. Both Volkova and Katina are then shown singing to the track in Catholic school uniforms. Throughout {{the majority of the}} visual, the girls are featured performing erratic behaviour, which includes them banging against a fence, yelling for help towards the audience, and occasionally laughing at them. While continuing to sing to each other during the second chorus, they subsequently start to kiss, and the audience slightly stares at their actions. Following this, several members of the public start to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, whilst a shot with the camera looking up Volkova's skirt and exposing her underwear is shown during the process.|$|E

5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|Cope's {{relations}} with Marsh {{turned into a}} competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull {{at the end of}} the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

25|$|System {{dynamics}} and discrete event simulation historically {{have been taught}} at universities to very different groups of students, namely management and economy, industrial and operation research engineers. As a result, there are two distinct practitioners' communities that never <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other.|$|E
25|$|A fifth debate {{took place}} on November 9 at Canal 13's studios in Santiago, which was {{broadcast}} live at 10 PM. All four candidates were present.

50|$|The {{fairly simple}} {{telephone}} achieves a limited form of telepresence using just the human sensory element of hearing, in that users consider themselves <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other rather than <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the telephone itself.|$|R

25|$|However, VRI {{cannot be}} used for {{situations}} in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With video relay service (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other on the phone through the interpreter.|$|E
25|$|While {{the novel}} alludes to a {{division}} within his mind, the film depicts him {{as having a}} split personality. The two personas—the childlike Smeágol and the evil Gollum—are established during {{a scene in which}} they argue over remaining loyal to Frodo. The two personalities <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, as established by contrasting camera angles and by Serkis altering his voice and physicality for each persona.|$|E
25|$|QOTW Off Topic {{was invented}} for those users of QOTW who found they had {{things in common}} and liked to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other using the reply system. Over several weeks {{it became clear that}} more and more people were preferring to chat to each other through the replies instead of the /talk board which was already set up, so Off Topic was created.|$|E

25|$|Steinbergs also filmed a {{video in}} which he and his two companions (his girlfriend and another student) {{approach}} the smoking crater and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other excitedly when they apparently discover a burning mass {{at the bottom of}} the crater. The deliberately amateur style of the video, with shaky handheld camerawork and apparently spontaneous reactions from the students, has been compared to The Blair Witch Project. The video was published on YouTube and news websites, attracting worldwide interest. Landowner Larisa Gerasimova reportedly charged visitors the equivalent of $2 each to view the crater.|$|E
25|$|With two others, Captain Haldane and Sergeant Brockie, Churchill {{devised a}} plan. The {{building}} {{where they were}} held {{was surrounded by a}} patrolled courtyard, and then a wall. The sentries moved about, and the conspirators determined that at a certain point the sentries would be briefly unable to see part of the wall, and a fit man would be able to climb it. On the first night they resolved to try to escape, the sentries changed their patrol pattern and escape was impossible. On the second an opportunity arose where two sentries stopped to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other, and Churchill scaled the wall.|$|E
25|$|Another form {{of closed}} {{communication}} {{used in the}} books and movies {{is a set of}} mirrors which belonged to Sirius Black. Sirius gives Harry one mirror in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with a note explaining to Harry that Sirius and James Potter used to use the mirrors to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> other when they were put in separate detentions. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry uses a shard of his broken mirror to call for help from the Malfoy's cellar, and later finds out that Aberforth Dumbledore had been watching over Harry using Sirius' mirror, which he obtained from Mundungus Fletcher.|$|E
