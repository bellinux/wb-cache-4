The Guwahati Refinery is the most important manufacturing industry in the city. Located at Noonmati, the refinery was set up by the Indian Oil Corporation Limited as the first public sector refinery of India as well as the refinery of Indian Oil since 1962. It was built with an initial crude processing capacity of 0.75nbsp&million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) {{at the time of its}} commission which was gradually increased to 1.0nbsp&MMTPA.
