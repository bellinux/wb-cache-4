25|$|If {{at least}} one of the numbers has a {{hundreds}}-digit then if one of the numbers has a missing hundreds-digit <b>then</b> <b>write</b> a 0 digit in its place.

25|$|If the {{multiplicand}} has a hundreds-digit, {{find the}} product of the multiplier and the hundreds-digit of the multiplicand, and to this product add the carry digit if there is one. <b>Then</b> <b>write</b> the resulting sum of the hundreds-column under the line, also in the hundreds column.

25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column so far {{contains}} only one digit: the tens-digit of the multiplicand (though it might contain a carry digit under the line). Find {{the product of}} the multiplier and the tens-digits of the multiplicand. Then, if there is a carry digit (superscripted, under the line and in the tens-column), add it to this product. If the resulting sum is less than ten <b>then</b> <b>write</b> it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits <b>then</b> <b>write</b> its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit over to the next column: in this case the hundreds column.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the hundreds-column will contain three digits: the hundreds-digit of the ones-row, the tens-digit of the tens-row, and the ones-digit of the hundreds-row. Find the sum of these three digits, then if there is a carry-digit from the tens-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the hundreds-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit <b>then</b> <b>write</b> it down under the second line in the hundreds-column; if it has two digits <b>then</b> <b>write</b> the last digit down under the line in the hundreds-column, and carry the first digit over to the thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten thousands-digit under the line.|$|E
25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column might contain two digits: the tens-digit {{of the first}} number and the tens-digit of the second number. If one of the numbers has a missing tens-digit then the tens-digit for this number can be {{considered}} to be a 0. Add the tens-digits of the two numbers. Then, if there is a carry digit, add it to this sum. If the sum was 18 then adding the carry digit to it will yield 19. If the sum of the tens-digits (plus carry digit, if there is one) is less than ten <b>then</b> <b>write</b> it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits <b>then</b> <b>write</b> its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit (which should be a 1) over to the next column: in this case the hundreds-column.|$|E

25|$|Consider a {{multiplication}} {{where one}} of the factors has multiple digits, whereas the other factor has only one digit. Write down the multi-digit factor, <b>then</b> <b>write</b> the single-digit factor under the last digit of the multi-digit factor. Draw a horizontal line under the single-digit factor. Henceforth, the multi-digit factor will be called the multiplicand, and the single-digit factor will be called the multiplier.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the ten-thousands-column will contain either one or two digits: the hundreds-digit of the hundreds-column and (possibly) the thousands-digit of the tens-column. Find the sum of these digits (if the one in the tens-row is missing {{think of it as a}} 0), and if there is a carry-digit from the thousands-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the ten-thousands-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit <b>then</b> <b>write</b> it down under the second line in the ten-thousands-column; if it has two digits <b>then</b> <b>write</b> the last digit down under the line in the ten-thousands-column, and carry the first digit over to the hundred-thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten hundred-thousands digit under the line. However, if the hundreds-row has no thousands-digit then do not write this carry-digit as a superscript, but in normal size, in the position of the hundred-thousands-digit under the second line, and the multiplication algorithm is over.|$|E

25|$|If {{none of the}} two numbers has a hundreds-digit then {{if there}} is no carry digit then the {{addition}} algorithm has finished. If there is a carry digit (carried over from the tens-column) <b>then</b> <b>write</b> it in the hundreds-column under the line, and the algorithm is finished. When the algorithm finishes, the number under the line is the sum of the two numbers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{physicists}} simply {{give up on}} {{a microscopic}} approach, and make informed guesses of the expected phases (perhaps based on NJL model results). For each phase, they <b>then</b> <b>write</b> down an effective theory for the low-energy excitations, {{in terms of a}} small number of parameters, and use it to make predictions that could allow those parameters to be fixed by experimental observations.|$|E
25|$|The ALUPEC is a {{phonetic writing}} {{system based on}} the Latin script and states only which letters {{should be used to}} {{represent}} each sound.

Wooden stopped writing the letters because of failing eyesight in {{the last months of}} his life.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the tens-column will contain a pair of digits located in the ones-row and the tens-row: the tens-digit of the ones-row and the ones-digit of the tens-row. Add these digits up and if the sum has just one digit <b>then</b> <b>write</b> this digit in the tens-column under the second line. If the sum has two digits then the first digit is a carry-digit: write the last digit down in the tens-column under the second line and carry the first digit over to the hundreds-column, writing it as a {{superscript}} to the yet-unwritten hundreds-digit under the second line.|$|E
25|$|In many {{categories}} it {{is possible}} to write every morphism as the composition of an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism. For instance, given a group homomorphism f : G → H, we can define the group K = im(f) = f(G) and <b>then</b> <b>write</b> f as the composition of the surjective homomorphism G → K which is defined like f, followed by the injective homomorphism K → H which sends each element to itself. Such a factorization of an arbitrary morphism into an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism can be carried out in all abelian categories and also in all the concrete categories mentioned above in the Examples section (though not in all concrete categories).|$|E

25|$|Years have passed, Michael is {{divorced}} {{and has a}} daughter from his brief marriage. He is {{trying to come to}} terms with his feelings for Hanna, and begins taping readings of books and sending them to her without any correspondence while she is in prison. Hanna begins to teach herself to read, and <b>then</b> <b>write</b> in a childlike way, by borrowing the books from the prison library and following the tapes along in the text. She writes to Michael, but he cannot bring himself to reply. After 18 years, Hanna is about to be released, so he agrees (after hesitation) to find her a place to stay and employment, visiting her in prison. On the day of her release in 1983, she commits suicide and Michael is heartbroken. Michael learns from the warden that she had been reading books by many prominent Holocaust survivors, such as Elie Wiesel, Primo Levi, Tadeusz Borowski, and histories of the camps. The warden, in her anger towards Michael for communicating with Hanna only by audio tapes, expresses Hanna's disappointment. Hanna left him an assignment: give all her money to the survivor of the church fire.|$|E
