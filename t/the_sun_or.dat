5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere. They are dense and opaque, not allowing the light of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of cumulonimbus clouds.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's {{existence}} the orbits of comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either collide with <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> a planet or else be ejected from the Solar System by planetary perturbations.|$|E

5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of {{the outer}} {{parts of the body}} was {{normally}} achieved through a combination of resins and animal skin wrappings. The resins were prepared with a mixture of minerals, plants, and fats. These were spread across the body prior to allowing it to dry, either in <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> through smoking. Finally, the deceased was wrapped in animal skins and laid to rest. The number of animal skins used in wrapping corresponded with the individual’s social status, with kings being wrapped with up to 15 skins.|$|E
5|$|Solar and lunar eclipses were {{considered}} to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world. In the Dresden Codex, a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the k'in ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.|$|E

5|$|Some comets meet a more {{spectacular}} end – either falling into <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> smashing into a planet or other body. Collisions between comets and planets or moons were {{common in the}} early Solar System: {{some of the many}} craters on the Moon, for example, may have been caused by comets. A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 broke up into pieces and collided with Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Thumbelina {{tries to}} protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits. She is finally given shelter by an old field mouse and tends her {{dwelling}} in gratitude. The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a mole, but Thumbelina finds repulsive {{the prospect of being}} married to such a creature because he spent all his days underground and never saw <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.|$|E
5|$|When both {{rates of}} {{movement}} are known, the space {{velocity of the}} star relative to <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, {{it has been found}} that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.|$|E

5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the only}} planet whose {{barycenter}} with the Sun lies outside {{the volume of the}} Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 millionkm (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>or</b> 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).|$|E

5|$|Kepler-6 {{was named}} for the Kepler Mission, a NASA and {{accomplishment}} project launched in 2009 that aims to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their home stars with respect to Earth. Unlike stars like <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> Sirius, Kepler-6 {{does not have a}} common and colloquial name. The discovery of Kepler-6b was announced by the Kepler team on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. It was the third planet to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets to be verified by data from Kepler had been previously discovered. These three planets were used to test the accuracy of Kepler's measurements.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's {{writings}} combined {{religious and}} scientific objections and were fueled by political events. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and {{arose from the}} fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.|$|E
5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states {{that there were}} hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>or</b> between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore and consumes a {{wide variety}} of animal prey, including carrion. It often catches a fish by flying low over the water and grasping it in its talons. It prepares for the strike by holding its feet far forward (almost under its chin) and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards. Generally only one foot is used to seize prey. The white-bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45 degree angle from its perch and briefly submerge to catch fish near the water surface. While hunting over water on sunny days, it often flies directly into <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>or</b> at right angles to it, seemingly to avoid casting shadows over the water and hence alerting potential prey.|$|E
5|$|An ala or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, ale particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in a good relationship with an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E
5|$|People {{in eastern}} and {{southern}} Serbia believed that ale, in their voracity, attacked the Sun and the Moon. They gradually ate {{more and more of}} those celestial bodies, thereby causing an eclipse. During an eclipse, the Sun turned red because it was covered with its own blood {{as a result of the}} ale’s bites; when it shone brightly again, that meant it had defeated the ale. The spots on the Moon were seen as scars from the ale’s bites. While ale devoured <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>or</b> the Moon, many elderly people became depressed and even wept in fear. If ale succeeded in devouring the Sun, the world would end. To prevent that, men shot their guns toward the eclipse or rang bells, and women cast spells incessantly. There was a notion in the Homolje region that, if ale succeeded in devouring the Moon, the Sun would die from sorrow, and darkness would overwhelm the world.|$|E
