40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} providing incentives <b>to</b> <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> decide cases {{in the same way}} that an appellate panel would decide them. Random selection of a proportion of cases for retrial could be used <b>to</b> encourage <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> place aside their preferences in deference to the perceived preferences of a majority of judges. Providing such incentives <b>to</b> <b>judges</b> may reduce the need for alternative approaches to reducing judicial discretion, such as substantive law based on rules rather than on discretion. An information market similarly could be used to accomplish the task of adjudication, with some cases randomly selected for traditional adjudication to discipline the information market participants. Such an approach may be more cost-efficient than provision of monetary incentives <b>to</b> <b>judges</b> where information is widely dispersed, or where it is impractical for the government <b>to</b> hire enough <b>judges</b> <b>to</b> handle a large group of cases. Advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are discussed...|$|R
