500|$|Some {{observers}} thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. James Berardinelli {{questioned the}} [...] "random amount [...] of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." [...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual." [...] George Clooney joked, [...] "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay". Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, [...] "I think we might have killed the franchise", and called it [...] "a waste of money".|$|E
2500|$|After a brief tour, John K {{decided to}} rejoin Biomechanical full-time. In an interview, John said [...] "I found my self giving Biomechanical less that [...] 100% and <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> a lot... As a {{musician}} {{you have something}} to say and I think you can easily lose direction by playing in two or three bands. I personally find it disorientating and I would prefer to focus in my band only." [...] The decision was amicable and the band continued to work on other projects.|$|E
2500|$|A puppet {{version of}} Garofalo {{appeared}} (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, {{she was more}} upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. [...] "I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> even more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Producer Robert Lorenz {{said that}} while the script was {{originally}} set in Minnesota, he chose Michigan as the actual setting as Kowalski is a retired car plant worker. Metro Detroit was the point of origin of the Ford Motor Company. Schenk said that sometimes the lines in the movie feel out of place with the Detroit setting; for instance a line about one of Walt's sons asks if Walt still knows a person who has season tickets for Minnesota Vikings games was changed to being about a person with Detroit Lions tickets. Schenk said [...] "They don't sell out in Detroit. And so <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> It seemed really untrue to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perron {{followed}} {{up the next}} week with a second blog post on the subject. She interviewed Lane who states {{that she did not}} expect to be named during Portman's acceptance speech because a Fox Searchlight producer had asked her to stop giving interviews until after the Oscars were over: [...] "They were trying to create this façade that [...] had become a ballerina {{in a year and a}} half ... So I knew they didn't want to publicize anything about me." [...] Perron then states that Lane [...] "says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we work so hard, but people can actually believe that it's easy enough to do it in a year. That's the thing <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> the most.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments." ...|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, Aames {{agreed to}} promote the film, because he {{admitted}} that [...] "aside from those parts <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> <b>me,</b> it's a damn good film." [...] Cates felt differently, and refused {{to have anything to}} do with the promotion such as screenings and parties. According to Aames, Cates was [...] "really upset" [...] by the film.|$|R

60|$|After {{talking with}} the New York client whose local {{interests}} I represented I sat thinking over the conversation with Perry. Considering Maude's intimacy with and affection for the Blackwoods, the affair was awkward, opening up many uncomfortable possibilities; {{and it was the}} prospect of discomfort <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> rather than regret for the probable loss of Perry's friendship. I still believed myself to have an affection for him: undoubtedly this was a sentimental remnant....|$|E
6000|$|... "No--it's <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me.</b> If I {{had seen}} him do it I would have gone {{straight}} and told Dechamp, but I didn't quite see him, you see.

500|$|Henderson {{served as}} an {{assistant}} to his former coach Carmody during Carmody's first eleven seasons as the coach at Northwestern University. Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part of a joke for a Sports Illustrated: [...] "I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those guys on the court. The thing <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> is <b>that</b> he's faster than all of them." [...] During Henderson's final three seasons at Northwestern, the team qualified for the National Invitation Tournament.|$|R

60|$|It did {{not seem}} to me that I was lost, yet lost I was. The peaks were not in sight. The canyon widened down the slope, and I was pretty sure that it opened out flat into the great pine forest of Penetier.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Sway Calloway, Eminem stated that, [...] "everything he wanted to address" [...] in regard to his mother is on [...] "Headlights" [...] and he likely will not speak on the topic outside of that particular song.

5000|$|However, {{the same}} second act that earned praise from some critics was criticised by Sam Marlowe, saying [...] "The {{problem is that}} this parade of comic {{cardboard}} cut-outs is impossible to care about, so it's not long before it falls flat," [...] whilst arguing the earlier scenes worked better. Charles Spencer, reviewing the show on its tour at Guildford, was harsher, suggesting this play was evidence of Ayckbourn's decline. He wrote: [...] "Ultimately, it's the laziness <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> most about latter-day Ayckbourn. You don't feel he truly cares about his characters any more: indeed, at times he can't be bothered to get inside their heads at all." ...|$|R
