5|$|St-Calais {{was brought}} before the king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, before which the king seized his lands. At the trial, St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then asked for an appeal to Rome, which was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or lands, was forfeit. Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal to Rome, his fellow bishops believed otherwise. Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his appeal to Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to appeal to Rome.|$|E

On 14 July Aehrenthal responded with guarded acceptance of the proposed discussions. On 10 September, after long and complex discussions within the Imperial Government discussing the Izvolsky proposals to Austria-Hungary, Aehrenthal outlined a slightly different set of counter-proposals to him: he proposed that in exchange for a friendly Russian attitude when Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary would then withdraw its troops from the Sanjak. The letter then went on to offer to discuss, as a separate matter, the Straits question, on a friendly basis. Aehrenthal proposed that should agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina be reached, his Government would not - should the Russians subsequently propose <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of their Black Sea fleet to both use and protect their access to the Mediterranean through the Bosporus - automatically decide with the other powers to support collectively the Ottoman Empire's opposition (up to and including war) to such a proposal.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are male}} line {{descendants}} of King Carol II: Paul of Romania (b. 1948), his son Carol Ferdinand (b. 2010), and Alexandru Hohenzollern (b. 1961). Paul and Alexandru are {{the sons of}} Carol Mircea Hohenzollern, also known as Carol Mircea Grigore of Romania (according to his Romanian birth certificate). Carol Mircea (8 January 1920 - 27 January 2006) {{is the issue of}} King Carol II's first marriage to Zizi Lambrino, which marriage had been declared null and void on 18 January 1919 by a Romanian court. In 1955, however, a Portuguese court declared Carol Mircea as former King Carol II's legitimate son, a ruling later confirmed by a Parisian court [...] The court rulings allowed him to bear the surname Hohenzollern and to inherit a portion of his father's properties, but did not confer upon him any dynastic rights to the defunct Romanian throne or rights to bear a princely title and style, despite his use of both. In October 1995 a Romanian court ruling also recognized Carol Mircea as a legitimate son of Carol II, allowing him the right to bear the surname [...] "al României", a ruling which evoked some speculation that called into question the status of Michael. The court ruling was cited by Paul <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to the title [...] "Prince". The argument which appears prevalent is that Mircea Carol's sons would not be entitled to succession rights, due to the non-dynastic nature of their grandparents' marriage. Moreover, Carol Mircea never claimed any right to the Romanian throne, unlike his son, Paul.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{historians of}} the {{international}} system have called into question the significance of the Treaties of Westphalia in 1648 as the moment when the international system formed. One of their primary arguments is that the non-intervention norm typically associated with Westphalian notions of sovereignty developed much later. This paper will examine the early 17 th-century debates over the right of the Pope to depose monarchs in the defense of spiritual matters. I read Part III and Part IV of Hobbes’ Leviathan in its intellectual context to see how his theory of sovereignty was partially developed to support a theory of non-intervention. This reading leads to two important contributions to current political science debates. First, it refutes the growing consensus that non-intervention developed as an aspect of sovereignty only in the late 18 th and early 19 th century. Second, the paper addresses current attempts <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of humanitarian intervention. By exploring similarities between these recent debates and those between Bellarmine and Hobbes in the 17 th century, I offer a fresh perspective on what is at stake in current claims to international community...|$|E
40|$|Burying {{deceased}} {{family members}} in familial gravesites close to the homestead of the living has been a well-established practice in Southern Africa for many centuries. In terms of indigenous cultural and religious norms proximate burials are essential for enabling ancestors to commune amongst themselves and with their living descendants. In the colonial and apartheid eras many African communities lost ownership of their land. One of the consequences was that they needed permission from white landowners to continue with burials in established gravesites. In the democratic era the legislature sought to reintroduce a burial right for rural black land occupiers. Section 6 (2) (dA) of the Extension of Security of Tenure Act 62 of 1997 allowed occupiers <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of familial burial as against landowners, provided certain conditions were met. In Selomo v Doman 2014 JDR 0780 (LCC) Spilg J permitted a burial {{despite the fact that}} the applicant and deceased had not been resident near their family gravesite for many years. In our analysis of the judgment we suggest that the court's attempts to find justification in the Extension of Security of Tenure Act 62 of 1997 and the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act 3 of 1996 were misconstrued. With proximate familial burials being essentially a matter of respect for dignity and indigenous culture, the court should have engaged in a deeper analysis of constitutional rights...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} a dearth {{in the literature}} on environmental equity in water governance in the "desakota", the extended metropolitan region of the great cities of Southeast Asia. Through a case study, the authors describe how, in an intensive mixed land use situation, the actions of new urban users of irrigation canals have degraded the water, unfairly prejudicing low-income farmers' entitlement to irrigation water of appropriate quality and harming their livelihood. It is argued that certain characteristics of existing land- and water-sector-related management institutions in Thailand encourage a disproportionate shift of the environmental burden to small farmers. This phenomenon also involves the violation of procedural equity - the farmers' right to be informed, to be able <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to and negotiate for appropriate water, and to participate meaningfully in strategic decisions related to water governance in the peri-urban area. The problem is mediated by administrative separatism, ambiguity and multiplicity in the functional jurisdiction of water-related government bodies, and the general lack of a participatory culture in the bureaucracy. The authors further argue that, without state acknowledgement of this form of injustice, establishing appropriate mechanisms and public institutions that will purposively address concerns of environmental equity is a remote possibility, and that this inequity will likely continue to be patterned and inscribed in the peri-urban geography of the mega-cities of Southeast Asia.

40|$|Historically, U. S. {{anti-discrimination}} {{law has been}} concerned with the total exclusion of certain groups from the workplace or from particular job categories within the workplace. Laws were directed at this across-the-board intolerance. As scholars (including Devon Carbado, Barbara Flagg, Mitu Gulati, Angela Harris and others) have noted, {{this is not the}} sole or arguably the primary way in which discrimination operates today. Homogeneous institutions and job categories are now suspicious (and presumably the market will no longer tolerate such places). Thus, instead of the wholesale exclusion of groups, what we are more likely to see is intra-group “screening” or “preferencing” to determine who will be included; that is, instead of the total exclusion of a group, employers are more likely to identify within groups those individuals they find most palatable (e. g., by selecting a lighter-toned African American over a darker-toned African American, a woman who wears makeup over a woman who does not, or a gay male who downplays his sexuality over a gay male who celebrates it). Although scholars have done an excellent job documenting the ways in which intra-group discrimination happens and have made progress in securing legal recognition of intra-group claims, one question has received scant attention in the literature. It is this: assuming a legal basis for intra-group claims, can plaintiffs actually win these cases? In other words, {{it is one thing to}} be able <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to relief; it is another to convince a fact finder to grant that relief. In the attached article, Intra-Group Preferencing: Problems of Proof in Colorism and Identity Performance Cases, I fill a missing void in the literature by exposing the unique challenges that plaintiffs face in proving intra-group claims. I also demonstrate ways in which traditional legal frameworks must be tweaked in order to address more subtle and nuanced contemporary discrimination...|$|E
40|$|Contraception {{is often}} a taken-for-granted element of {{actively}} heterosexual women’s lives. Yet while modern contraceptives have technically enhanced women’s ability to control their fertility, the history of women’s struggles to achieve this control shows the importance of understanding the social context within which women’s contraceptive decisions are situated. Previous feminist studies of contraception in the UK have tended to concentrate either on aspects of medicine or on heterosexuality. Whilst both areas have highlighted the {{need to understand how}} power relationships structure women’s contraceptive experiences, these two aspects have not been integrated adequately. There has also been a tendency to focus research on younger women, and mature women’s ongoing use of contraception has generally been overlooked. This thesis is based on qualitative interviews with twenty-two mid-life British women aged between 30 and 40, as well as observations at a family planning clinic. It demonstrates that only by giving full consideration to the extent and complexity of the power relationships surrounding contraception can an understanding of women’s decisions and everyday practices be achieved. The concept of ‘subjective power’ is developed to explore how these women make strategic and creative use of circulating discourses, interact with disciplinary regimes, and situate themselves within multi-faceted webs of power relationships, such as in relation to the institutions of medicine, the media, and heterosexuality. The embodied nature of both the risk of pregnancy and the use of contraceptive technologies is argued to lead the women <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of bodily autonomy. Yet this assertion conflicts with their expectation of equitable coupledom within heterosexuality and their routine consideration of men’s preferences. In addition, this thesis will show that taking ‘proper’ responsibility for preventing pregnancy constructs women as respectable, yet may increase their risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections.

40|$|In the {{tradition}} of legal pluralism, I explore the various notions of a right influenced by claims on little bits of contingent space. As a consequence of this territoriality, the municipal regulation of and local politics surrounding parking spaces produce competing notions of legality. The jurisprudence of the parking space examines a type of governing that is local and often contested. In spaces where formal law is evident, yet dominantly absent, social law become judge and jury. Right and its regulation are culturally dependent and politically malleable. The right to park is a special right, {{considered to be a}} presumption of expectation connected, literally, to a person driving a car and lines on the pavement. Jurisprudentially, this special right is enacted between individuals in everyday parking environments where often the social norm operates as 2 ̆ 7 the law. 2 ̆ 7 In many cases, formal law is distanced. Feeding the meter manages the threat of a ticket. The appeal of a ticket is the pronouncement of right. Yelling angrily at a driver who parks triumphantly in a coveted space is a noisy but weak attempt <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>a</b> <b>right.</b> The fundamental issues that I explore in the project involve the hybridization of right, identity, and property. My study of the parking space is complex, as I consider the semiotics of the terrain, the embodiment of jurisdiction, and expertise as governance as factors of legitimacy focused on the visibility of who is parking. This notion of belonging is central to the frameworks of community and citizenship in which parking spaces become site of politically constructed architecture. These sites are policed officially by the sexualized authority of parking enforcement and unofficially (and often violently) by other parkers. In this way, law is personified, with the administration of authority inviting closer scrutiny into the nature of constitutive legal theory. At both the level of the United States Supreme Court and in the everyday parking area, the parking space engenders disputes over equal protection guarantees, acts of free speech, and assertions of reserve that reach beyond the stated scope of policy. ...|$|E

SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS: During prosecution, most patent applicants contend with non- 102 (b) prior art that could be antedated.

50|$|New York {{state courts}} may issue a writ of coram nobis only for claims of {{ineffective}} assistance of appellate counsel. The Court of Appeals of the State of New York provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in New York (Citations and quotes removed): In New York courts, the writ of coram nobis is available but its application is considerably {{different than the}} writ’s application in other courts. In 1971, most of the common-law, coram nobis types of relief were abrogated when the New York Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 (CPL 440.10) was enacted to embrace the deprivation of constitutional rights outside the record; however, the specific category of “ineffective assistance of appellate counsel” was not specified by the Legislature {{at the time of}} its enactment.The US constitution provides that a criminal defendant must be provided <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to appeal <b>an</b> unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel. Consistent with the demands of due process, a criminal defendant must be allowed <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> that <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> appeal was extinguished due solely to the unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel in failing to file a timely notice of appeal.CPL 460.30 contains a significant restriction as it imposes a one-year limit for the filing of a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal. Consistent with the due process mandate, CPL 460.30 should not categorically bar an appellate court from considering that a defendant's application to pursue an untimely appeal whenever:# An attorney has failed to comply with a timely request for the filing of a notice of appeal and # The defendant alleges that the omission could not reasonably have been discovered within the one-year period, the time limit imposed in CPL 460.30.Whenever these two criteria are met, the proper procedure is a coram nobis application to the Appellate Division. After CPL 440.10 was enacted, common-law coram nobis proceeding brought in the proper appellate court became the only available and appropriate procedure and forum to review a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.|$|R
