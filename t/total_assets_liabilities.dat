40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to evaluate {{the effect of the}} adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the financial position of banks in Nigeria. In order to achieve this, we adopted a quantitative research design that primarily focused on the construction of quantitative data by obtaining the required information on <b>Total</b> <b>Assets,</b> <b>Liabilities</b> and Equities needed for the purpose of data analysis from the annual reports and accounts of three sampled banks in Nigeria. Analysis was based on periods before and after IFRS adoption and was done using the Ordinary Least Square technique. Findings from this study show among others that IFRS adoption significantly and positively affected the financial position of the sample banks in Nigeria. On the basis of our findings, we recommend that all organizations, as a matter of urgency, should be made by law to comply with the provisions of IFRS, and the continuous training and retraining of accountants, preparers of financial statements and all stakeholders must remain a re-occurring decimal generally in corporate entities, and in banks (in particular) in Nigeria...|$|E

By employing event study methodology, this study examined 5, 189 firms listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ. Among these firms, 331 received ISO 14001 certification during 1996 - 2010, while only 174 firms had accurate dates of their first certification. These firms were used as the sample for this study. The long-term financial performance was measured by eight dependent performance variables (ROA 1, ROA 2, ROS (Return on Sales), Stock price, Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s Q, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) /SALES, Sales growth rate, and SALES/ASSETS). The long-term effect of ISO 14001 certification on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s equity structure was measured by four dependent performance variables (Assets, Liabilities, Debt ratio (Liabilities/Equity), and Market-to-book ratio of equity). The certified firms 2 ̆ 7 performance was {{compared to that of}} the control firms based on three criteria (ROA, Assets, and z-value). ^ The results indicate that the profitability variables (ROA 1, ROA 2, ROS, Stock price, and Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s Q) showed immediate positive abnormal effects after firms applied for the certification, while the market benefit variables (Sales growth rate and SALES/ASSETS) showed gradual improvements after obtaining the certification. ISO 14001 also showed a positive effect on the internal process improvement (COGS/SALES). Overall, ISO 14001 was found beneficial to the firm in the long run from the perspectives of profitability, internal process improvement, and market benefits. ^ In terms of the effect on firms 2 ̆ 7 equity structure, the results show that the adoption of ISO 14001 increases a firm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>total</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and debt ratio in the long run, implying that pursuing the certification entails an increase in a firm 2 ̆ 7 s size and equity risk. The long-term movement of market-to-book ratio of equity showed no abnormal performance, while it fluctuated in the short term. These results suggest that managers should consider the potential risk from a firm 2 ̆ 7 s equity structure when they decide to pursue the ISO 14001 certification. ...|$|E

The thesis analyzes the relationship of working {{capital management}} on company’s profitability in Indonesia for the period 2007 to 2011. For this purpose, multiple regression analysis is used to analyze 127 manufacturing companies which are listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange. The results indicate that the current <b>asset</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> ratio, current <b>liabilities</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> ratio, firm’s size, and sales growth are significantly affecting the profitability of firms. The effective policies must be formulated for the individual components of working capital.

The theoretical literature is quite limited and the most appropriate macroeconomic framework would be complex and difficult to apply. We therefore examine some simpler empirical hypotheses about the size of these <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> but find that they are rejected by the data. We conclude that while an institutional and theoretical approach reveals the nature of UK banks' overseas <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> and suggests some of their determinants, developing a satisfactory empirical model is quite difficult.
