40|$|Cross-linguistic {{data suggest}} that the {{grammatical}} categories of tense and aspect are not generally impaired in individuals with aphasia (see Bastiaanse et al., 2011 for a review). Rather, and more specifically, verb forms expressing reference to the past or conveying perfective semantics are more impaired than verb forms expressing reference to the non-past (present or future) or conveying imperfective semantics, both in comprehension and production. The present study used some structural properties of Russian to systematically test the interaction of <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> aspect in non-fluent and fluent aphasia. The Test for Assessment of <b>Reference</b> of <b>Time</b> (TART; Bastiaanse, Jonkers, & Thompson, 2008; Russian version Dragoy & Bastiaanse, 2010) was used to elicit production of four verb forms in sentence context: past perfective, non-past perfective, past imperfective and non-past imperfective. The results showed that non-past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> had a general advantage over past <b>time</b> <b>reference,</b> all aspectual forms being collapsed. However, an interaction between <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> aspect was found: imperfective verbs were better produced in the non-past, whereas production of perfective verbs was better preserved in the past time frame. Non-fluent and fluent aphasic speakers showed largely overlapping performance. These results demonstrated that the advantage of a particular <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> depends on aspectual characteristics of the verb. The performance of both non-fluent and fluent aphasic speakers can be explained in terms of prototypical and non-prototypical matches of <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> aspectual semantics: perfectives primarily refer to completed, past events while imperfectives prototypically describe ongoing, non-past events.

5000|$|In {{traditional}} Latin and Ancient Greek grammar, {{the perfect}} {{is a particular}} conjugated verb form considered {{to be one of}} the tenses. Modern analyses view the perfect constructions of these languages as combining elements of grammatical tense (such as <b>time</b> <b>reference)</b> <b>and</b> grammatical aspect. The Greek perfect contrasted with the aorist and the imperfect, and referred specifically to completed events with present consequences; its meaning was thus similar to that of the English construction [...] "have/has (done something)". The Latin perfect contrasted only with the imperfect (used for past incomplete actions or states), and was thus used to mean both [...] "have/has done something" [...] and [...] "did something" [...] (the preterite use). Other related forms are the pluperfect, denoting an event prior to a past <b>time</b> of <b>reference,</b> <b>and</b> the future perfect, for an event prior to a future <b>time</b> of <b>reference.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a pilot study examining the representation of the typology of conditional sentences presented in English language teaching (ELT) materials (coursebooks and grammars) in a random sample of 1, 000 conditional sentences from the British National Corpus. The if-clause and main clause of the conditional sentences in the sample was annotated for the form of the main verb (particularly tense and aspect), the modal auxiliaries and other lexis expressing modality, <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> modality. Each sentence was also annotated for the type of relation holding between the two clauses, as well as their relative <b>time</b> <b>reference.</b> ELT materials essentially use the typology in logic (real, counterfactual and hypothetical conditionals), with the addition of two more types, â��zeroâ�� and â��mixedâ��. The vast majority of ELT materials provide information about the following aspects of conditional sentences: a. The tense-aspect marking of the main verbs in the if-clause and main clause. b. The modal auxiliaries {{that can be used in}} each clause. c. The <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> of the conditional sentence (not of each clause). d. The userâ��s attitude towards possibility. Maule (1988) examined 100 conditional sentences collected from television and found that there was a large group of sentences that could not fit in the framework of the 3 types. The study supports this finding, but also points towards the need to adapt the typology and information offered in ELT materials. The paper reports on the frequency of the five ELT types in the sample and outlines the cases that the typology does not cover. It also presents some preliminary findings regarding patterns in tense marking and modal expression on one hand, <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> modality on the other, briefly discusses implications for a pedagogical treatment of conditionals and proposes a tentative adaptation of the ELT typology...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A remote {{synchronization}} {{system for}} the on-board crystal oscillator (RESSOX) of the QZSS is proposed. Aimed at offering an alternative architecture for the classic GPS time-keeping system (TKS), the proposed system consists of a synchronization framework where an ultrastable atomic clock, localized at the ground station, is kept synchronized to a second <b>time</b> <b>reference,</b> a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO), on-board the QZSS satellite. Based on orbit calculations and delay predictions, feedback and feed-forward control guarantee the correct synchronization of the on-board <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> the ground-station atomic clock. Compared with the classic GPS TKS, the RESSOX scheme offers several advantages in terms of accuracy, cost, weight, and power consumption. An extensive explanation of this novel design is presented. Differences and advantages of the proposed system are compared with the classic atomic clock scheme...|$|R

As a second contribution, we propose estimating the validity of predictions by automatically searching for realworld events corresponding to the predictions.

The paper identifies the key factors {{that give rise to}} various problems, such as in-vacuo vs. in-context treatment of modal verbs and absolute vs. relative temporal relations. It is argued that most students fail to fully understand contextualised modal verb constructions mostly due to the polysemy of modal verbs as well as their relative tense value.

40|$|Objectives—Individuals with nonfluent agrammatic aphasia show {{impaired}} production <b>and</b> {{comprehension of}} <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> via verbal morphology. However, cross-linguistic findings to date suggest inconsistent evidence {{as to whether}} tense processing in general is impaired or <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> to the past is selectively difficult in this population. This study examined production <b>and</b> comprehension of <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> via verb morphology in Korean-speaking individuals with nonfluent aphasia. Methods—A group of 9 healthy controls and 8 individuals with nonfluent aphasia (5 for the production task) participated in the study. Sentence priming production and auditory sentence to picture matching tasks were used, parallel with the previous cross-linguistic experiments in English, Chinese, Turkish, and others. Results—The participants with nonfluent aphasia showed different patterns of impairment in production and comprehension. In production, they were impaired in all <b>time</b> <b>references</b> with errors being dominated by substitution of incorrect <b>time</b> <b>references</b> <b>and</b> other morpho-phonologically well-formed errors, indicating a largely intact morphological affixation process. In comprehension, they showed selective impairment of the past, consistent with the cross-linguistic evidence from English, Chinese, Turkish, and others. Conclusion—The findings suggest that interpretation of past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> poses particular difficulty in nonfluent aphasia irrespective of typological characteristics of languages; however, in production, language-specific morpho-semantic functions of verbal morphology may {{play a significant role}} in selective breakdowns of <b>time</b> <b>reference.</b> This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licens...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Emerging {{cyber-physical system}} (CPS) {{applications}} require reliable time synchronization to enable distributed control and sensing applications. However, <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> signals {{are vulnerable to}} attacks that could remain undetected for a long time. Sensor-rich distributed CPS such as the ”smart grid” highly rely on GPS <b>and</b> similar <b>time</b> <b>references</b> for sub-station clock synchronization. The vulnerability of time synchronization protocols to spoofing attacks is a potential risk factor {{that may lead to}} falsified sensor readings and, at a larger scale, may become hazardous for system safety. This paper describes a simulationbased assessment of the effect of time accuracy on time-centric power system applications. In particular, the vulnerability of power grid sensors to erroneous <b>time</b> <b>references</b> <b>and</b> the potential risks of time-base spoofing on power grid health are studied, using the Ptolemy modeling and simulation tool. Both the false alarm and the missed generation scenarios are considered, where the GPS spoofer may lead the substation to declare an erroneous out-of-phase situation, or the substation may be disabled to detect anomalies that are present in the incoming phase data.

Originally this was done with an electro-mechanical interlock between the camera and recorder, necessitating a physical link, a cable, between recorder and camera.
