5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved <b>the</b> <b>cigar,</b> keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit <b>the</b> <b>cigar,</b> and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World Is Not Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E

5|$|When The Great Silence was {{screened}} for Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox {{to see whether}} the film could be released on the American market, he was offended by the film (to the point where he reportedly swallowed <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> he was smoking in shock upon watching the ending), and refused to distribute it in the United States. 20th Century Fox did, however, distribute the film in Italy and several other markets. The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, the Mint shipped five kegs {{of the new}} coins, each holding 10,000 pieces, to Chicago. Each keg held five {{bags with}} a {{thousand}} coins each, though in one keg, one bag was intentionally short four coins, as also in that keg was a cigar box containing four envelopes, with coins number 1, 400, 1492, and 1892 {{from the first day}} of production. The kegs were taken to the Chicago Sub-Treasury, and on December 19 at 1:00pm conveyed to Room 404 of the Rand McNally Building, the exposition's headquarters. There, Harlow N. Higinbotham, president of the Exposition Company, took mallet and chisel in hand and opened the keg, removing <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> box. Placing three of the envelopes in his pocket, he displayed the first coin to the assembled crowd, then exchanged it for a check—Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict (later the Remington Typewriter Company and makers of the official typewriter of the fair), was purchasing the first coin struck for $10,000 as a publicity stunt. That coin was donated to the newly established Columbian Museum (today the Field Museum). The Company immediately put the pieces on sale for $1 each, and the first shipment was soon all sold to those who lined up to buy them, had ordered them by mail, or had purchased them at local banks that were given allocations. No official packaging was provided; the pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's major {{industries}} {{of the era}} were the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Westward expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Philadelphia keep up with nearby New York City in domestic commerce, as both cities fought for dominance in transporting iron and coal resources from Pennsylvania. Philadelphia's other local railroad was the Reading Railroad, but {{after a series of}} bankruptcies, it was taken over by New Yorkers. The Panic of 1873, which occurred when the New York City branch of the Philadelphia bank Jay Cooke and Company failed, and another panic in the 1890s hampered Philadelphia's economic growth. While the depressions hurt the city, its diverse array of industries helped it weather difficult times. It had numerous iron and steel-related manufacturers, including Philadelphian-owned iron and steel works outside the city, most notably the Bethlehem Iron Company in the city by that name. The largest industry in Philadelphia was textiles. Philadelphia produced more textiles than any other U.S. city; in 1904 the textile industry employed more than 35 percent of the city's workers. <b>The</b> <b>cigar,</b> sugar, and oil industries also were strong in the city. During this time the major department stores: Wanamaker's, Gimbels, Strawbridge and Clothier, and Lit Brothers, were developed along Market Street.|$|E

25|$|Ybor City {{was founded}} as an {{independent}} town in 1885 {{by a group of}} cigar manufacturers led by Vicente Martinez-Ybor and was annexed by Tampa in 1887. The original population was mostly composed of Cuban and Spanish immigrants who worked in <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> factories. Italian and Eastern-European Jewish immigrants followed shortly thereafter and established many retail shops, farms and grocery stores, box factories, print shops, and other enterprises which catered to <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> industry and its workers.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike Caribbean cigars, where {{a binder}} is rolled around the filler tobacco before the wrapper tobacco covers it over, <b>the</b> Toscano <b>cigar</b> {{is made by}} rolling the filler tobacco with only the wrapper tobacco (without any binder). <b>The</b> {{production}} of <b>cigars</b> then continues on two lines: production by hand for high quality and limited edition cigars, and production by machine. In the production by hand, a cigar roller known as [...] "sigaraia" [...] produces up to 520 cigars per day. After rolling, <b>the</b> <b>cigars</b> are air-dried in an aging chamber. Depending on the duration of maturation, different qualities result. <b>The</b> <b>cigars</b> are placed in ventilated cells with controlled humidity levels. The aging period varies depending on <b>the</b> type of <b>cigar.</b> Some of <b>the</b> high-quality Toscano <b>cigars</b> are hand-rolled such as the Toscano Il Moro, Toscano Il Presidente, Toscano Originale.|$|R

25|$|Unlike Cubans and Spaniards, the Italians {{arrived in}} <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> town without cigar-making skills. When the early Italians entered the factories, {{it was at}} the bottom of the ladder, {{positions}} which did not involve handling tobacco. Working beside unskilled Cubans, mainly Afro-Cubans, they swept and hauled and were porters and doorkeepers. In time, many did become cigar workers, including Italian women. The majority of the Italian women worked as cigar strippers in 1900, an undesirable position mainly held by women who could find nothing else. However, eventually many of them became skilled cigar makers, earning more than the male Italian cigar makers. Other Italian immigrants started small businesses built around <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> industry, such as cafés, food stores, restaurants, and boardinghouses.|$|E

25|$|By {{pumping out}} {{hundreds}} of millions of hand-rolled cigars annually (the peak was 500,000,000 in 1929, right before the Great Depression took hold), <b>the</b> <b>cigar</b> workers of Ybor City not only made a good life for themselves, but also pumped millions of dollars into the coffers of local businesses and city government.|$|E

25|$|For one, the {{worldwide}} demand for cigars had not returned to pre-Depression levels, and many factories that had {{closed in the}} 1930s remained shuttered and empty.
