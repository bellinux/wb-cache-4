50|$|HD Audio {{can sense}} <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> audio dongle. A 10 kΩ pull-up {{resistor}} {{is attached to}} pin 4 (PRESENCE#). When the HDA dongle is plugged in, it pulls pin 4 to ground with a 1 kΩ resistor. The motherboard can determine if the dongle is plugged in by examining the logic level on pin 4. If the motherboard does not detect <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> HDA dongle, then it should ignore SENSE1_RETURN (pin 6) and SENSE2_RETURN (pin 10) signals. In AC'97, pins 2 and 4 are audio ground, but pin 4 is often disconnected. Consequently, an HDA motherboard would not detect <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> AC'97 dongle with a disconnected pin 4.|$|R

5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—{{the perception of}} stimuli (for example, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the perception of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the perception of a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). <b>The</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing {{an increase in the}} frequency of leaps.|$|E

5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra {{is less than a}} third as wide as the ventral part; <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable portion of the population. <b>The</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E
5|$|Alcohols do not {{normally}} behave as acids in water, but <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> double bond {{adjacent to the}} OH group can substantially decrease the pKa by the mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism. Ascorbic acid {{is an example of}} this effect. The diketone 2,4-pentanedione (acetylacetone) is also a weak acid because of the keto–enol equilibrium. In aromatic compounds, such as phenol, which have an OH substituent, conjugation with the aromatic ring as a whole greatly increases the stability of the deprotonated form.|$|E
