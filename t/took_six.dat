5|$|During 1930, Allen again had {{leave in}} which he could play cricket, and was among the front-runners for {{a place in the}} England team. His first {{appearance}} of the season was for the MCC against the Australian touring team. Although he took four for 28 on the last day, his rivals for an England place were also successful. Playing for Middlesex against the Australians, Allen <b>took</b> <b>six</b> for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. England won the match during the course of which Larwood, the incumbent fast bowler in the team, fell ill. Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being chosen, and <b>took</b> <b>six</b> for 77. His subsequent inclusion in the squad of 13 for that game was not particularly well received by the press.|$|E
