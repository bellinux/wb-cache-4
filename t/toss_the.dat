5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that <b>toss,</b> <b>the</b> player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
5|$|Winning the <b>toss,</b> <b>the</b> Panthers {{opted to}} bowl first. The Royals scored 162 runs for five wickets, and Swapnil Asnodkar and Mohammad Kaif top-scored with 41 run each. Dawid Malan took two wickets for 23 runs. In reply, the Panthers made 116 runs for seven wickets, as the Royals won by 46 runs. Sohail Tanvir took three wickets for 20 runs, and Dimitri Mascarenhas {{was named the}} man of the match for his all-round performance.|$|E
5|$|The draft {{order was}} {{determined}} by a coin <b>toss,</b> <b>the</b> winner of which could choose either: (a) the first overall pick in the expansion draft and the 28th, and last, pick {{in the first round}} of the 1993 MLB amateur draft; or (b) allow the other team to pick first and receive both the second and third overall expansion draft picks, the right to pick first in the subsequent rounds of the expansion draft, and the 27th, and next-to-last, overall pick in the 1993 MLB amateur draft. Colorado won the toss and chose to pick first overall.|$|E
25|$|They tested {{this concept}} under three {{different}} conditions. The first was person focused, where <b>the</b> person who <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> coin mentioned {{that she was}} tossing a lot of heads or tails. Second was a coin focus, where <b>the</b> person who <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> coin mentioned that the coin was {{coming up with a}} lot of heads or tails. Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by <b>the</b> person <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> coin. The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping the coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.|$|R

5|$|After {{winning the}} <b>toss,</b> <b>the</b> Australians made all their {{runs on the}} first day, with centuries for Hassett (103), Harvey (126) and Johnson (113*) and 99 for Hamence. The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket, through Hassett and Barnes, who was {{replaced}} by Harvey after retiring ill. The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries, and were keen to see Hamence do the same. The {{rest of the team}} left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone, only to see him stumped for 99, his highest score for the season. On the Monday, the second day, on a pitch that was taking spin, Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total. McCool took 4/21 and 4/23, and Johnston also took eight, including 5/34 in the second innings. He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner, and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticism, tournament organisers ERC agreed to review the penalty {{shoot-out}} system, although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of deciding matches, including replaying the game, having a 'next try wins' rule in extra time, {{reducing the number of}} players on the pitch periodically in extra time to create more space and deciding the game on a coin <b>toss.</b> <b>The</b> format for the penalty shoot-out was changed prior to the following season's tournament, removing the requirement for all players on the field (including forwards) to participate, however for the remainder of its existence, the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot-out as the final system for deciding a winner if required. No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} drive {{of the second}} quarter, the Golden Bears found success that was missing since their first drive of the game. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers {{completed}} a short pass, then scrambled for 24yards and a first down. California ran the ball three times for another first down, then Rodgers connected with Chase Lyman on a 33-yard touchdown <b>toss.</b> <b>The</b> score was California's first since the opening drive {{of the game and}} cut Virginia Tech's lead to 21–14 with 9:10 remaining before halftime. The Hokies recovered the post-touchdown kickoff at their 20-yard line and began a scoring drive of their own. At first, the Hokies moved slowly, spending six plays to move just 14yards, gaining a first down in the process. Then, facing a third down and seven, Randall completed a 25-yard pass to Richard Johnson. This was followed by another long pass—this one a 31-yarder—to Marcus Vick. On the play immediately following, Kevin Jones ran for seven yards and a Virginia Tech touchdown. The Tech score made the game 28–14 with 5:09 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a short break. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin <b>toss.</b> <b>The</b> visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons <b>toss</b> <b>the</b> kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E
