Partly dressing himself; he went along the passage and tapped at Lizzy's door. She did not answer, and, {{thinking of her}} erratic habits {{in the matter of}} sleep, he thumped the door persistently, when he discovered, by its moving ajar under his knocking, that it had only been gently pushed to. As there was now a sufficient entry for the voice, he knocked no longer, but said in firm tones, 'Mrs. Newberry, you are wanted.' ...|$|E
50|$|On 15 December 2009 Pope Benedict XVI {{issued the}} motu proprio Omnium in Mentem, which amended five canons (1008, 1009, 1086, 1117, 1124) of the 1983 Code of Canon Law {{clarifying}} that, {{among those in}} Holy Orders, only bishops and priests received the power and mission <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> the <b>person</b> of Christ the Head while deacons obtained the faculty to exercise the diakonias of service, Word, and charity. The amendments also removed formal defection from the Catholic faith as excusing Catholics from the canonical form of marriage.|$|R
50|$|Schema-archimandrite Abraham (Reidman) in {{his book}} of conversations with the monastics also thinks that {{carelessness}} is delusion and says that carelessness in some sense is opposite to pride, but even more dangerous. A very common manifestation of carelessness is the weakening of abstemiousness in food. With excessive nutrition, the passions begin <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> the <b>person</b> and darken the mind, especially the passion of sexual lust, and especially <b>in</b> the young <b>persons.</b> Also carelessness can manifest itself in laziness to physical labor, when the person is too sparing himself, is lazy to attend long church services, abandons the daily prayer rule. In obedience, a monk can be lazy to fight with himself cutting out his will, not striving to do exactly according to {{the blessing of the}} spiritual father but rather trusting his own intellect and reasoning.|$|R

A history is presented of state actions on comparable worth. The causes for the slow course of policy formation and implementation are seen to lie with the following: being the first to conduct a study, taking too long <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> the changes <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> key positions, the state economy, attitudes towards state workers, lack of focus of responsibility, and denial that sex-based differences in wages are the bases for Comparable worth adjustments.

50|$|Code of Canon Law (1983)7 as {{modified}} by Benedict XVI (2009)8:Can. 1008 By divine institution, {{some of the}} Christian faithful are marked with an indelible character and constituted as sacred ministers by the sacrament of holy orders. They are thus consecrated and deputed so that, each according to his own grade, they may serve the People of God by a new and specific title.Can. 1009 §1. The orders are the episcopate, the presbyterate, and the diaconate.§2. They are conferred by the imposition of hands and the consecratory prayer which the liturgical books prescribe for the individual grades.§3. Those who are constituted {{in the order of}} the episcopate or the presbyterate receive the mission and capacity <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> the <b>person</b> of Christ the Head, whereas deacons are empowered to serve the People of God in the ministries of the liturgy, the word and charity.The change in Canon Law introduced by Ominum in Mentum resolved a discrepancy between the applicability of in persona Christi Capitis (“in the person of Christ the Head”) to deacons as well as priests and bishops. With the new Motu Proprio, in persona Christi Capitis applies only to priests and bishops.|$|R

This would be an increased from the 444 already present. The Secretary-General had called for the redeployment of military observers currently in Nairobi, Kenya to Rwanda and to bring the mechanised infantry battalion up to full strength. He was also asked to report on developments in the situation concerning progress towards a ceasefire, availability of resources, the UNAMIR mandate and review of further action. Member States were requested to provide personnel to UNAMIR, while the parties in Rwanda were urged to co-operate with its mandate, ensuring its safety and freedom of movement and to treat Kigali International Airport as a neutral zone.|$|R

50|$|As regards cleanliness, ventilation, drainage, {{water supply}} and {{sanitary}} condition generally, shops have been since 1878 (the Factory and Workshop Act 1878, s. 101) subject to {{the provisions of the}} Public Health Act 1875, which apply to all buildings, except factories under the Factory <b>Acts,</b> <b>in</b> which any <b>persons,</b> whatever their number be, are employed. Thus, broadly, the same sanitary provisions apply in shops as in workshops, but in the former these are enforced solely by the officers of the local authority, without reservation of any power, as in workshops for the Home Office inspectorate, <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> default of the local authority.|$|R
