5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E
25|$|The {{epidermis}} {{layer is}} secured to the deeper connective tissue by basement membrane. Due to the primarily amorphous fibrous and nonfibrous proteins in the lamina propria, the basement membrane applies strong anchoring filaments like collagen Ⅳ and Ⅶ {{to secure the}} hemidesmosome of basal cell to the lamina propria. These attachments {{are strong enough to}} sustain beating and stretch, to which VFs are subjected. The population density of some of <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> fibers in the basement membrane, such as collagen Ⅶ, is genetically determined, and these genetics may influence the health and pathogenesis of the vocal folds.|$|E
25|$|On 21 June the English convoy {{arrived at}} La Rochelle {{and the battle}} began as Pembroke's ships {{approached}} the harbour. This lay {{at the head of}} an inlet which was partially unnavigable at low water. The first Castilian attacks met strong resistance. The English, despite the inferiority of their numbers, defended themselves well. At dusk, when the tide rose, the two fleets separated. Though they had lost two or four vessels, according to Froissart, the English were not yet defeated. Pembroke then withdrew some way from land, while Boccanegra anchored in front of La Rochelle. The Chronicle Quatre Premiers Valois, unlike López de Ayala and Froissart, implies that only some skirmishes took place on the first day, as Boccanegra would have ordered his galleys to withdraw, reserving them for the main action. According to this chronicle, <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> sites were reversed: the English off the town and the Castilians on the open sea.|$|E
50|$|A rope {{anchor line}} {{should be at}} least seven times longer than the depth of the water in the anchorage. A seven to eight foot chain should also be {{attached}} between the rope and <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> {{in order to reduce the}} angle of the pull on <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> facilitated by <b>the</b> chain sinking and lying on the bottom. This is important because in order for <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> to be effective, the pull must be at a shallow angle rather than vertically. A vertical pull on <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> will result in <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> breaking out of the bottom sediment and is used as a technique to break <b>the</b> <b>anchor's</b> hold allowing <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> to be raised in order to leave the anchorage.|$|R

25|$|The {{downtown}} area is located between Memorial Square, {{formed by the}} intersection of Concord St. and Union Ave., {{to the north and}} its mirror intersection at the junction of Irving St. and Hollis St. on the south end. The area is bisected by Waverly St. (Route 135) and the MBTA Commuter Rail tracks. <b>The</b> <b>anchoring</b> structure of Downtown is the town hall, The Memorial Building. From 2015 to 2016, the whole area underwent a multimillion-dollar reconstruction of the intersection of Union Ave. and Concord St. that removed the traffic circle and replaced it with a signal controlled intersection. Additional lights were installed at the Irving St./Hollis St. intersection, while older signals in the area were upgraded. All sidewalks in the area were to be replaced, lighting upgraded, and new amenities such as seating and bicycle racks were also installed. The project was scheduled to begin in 2012, but has been delayed to 2014–2015. Further delays pushed the project into 2015 due to needed electrical utility upgrades and replacement.|$|E
500|$|Lucy Mangan, {{the culture}} critic from The Guardian newspaper, {{summed up the}} {{character}}: [...] "Pauline Fowler is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable... She was presumably intended to be <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> force for EastEnders, {{but because of the}} writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show." [...] This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35th most annoying person of 2006 in a BBC Three poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list. In a Radio Times poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13% chose Pauline Fowler as the soap character they would most like to see retired. She came third in the poll, behind EastEnders Den Watts (17%) and Coronation Street's Ken Barlow (15%).|$|E

50|$|The {{shaft of}} <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> called <b>the</b> crutch {{ends in a}} fork which embraces the shaft of the pendulum, giving it {{transverse}} impulses. The pendulum rod is hung from a short straight suspension spring attached to a sturdy support directly behind <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> <b>The</b> pivot of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> is aligned with the bending point of the spring. This arrangement results in a more stable pendulum support than simply suspending the pendulum directly from <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Handling {{and storage}} of these anchors {{requires}} special equipment and procedures. Once <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> is hauled {{up to the}} hawsepipe, the ring end is hoisted {{up to the end}} of a timber projecting from the bow known as the cathead. The crown of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> is then hauled up with a heavy tackle until one fluke can be hooked over the rail. This is known as [...] "catting and fishing" [...] <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> Before dropping <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> <b>the</b> fishing process is reversed, and <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> is dropped from the end of the cathead.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of anchoring quality {{depends on the}} accuracy of assessing stress wave velocity in <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> system. Stress wave velocity {{is closely related to}} collaborative vibration and depends on the degree of bonding between anchor body and anchorage medium. Bonding differences can be large at different ages. Based on stress wave reflection methods, non-destructive testing of anchors was performed using sensors arranged at the same cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> body and anchorage medium, which showed stress wave synchronization. In the early stage of filling, stress wave synchronicity was poorer between <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> body and mortar. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> should not be treated as a composite material when determining its wave velocity. Once the mortar hardens, the stress waves become more synchronous and <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> can be regarded as a composite material. Stress wave synchronicity between <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> body and mortar is related to mortar age and anchorage length. <b>The</b> <b>anchor</b> length required to provide stress wave synchronization between <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> body and mortar decreases with increasing mortar age. Stress wave velocity rules were derived for different ages to provide the basis for accurately determining the stress wave velocity in <b>the</b> <b>anchor...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Ground {{for the new}} {{structure}} was broken in January 1975, {{and by the time}} ground clearance began in April the building's cost had risen to $84 million ($ in [...] dollars). The poor and uneven condition of the soil at the site caused delays in the excavation, and major cost increases. When the foundations were finished, it was discovered that many of <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> bolts were misaligned and had to be replaced. This also added extensive new costs to the project.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> {{placement problem}} in localization based on one-way ranging, in which either the sensor or <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> send <b>the</b> ranging signals. <b>The</b> number of <b>anchors</b> de-ployed over a geographical area is generally sparse, and {{we show that}} <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> placement can be formulated as the de-sign of a sparse selection vector. Interestingly, the case in which <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> send <b>the</b> ranging signals, results in a joint ranging energy optimization and anchor placement problem. We make abstraction of the localization algorithm and instead use the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRB) as the performance constraint. <b>The</b> <b>anchor</b> placement problem is formulated as an elegant convex optimization problem which can be solved efficiently in polynomial time. 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>anchor</b> {{escapement}} {{consists of}} two parts: the escape wheel, which is a vertical wheel with pointed teeth on it rather like saw teeth, and <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> shaped vaguely like a ship's anchor, which swings {{back and forth on}} a pivot just above the escape wheel. On the two arms of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> are curved and flat faces which the teeth of the escape wheel push against, called pallets. The central shaft of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> is attached to a fork pushed by the pendulum, so <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> swings back and forth, with the pallets alternately catching and releasing an escape wheel tooth on each side.|$|R

2500|$|One {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of FRP reinforcement is their limited fire resistance. Where fire safety is a consideration, structures employing FRP have to maintain their strength and <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> of the forces at temperatures to be expected in the event of fire. For purposes of fireproofing an adequate thickness of cement concrete cover or protective cladding is necessary. The addition of 1kg/m3 of polypropylene fibers to concrete has been shown to reduce spalling during a simulated fire. (The improvement is thought to be due to the formation of pathways out of the bulk of the concrete, allowing steam pressure to dissipate.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the depth}} of Byfjorden, which reaches [...] below mean sea level, Trumphy had not looked into a {{conventional}} subsea tunnel. However, he had instead considered a submerged floating tunnel, but concluded that it was unrealistic, {{in part because of}} <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> depth, {{in part because of the}} strong current and in part because no such tunnel had ever been built. On 21 March 1969, Engineer Per Tveit held a lecture in Bergen, where he projected that a tunnel to Askøy at Kvarnen would cost NOK28 million. Trumpy estimated the cost of the tunnel, which would be [...] in water and [...] to NOK150 million. In 1970, modified plans were launched for a submerged tunnel which instead of being anchored in the seabed instead was horizontally suspended at each end in bedrock.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{approach}} to tone mapping of HDR images {{is inspired by}} <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> theory of lightness perception. This theory explains many characteristics of the human visual system such as lightness constancy and its failures (as in the checker shadow illusion), which are important {{in the perception of}} images. [...] The key concept of this tone mapping method (Lightness Perception in Tone Reproduction) is a decomposition of an HDR image into areas (frameworks) of consistent illumination and the local calculation of the lightness values. The net lightness of an image is calculated by merging of the frameworks proportionally to their strength. Particularly important is the anchoring—relating of the luminance to a known luminance, namely estimating which luminance value is perceived as white in the scene. This {{approach to}} tone mapping does not affect the local contrast and preserves the natural colors of an HDR image due to the linear handling of luminance.|$|E
40|$|Suction Embedded Plate Anchors (SEPLA) are {{vertically}} loaded anchors {{which are}} installed {{by using a}} suction caisson to the required embedment depth. The cost effectiveness, ease of installation and {{the accuracy of the}} installation makes it an attractive choice for deep to ultra-deep waters. After installation, SEPLAs are tensioned by mooring lines which will cause <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> to move from its initial vertical orientation to its final orientation perpendicular to the loading direction. The keying process results in the loss of embedment which reduces the holding capacity of <b>the</b> plate <b>anchors.</b> A plasticity model was created to predict the keying trajectory, tension capacity and the embedment loss for a plate <b>anchor.</b> <b>The</b> soil is assumed to be normally consolidated undrained clay that obeys associated flow rule. The interaction of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> with <b>the</b> surrounding soil, interaction of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> chain and <b>the</b> interaction of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> chain with <b>the</b> soil is also considered in the model to predict the keying trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> <b>The</b> results obtained from the model are compared to existing centrifuge tests and finite element models. The model was found to have very good agreement with the finite element data and it had reasonable agreement with the centrifuge test results. A parametric study was performed to better understand the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> during <b>the</b> keying process. <b>The</b> effect of <b>anchor</b> geometry, thickness of <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> eccentricity at <b>the</b> padeye, the pullout angle {{on the surface of the}} water, type of anchor line, soil strength and sensitivity on the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> were studied. <b>The</b> effects of these parameters on the embedment loss, keying trajectory and capacity of <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> have been calculated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>anchor</b> which added a elastic-flexible {{deformable}} body on <b>the</b> common <b>anchor</b> will be form a {{new type}} anchor, it is called <b>the</b> elastic-flexible <b>anchor.</b> With <b>the</b> help of FLAC 3 D 3. 0, we compared the numerical simulation analysis results between <b>the</b> common <b>anchor</b> and <b>the</b> elastic-flexible <b>anchor.</b> we obtained that, <b>the</b> elastic-flexible <b>anchor</b> has <b>the</b> higher bearing capacity and more excellent anti-deformation performance, this mainly due to the elastic-flexible deformable body which has the buffering effect of the stress and deformation.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an upper bound plastic limit analysis for predicting drag anchor trajectory and load capacity. The shank and fluke of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> are idealized as simple plates. The failure mechanism involves {{the motion of}} <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> about a center of rotation, the coordinates of which are systematically optimized to determine the minimum load at the shackle. For a given <b>anchor</b> orientation, <b>the</b> direction of the shackle force is varied to establish {{a relationship between the}} magnitude and direction of the shackle load. Coupling this relationship to <b>the</b> Neubecker-Randolph <b>anchor</b> line solution produces a unique solution for the magnitude and orientation of the shackle force. <b>The</b> <b>anchor</b> is then advanced a small increment about the optimum center of rotation and the process is repeated. The upper bound method (UBM) provides a practical means to determine the trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> and <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> load capacity at any point in the trajectory. To better understand of <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> behavior, extensive parameter studies were carried out varying the properties of <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> anchor line, and soil. The UBM show good agreement with six full-scale tests covering several different anchor types and centrifuge model tests...|$|R
2500|$|The PDZ domain is {{a common}} {{structural}} domain of 80-90 amino-acids found in the signaling proteins of bacteria, yeast, plants, viruses and animals. Proteins containing PDZ domains {{play a key role}} in anchoring receptor proteins in the membrane to cytoskeletal components. PDZ is an initialism combining the first letters of the first three proteins discovered to share the domain — post synaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), and zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1). PDZ domains have previously been referred to as DHR (Dlg homologous region) or GLGF (glycine-leucine-glycine-phenylalanine) domains. Proteins with these domains help hold together and organize signaling complexes at cellular membranes. These domains {{play a key role in}} the formation and function of signal transduction complexes. PDZ domains also play a highly significant role in <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> of cell surface receptors (such as Cftr and FZD7) to the actin cytoskeleton [...] via mediators like NHERF and ezrin.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the west}} end, Fort San Felipe (Spanish: Fuerte de San Felipe) had 28 gun {{positions}} with a ditch and a bastion trace in the gorge (rear) of the fort. Its broad structure gave the Spanish gunners a wide arc of fire across the Bay of Gibraltar {{and provided a}} direct line of fire into {{the town and the}} British Devil's Tongue Battery located along the Old Mole. According to James, [...] "the parapet is eighteen feet thick, faced with stone, and filled with earth and clay." [...] It was [...] "mounted with twenty iron sixteen pounders, and four iron six pounders in flanks, with four thirteen inch brass mortars : eighteen of these guns command <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> place and their strand, the other six open on the town, and neck of land". Several casemates were situated under the ramparts. Two demi-bastions and a curtain wall were situated {{at the rear of the}} fort while storehouses and guard-houses stood alongside it. A solid stone sea wall ran along the east side of the fort. A ditch, filled from the sea and controlled via a sluice gate, provided an additional obstacle. According to James, the normal garrison of the fort was one captain, one subaltern and fifty men, though it could accommodate six hundred.|$|E
2500|$|Work on the {{foundations}} was complete by 30 June and the erection {{of the iron}} work was started. Although no more than 250 men were employed on the site, a prodigious amount of exacting preparatory work was entailed: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detail drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed. The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved {{in the design and}} the degree of precision required: the positions of rivet holes were specified to within 0.1mm (0.04in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, were first bolted together, the bolts being replaced by rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit it was sent back to the factory for alteration. The four legs, each at an angle of 54° to the ground, were initially constructed as cantilevers, relying on <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> bolts in the masonry foundation blocks. Eiffel had calculated that this would be satisfactory until they approached halfway to the first level: accordingly work was stopped for the purpose of erecting a wooden supporting scaffold. This gave ammunition to his critics, and lurid headlines including [...] "Eiffel Suicide!" [...] and [...] "Gustave Eiffel has gone mad: he has been confined in an Asylum" [...] appeared in the popular press. At this stage a small [...] "creeper" [...] crane was installed in each leg, designed to move up the tower as construction progressed and making use of the guides for the elevators which were to be fitted in each leg. After this brief pause erection of the metalwork continued, and the critical operation of linking the four legs was successfully completed by March 1888. In order to precisely align the legs so that the connecting girders could be put into place, a provision had been made to enable precise adjustments by placing hydraulic jacks in the footings for each of the girders making up the legs.|$|E
