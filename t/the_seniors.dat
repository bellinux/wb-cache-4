5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the group were {{contacted}} by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} Hamburg. Derry and <b>the</b> <b>Seniors</b> were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm and the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and <b>the</b> <b>Seniors</b> at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than <b>the</b> <b>Seniors</b> or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm and The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E

He initially tried to send Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, but Storm and his group were committed to a Butlins holiday camp and turned Williams' offer down, as did Gerry and the Pacemakers. Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960, after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool, and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings. He booked them into Bruno Koschmider's Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960, but {{said that he was}} not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped to find a better act to follow them.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1989, Liukin was {{ten months}} {{too young to}} compete as a senior in 2004, and thus was not {{eligible}} for {{a place on the}} U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens. Her scores in the junior division at the 2004 U.S. National Championships were competitive with those being posted by <b>the</b> <b>seniors,</b> and Marta Karolyi, the U.S. national team coordinator, has said that if Liukin had been eligible, she would have been named to the Olympic team.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma played {{its last}} home {{game of the}} season against Texas Tech (coached by former Oklahoma {{assistant}} Mike Leach), and bid farewell to the smallest class of seniors in Stoops's tenure as head coach.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senior</b> PGA {{is by far}} {{the oldest}} of <b>the</b> <b>senior</b> majors, having been founded in 1937, decades before the {{establishment}} of the Champions Tour (as <b>the</b> <b>Senior</b> PGA Tour) in 1980. The other events were all founded in <b>the</b> 1980s—the U.S. <b>Senior</b> Open in 1980, <b>the</b> <b>Senior</b> Players Championship in 1983, <b>The</b> <b>Senior</b> Open in 1987, and The Tradition in 1989. This era saw senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era, such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, reached their fifties. <b>The</b> <b>Senior</b> Open, however, was not recognized as a Champions Tour major until 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the {{mainstream}} majors, two of <b>the</b> <b>senior</b> majors have title sponsors, and <b>the</b> <b>Senior</b> PGA Championship and Senior British Open have presenting sponsors whose names appear after the tournament title. Also unlike {{the mainstream}} majors, {{none of which}} falls under the direct jurisdiction of any professional tour, the Champions Tour directly operates two of its majors—The Tradition and <b>the</b> <b>Senior</b> Players Championship. <b>The</b> other three <b>senior</b> majors are operated by the same bodies that organize their mainstream counterparts—the PGA of America for <b>the</b> <b>Senior</b> PGA, <b>The</b> R&A for <b>the</b> <b>Senior</b> British Open, and the USGA for <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Senior</b> Open.|$|R

5|$|Texas A {{graduates}} {{were called}} to use their military training during World War I, and by 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, a larger percentage than any other college or university. In early September 1918, the entire senior class was mustered into military service, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of <b>the</b> <b>seniors</b> were fighting in France {{when the war ended}} two months later.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' booking agent, Allan Williams, {{decided to}} send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed, Derry and <b>the</b> <b>Seniors,</b> proved {{successful}} there. Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best {{a few days before}} their departure. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson (after McCartney or Best had set fire to a condom in their living quarters as a light source to gather their possessions as their host had cut off power to their room).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his success}} with Clarke, Billingham {{still could not}} get support for Little Athletics from VAAA; instead, they {{suggested}} he drop the junior competition {{and focus on the}} rapidly expanding senior one. One of the delegates, Jack Frewin, encouraged him to push through with his idea, so he published a notice in the Geelong Advertiser announcing that he needed to start a formation of Little Athletics clubs. There was a meeting of interested parents, and Billingham told them that he thought an organisation should be set up based on his experience from <b>the</b> <b>seniors</b> competitions but he need some parents to help him. On 27 November 1965, six clubs were formed. They were run by parents with Billingham as an overall manager. By the end of the 1965/66 season, more than 200 boys and girls were competing regularly across nine clubs, and more than 500 had tried out at least once. The first Geelong championships were held in March 1966 over the long weekend.|$|E
5|$|Starr {{considered}} leaving Storm at {{that time}} to join Derry and <b>the</b> <b>Seniors,</b> but accepted a job with Tony Sheridan at the Top Ten Club on 30 December 1961, as Sheridan's offer of more money, a flat and a car was too good to refuse. Starr's stay with Sheridan was short-lived, as he found Sheridan's habit of changing the set list without telling his backing group beforehand frustrating, so he rejoined the Hurricanes. On 5 February 1962, Best fell ill and the Beatles had to play a lunchtime concert at the Cavern and an evening concert at the Kingsway club in Southport. As the Hurricanes had no concert that day Starr played with them live on stage for the first time (although he had recorded with them in Hamburg).|$|E
5|$|The Hokies' loss to Kansas {{lowered its}} bowl winning {{percentage}} since 1993 to 40percent. In the 15bowl games played between the 1993 Independence Bowl and the 2008 Orange Bowl, the Hokies amassed {{a record of}} sixwins and ninelosses. Despite the loss to the Jayhawks {{and the loss of}} several graduating players, Virginia Tech was a popular pick to repeat as ACC champions heading into the off-season. <b>The</b> <b>seniors</b> who graduated following the Orange Bowl game were the winningest team in Virginia Tech history, becoming one of just three teams in Division I to win at least 10 games each of the previous four years. Junior Sean Glennon's second consecutive failure to win a bowl game, however, re-opened the question of whether he or Tyrod Taylor would be the Hokies' starter at quarterback in 2008.|$|E

He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, <b>the</b> <b>seniors</b> citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E
