The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to examine the impact of the existence of the audit committees to the relationship between company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> and conservatism accounting. The audit committee is measured by proxy the number of audit committee members while the company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> was proxy with debt to equity ratio and accounting conservatism measured by the accrual value. Sample in this research are companies listed to stock exchanges of Indonesia which publishes annual report from 2005 to 2009 and who applied conservative accounting as well as having an audit committee. The testing of hypothesis in this research is used moderated regression analysis (MRA). The result of hypothesis test indicated that audit committees affect the positive relationship between company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> and conservatism accounting.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} incentive contracting for registered investment company advisors and the performance {{and the risk of}} the portfolio managed by the advisor. To test these relationships, four measures of return and three measures of risk are employed in a pooled time-series, cross-sectional regression. ^ The results {{of this study indicate that}} managerial incentive fees do not significantly correlate with the overall performance of the managed fund. No significant positive relationship between fees based on the performance of the fund and three of the four measures of portfolio return was found. However, the empirical results did show a positive relationship between the presence of a performance-based fee and a fund 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> adjusted return. ^ The results confirm that incentive contracting does impact portfolio management risk-taking. In particular, management fees that are based on the size of the portfolio correlate positively with the fund 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> nonsystematic <b>risk</b> and negatively with the fund 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> systematic <b>risk.</b> Incentive management fees based on the relative performance of the fund relate positively to a fund 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> systematic <b>risk.</b> These results imply that both signalling and gaming aspects of incentive contracting are present in the investor-advisor relationship. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between a firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> and the effectiveness of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s corporate governance practices. Previous research investigating {{the relationship between}} corporate controls and firm performance has been mixed and often weak. Therefore, this study sets out to determine the efficiency of monitoring and incentive contracts given certain characteristics of the firm. That is, the study sets out to determine whether risk firms with higher monitoring and levels of incentives are associated with higher firm performance. The results of this study of 282 firms demonstrate how the relationship between firm risk and performance is associated with the monitoring and incentive contracts used by these firms. In particular, {{the results of this study}} showed that the negative association between risk and firm performance is weakened when firms have stronger monitoring and incentive mechanisms. The particular contribution of this study is to show that the role of corporate governance variables infirm performance should be evaluated in the context of the firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk.</b> <br /...|$|R

Such “unrealistic optimism” (UO) has been assessed in two ways: directly (via a single question, requiring comparison of own risk to that of the average person) and indirectly (via separate questions about own risk and that of the average person). The study examined the equivalence of the direct and indirect measures of female students 2 ̆ 7 UO for unwanted pregnancy. Participants (N =  120) answered questions about their own risk, that of the average female student, and their own risk relative to that of the average female student; responses and response times were recorded.

Direct-UO was strongly associated with estimate of own risk, but only moderately associated with estimate of the average student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk.</b> Response times for the comparative risk and own risk questions did not differ, but participants took significantly longer to answer the question about average student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk.</b> The results suggest that the two measures of UO are not equivalent, but, rather, that individuals answering a comparative risk question focus mainly on their own risk, at the expense of that of the average person. <br /...|$|R
