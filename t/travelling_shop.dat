In addition to the main task of making poppies, the employees made other goods by hand which were sold at three shops in Edinburgh and by a <b>travelling</b> <b>shop</b> throughout Scotland. The factory moved to its current premises, a former printing works, in 1965. Staffing levels {{and the range of}} good made at the factory gradually declined after the Second World War, and increasing annual deficits were funded by contributions from the Earl Haig Fund Scotland. In 1998, the factory became an independent charitable company, The Lady Haig Poppy Factory Ltd, owned by Earl Haig Fund Scotland Ltd.|$|E
40|$|El Ultimo Grito {{used the}} Griffin Flagship Shop {{to explore and}} produce 5 {{different}} retailing environments and objects that challenged pre-conceived ideas of retail spaces and brand philosophy. The short life of interior design for fashion labels and brand philosophy (rather than image) were paramount issues in this investigation. Exploring the qualities of window displays, focal points of retail shops reflecting changing trends, El Ultimo Grito developed a system for producing an 'ever changing' environment {{as opposed to the}} static and easily-ageing standard shop design. This led to a commission to design Griffin's Flagstore in Tokyo (2003; 6 - 4 - 9, 1 F Minami Aoyama 107 - 0062 Tokyo, Japan), two 'ephemeral' shops in Paris (Surface to Air, 2002) and London (Carnaby Street, 2003), as well as a <b>travelling</b> <b>shop</b> titled ' 10 years of Griffin'. The London Flagship Shop's main feature is a ceiling covered with over 1000 hooks and using extra long necked coat hangers permitting the creation of infinite layouts. Movable walls and temporary installations allow regular renewal of the design, reflecting the 'anti-establishment' philosophy Griffin espouses. (40 square metres). The main feature of the Tokyo Flagship Shop is a 'gallery framework' creating space for hanging clothing without touching the original shop walls, floor or ceiling. A fully printed canvas canopy, featuring work commissioned by Griffin from different artists, changes every 2 / 3 months, reflecting the constant collaboration advocated by the brand...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the dimensions of customer trust in the context of Internet <b>travel</b> <b>shopping.</b> Based on the related literature on relationship marketing in online as well as offline contexts, the study proposed four main factors affecting customer trust towards Internet-based travel Websites. These are perceived quality of travel Web services, institution-based trust, calculative-based trust and trusting beliefs of the online vendor. The study began by testing the developed survey questionnaire on small sample of customers who had a significant level of experience with Internet-based travel Websites. The final survey questionnaire using electronic mail service generated hundred usable responses. Exploratory Factor Analysis using Principal Component Analysis was performed on thirteen trust measures of customer trust in online <b>travel</b> <b>shopping.</b> These variables were grouped into two factors. The factors were denoted as perceived quality in travel Web services and perceived trustworthiness of online travel agencies. Independent sample t-tests run on the trust measurement constructs in online <b>travel</b> <b>shopping</b> indicated no significant difference for males and females. Thereafter, multiple regression analytical technique was used to determine the relative contribution of the two factors in the prediction of customer trust in online <b>travel</b> <b>shopping.</b> In this regard, it was found that perceived trustworthiness of online travel agencies had a higher predictive value in the formation of customer trust. This study is important as few online travel businesses have developed Internet-based travel Websites that is based on establishing a significant level of relationship with the customer. More importantly, there exists a lack of research to guide the online travel agencies in understanding online customer trust. In this regard, this study established that increasing the perceptions of trustworthiness in the travel Websites as well as the Travel service quality will aid online travel businesses in achieving a successful relational exchange...|$|R
