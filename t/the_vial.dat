40|$|Advanced Fuel Research, Inc. (AFR) {{developed}} a new sol-gel material coating for sample vials {{to be used in}} surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy. In the fields of biomedical and forensic science, <b>the</b> coated <b>vials</b> are used to identify physiological chemicals present in blood and urine. <b>The</b> <b>vials</b> are used in the pharmaceutical industry in the area of drug development and discovery. In the drug enforcement field, using <b>the</b> <b>vials</b> helps with detection of trace amounts of drugs on surfaces. <b>The</b> SER <b>vials</b> will also help to identify contaminants in water sources, such as various inorganics and pesticides. <b>The</b> new <b>vials</b> have advantages over other SER materials. Former products required that samples be pre-mixed or dissolved into specific solvents or reagents. <b>The</b> SER <b>vials</b> do not have these limitations, and measurements can be performed using any solvent. Furthermore, the signal appears in less than one second. The sol-gel material will stay active for at least one year and <b>the</b> <b>vials</b> are compatible with any Raman spectrometer. Most importantly, the SER activity can be duplicated from vial-to-vial, allowing for reproducible results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE Quantifying {{residual}} volume contained in vials of antibiotics used in pediatrics. METHOD This is an experiment involving samples from vials of antibiotics {{used in a}} pediatric hospital. Residual volume was identified by calculating the difference in weight measurement before and after <b>the</b> <b>vials</b> were washed. Evaluation of the {{residual volume}} difference in <b>the</b> <b>vials</b> {{was determined by the}} Wilcoxon non-parametric test for a sample and established at a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS 105 samples of antibiotics were selected. The correct use of the antibiotics oxacillin (88. 57 %) and ceftriaxone (94. 28 %) predominated with low residual values. The same did not occur for procaine benzylpenicillin + potassium benzylpenicillin, since a greater residual volume was discarded in 74. 28 % of <b>the</b> <b>vials.</b> CONCLUSION We highlight the need for improvements in managing antibiotics in the institution under study, so that the excess volume of the antibiotics in <b>the</b> <b>vials</b> is used within the acceptable stable time. It is also necessary that the disposal of the residual volume be adequately disposed, since it presents a risk to public health and the environment...|$|R

Liz accuses Eve of deliberately {{giving her the}} punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. T. C. proposes to Liz, but she becomes increasingly paranoid over his romantic feelings for Eve. Liz attempts to force Julian {{to have sex with}} her {{in the middle of an}} earthquake and tsunami, and stabs him in the back when he does not comply. At this point, Liz lies to Julian by saying that he had raped her in the past. T. C. later breaks off his engagement with Liz after reconciling with his ex-wife's past and rebukes all of her efforts to seduce her way back into his life. On the eve of Eve's trial, Liz offers her adoptive sister a deal: she will rescind her accusation and not testify if Eve promises to leave Harmony forever. Eve considers the deal before ultimately refusing it. Near the end of Eve's trial, Julian agrees to give Rebecca anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with <b>the</b> <b>vial</b> of poison.

25|$|Script Pro {{manufactures}} a robot {{designed to}} help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form. The pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system. The system, upon determining {{whether or not the}} drug is in the robot, will send the information to the robot for filling. The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined {{by the size of the}} pill. The robot technician, user, or pharmacist determines the needed size of <b>the</b> <b>vial</b> based on the tablet when the robot is stocked. Once <b>the</b> <b>vial</b> is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins <b>the</b> <b>vial</b> and attaches the patient label. Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient's medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient's name on an LED read out. The pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of <b>the</b> <b>vial</b> to ensure it's the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up.

An investigation is ongoing. A media statement was released by the CDC regarding the Bethesda variola major (smallpox virus) situation seven days after the discovery. It confirmed that variola major had been found & it had been transferred to a BSL-4 laboratory at the CDC in Atlanta. Overnight PCR testing had shown <b>the</b> <b>vials</b> did contain variola major. <b>The</b> <b>vials</b> were {{believed to have been}} from the 1950's.

The protocol for destruction of variola major virus involves a member of the WHO being present at the destruction. Usually the observer watches via close circuit television outside the room where the variola virus will be autoclaved to destroy it. As a result of the Ebola outbreak in parts of Africa at the time, the WHO were overstretched & stated they had no one locally with sufficient security clearance to enter a BSL-4 laboratory.

Asclepius' death {{at the hands of}} Zeus illustrates man's inability to challenge the natural order that separates mortal men from the gods. In honor of Asclepius, snakes were often used in healing rituals. Non-poisonous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. The Bibliotheca claimed that Athena gave Asclepius a vial of blood from the Gorgons. Gorgon blood had magical properties: if taken from {{the left side of the}} Gorgon, it was a fatal poison; from the right side, the blood was capable of bringing the dead back to life. However, Euripides wrote in his tragedy Ion that the Athenian queen Creusa had inherited this vial from her ancestor Erichthonios, who was a snake himself and had received <b>the</b> <b>vial</b> from Athena.
