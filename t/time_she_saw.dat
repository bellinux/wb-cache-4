25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} he was asleep {{at the time of}} the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of the}} murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E

Golaud tells her not to worry: Pelléas can behave oddly and he is still very young. Mélisande complains about the gloominess of the castle, today was the first <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the sky. Golaud says that she is too old to be crying for such reasons and takes her hands to comfort her and notices the wedding ring is missing.

In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know.

Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard.

500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her father and mother, the second <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> all her relatives, and the third <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E

500|$|A nurse by training, Goldman was {{an early}} {{advocate}} for educating women concerning contraception. Like many feminists of her <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control as a positive alternative. Goldman was also an advocate of free love, and a strong critic of marriage. She saw early feminists as confined in their scope and bounded by social forces of Puritanism and capitalism. She wrote: [...] "We {{are in need of}} unhampered growth out of old traditions and habits. The movement for women's emancipation has so far made but the first step in that direction." ...|$|E
500|$|McKenna {{saw more}} than Borah {{becoming}} an antique {{in his own}} <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> damage inflicted by his positions: [...] "time was to demonstrate the utter bankruptcy of the narrow nationalistic policy which the irreconcilables decreed and to which the Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover administrations submitted with such disastrous results." [...] Borah's comment regretting {{that he could not}} have talked to Hitler has been repeatedly cited as evidence of naiveté in those who believe in the power of pure diplomacy. Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer has referred to the statement in at least three of his columns, making an analogy to negotiating with China in 1989, with North Korea in 1994 and with Iran in 2006, and it was cited disparagingly in a 2006 speech by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
500|$|The Duke of York, an avowed Catholic, was {{twenty-five years}} older than his bride, scarred by {{smallpox}} and afflicted with a stutter. He had secretly converted to Catholicism around 1668.

Mary, however, at first disliked him, and burst into tears each <b>time</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him. Nonetheless, she soon warmed to James. From his first marriage to the commoner Anne Hyde, who had died in 1671, James had two daughters: Lady Mary and Lady Anne. They were introduced to Mary by James with the words, [...] "I have brought you a new play-fellow". [...] Unlike Lady Mary, Lady Anne disliked her father's new wife. Mary played games with Anne, to win her affection.|$|E

500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
