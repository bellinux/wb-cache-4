5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen through <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> of domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E

40|$|<b>Prisms</b> {{laterally}} shifting <b>the</b> perceived visual world cause arm {{movements to}} deviate from intended targets. The resulting error—the direct effect—both for pointing and throwing movements, usually corresponds to only around half of <b>the</b> <b>prism’s</b> optical power due to an “immediate correction effect”. We investigated the mechanisms of this immediate correction effect. In three experiments with 73 healthy subjects {{we find that the}} immediate correction effect is associated with a head and/or eye rotation. Since these rotations are subconscious they are not taken into account by the participants. These subconscious rotations compensate for a large portion of <b>the</b> <b>prism’s</b> optical effect and change the subjective straight ahead. These movements seem to be induced only in a rich visual environment and hence do not take place in the dark. They correspond to the difference between the direct effect and the optical power of <b>the</b> <b>prisms</b> and seem to cause the immediate correction effect. Hence, eye-hand adaptation only adapts to <b>the</b> <b>prism’s</b> optical power minus unconscious head rotation and hence is much smaller than the optical power of <b>the</b> <b>prisms...</b>|$|R

5|$|Aronofsky {{followed}} his debut with Requiem for a Dream, a film based on Hubert Selby, Jr.'s {{novel of the}} same name. He was paid $50,000, and worked for three years with nearly the same production team as his previous film. Following the financial breakout of Pi, {{he was capable of}} hiring established actors, including Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, and received a budget of $3,500,000 to produce the film. Production of the film occurred over the period of one year, with the film being released in October 2000. The film went on to gross $7,390,108 worldwide. Aronofsky received acclaim for his stylish direction, and was nominated for another Independent Spirit Award, this time for Best Director. The film itself was nominated for five awards in total, winning two, for Best Actress and Cinematography. Clint Mansell's soundtrack for the film was also well-regarded, and since their first collaboration in 1996, Mansell has composed the music to every Aronofsky film. Ellen Burstyn was nominated for numerous awards, including for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the Independent Spirit Award. Aronofsky was awarded <b>the</b> <b>PRISM</b> Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for the film's depiction of drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and <b>the</b> <b>PRISM</b> program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending {{from the tip of}} the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come from {{the opposite side of the}} mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in Gondwanatherium and possibly Ferugliotherium.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} <b>the</b> two <b>prisms</b> is such, that the {{entrance}} beam and exit beam are coaxial, i.e. <b>the</b> Schmidt-Pechan <b>prism</b> does not deviate the beam if {{centered on the}} optical axis. The [...] "roof" [...] section of <b>the</b> upper <b>prism</b> flips (reverts) <b>the</b> image laterally with two total internal reflections in the horizontal plane from the roof surface: once {{on each side of}} the roof. This latter pair of reflections can be considered as one reflection in the vertical plane. Both inversion and reversion together cause a 180° rotation of the image, but in doing so deviate the path by 45°. <b>The</b> lower <b>prism</b> corrects for this by interfacing the beam at 45° with <b>the</b> upper <b>prism.</b> <b>The</b> lower <b>prism</b> uses one total internal reflection, followed by a second reflection on the bottom surface to direct the beam into <b>the</b> second Schmidt <b>prism.</b> This second reflection in <b>the</b> lower <b>prism</b> happens at less than the critical angle, therefore <b>the</b> Schmidt-Pechan <b>prism</b> requires a reflective coating for this surface to be usable in practice.

5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used <b>the</b> <b>PRISM</b> system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E
