5000|$|Pikepass is the {{electronic}} toll collection system used by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority. Created in 1990 and launched on January 1, 1991, Pikepass provides a faster and cheaper alternative in paying cash tolls. The authority also saves millions with the system. [...] Most customers pay an initial $40 in prepaid tolls, which they can refill at their own convenience or have funds automatically withdrawn <b>to</b> <b>replenish</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> if it falls below $10-15. Pikepass usage results in a 5% savings up front and customers with 20 or more uses of the Pikepass receive a credit of 5% of their toll charges for that month. The Pikepass device has been tested by the manufacturer to accurately record toll usage at speeds up to 123 mi/h km/h.|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Highway <b>Account</b> within <b>the</b> Highway Trust Fund is the primary mechanism for funding federal highway programs. <b>The</b> <b>account</b> [...] administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT) [...] channels about $ 33 billion in highway user excise taxes annually to states for highway projects. Although DOT and others projected that <b>the</b> <b>account</b> could run out of funds in fiscal year 2009, the balance fell more rapidly than expected and a shortfall became imminent in August 2008. In September, Congress passed legislation to provide $ 8 billion <b>to</b> <b>replenish</b> <b>the</b> <b>account,</b> but DOT officials anticipate <b>the</b> <b>account</b> could reach a critical stage again in fiscal year 2009. This report (1) describes the {{events that led to}} the decline in <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance, including how DOT responded, and (2) identifies potential improvements in mechanisms to manage account solvency. This report also includes information on strategies GAO has reported on in the past {{that could be used to}} better align account outlays and revenues.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Highway <b>Account</b> within <b>the</b> Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is the principal means for funding federal highway programs. Administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT), it channels about $ 33 billion in highway user excise taxes annually to states for highway and related spending. Estimated outlays from <b>the</b> Highway <b>Account</b> under <b>the</b> Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act [...] A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) exceeded estimated receipts throughout the authorization period [...] fiscal years 2005 through 2009. Furthermore, actual account receipts were lower than had been estimated and <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance dropped more rapidly than anticipated, approaching zero in August, 2008. Congress subsequently approved legislation in September 2008 to appropriate $ 8 billion from the General Fund of <b>the</b> Treasury <b>to</b> <b>replenish</b> <b>the</b> <b>account.</b> Agency officials anticipate <b>the</b> <b>account</b> will reach a critical stage again {{before the end of}} fiscal year 2009, and estimate that about $ 15 billion will be needed to ensure <b>account</b> solvency through <b>the</b> end of fiscal year 2010.
