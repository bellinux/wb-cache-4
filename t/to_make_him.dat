5|$|In {{the season}} finale, Andrew Kravis {{defeated}} Brandon Saunders {{to win the}} grand prize, for an overall total of $2,326,346. Seacrest then announced that Kravis's winnings would be increased to $2,600,000 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the all-time highest-earning regular-season contestant on a single American game show, surpassing Ken Jennings's $2,522,700 run on Jeopardy! in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{endorsed}} Hitler's {{order that}} deserters should be hanged {{from the nearest}} tree. When a staff officer sought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> aware of the hopelessness of the situation, Kesselring {{told him that he}} had driven through the entire army rear area and not seen a single hanged man.|$|E

5|$|Sunday's personality, demeanor, and athleticism {{made him}} {{popular with the}} fans, {{as well as with}} his teammates. Manager Cap Anson {{considered}} Sunday reliable enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the team's business manager, which included such duties as handling the ticket receipts and paying the team's travel expenses.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of absence, Carmella's mother sends Connor on a secret mission to find her daughter. He discovers that Carmella has become a nun, and is living in a convent as Sister Mary Catherine. During her time as a nun, she grows close to Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor), who {{encourages}} her to become a recording artist after hearing her sing. Carmella does it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> happy, but admits {{that she does not}} really enjoy singing. She withdraws from their relationship as she feels that Ned is prying too much into her private affairs.|$|E
5|$|After the disappointing {{end to the}} season, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that front-office changes were coming. In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous experience as a general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but {{he chose not to}} wait for the Senators <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization.|$|E
60|$|He offered 'er {{the money}} {{four or five}} times, but she wouldn't take it, but at last just as they got near her 'ouse he forced it in her 'and, and put his own 'ands in his pockets when she tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'im</b> take it back.|$|R
60|$|The squire {{was fully}} {{prepared}} for the communication which James had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and, as there were no reasons for waiting, the ceremony took place very shortly afterwards.|$|R
60|$|And yet we knew 'twas in 'im, we knew as 'e could fly; But what we couldn't git at was 'ow <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'im</b> try. We'd almost {{turned the}} job up, {{until at last}} one day We got the last yard out of 'im in a most amazin' way.|$|R
5|$|At a {{birthday}} reception in Windsor Castle, the King states his {{wish to be}} closer to Victoria and insults her mother. But when the King increases Victoria's income, this is rejected by Conroy, who physically subdues her in front of her mother, heightening the animosity between them. The King then sends the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to advise her. Victoria agrees <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> her private secretary, and he appoints ladies-in-waiting for her from political families allied to him.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} sought <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the National Republican {{nominee for}} governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E
5|$|Dutton was {{the subject}} of trade talks between the Maroons and the Chicago Black Hawks {{following}} the 1928–29 NHL season. The teams had been negotiating to send Cyclone Wentworth to Montreal in exchange for Dutton and Babe Siebert before the Black Hawks purchased the contract of Taffy Abel, which ended the Hawks pursuit of Dutton. The Maroons continued <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> available, with the Toronto Maple Leafs showing interest following the 1929–30 season. Finally, he was sold to the New York Americans along with Mike Neville, Hap Emms and Frank Carson for $35,000.|$|E

60|$|As {{the unhappy}} parents withdrew, Lord Glenallan, {{to prevent the}} old woman from {{relapsing}} into her lethargy, again pressed her {{on the subject of}} the communication which she proposed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord, I am glad--my lord, I am sorry,"--answered the {{trembling}} scrivener, who, {{aware of the}} vivacity of Lord Dalgarno's temper, dreaded the consequence of the communication he had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5|$|Early in the morning, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Penny {{wake up to}} find Sheldon {{playing a}} bongo drum, as Richard Feynman played bongos. They try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> stop but he leaves the apartment, {{eventually}} falling asleep on Amy's couch.

5|$|Hawks {{signed a}} new one-year {{contract}} with Famous-Players {{in the fall}} of 1924. He broke his contract to become a story editor for Thalberg at MGM, having secured a promise from Thalberg <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a director within a year. In 1925, when Thalberg hesitated to keep his promise, Hawks broke his contract at MGM and left.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} {{to make it look like}} tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E

5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> relatable, the character was dressed {{in jeans and a}} T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, the Lakers {{decided that}} they would not make Morris the $1.2 million {{qualifying}} offer prior to the July 1 deadline that would have been necessary <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a restricted free agent. Although the team expressed interest in re-signing Morris at a lower priced contract and having him represent the team again in the summer league, he would become an unrestricted free agent at the deadline because the qualifying offer was not made.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the show}} was set aside {{for a series of}} funny, colorful, puppet {{characters}} living on the titular street. These included Grover, Bert and Ernie, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Oscar the Grouch, and Big Bird. Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter. It was around this time that a frill was added around Kermit's neck <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> more frog-like. The collar was functional as well: it covered the joint where the Muppet's neck and body met.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{introduces}} Mulder to Kritschgau, {{who claims}} that everything Mulder {{thinks he knows}} about aliens is a lie. He tells him that his sister's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body he has just examined was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for {{the activities of the}} military–industrial complex. Mulder dismisses these claims until Scully tells him Kritschgau told her that she was given cancer <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> believe.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Prince and Princess {{shared the}} outlook of the Progressive Party, and Bismarck was {{haunted by the}} fear that should the old Emperor dieand he was now in his seventiesthey would call {{on one of the}} Progressive leaders to become Chancellor.

5|$|The Samian War {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{significant}} military events before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides' ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the de facto ruler of the state. In 440 BC Samos went to war against Miletus over control of Priene, an ancient city of Ionia on the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians.|$|E
