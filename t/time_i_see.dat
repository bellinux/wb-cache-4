[...] Like [...] in the song [...] "T.B.

[...] The song ends abruptly with the words, [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> you, I just don't know what to do."

500|$|Rodgers {{considered}} Carousel {{his favorite}} {{of all his}} musicals and wrote, [...] "it affects me deeply every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it performed". [...] In 1999, Time magazine, in its [...] "Best of the Century" [...] list, named Carousel the Best Musical of the 20th century, writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein [...] "set the standards for the 20th century musical, and this show features their most beautiful score and the most skillful and affecting example of their musical storytelling". [...] Hammerstein's grandson, Oscar Andrew Hammerstein, in his book about his family, suggested that the wartime situation made Carousels ending especially poignant to its original viewers, [...] "Every American grieved {{the loss of a}} brother, son, father, or friend... the audience empathized with [...] all-too-human efforts to offer advice, to seek forgiveness, to complete an unfinished life, and to bid a proper good-bye from beyond the grave."

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Something There" [...] has {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} film and music critics. Writing for Den of Geek, Simon Brew felt that [...] "Something There" [...] is [...] "where {{the genius of}} music as storytelling kicks in." [...] In Brew's opinion, the [...] "utterly convincing and un-mawkish" [...] song works [...] "because the two characters aren't on screen singing directly at each other." [...] Brew concluded, [...] "Everyone who makes an animated film that has a love story at the heart should watch this." [...] Filmtracks.com described [...] "Something There" [...] as an [...] "affable" [...] song. Particularly praising Ashman's songwriting, Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "Ashman's songs advance the plot by exploring the characters' emotions and making story points more concisely than conventional exposition." [...] Solomon concluded, [...] "By {{the end of the}} deceptively simple-sounding 'Something There,' the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem." [...] O'Hara continues to cite [...] "Something There" [...] as her favorite of the film's songs, elaborating, [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> the Beast with that grin on his face and the bird in his hand, my heart just melts." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E
