However, only a few studies integrate both spatial and to the latter, global warming and the potential release temporal dimensions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a method for field-scale simulations of the spatio-temporal evolution of topsoil organic C (OC) at the landscape scale over a few decades and under different management strategies. A virtual landscape with characteris-tics matching part of Brittany (France) was considered for the study. Stochastic simulations and regression analysis were used to simulate spatial fields with known spatial structures: short-range, medium-or sequestration of C into or from the atmosphere must be considered. Intermediate spatial scales such as varia-tions along slopes are also important as they contribute to soil diversity, which impacts biodiversity (Ibáñez et al., 1995).

40|$|International audienceAssessing the {{environmental}} impacts of agricultural production systems requires spatially explicit information regarding cropping systems. Projecting changes in agricultural land use that are caused by changes in land management practices for analyzing the performance of land activity-related policies, such as agricultural policies, also requires this type of data for model inputs. Crop sequences, which are vital and widely adopted agricultural practices, are difficult to directly detect at a regional scale. This study presents innovative stochastic data mining that was aimed at describing the spatial distribution of crop sequences at a large regional scale. The data mining is performed by hidden Markov models and an unsupervised clustering analysis that processes sequentially observed (from 1992 to 2003) land-cover survey data on the French mainland named Teruti. The 2549 3 -year crop sequences were first identified as major crop sequences across the entire territory, which included 406 (merged) agricultural districts, using hidden Markov models. The 406 (merged) agricultural districts were then grouped into 21 clusters according to the similarity of the probabilities of occurrences of major 3 -year crop sequences using hierarchical clustering analysis. Four cropping systems were further identified: vineyard-based cropping systems, maize monoculture and maize/wheat-based cropping systems, <b>temporary</b> <b>pasture</b> and maize-based cropping systems and wheat and barley-based cropping systems. The modeling approach that is presented in this study provides a tool to extract large-scale cropping patterns from increasingly available time series data on land-cover and land-use. With this tool, users can (a) identify the homogeneous zones in terms of fixed-length crop sequences across a large territory, (b) understand the characteristics of cropping systems within a region in terms of typical crop sequences, and (c) identify the major crop sequences of a region according to the probabilities of occurrences. L'évaluation des impacts des systèmes de production agricole requiert une information spatiale explicite sur les système de culture.

Introduced tropical grasses and legumes, used in perma-nent or <b>temporary</b> <b>pastures,</b> are the primary feed base for dairy and beef-finishing operations. Sown legumes are also used to increase the productivity of extensive native grass-lands, particularly for beef breeding and sheep production. By the mid- 1990 s, the net present value of sown pastures to the beef industry alone was estimated at AU$ 712 M with an annual gross benefit of AU$ 80 M (Walker et al. 1997). There is continued impetus to develop new pasture plants. Key reasons in the last 10 years include: increasing productivity (biomass and feed quality) of pastures to maintain business profitability (Brachiaria and Arachis spp. for beef finishing and dairy); imparting tolerance to diseases (Stylosanthes guianensis and Macroptilium atropurpureum) and insect pests (Leucaena leucocephala); developing new agricultural systems (Clitoria ternatea and Macroptilium bracteatum in crop/graze systems); and developing summer-active grasses in temperate areas and filling production niches where few plants exist (Desmanthus virgatus and Stylosanthes seabrana for beef production on vertisols).

40|$|International audienceThe SWAT {{model was}} used to model the impacts of climate, soils and {{agricultural}} practices on nitrate flows in a 1310 km 2 catchment in western France. Spatialized data were used for natural features (climate, soil, topography), while agricultural activities, finely represented by crop sequences over 3 years, and their associated cultural practices were mapped by remote sensing. The model was calibrated and validated for discharge and nitrate flows at a gauging station. Results are analyzed with respect to leaching for each crop sequence and for each soil type, as nitrate leaching is highly sensitive to the soil and the crop sequence. The lowest risks were found in clayey soils and the highest in sandy soils and/or in sequences including maize. In collaboration with local stakeholders, five scenarios of alternative practices were simulated to evaluate their consequences for nitrogen flows: reduced fertilization, catch crops, shallow cultivation, no-till with catch crops and filter strips. The impacts of the conversion of a pasture into wheat and rapeseed were also assessed. At the catchment gauging station, our 9 -year simulations showed a reduction in nitrate flow of 8 % with filters strips, 11 % with catch crops, 12 % with no-till with catch crops, and 15 % with reduced fertilization. Shallow cultivation had no impact on nitrate flow. Inversely, the conversion of <b>temporary</b> <b>pastures,</b> which accounts for 32 % of the catchment area, to cereals and rapeseed increased nitrate flow by 18 %. The impacts of each scenario varied in accordance with leaching at the parcel scale and with the proportion of area affected by the practice.

We studied traditional measures taken by pastoralists during the period and their effects. The study was conducted in Bayantsagaan soum of Tuv aimag, on a typical steppe region in Mongolia. "Otor", which is a <b>temporary</b> evacuation from <b>pastures</b> covered by heavy snow, was the most effective method for reducing horse loss, since horses can be moved quickly to less snowy areas. However, otor requires the following conditions which is; Domestically, to have at least one young man in order to herd the horses, a positive attitude and the financial capacity for otor. There needs to be a small group of local young people in order to form an otor team and to have transportation means, to be able to obtain the area information to head for otor, and to improve the system for pastoralists to consign their horses for the otor team. For reducing loss of cows, sheep and goats, on the other hand, the following measures are needed; Evacuating only the physically strong livestock by households with enough labor, changing grazing methods, owning a good shelter to protect livestock from snowstorms, and purchasing small amounts of fodder by some pastoralists. Pastoralists who consistently take the measures mentioned above especially succeeded on reducing loss. However, fodder reservation and individual purchasing were difficult for them with their moving based nomadic life, and high price of fodder. From these findings, we suggested that the government's role in coordinating pasture use, shelter improvement and fodder provision is necessary for pastoralists to reduce dzud damage during the dzud period...|$|R
