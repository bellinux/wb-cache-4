5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country may be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about <b>the</b> <b>jobless</b> nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment, {{especially}} among the young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems. In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>jobless</b> figure was at 4%, with women over represented at 85% of the total. In 2007 Bahrain became the first Arab country to institute unemployment benefits {{as part of a}} series of labour reforms instigated under Minister of Labour, Dr. Majeed Al Alawi.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{recession}} which began in 1893, and which continued through 1896, ruined many Americans. Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25%. The task of relieving <b>the</b> <b>jobless</b> fell to churches and other charities, {{as well as to}} labor unions. Farmers went bankrupt; their farms were sold to pay their debts. Some of the impoverished died of disease or starvation; others killed themselves.|$|E

5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} <b>the</b> <b>jobless</b> to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, and, in the case of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. <b>The</b> <b>jobless</b> Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's {{more than}} 15 years as premier brought {{fundamental}} changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government {{spent more than}} $100million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting <b>the</b> <b>jobless</b> to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government {{could not afford to}} participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to politics after the 1929 {{stock market crash}} {{and the beginning of}} the Great Depression. He decided to run for the presidency. He formed the Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He tented the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book The Book, which dealt with the harmful effects of usury by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates could agree on. They nominated Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for vice president. The Liberty Party ended up merging with <b>the</b> <b>Jobless</b> Party, and Harvey ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, and Harvey only drew 800 votes.|$|E

The gradual return of the financial health during the 1920s brought the MTC project back and attracted support from the Premier of Quebec.

500|$|Tudor {{attempts}} {{to tackle the}} problem originate {{during the reign of}} Henry VII. In 1495, Parliament passed the Vagabonds and Beggars Act ordering that [...] "vagabonds, idle and suspected persons shall be set in the stocks for three days and three nights and have none other sustenance but bread and water and then shall be put out of Town. Every beggar suitable to work shall resort to the Hundred where he last dwelled, is best known, or was born and there remain upon the pain aforesaid." [...] Although this returned the burden of caring for <b>the</b> <b>jobless</b> to the communities producing more children than they could employ, it offered no immediate remedy to the problem of poverty; it was merely swept from sight, or moved from town to town. Moreover, no distinction was made between vagrants and the jobless; both were simply categorised as [...] "sturdy beggars", to be punished and moved on.|$|E
500|$|Construction of Brockway Mountain Drive {{began in}} early 1933 by the Keweenaw County Road Commission with federal highway funding {{designed}} to provide meaningful work to the many copper miners who became unemployed during the Great Depression. Rather than provide welfare, the government provided work for <b>the</b> <b>jobless.</b> The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was the agency {{on the federal level}} responsible for the project. Up to 300laborers were employed for a wage of 25¢/hr (equivalent to $/hr in [...] ). The work required to build the road was carried out by manual labor, with the assistance of a team of horses, in a project designed to maximize the numbers of men employed. The grading and leveling of the road surface was done by hand; no survey instruments were used to level the roadway. The road was opened for public use that October 14, at a preliminary cost of $30,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ). That same year, the Skytop Inn opened on top of the mountain. During 1934, additional work was done to the roadway to build the stone walls. Motorists were restricted to one-way traffic, and the road was only open to the public on Sundays and holidays. In the interim, the road was temporarily used as a connection between completed segments of the parallel state highway, numbered M-129 at the time. This highway, now part of M-26, was built starting in July 1933 but was not completed through the area until October 1934. The KCRC declared the road initially finished on June 14, 1935, at a cost of $40,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) ...|$|E

40|$|Examining {{self-reported}} reservation wages {{from the}} 1979 - 80 {{waves of the}} National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), Holzer concludes that 26 to 42 percent of the race difference in <b>the</b> length of <b>jobless</b> spells {{is due to the}} higher wages sought by young Black men.

2500|$|Elizabeth Tatar divided Hawaiian {{music history}} into seven periods, {{beginning}} with the initial arrival of Europeans and their musical cultures, spanning approximately from 1820 to 1872. The subsequent period lasted {{to the beginning of}} the 20th century, and was marked by the creation of an acculturated yet characteristically Hawaiian modern style, while European instruments spread across the islands. Tatar's third period, from 1900 to about 1915, saw the integration of Hawaiian music into the broader field of American popular music, with the invention of hapa haole songs, which use the English language and only superficial elements of Hawaiian music; the beginning of the Hawaiian recording industry was in 1906, when the Victor Talking Machine Company made the first 53 recordings in the state. [...] By 1912, recorded Hawaiian music had found an audience on the American mainland. Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes in 1899. The devastation caused a worldwide shortage in sugar and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii. Hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit <b>the</b> <b>jobless,</b> but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico. They took with them their music and in the early 1900s introduced what is known as Cachi Cachi music, on the islands of Hawaii.|$|E

2500|$|Papen was authoritarian by inclination. Richard J. Evans {{described}} his philosophy as [...] "utopian conservatism" [...] {{due to his}} long-term goal of restoring a modern version of the Ancien Régime. He imposed increasingly stringent censorship on the press and repealed his predecessor's ban on the Sturmabteilung (SA) {{as a way to}} appease the Nazis, whom he hoped to lure into supporting his government. [...] Papen's economic policies, which were all passed by Article 48, were to sharply cut the payments offered by the unemployment insurance fund, subject all jobless Germans seeking unemployment insurance to a very strict means test, had wages drastically lowered (including those reached by collective bargaining) while bringing in very generous tax cuts to corporations and the rich. Papen argued that lowering taxes on the well off and corporations would encourage them to spend and create jobs; that lowering wages would encourage businesses to hire and reducing unemployment insurance would force <b>the</b> <b>jobless</b> (whom Papen often implied were just lazy people who didn't want to work) to find work; and thus alleviate the effects of the Great Depression. As 1932 was the worst year of the Great Depression with joblessness at an all-time high, Papen's economic policies of favoring the rich while punishing the poor enraged ordinary Germans, making him into Germany's most hated man. Papen reveled in his unpopularity and took a great deal of pleasure in taunting and baiting his critics as he enjoyed provoking people. Papen's thesis that lowering wages would make employers more likely to hire and less likely to fire employees was not a popular one as he was widely viewed as engaging in [...] "one-sided catering" [...] to big business.|$|E
