5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment.|$|E

To prevent domination by bigger powers, the Qing Court gave {{the rights to the}} Lugouqiao-Hankou Railway to Belgians. The Japanese initially received numerous concessions along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, and <b>built</b> <b>the</b> Chao Chow and Swatow Railway (1904-06).

5|$|Urban design {{management}} involves mediation among {{a range of}} self-interested stakeholders engaged {{in the production of}} <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment.

5|$|As the Biddulphs were {{interested}} in the Arts and Crafts movement, using the manor house to give classes for villagers in crafts such as woodwork and embroidery. There were also plays and musical events for the villagers, including puppet shows for the children. Construction was paused during World War I and Barnsley died in 1926. The final part of the build was completed between 1926 and 1929 under the supervision of his brother, Sidney and his son-in-law, Norman Jewson. <b>The</b> <b>built</b> took a total of 23 years, largely due to the traditional methods being used, but also as no contractor was hired to manage the build.|$|E

5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately {{may lead to a}} tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|Japan has a {{comprehensive}} network of legislation for protecting, preserving, and classifying its cultural patrimony. The regard for physical and intangible properties and their protection {{is typical of}} Japanese preservation and restoration practices. Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations, transfer, and export, as well as financial support {{in the form of}} grants and tax reduction. The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration, administration, and public display of the properties. These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment of designated structures and the necessary techniques for restoration of works.|$|E

5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment {{to create and}} preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E
5|$|Regular ferry {{service on}} the Dalco Passage between Point Defiance in Tacoma and Tahlequah on Vashon Island started with the MV Skansonia in June 1951 during the {{creation}} of the WSF, and served the route until the completion of the MV Hiyu in 1967. The Hiyu operated for 26 years until it was replaced by the refurbished MV Rhododendron in 1993. The Hiyu briefly returned to the route twice, in June 2008 and in September and October 2008, while the Rhododendron was loaned out to Pierce County for the SteilacoomAnderson Island ferry. <b>The</b> , <b>built</b> in 2010, began serving the route in January 2012.|$|E

5|$|Salford's built {{environment}} {{is made up}} of a range of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment is poor.|$|E

The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century local authority housing buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E
5|$|The new tracks {{built by}} the London, Midland and Scottish Railway allowed {{additional}} intermediate stations to be constructed on the local lines between 1932 and 1935. Increased local demand {{was caused by the}} expansion of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> up area of suburban London during the interwar period. The station at Upminster Bridge opened with platforms on the local electric lines on 17 December 1934. The station was operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway but was only served by District line trains. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways and in 1969 ownership transferred to the London Underground.|$|E
5|$|The work on Integrative Negotiation Consensus Building and the Mutual Gains Approach {{provide a}} helpful {{theoretical}} framework {{for developing the}} theory of urban design management. Negotiation theory provides a useful framework for merging the perspectives of urban planning, city design, and real estate project proposals regarding production of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> environment. Interests, a key construct in negotiation theory, is an important variable that will allow integrated development, as defined above, to occur. The path-breaking work of Roger Fisher and William Ury (1981), Getting to yes, advises negotiators to focus on interests and mutual gains instead of bargaining over positions.|$|E
