5|$|Artificial selection, <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> {{selective}} breeding of domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best vague look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|By 1675 George's eldest {{uncle had}} died without issue, but his {{remaining}} two uncles had married, putting George's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles' estates might pass {{to their own}} sons, should they have had any, instead of to George. George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> purpose of testing and training his son in battle.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{wildlife}} monitoring organization, WildTrack, started using JMP with the Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) system to identify individual endangered animals by their footprints. In 2009, the Chicago Botanic Garden used JMP to analyze DNA data from tropical breadfruit. Researchers {{determined that the}} seedless, starchy fruit was created by <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> hybridization of two fruits, the breadnut and the dugdug. The Herzenberg Laboratory at Stanford has integrated JMP with the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). The FACS system is used to study HIV, cancer, stem-cells and oceanography.|$|E

In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.|$|E
5|$|A two-day long {{bombardment}} of Flushing forced its capitulation on 15 August. Ratified the following day, {{it left the}} British in control of Walcheren which they garrisoned with 10,000 troops. Schouwen and Duiveland on the Eastern branch of the Scheldt, were occupied peacefully on 17 August. The French fleet had already withdrawn to Antwerp however, having been informed on 29 July when the British were still at sea. Between the British and their objective were now more than 35,000 French soldiers, garrisoned in heavily armed forts at Lillo, Liefkenshoech, and Antwerp. <b>The</b> <b>deliberate</b> destruction of dykes by the French had led to widespread flooding, and with disease spreading through the British army, {{it was decided to}} abandon the expedition in early September.|$|E

When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E

The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> misses stopped.|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations has resulted in <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> introduction of beetles {{in order to control}} weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. <b>The</b> <b>deliberate</b> use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged 3D models, and <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games. Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E
5|$|In January 1917, {{a second}} mounted division– the Imperial Mounted Division– was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades. A British regular army officer fresh from {{experience}} in the Senussi Campaign, Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was appointed to command, with an all-British staff. <b>The</b> <b>deliberate</b> mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel's approval but was contrary to {{the policy of the}} Australian Government, which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir Robert Anderson to Cairo to discuss the matter frankly with Chauvel and his superiors. As a result, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division.|$|E

5|$|The 1984 Rajneeshee {{bioterror}} {{attack was}} the food poisoning of 751individuals in The Dalles, Oregon, through <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> contamination of salad bars at ten local restaurants with Salmonella.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deliberate</b> {{planting}} of fake documents {{to be found}} by the enemy was not new; known as the Haversack Ruse, it had been practised by the British {{and others in the}} First and Second World Wars. In August 1942, before the Battle of Alam el Halfa, a corpse was placed in a blown-up scout car, in a minefield facing the German 90th Light Division. On the corpse was a map purportedly showing the locations of British minefields; the Germans used the map and their tanks were routed to areas of soft sand where they bogged down.|$|E
5|$|At Parc Cwm long cairn {{a variety}} of {{mortuary}} practices was evident and <b>the</b> <b>deliberate</b> ordering of skeletal parts noticeable. Whittle and Wysocki (1998) note cremated human remains were placed only in the front, right (southeast) chamber, where females and males, and all age ranges were represented. The southeast chamber was also unusual in that it contained nearly {{three times as many}} individuals as in each of the other chambers, which contained the remains of all representative groups except younger children and infants. At the forecourt entrance Atkinson recorded finds, deposited in groups, including: flint debitage, lithic cores and a bladelet (burnt and unburnt); a leaf-shaped arrowhead (burnt); pieces of quartz; pieces of stalactite (now missing); sherds of Neolithic pottery; and cremated bone fragments. Atkinson speculated that the stalactite originated from Cat Hole cave, which (along with Tooth Hole cave) Whittle and Wysocki note as a possible source of the quartz too.|$|E
