5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later that night, Victoria {{returns to}} Roni's with a {{contract}} to have Roni sign over the place. Unfortunately, Roni changes her mind and tells Victoria {{that she is not}} selling out. Having been inspired by Jacinda's decision, she tells Victoria that she won't be ordered around by her, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b> At the same time, Rogers examines a picture of Emma Swan in Lucy's book, and learns that his new partner is Detective Weaver. Henry begins work on a new story, and Jacinda returns to her job at Cluck's Chicken. On her way home, Jacinda finds a quarter and uses it to make a wish at the well, causing a hyacinth flower to sprout out of the ground.|$|E
500|$|Rare {{unveiled}} {{their work}} on Xbox Live avatars, [...] (the next instalment in the Viva Piñata [...] series), and [...] in 2008. Made by the core team that developed the first Banjo-Kazooie, [...] Nuts & Bolts received significant criticism from players due to its focus on vehicle construction rather than traditional platforming. Despite generally positive reviews, the company's titles for Microsoft sold poorly and Microsoft decided to restructure the studio {{at the end of}} the decade. In March 2010 Rare opened a new facility at Fazeley Studios in Digbeth, Birmingham. Later that year Microsoft confirmed that Scott Henson, a developer who had worked on the hardware and software designs of the Xbox 360 console and Kinect for Xbox 360, replaced Mark Betteridge as studio manager and announced a focus on Xbox Live avatars. Rare also shifted their focus to Kinect. According to Henson, [...] "Kinect will be the main focus for Rare going forwards as it's a very rich canvas. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of an experience that will touch millions of people". Rare's first Kinect project, Kinect Sports, was released in November 2010. Originally titled Sports Star, a more-complex sports simulation games, the game was streamlined into what Microsoft executive Don Mattrick hoped would be the Kinect equivalent of Wii Sports. According to a former Rare employee, the team was worried about the game during its development because of Kinect's limitations. Despite average reviews it was a commercial success, selling three million units by May 2011. Many non-Kinect teams at Rare and BigPark, another Microsoft studio, collaborated on the development of sequel [...] Combining with the sales of the first Kinect Sports, the game sold more than 8 million copies.|$|E

2500|$|UNCG is in {{the midst}} of {{expanding}} beyond its traditional borders onto West Lee Street, a major city thoroughfare (which became Gate City Boulevard), with the construction of an 800-bed residence hall for students, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the $200 million project on Lee Street. [...] The new construction will be a mixed-use development, with space for retail and restaurants, along with student residence halls and a new student recreation center. The university's expansion into the West Lee Street Corridor was triggered by UNCG's strategic housing plan, which calls for the university to increase the percentage of undergraduates living in university housing from 30 percent to more than 40 percent over the next decade.|$|E
2500|$|On May 5, 2011, the Detroit International Bridge Company {{announced}} it engaged the Ann Arbor firm of Quinn Evans {{on behalf of}} the Moroun family that owns the building to oversee restoration of the roof and windows of the structure. Bridge Company owner Moroun stated, [...] "We hope <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of a renaissance for the depot." [...] As of December 2015, all of the once broken windows have been replaced. [...] The once flooded basement has largely been drained, with about 4 inches of water at its highest still remaining in a sub-basement of the building. [...] Structural Analysis of the building, as well as proposals for reuse of the building were going on as of early July 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had {{achieved}} closer relations during Reagan's second term, but Bush was initially skeptical of Soviet intentions. In 1989, {{just after the}} fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush met with Gorbachev in a conference on the Mediterranean island of Malta. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction; Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be [...] "premature" [...] due to concerns where, according to Condoleezza Rice, [...] "expectations [...] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [...] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." [...] But European leaders, including François Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev, something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989. Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, [...] "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation.... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning.</b> We are just at the very beginning of our road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crenshaw was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Louis Johnson of The Badger Herald gave the mixtape a very positive review: [...] "He's a diamond in the rough. For fans of West Coast hip hop, his music is infectious. Nipsey is proof that an independent artist can become {{a major force in}} today's world of Clear Channel sameness and major label monopolies. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning,</b> though. In a Tuesday tweet Nipsey said, '...I made a hunnit k today off my album throw away's.' If this is true, it's scary to think of how good his album will be." [...] Bruce Smith of HipHopDX deemed the project a [...] "free album" [...] (their highest praise for mixtapes). He said, [...] "The Bullets Ain't Got No Name series was music straight off Slauson Avenue; it was Hip Hop from a South Central state of mind. With his Marathon series, Nipsey offered himself as a Slauson boy, matured, and free of label politics. Crenshaw is where the two sets of projects meet up. While he may have never strayed far from the streets of Los Angeles, Crenshaw is like a homecoming for the artist that dropped the last two Marathon mixtapes, bringing the growth and maturity shown on the Marathon series back to a project that bares a close resemblance to the Bullets Ain’t Got No Name tapes. While not without its flaws, at its high points (of which there are many) Crenshaw is on par, or above what a lot of artists have put on shelves as of late." ...|$|E
