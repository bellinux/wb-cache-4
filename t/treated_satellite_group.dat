40|$|Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) {{has been}} known as {{traditional}} medicinal plants. It needed to evaluate the safety of roselle extract on long-term oral administration. The research aimed to determine the savety of ethanolic extract of roselle calyx. Subchronic toxicity study of ethanolic extract of roselle calyx had been carried out on 60 Sprague Dawleys (SD) rats for 28 days. The roselle extract was administered orally every day, with doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kgBW. There are 2 <b>satellite</b> <b>groups,</b> kept for another 14 days after the treatment in order to detect a delayed occurrence of toxic effect. <b>Satellite</b> <b>group</b> was given extract 200 mg/kgBW for 28 days and followed aquadest treatment for 14 days. At the end of experiment the blood was collected for meansuring SGPT, SGOT and ALP activity. The result showed that treatment of roselle calyx extract had no significant changes in SGPT SGOT, ALP activity. The delayed effect was not also observed. The ethanolic extract of roselle calyx didn’t show toxic effects on the liver on subchronic administration. Key words: Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa, L.), SGPT, SGOT, AL...|$|R
5000|$|To {{avoid this}} {{probable}} crisis, an Operational Training Unit (OTU) system was adopted {{as it had}} been by the RAF. Under the American OTU concept, certain experienced groups were authorized as overstrength [...] "parent" [...] groups.

Cadres detached to the newly activated <b>satellite</b> <b>group</b> were first provided with special instruction on their training responsibilities, initially by the responsible air forces, but after 9 October 1942, by the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) to standardize curriculum and instruction. New graduates of training schools fleshed out the <b>satellite</b> <b>group</b> and also restored the parent group to its overstrength size. The parent group was responsible for the organization and training of its satellite, normally a process six months in length that began the day of detachment of the cadre, {{the first half of the}} process bringing the new unit up to strength, the second half devoted to flying training, with the final six weeks concentrating on fighting as a unit.|$|R
