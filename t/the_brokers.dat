5|$|In 2014 an Australian {{non-profit}} organisation called Australia for Dolphins (featured {{in the documentary}} The Killing Cove) launched a world-first lawsuit against <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> of the drive hunts, the Taiji Whale Museum. The lawsuit, known as the Action for Angel case, alleges that the museum illegally refused entry to dolphin welfare observers, and aims to open the museum up to public scrutiny. The lawsuit, which is ongoing, {{is expected to reach}} an outcome in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{the play}} was a {{tremendous}} financial success; the previews broke attendance records. In Boston, the show sold out even after the addition of extra matinées. The first week on Broadway took in nearly $ 20,000, close to the maximum the Shubert Theatre could generate at normal prices. However, ticket sales fell off rapidly following the strongly negative reviews. Woods pre-sold four weeks of tickets to local ticket brokers, which helped the box office totals, but <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> were left with unsold seats even after offering deep discounts. After leaving New York, the show returned to strong sales on the road.|$|E
5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. <b>The</b> <b>brokers</b> in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E
30|$|Based on its {{business}} model, we can derive {{the objectives of}} <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> pool’s processes. First, <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> pool must consider insurance brokers as direct customers and the brokers’ customers as indirect customers. <b>The</b> <b>broker</b> pool’s processes must fit not only the brokers’ demands, but also those of the brokers’ customers. As a result, customer orientation and satisfaction are primary process objectives. Second, <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> pool’s success heavily depends {{on the cost of}} its processes, making cost efficiency another important objective. Third, <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> pool’s processes must be flexible to cope with different broker behaviors, making flexibility another objective. <b>The</b> <b>broker</b> pool thus faces the BPS trade-off.|$|R
30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> {{receives}} <b>the</b> request, {{from the}} client identifier, <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> obtains <b>the</b> keys the client used to cipher and symmetrically sign the message. For this purpose, <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> uses <b>the</b> same master keys {{that were used}} during the client registration. If the message is correctly deciphered and the signature is valid, <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> mints <b>the</b> different e-coins requested.|$|R
30|$|At {{the end of}} {{the period}} {{established}} by <b>the</b> <b>broker,</b> each vendor sends <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> <b>the</b> amounts of the different e-coins he has received so that <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> can pay <b>the</b> amounts into the account of each vendor.|$|R
25|$|John B. Bunch McHardy, {{an officer}} in the British Navy and {{grandson}} of John and Cecily Bunch, eventually inherited the former Dean property. He had no interest in running a plantation, and sold the land to land dealers Charles and Joseph Lawton for $3,000 dollars. In 1832, <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> sold it to Sarah Anderson and her two sons, George and James, for $4,500. The name Dunlawton was formed by combining her maiden name, Dunn, with the land dealers' name, Lawton. The brothers operated the mill with slave labor—processing sugar, molasses and rum on the property until December 1835, when the Second Seminole Indian War began.|$|E
25|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} over the distribution of tickets at the Denver show of the first tour leg by promoter House of Blues Concerts. It was alleged that House of Blues had reserved {{a large number of}} tickets not purchased by season-ticket holders to private brokers, instead of offering them to the public. <b>The</b> <b>brokers</b> then resold the tickets for well above face value. The band subsequently requested that House of Blues donate $75,000 to a Columbine High School scholarship fund as compensation for their actions. The promoter agreed to make the donation to Columbine victims, but said it would offer the donation to a group of its own choosing, claiming the Columbine College Fund, chosen by the band's management, might not have been legitimate.|$|E
500|$|However, this aura of {{untouchability}} nearly {{came to an}} {{end when}} the cornermaster was himself cornered. Little particularly favored shorting the stocks of the Erie Railroad Company, and it was here that he was trapped by the cornering of the company's stock by a hostile syndicate of rival stockbrokers calling itself the [...] "Happy Family" [...] (in {{much the same way as}} he had done to countless other traders before). This led to a rather dramatic showdown between Little and the financiers involved. At the time, making good on a purchase promise required a transaction at the associated clerk's office, and on the day it was due <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> gathered at the Erie Railroad Company clerk's office, smug at the likelihood that they had beaten Little at his own game. What the traders did not know was that Little had purchased convertible bonds at a company sale in London a few years before; Little entered the premises, apparently unrushed, carrying an oversize bag of what was revealed to be those very bonds, which Little had converted to stocks. To the astonishment of all, Little not only outplayed the syndicate but came out hundreds of thousands of dollars ahead; such a maneuver was never attempted again.|$|E

5000|$|Thus, for example, in the United States the law (in particular, the SEC’s {{customer}} protection rule, Rule 15c3-3) generally {{requires that}} a broker must {{take steps to}} hold separately, in separate (segregated) accounts on <b>the</b> <b>broker's</b> books, securities it holds for its customers from securities of <b>the</b> <b>broker</b> itself. <b>The</b> purpose of the rule is: a) to limit <b>the</b> <b>broker’s</b> use of customer securities to support <b>the</b> <b>broker's</b> own business activities; and b) to facilitate the prompt return of customer securities {{in the event of}} <b>the</b> <b>broker’s</b> insolvency.|$|R

2500|$|Dabit {{claimed that}} Merrill Lynch had {{manipulated}} stock prices by disseminating misleading research, and consequently using its misinformed stockbrokers to artificially inflate {{the value of}} its investment banking clients' stock. [...] In this alleged scheme, the research analysts issued unrealistically optimistic reports upon which <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> relied in advising their clients and in deciding whether to hold on to their own stock, and that both the clients and brokers held on to their stock long past the point at which they would have sold if they had accurate information. [...] By the time the truth was revealed {{around the time of the}} Attorney General's investigation, the price of the stocks had plummeted, causing the stockholders to lose value and <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> to lose commissions when their misinformed clients took their business elsewhere. [...] Dabit's complaint claimed damages on behalf of himself and all class members against Merrill Lynch under Oklahoma state law for breach of fiduciary duty.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the state}} was {{committed}} to secularism, Mujib soon began moving closer to political Islam through state policies as well as personal conduct. He revived the Islamic Academy (which had been banned in 1972 for suspected collusion with Pakistani forces) and banned the production and sale of alcohol and banned the practice of gambling, which {{had been one of}} the major demands of Islamic groups. In his public appearances and speeches, Mujib made increased usage of Islamic greetings, slogans, and references to Islamic ideologies. In his final years, Mujib largely abandoned his trademark [...] "Joy Bangla" [...] salutation for [...] "Khuda Hafez" [...] preferred by religious Muslims. He also declared a common amnesty to the suspected war criminals in some conditions to get the support of far right groups as the communists were not happy with Mujib's regime. He declared, [...] " [...] I believe that <b>the</b> <b>brokers,</b> who assisted the Pakistanis during the liberation war has realized their faults.

2500|$|There were {{different}} types of merchants who operated in the ancient Tamil market, which {{gave rise to a}} wealth-based class distinction among them. Merchants in the lower levels of the hierarchy were of two varieties: the [...] merchants who sold goods that they manufactured themselves and the retailers who sold goods manufactured by others. Itinerant traders were found in both the rural and urban markets, but the retailers were concentrated in the cities. In the rural markets, salt and grain merchants usually produced the goods, transported them and sold them directly to the consumers. Salt merchants, known as umanar, travelled with their families in trains of carts. In the cities, artisans such as the blacksmiths and the oil mongers sold their products directly to the consumers. The bulk of the retailers operated in the textile industry. The textile dealers (aruvai vanigar) bought their products from the weavers (kaarugar) and resold them to the consumers. Merchants selling agricultural produce in the cities were also retailers. At {{the upper end of the}} merchant hierarchy, were the rich merchants who participated in the export trade. There were three classes among them - ippar, kavippar and perunkudi - based on the extent of their wealth; the perunkudi made up the wealthiest class. Foreign merchants, mainly Romans, also did business in the Tamil markets [...] not just in the port cities, but in inland cities such as Madurai, where they exchanged indigenous goods for their offerings. Another category of merchants were the intermediaries or <b>the</b> <b>brokers,</b> who acted as information channels and offered their services mainly to the foreign merchants.|$|E

[...] The sidewalks will be worse obstructed in every street than Wall-street is where <b>the</b> <b>brokers</b> are in full blast. Old beds and ricketty bedstands, handsome pianos and kitchen furniture, will be chaotically huddled together. [...] Everything will be in a muddle. Everybody in a hurry, smashing mirrors in his haste, and carefully guarding boot boxes from harm. Sofas that go out sound will go in maimed, tables that enjoyed castors will scratch along and [...] "tip" [...] on one less than its complement. [...] Bed-screws will be lost in the confusion, and many a good piece of furniture badly bruised in consequence. [...] Family pictures will be sadly marred, and the china will be a broken set before night, in many a house. All houses will be dirty – never so dirty – into which people move, and the dirt of the old will seem enviable beside the cleanliness of the new. [...] The old people will in their hearts murmur at these moving dispensations. The younger people, though aching in every bone, and [...] "tired to death," [...] will relish the change, and think the new closets more roomy and more nice, and delight themselves fancying how this piece of furniture will look here and that piece in the other corner. The still [...] "younger ones" [...] will still more enjoy it. [...] Into the cellar and upon the roof, into the rat-holes and on the yard fence, into each room and prying into every cupboard, they mill make reprisals of many things [...] "worth saving," [...] and mark the day white in their calendar, as little less to be longed for in the return than Fourth of July itself.Keep your tempers, good people. Don't growl at the carmen nor haggle over the price charged. When the scratched furniture comes in don't believe it is utterly ruined, – a few nails, a little glue, a piece of putty, and a pint of varnish will rejuvenate many articles that will grow very old 'twixt morning and night, and undo much of the mischief that comes of moving, and which at first sight seems irreparable.|$|E
