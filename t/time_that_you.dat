25|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a common}} term {{for all of the}} {{behaviors}} which relate to the promotion of good sleep. These behaviors are used as the basis of sleep interventions and are the primary focus of sleep education programs. Behaviors include the use of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption, maximizing the regularity and efficiency of sleep episodes, minimizing medication usage and daytime napping, the promotion of regular exercise, and the facilitation of a positive sleep environment. Exercise can be helpful when establishing a routine for sleep but should not be done close to the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are planning on going to sleep. The creation of a positive sleep environment may also be helpful in reducing the symptoms of insomnia. In order to create a positive sleep environment one should remove objects that can cause worry or distressful thoughts from view.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Constable was {{a member}} of the Whig party, likely due to the close {{friendship}} of his father-in-law and Henry Clay. Due mainly to frustrations over how the Whig party had treated him, Constable decided to switch parties. He is quoted as saying, [...] "that the party was dominated by old fogies who are indifferent to younger men." [...] His inclination toward the Democratic Party almost led to a fistfight between himself and Lincoln in a tavern in Paris, Illinois. Lincoln was quoted as saying, [...] "Mr. Constable, I understand you perfectly, and have noticed for some <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have been slowly and cautiously picking your way over to the Democratic party." [...] After this heated exchange, the men reconciled, but by 1856 Lincoln claimed that Constable had left the party. In 1858, Constable was the Illinois elector at-large for the election of President James Buchanan, a Democrat.|$|E

[...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{was further}} {{violence}} in May 2001. On 5 May, 300 Orangemen and supporters tried to march on to Garvaghy Road but were stopped by police. There were some scuffles between Orangemen and police officers. District Master Harold Gracey drew controversy {{when he said}} to the police officers: [...] "We all know where you come from...you come from the Protestant community, the vast majority of you come from the Protestant community and it is high <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> supported your own Protestant people". On 12 May there were clashes between loyalists and nationalists on Woodhouse Street. On 27 May there were clashes between nationalists and police after a junior Orange march on the lower Garvaghy Road.|$|E

You feel a certain way and you want people to go out and support it. The <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> take, it's like a piece of your life.

2500|$|Within marriage, regular sexual {{relations}} are expected and encouraged. [...] "The husband should give {{to his wife}} her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does." [...] As “one flesh,” {{the husband and wife}} share this right and privilege; the New Testament does not portray intimacy as something held in reserve by each spouse to be shared on condition. [...] "Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control." [...] A stated reason for maintaining marital relations is to reduce the temptation to adultery.|$|E
2500|$|These traits come to {{the fore}} in Hi, Mom!s [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{sequence}}. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of Brechtian distanciation: [...] "First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In Hi, Mom! for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching at the same <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are emotionally involved with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sputnik Music {{said about}} the song {{in a review of}} The Downward Spiral, declaring that [...] "'Mr. Self Destructs cryptic {{declarations}} of the many addictions we seem to openly enjoy are jarringly poetic, and its blistering chainsaw guitars and machine gun drum loops are an outstanding example of how aggressive yet tuneful industrial music can be." [...] Rolling Stone was also positive towards [...] "Mr. Self Destruct", saying that the song [...] "the soft passages are soft chiefly in the sense of not being loud, as if there were a really great party down the street that you were wimping out on, pumped guitars and cranking boom-thwack drum machines and what not. But almost as soon as you rush to your pre-amp and squeeze in more juice, the loud comes back in, but so unimaginably loud this <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think your speaker coils might melt, and old man Reilly in the next apartment has already started to bang his broomstick on the wall." [...] "Mr. Self Destruct" [...] was remixed five times for Further Down the Spiral (1995), including a re-work partially produced by Aphex Twin.|$|E

2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E
