5|$|The game {{begins with}} the Hero dreaming that he meets the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, and a woman named Yuriko; she {{promises}} that she will become the Hero's partner. He wakes up, and receives an e-mail with a computer program for summoning demons attached. While out on an errand, he learns that a scientist has opened a portal to the Abyss, which allows demons to enter Tokyo. He also meets Yuriko, who says she will fulfill her promise. The next night, the Hero again dreams that he meets the Law Hero and Chaos Hero, and that they save the Heroine from a sacrificial ritual. The next day, he meets the Law Hero and Chaos Hero in reality; they reveal that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> dreams. News of the demons spread, and the US military, led by ambassador Thorman, decides to intervene. The Japan Self-Defense Forces, led by general Gotou, opposes them, as they see demons as the ancient spirits of the land. A third group, led by the Heroine, tries to prevent conflict between the other two. She gets captured by Gotou's forces; {{they are about to}} publicly execute her under supervision by Yuriko, but she is saved by the Hero, Law Hero, and Chaos Hero. Players can choose to support Thorman or Gotou, or to reject both; regardless of what they choose, the conflict escalates until Thorman launches missiles towards Tokyo. The Heroine is killed, but saves the Hero, Law Hero, and Chaos Hero by using magic to teleport them to another plane of existence.|$|E

25|$|During the 1710s and 1720s, French {{presence}} and settlement in Natchez territory increased from {{a handful of}} traders and missionaries to hundreds of settlers (some 400 French colonists and 200 African slaves). They cultivated several large tobacco plantations, and maintained the military post of Fort Rosalie. French colonists intermarried with Natchez women. At first the Natchez welcomed the French settlers and assigned them land grants, although it's unlikely <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> concept of land use as the French.|$|E

25|$|The Treaty of Holston, {{signed in}} July 1791, {{required}} the Upper Towns to cede more land {{in return for}} continued peace because the US government proved unable to stop or roll back illegal settlements.

25|$|For {{most of the}} country's history, Hemingway wrote, federal {{employees}} were appointees, employed at will, with no legal recourse against adverse actions due to the federal government's sovereign immunity.

Over the course of the 20th century Congress expanded the protections of {{federal employees}}, to the point that by the 1990s <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> legal recourse against discrimination as employees in the private sector, with five separate administrative agencies empowered to hear employee complaints and grant relief.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the South African Reserve Bank issued 100-rand {{banknotes}} {{which were}} defective because they lacked fluorescent printing visible under UV light. In June, printing of this denomination was {{moved from the}} South African Bank Note Company to Crane Currency’s Swedish division (Tumba Bruk), which reportedly produced 80 million 100-rand notes. The South African Reserve Bank shredded 3.6 million 100-rand banknotes printed by Crane Currency because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> serial numbers as a batch printed by the South African Bank Note Company. In addition, the notes printed in Sweden were not the correct colour, and they were 1 mm short.|$|E
25|$|As the hip hop {{community}} worldwide {{received the}} album {{with a high}} note, the members of N.W.A became the top stars for the emerging new era of gangsta rap while popularizing the lyrics of Ice Cube and MC Ren. The album also helped to spawn many young MCs and gangsta hip hop groups from areas such as Compton, California, and South Central Los Angeles, as many thought <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> story to tell {{and the ability to}} pursue the career track that N.W.A had taken, hence groups such as Compton's Most Wanted coming into being.|$|E

25|$|The Netherlands' {{target was}} {{therefore}} 198 to win (in 36 overs), or 197 to tie. It is fair that their target was increased, even though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively {{in their first}} 28 overs, and scored more runs {{at the expense of}} more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralizes the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 minus& 122 = 75 runs.|$|E
25|$|A {{consumer}} {{version of}} the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance and drivetrain upgrades and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were a few different superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC. All Shelby GTs are shipped with the Shelby serial number (CSM) on the dashboard badge and in the engine compartment, such as 07SGT0001 or 08SGT0001.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the interwar period, Arab nationalists bore Germany no ill-will, {{despite its}} earlier {{support for the}} Ottoman Empire. Like many Arab countries, it was {{perceived}} {{as a victim of}} the post-World War I settlement. Hitler himself often spoke of the 'infamy of Versailles'. Unlike France and Great Britain it had not exercised imperial designs on the Middle East, and its past policy of non-intervention was interpreted as a token of good will. While the scholarly consensus is that Husseini's motives for supporting the Axis powers and his alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were deeply inflected by anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist ideology from the outset, some scholars, notably Renzo De Felice, deny that the relationship can be taken to reflect a putative affinity of Arab nationalism with Nazi/Fascist ideology, and that men like Husseini chose them as allies for purely strategic reasons, on the grounds that, as Husseini later wrote in his memoirs, 'the enemy of your enemy is your friend'.Translation: 'I have considered Germany to be a friendly country, because it was not a colonizing country, and it never harmed any Arab or Islamic country, and because it was fighting our colonialist and Zionist enemies, and because the enemy of your enemy is your friend. And I was certain that Germany's victory would definitely save our countries from the danger of Zionism and colonization'.Mudhakkirat al-Hajj Amin al-Husayni, Damascus 1999 p.96. When Husseini eventually met with Hitler and Ribbentrop in 1941, he assured Hitler that 'The Arabs were Germany's natural friends because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> enemies... namely the English, the Jews, and the Communists'.|$|E
