50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Delis,</b> {{rather than}} aid Hurshid Ahmed Pasha, were the {{proximate}} {{cause of his}} overthrow.

At this juncture a firman arrived from Constantinople conferring on Muhammad Ali the governorship of Jedda. Within a few days, however, he managed to seize Egypt instead.|$|R

5000|$|Of {{the many}} delicatessens in the area, <b>the</b> Carnegie <b>Deli</b> {{has had a}} longstanding rivalry with <b>the</b> nearby Stage <b>Deli.</b> While <b>the</b> Stage Delicatessen long had the better reputation, a 1979 article in The New York Times that rated <b>the</b> Carnegie <b>Deli's</b> pastrami as {{superior}} helped spur business and set off what had {{been described as the}} [...] "Pastrami War". While both businesses routinely had customers lined up outside the door, Parker dismissed <b>the</b> Stage <b>Deli,</b> saying that [...] "They're living off our overflow". Among the allegations in the war was that <b>the</b> Carnegie <b>Deli's</b> pastrami was made at its commissary in Secaucus, New Jersey, with water from the Garden State, unlike the New York City water used to prepare the brine made by <b>the</b> Stage <b>Deli</b> for its pastrami.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> Montreal <b>deli</b> Schwartz's is {{credited}} {{with the creation of}} Montreal steak seasoning.

Soon the customers began asking for the same.

His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown and Paul Gilbert. Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers when <b>the</b> <b>Deli</b> Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>deli's</b> {{corned beef}} and pastrami, celebrated by smoked meat connoisseurs nationwide, were cured in the store's cellar using Steiner's own recipe in a two-week-long curing process. <b>The</b> Carnegie <b>Deli</b> used a half-ton of brisket {{to prepare a}} week's supply of corned beef {{by the time of}} his death.

25|$|Wild Oats was co-founded in 1986 by {{husband and}} wife team Mike Gilliland and Libby Cook in 1987 in Boulder, Colorado. Originally {{purchasing}} a convenience store, which they bought with cash advances on 17 credit cards and a second mortgage on Gilliland's mother's house, the pair decided to buy a natural foods market, Crystal Market, which they felt would prosper in health-conscious Boulder. The $300,000 purchase, completed in 1987, thrust the couple into an environment {{quite different from the}} junk-food focus of convenience stores, an environment that gradually persuaded Gilliland and Cook to become healthy eaters themselves. In that first store, Gilliland worked the counter, while Cook worked <b>the</b> <b>deli.</b> Soon, the couple had opened another natural foods store, {{on the south side of}} Boulder, called Wild Oats Community Market. As the Wild Oats business expanded, a holding company was formed, and Gilliland became chief executive officer and president, while Cook became vice-president and in-house attorney.|$|E
25|$|In {{an early}} example from eastern Sumatra, the 15th century Sultanate of Aru, {{believed}} to be the precussor of Malay Sultanate of Deli, is described in the Melaka-Johor chronicle as being of Batak origin. European observations on the same region from the 19th century suggests that people further upstream on the rivers of Deli, people who had long had a trading relationships with the coast, and were later called Karo Batak, were being incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>Deli</b> Sultanate. The Batak and Malay distinction was not racial but cultural, and by converting to Islam and taking on Malay dress and culture, the Batak could become Malay. Both European and Malay writings show them being tutored in the new culture, receiving Malay titles such as Orang Kaya Sri di Raja as {{part of the process of}} conversion. Similar developments were underway in Asahan, to the south, and on the Barus frontier in the northwest of Sumatra where entry to the new sphere entailed not only a change in manners an clothing styles, but also the adoption of the Islamic religion and the Malay language.|$|E

Stoler {{examined}} the tobacco plantations of <b>the</b> <b>Deli</b> Maatschappij, {{one of the}} most profitable Dutch colonial corporations of the 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>Deli</b> company imported large numbers of Chinese indentured labourers to Sumatra, Indonesia, where they were treated not as employees, but as contractors. As contractors they had to buy all their supplies at inflated prices from the company, take all the risks of cultivation and processing, and finally sell their tobacco to the company at prices it set. They were kept in perpetual debt, unable to change employers, in working conditions that resulted in extraordinarily high death rates.
