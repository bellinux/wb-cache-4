40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{have become an}} important strategy for international expansion, even though numerous acquisitions fail to achieve their financial and strategic objectives. The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is performed to eliminate this information asymmetry. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The importance of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough for a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> audit. Therefore, this study examines the role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> recognizing the elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> For the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews conducted for a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> However, conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is not always self-evident. Doubtful attitude towards <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> exists, though it is exceptional. Carefully planning the focus of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and compiling and managing the team conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> are identified as the main elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Altogether, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> can have plural roles which in this study are categorized as the confirmatory, preparative, and cross-functional roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The older academic literature tends to emphasize the confirmatory role whereas the current academic discussion also supports the preparative role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> It can be argued that the roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> differ among experienced <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practitioners based on several factors. In attempt to increase the value of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> for acquirers, more than one role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is likely to exist.

40|$|A <b>Technical</b> <b>Due</b> <b>Diligence</b> (TDD) {{investigation}} {{is an important}} step in the process of obtaining financing, or in mergers and acquisitions, for a wind power project. The investigation, the scope of which varies depending on the stage and nature of the project, involves reviewing important documentation relating to different aspects of the project, assessing potential risks in terms {{of the quality of the}} information available and suggesting mitigation or other risk management measures where required. A TDD assessment can greatly benefit from increased objectivity in terms of the reviewed aspects as it enables a sharper focus on the important risk elements and also provides a better appreciation of the investigated parameters. This master’s thesis has been an attempt to introduce more objectivity in the <b>technical</b> <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process followed at the host company. Thereafter, a points-based scoring system was devised to quantify the answered questions. The different aspects under investigation have a complex interrelationship and the resulting risks can be viewed as an outcome of a causal framework. To identify this causal framework the concept of Bayesian Belief Networks has been assessed. The resulting Bayesian Networks can be considered to provide a holistic framework for risk analysis within the TDD assessment process. The importance of accurate analysis of likelihood information for accurate analysis of Bayesian analysis has been identified. The statistical data set for the right framework needs to be generated to have the right correct setting for Bayesian analysis in the future studies. The objectiveness of the TDD process can be further enhanced by taking into consideration the capability of the investing body to handle the identified risks and also benchmarking risky aspects with industry standards or historical precedence...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices {{and whether they}} contribute to Merger and Acquisition (M&A) success or failure is an ongoing debate in finance research. This research report contributes to the debate by examining the {{effectiveness of}} traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> using a qualitative research approach. A dataset of traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices was compiled from the literature, which {{formed the basis for}} an interview which was conducted with corporate finance practices. The findings indicate that the traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process is considered to be an evolving process, where <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices of the last decade are considered to be significantly different from the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> required in acquisitions today. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is also considered to be indispensable, and its scope and importance underestimated.

Although green or sod roofs have been built over many centuries, contemporary roofs adopt new approaches and technologies. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – A mixed methods design based on a systematic review of relevant literature from parallel disciplines was used to identify and quantify the social, economic and environmental benefits of retrofitted green roofs in commercial districts. The technical issues of concern were drawn from a desk-top survey of literature and from stakeholder focus groups undertaken in Sydney in 2012. Findings – There are perceptions amongst built environmental practitioners that may act as artificial barriers to uptake. There is little direct experience within built environment professionals and practitioners, along with a fear of the unknown and a risk averse attitude towards perceived innovation which predicates against green roof retrofit. Furthermore projects with green roofs at inception and early design stage are often “value engineered” out of the design as time progresses. There is a need for best practice guidance notes for practitioners to follow when appraising roofs for retrofit and also for <b>technical</b> <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> purposes. Research limitations/implications – The focus groups are limited to Sydney-based practitioners. Although many of these practitioners have international experience, few had experience of green roofs. A limited number of roof typologies were considered in this research and some regions and countries may adopt different construction practices. Practical implications – In central business districts the installation of green roof technology is seen as one of the main contributors to water sensitive urban design (WSUD). It is likely that more green roofs will be constructed over time and practitioners need knowledge of the technology as well as the ability to provide best advice to clients. Originality/value – The benefits of green roofs as part of WSUD are increasingly being recognised in terms of reduced flood risk, reduced cost of drainage, improved water quality and lower energy use, as well as other less tangible aspects such as aesthetics and amenity. This research highlights the lack of understanding of the short- and long-term benefits, a poor appreciation and awareness of these benefits; a lack of technical knowledge and issues to be considered with regard to green roofs on behalf of practitioners. The study has highlighted the need for specific training and up-skilling in these areas to provide surveyors with the technical expertise needed. There is also a need to consider how the emerging retrofit and adaptation themes are best designed into the curriculum at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

Therefore Group Machiels conducted tests with 2 types of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF), the recycling residue from the material recuperation process performed on mined waste from the Remo landfill site in Houthalen-Helchteren. In order to achieve the above-mentioned goal, the following elements have to be validated and verified: •	Gasplasma™ is able to robustly process RDF from mined Remo landfill waste and operate very stable {{for a long time}} to demonstrate its robustness for the intended application. This has already been proven for similar but different applications. •	Gasplasma™ offers a sound mass balance demonstrating the conversion into Plasmarok™ which is a substitute for gravel or a cement replacement in construction industry.

O objetivo deste Trabalho Final de Mestrado é a criação de um modelo de análise que permita aferir da possibilidade de terminar a construção de edifícios inacabados de uma forma economicamente sustentável. Tomou-se um edifício inconcluso como caso de estudo, localizado numa avenida nobre da cidade Lisboa, com a finalidade de avaliar a sua viabilidade económica. Para este efeito adotou-se uma abordagem de diagnóstico 360 graus; com recurso à metodologia baseada em Due Diligences: Due Diligence Administrativa, Due Diligence Técnica e Due Diligence Comercial. Da aplicação do método existirá sempre um tipo de solução para os edifícios inacabados: - Demolir o existente; - Alterar o programa com {{eventual}} redução de áreas e usos; - Concluir a construção do programa base. As Due Diligences (administrativa, técnica e comercial) completadas pelos estudos de viabilidade económica foram a fórmula que possibilitou a conclusão de que é viável terminar o edifício em estudo, alterando o programa e adaptando à procura atualmente existente.

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2013. In {{the context}} of {{corporate}} accountability, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are two important concepts. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> as ‘the care that a reasonable person exercises to avoid harm to other persons or their property’. In the business context, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> refers to the ‘research and analysis of a company or organization done {{in preparation for a}} business transaction’, or the ‘duty of a firm’s directors and officers to act prudently in evaluating associated risks in all transactions’. Complicity, on the other hand, is described as ‘association or participation in… a wrongful act’. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are thus different notions. This chapter will explore the various possible connections between these two concepts. Questions arising in this respect include, for example, whether the assessment and avoidance of the risk of complicity is part of a company’s <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibility. If so, can complicity liability arise even though the company acted with <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> but harm nevertheless occurs? And can <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibilities help to define the elements of complicity liability, with regard to both the question of which acts might result in liability of the company for third party wrongdoing, and which mental element is necessary in order to hold the corporation to account in such circumstances? Or does complicity liability define the content and scope of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibilities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSignificant {{reductions}} in CO 2 emissions to atmosphere from established industrial {{processes such as}} power generation and also cement, {{iron and steel production}} require increased, widespread deployment of commercial-scale CCS projects. Large-scale integrated projects (LSIPs) face different challenges than do smaller pilot and demonstration projects that have contributed much toward technical research. LSIPs have a much larger spatial scale of operation and a much larger temporal scale as they are expected to be operational for many decades and will require on-going monitoring, performance assessments, and must satisfy regulated reporting requirements. Among the most significant factors required to move an LSIP forward is the need to provide confidence internally to the project proponents that the technical appraisal of the project and the prospective business case can justify a final investment decision (FID) of tens to {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} or more. Many non-geological factors also have major influence over CCS project success such as regulatory environment continued uncertainty around national and international policy development around greenhouse gas mitigation, and uncertain public support. Considering the large commitment in financial and technical resources required to reach FID, perhaps neither the slow progress in LSIP development nor the highly visible project cancellations and postponements in this nascent industry should be unexpected. Although all project proponents are confronted with unique geological and non-technical issues there are common aspects that may be recognized within projects achieving FID that may be broadly instructive. Storage exploration and site appraisal is a lengthy process that will take years and should not be underestimated. Industrial scale CCS requires a firm and large commitment and investment in human, technical, and financial resources. Recent LSIPs that have achieved FID have employed dedicated full-time subsurface teams for years to reduce uncertainties in the storage plan. Multi-faceted projects such as large-scale CCS require decisions be made even though uncertainties exist at various stages of project lifecycle. There is a critical need to manage these uncertainties in all aspects of the project, particularly when dealing with changes in project scope or framework in order to reach milestones and decision gates. Projects may not always proceed linearly through lifecycles and may need to recycle back to an earlier development phase if appropriate. Interface management around project integration is a critical process that must be actively managed to consider exploration and appraisal requirements. For example, capture requirements feed into storage requirements, and storage limitations may impact capture considerations and project feasibility. Focused stakeholder engagement is required: projects must provide transparency to the community and the regulator; public reviews and <b>technical</b> <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> exercises such as independent peer reviews bring confidence to the government; environmental assessments bring confidence to the community all of the above build confidence in the project...|$|E
