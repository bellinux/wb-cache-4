Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content, including stearic acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly over half of the total free fatty acid content.|$|E
5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations.

Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
40|$|This {{position}} paper outlines a staged approach to search-based application security <b>testing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first stage one searches for candidate <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> input space {{that have a}} chance of leading to good security <b>tests.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second stage one selects individual candidates and uses them to select and parameterize specialized search techniques. This approach has its roots <b>in</b> exploratory security <b>testing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first stage, the fitness of tests depends on their ability to provoke vulnerability symptoms at all, and on their relation to other <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> a <b>test</b> suite. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second stage, the fittest tests are those that come closest to an exploit of a specific type of vulnerability. To evaluate the performance of such a staged approach one might use web application vulnerability scanners as a bas eline...|$|R

Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined {{that the quality of}} African American petty officers at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels of competence were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for the enlisted men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers at Port Chicago considered the enlisted men unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E

For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were assembled and <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and others in France. Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core {{was built in the}} U.S., then shipped to the SNECMA plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which even the President of SNECMA was not allowed. The SNECMA components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out to be finished.|$|E

5|$|Haynes' car is {{believed}} to be the second gasoline-engine powered vehicle successfully road <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, according to its exhibit information at the Smithsonian Institution. It was built two years before Henry Ford's Quadricycle, and preceded only by Charles Duryea's Motorized Wagon less than a year earlier. Unlike Duryea's car, which was an adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power but still able to be pulled by horse, Haynes' car was designed only to run on its own. Some automotive historians use this difference to determine that Haynes' car was the first true American automobile. The Sintz company continued to be intrigued by Haynes' use of their motor and sent representatives to photo his vehicle and published the images as an advertisement for one of their engine's possible uses. The publicity spurred the creation of numerous other automobiles across the American midwest.|$|E

5|$|In 1899, {{with the}} {{outbreak}} of the South African War, the British Army was committed to its first large-scale overseas deployment since the 1850s. The intervening period had seen extensive redevelopments of the Regular Army. The Cardwell Reforms of 18681872 had abolished the purchase of commissions, professionalising the officer corps, and reformed the system of enlistment so that recruits now served for six years with the colours and then a further six years liable for reserve service. The new reserve system had been <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War (when reservists fought overseas for the first time) and during the Pendjeh Crisis, when the reserves of one cavalry regiment and fifteen infantry regiments, totalling 4,681 men, were mobilised.|$|E

In 2007, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect DNA samples and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina, considered to be the largest remaining herd, with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War.

5|$|In March 1989, {{the first}} buses were <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel; University Street station was only 75 percent complete, and buses {{had to drive}} under {{scaffolding}} and construction equipment while passing through the station. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, and a soft opening for University Street station was held on August 9, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dual-mode buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. During its early months, University Street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. The leaks were later fixed by Metro contractors.|$|E
