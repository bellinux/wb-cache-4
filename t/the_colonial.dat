5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> authorities, who {{regarded him}} as responsible for several satirical and mocking posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed convenient. Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E
5|$|Clarke was {{a critic}} of migrant labour schemes, which were {{designed}} to attract foreign labour to Rhodesia, and in 1900 he defended the rights of indigenous labour against infringement by foreign Africans from Mozambique, Nyasaland, Zambia and South Africa. As early as 1900, the BSAC came to <b>the</b> <b>Colonial</b> Office with a proposal regarding Chinese labour. In London, the Land and Mine Owners Association was formed in 1902 to lobby <b>the</b> <b>Colonial</b> Office and continued to press throughout 1903. <b>The</b> <b>Colonial</b> Office postponed its decision saying that the question concerned not only Rhodesia but all of southern Africa. Milner was lobbied by the BSAC and he promised his support. Clarke, however, dismissed the demands, arguing that 'the introduction {{of large numbers of}} Asiatics... will subject the aboriginal natives to unfair competition'. He forecast that the labour shortage was temporary and that the new bureau would satisfy demand. Clarke also argued that most Rhodesians were opposed to the introduction of Chinese labour. The Duke of Marlborough, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, recorded that he found Clarke's argument more convincing than Milner's, and <b>the</b> <b>Colonial</b> Office refused the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Clemuel Ricketts, the {{architect}} of the stone house, was very interested in architecture from <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> period and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> or Georgian style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year.|$|E
25|$|The NCAA {{committee}} selected <b>the</b> <b>Colonials</b> as <b>the</b> #9 {{seed in the}} East Region for the tournament. They faced #8 seed Memphis in {{the second}} round.

A late rally cut the Memphis lead to only one point with 25 seconds to go, but <b>the</b> <b>Colonials</b> could not hold on and lost, 71–66.|$|R

5|$|In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had {{recently}} been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed {{by the actions of}} the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> governors in America, instructing them to dissolve <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.|$|E

5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While <b>the</b> <b>Colonial</b> Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at <b>the</b> <b>Colonial</b> Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E

5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) to an Afrikaner {{mother and}} a Lithuanian Jewish father, he moved to Northern Rhodesia, became {{involved}} with the trade unions, and entered <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> legislative council in 1938. There, he campaigned for the amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia (the latter under white self-government, the former under <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> office). Although unsuccessful, he succeeded {{in the formation of}} the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a state within the British Empire that sought to retain predominant power for the white minority while moving in a progressive political direction, in contrast to apartheid South Africa.|$|E
5|$|By early 1942, <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> {{government}} of the Dutch East Indies had become concerned {{with the possibility of}} an invasion by the Empire of Japan. This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would move away from <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Star, though production of 1001 Malam was incomplete, was reported to be preparing to move. When the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942, Star was closed, never to reopen.|$|E
5|$|Charles Atangana (c. 1880 – 1 September 1943), {{also known}} by his birth name, Ntsama, and his German name, Karl, was the {{paramount}} {{chief of the}} Ewondo and Bane ethnic groups during much of <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> period in Cameroon. Although from an unremarkable background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with colonial priests and administrators secured him successively more prominent posts in <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> government. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and an eager collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two Beti-Pahuin subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples. His loyalty and acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I.|$|E

5|$|During Western Australia's convict era, {{the prison}} {{was known as}} the Convict Establishment, and was used for prisoners transported from Britain. Longer term locally-sentenced prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a cost to <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> government. In 1868, penal {{transportation}} to Western Australia ceased, and the number of convicts in the colony gradually declined, down to 83 in the mid-1880s. Due to the great expense of sending these convicts back to Britain, the authorities there negotiated with <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> government to relinquish jurisdiction over them, as well as the prison complex – demolition was considered too expensive. Early negotiations had broken down, but were restarted in August 1883. After one and a half years, a compromise was reached, and the transfer was finalised on 31 March 1886.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in London in late 1885, Abu Bakar {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} Meade for a formal recognition as the Sultan of Johor.

Queen Victoria consented to his wishes, and a treaty was signed on 11 December 1885 which formalised relations between Great Britain and Johor, was concluded between Abu Bakar and <b>the</b> <b>Colonial</b> Office. Abu Bakar also founded the state advisory board in London, which was intended to oversee state interests in London.
