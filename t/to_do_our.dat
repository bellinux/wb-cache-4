5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>our</b> job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

[...] Taylor York adds [...] "A lot of people would hear the song and assume it would be about the story of people still being in love, but what was so appealing about Isaac's treatment is that he wanted to capture what love feels like ...

The head of Kosevo Hospital's plastic surgery department said [...] "It would be much better if you sent the tools <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>our</b> jobs properly than for you to make a big show of a few token evacuations."

500|$|Stoicism is {{a school}} of Hellenistic {{philosophy}} that flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD. [...] Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics which is informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. [...] According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting this moment as it presents itself, by not allowing ourselves {{to be controlled by}} our desire for pleasure or our fear of pain, by using our minds to understand the world around us and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>our</b> part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others in a fair and just manner.|$|E

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>our</b> work well." ...|$|E
500|$|In an August 2010 interview, co-showrunner and {{executive}} producer Robert Carlock was asked if the series would continue to make reference of the real-life acquisition of NBC Universal by cable company Comcast—which occurred in November 2009—to which Carlock replied that their version of the acquisition was in the [...] "works". Carlock noted that the NBC-Comcast deal would not change the show's [...] "reason for existence", explaining that since the merger has occurred it has made things [...] "even funnier" [...] for the staff writers. [...] "To us it's great, we've been able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>our</b> version of 'ripped from the headlines,' {{which a lot of}} comedies don't get to do." [...] In the episode, Representative Bookman called out NBC for being racist in regards to its programming lacking diversity. This subplot was based on real-life in which Jeff Zucker, then-President and CEO of NBC Universal, [...] who attended the House Judiciary Committee hearing in February 2010 in discussions of the NBC-Comcast deal, was asked by United States Representative Maxine Waters why the NBC network had not attempted to create shows that would appeal to the black community.|$|E
500|$|... "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Hurwitz and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. The storyline of the episode resembles David Cronenberg's film A History of Violence. [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] features several references to popular culture. For example, in a sequence {{at the beginning of}} the episode, Homer sings about working at the power plant to the melody of The Police's song [...] "Walking on the Moon". According to Chris Ledesma, music editor on The Simpsons, the staff was [...] "very fortunate to have obtained the original master tracks from The Police without vocals. This is a rare instance. When we need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>our</b> own lyrics to an established hit song, [...] usually arranges and records a 'sound-alike' that tries to capture all the spirit and nuance of the original so that the audience immediately identifies the track, but allows us to add our own vocals." [...] The episode also made frequent use of the sequence [...] "Dance of the Knights" [...] from the ballet Romeo and Juliet by Sergei Prokofiev. The sequence had to be licensed, as it was under copyright in most parts of the world.|$|E

500|$|In Waters' absence, Gilmour {{had been}} {{recruiting}} musicians {{for a new}} project. Some months previously, keyboard player Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression for what later became [...] "Learning to Fly", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role {{on the development of}} his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was [...] "far easier for Dave and I <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>our</b> version of a Floyd record". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as [...] "mucking about with a lot of demos". At this stage, there was no firm commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the new material might end up on a third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music [...] "doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd". Gilmour later admitted that the new project was difficult without Waters. [...] Gilmour had experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who would be credited as co-writer of [...] "Learning to Fly" [...] and [...] "On the Turning Away". Instead of writing a concept album, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to turn the new material into a Pink Floyd project.|$|E
500|$|The {{team working}} on the film {{commuted}} between the project and the series, pushing both to scheduling extremes (changes to Bigger, Longer & Uncut were made as late as two weeks before its release) and fighting constantly with Paramount. [...] "They wanted a Disney kind of trailer. We said no. They put together a totally un-South Park MTV video for the song 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?'. We had to go make our own version." [...] Paramount's first trailer for the film advertised it, according to Parker, as [...] "the laughiest movie of the summer", and promoted {{it in a way}} that South Park [...] "was completely against". Parker and Stone told the studio of their dissatisfaction with the trailer, and upon the creation of a second trailer with minimal changes, the two broke the videocassette in half and sent it back in its original envelope. [...] "It was war," [...] said Stone in 2000. [...] "They were saying, 'Are you telling us how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>our</b> job?' And I was going, 'Yes, because you're fucking stupid and you don't know what you're doing.'" [...] In another instance, Paramount took the songs from the film and created a music video to be aired on MTV. In accordance with broadcast standards, the studio cut various [...] "R-rated" [...] parts out and edited it into what Parker described as a [...] "horrible little medley with all humor absent". The studio sent the original tape to Parker and Stone over a weekend, with plans to send it to MTV on Monday to prepare it for airtime beginning Wednesday. Stone instead put the tape in the trunk of his car and went home. Paramount threatened to sue Parker and Stone in response. Parker also noted that the title was an obvious innuendo, and [...] "they (the MPAA) just didn't get it".|$|E
