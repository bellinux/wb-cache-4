50|$|Radar, Field Artillery, No 15, {{better known}} as Cymbeline, was a widely used British mortar {{locating}} radar operating in the I band using a Foster scanner. Developed by Thorn-EMI and built at their now-defunct site at Hayes in Middlesex, it was in British service from 1975 until about 2003 with the Royal Artillery. Cymbeline replaced Green Archer in British service, but in {{a larger number of}} larger units including the Territorial Army. Cymbeline came in Mk 1 and Mk 2 versions, the difference being their mobility; Mk 1 was on a lightweight <b>two</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer</b> whereas Mk 2 was mounted on top of an FV432 armoured carrier. The Mk 1 was transportable underslung by a helicopter.|$|E
50|$|The BS.7 was {{designed}} with transportability in mind and, with the wings detached and arranged along the fuselage beam, leading edges up, {{it could be}} towed behind a motorcycle on a <b>two</b> <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer.</b> Pilots could use it to gain their A and B badges.|$|R
25|$|In late 1940 the Army {{was well}} into {{an effort to}} build an S-band GL radar system, and by 1942 had already sent the plans to {{companies}} in the UK for production. Work also began in Canada in 1940 on an entirely Canadian designed and built version with production starting in September 1942, and deliveries arriving in the UK starting in November 1942, as the GL Mk. IIIC, with British units arriving the next month as the Mk. IIIB. These were dramatically more mobile than the earlier Mk. I and Mk. II designs, consisting of <b>two</b> <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailers</b> and a generator set.|$|R
2500|$|Eventually Bottrill, in {{association}} with A. H. MacDonald & Co. of Richmond Melbourne, began producing steam and oil-based tractors fitted with his wheels. The most famous was known as [...] "Big Lizzie" [...] built in 1915 with a wheel diameter of 7 feet 2 inches (2.2m). At 34 feet (10.4m) long and 45 tons (46 tonnes); with <b>two</b> dreadnought <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailers,</b> it was capable of carrying a total of 80 tons (81 Tonnes) and effectively making its own roads.|$|R
5000|$|The K {{represents}} the nickname [...] "Mikado" [...] that describes a locomotive with <b>two</b> non-powered, pivoting <b>wheels</b> {{in front of}} eight driving wheels, which are connected to driving rods powered by the engine's pistons, and finally <b>two</b> non-powered <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels</b> located under the cab. The name {{comes from the fact}} that the first significant use of the type was a series built by Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Japanese Railways in 1887.|$|R
5000|$|Mass {{awareness}} about road safety through a well decorated float established on 20 <b>wheels</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the Meillerwagen consisted of the <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> chassis, and the hydraulic lifting frame.|$|R
50|$|Instead of panniers, some riders {{prefer a}} bicycle trailer. Trailers {{are easy to}} use and allow touring with bikes on which it is {{impossible}} to attach racks. However, double <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailers</b> decrease maneuverability and are not particularly suited for touring in mountainous regions or on rugged terrain. On the other hand, single <b>wheel</b> <b>trailers</b> are extremely maneuverable, with the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> tracking very closely with the rear wheel. These can easily be ridden on single track trails (about 40 cm width), over some very technical terrain.|$|R
50|$|A {{steering}} wheel is a wheel that turns {{to change the}} direction of a vehicle. A <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> is one that is neither a drive wheel, nor a steer wheel. Front-wheel drive vehicles typically have the rear <b>wheels</b> as <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Brakes {{were full}} air with drum brakes on all <b>wheels.</b> <b>Trailer</b> brakes {{could be used}} {{independently}} of the tractor. A disk type hand brake was mounted on the propeller shaft.|$|R
50|$|The Hawk system {{consists}} {{of a large number}} of component elements. These elements were typically fitted on <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailers</b> making the system semi-mobile. During the system's 40-year life span, these components were continually upgraded.|$|R
25|$|Tires were 9.00x20 with dual rear tires. Brakes {{were full}} air with drum brakes on all <b>wheels.</b> <b>Trailer</b> air {{connections}} applied trailer-brakes with the truck brakes and a hand lever could apply the trailer brakes alone.|$|R
50|$|Recreational vehicle types {{include the}} {{motorhome}} (classes A, B, B+, and C), travel <b>trailer,</b> fifth <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer,</b> toy hauler, popup trailer, and slide-in camper (which fits {{in the bed}} of a pickup truck). See also the list of recreational vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the more}} notable Churchill variants, the Crocodile was a Churchill VII in which the hull machine gun was {{replaced}} with a flamethrower. The fuel was in an armoured <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> towed behind. It could fire several one second bursts over 150 yards. The Crocodile was one of [...] "Hobart's Funnies".|$|R
50|$|During the World War II, {{compelled}} by fuel rationing in the United States, Merle Williams of Long Beach, California invented a two-wheeled electric motorcycle that towed a single <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer.</b> Due to {{the popularity of}} the vehicle, Williams started making more such vehicles in his garage. In 1946, it {{led to the formation of}} the Marketeer Company (current-day ParCar Corp.).|$|R
50|$|The {{engineer}} {{vehicle is}} based on the infantry carrier. Its most distinctive feature is a mine-clearance blade, it is most often towing a <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> loaded with additional equipment. The vehicle is capable of clearing mines on paved surfaces and some rubble clearance. Other mobility tasks can be completed by the mounted engineer squad with the tools on the vehicle and trailer.|$|R
50|$|The Wagon Wheel Family Apartments, a 120-unit {{complex to}} be managed by the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., is the first new {{building}} on the site. The units were first offered to {{the residents of the}} Wagon <b>Wheel</b> <b>Trailer</b> Lodge. The demolition of the trailer park waited until completion of {{the first phase of the}} apartments that has five rent levels based on income and family size.|$|R
50|$|The MMTB {{commenced}} {{operations on}} 1 November 1919, {{taking over the}} cable tram network with 44 route miles of track, 539 grips cars, 485 four <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer</b> cars, 58 double bogie trailers, 11 engine sheds and 15 carriage sheds. On 2 February 1920, it took over the six suburban electric tramway trusts, which were dissolved later that month. The MMTB also succeeded the Cable Tramway Board and the Royal Park Horse Tramway.|$|R
5000|$|The Churchill Crocodile was a Churchill VII {{that was}} {{converted}} by replacing the hull machine gun with a flamethrower. The fuel {{was in an}} armoured <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> towed behind. It could fire several one second bursts over 150 yards. The Crocodile was one of [...] "Hobart's Funnies" [...] - another vehicle used by the 79th Armoured Division. A working example can still be seen at the Cobbaton Combat Collection in North Devon.|$|R

5000|$|... 1957 - Southern Pacific {{steam engine}} #982 was {{dedicated}} at Hermann Park and the Mini-train service was established. The engine was saved after a newspaper letter from Peter Whitney got 75 replies and Southern Pacific donated {{the engine to}} the Junior Chamber of Commerce and the city. It took 5 days to move it from Blodgett to the Park, as rails were laid in the streets in front of it. The locomotive was relocated by 50 <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer</b> to Minute Maid Park in 2005.|$|R
50|$|A 'fifth-wheel' is {{a travel}} trailer {{supported}} by a hitch {{in the center of}} the bed of a pickup truck instead of a hitch at the back of a vehicle. The special hitch used for fifth-wheels is a smaller version of the one used on 18-wheeler trucks and can be connected by simply driving the tow vehicle under the <b>trailer.</b> Fifth <b>wheel</b> <b>trailers</b> are popular with full-time recreational vehicle enthusiasts, who often live in them for several months in one place, using their pickup truck tow vehicle for local errands. A fifth <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer</b> tows more securely than a traditional travel trailer because the hitch weight sits directly over the pickup truck's rear tires. Since part of a fifth wheel sits over the bed of the pickup, it also reduces the overall length of the vehicle/trailer package while allowing the same room as a comparable length travel trailer. Additionally, the hitch's location in the pickup's bed reduces the risk of jackknifing and allows for more maneuverability when backing. Because of the greater room available on the roads in North America, these vehicles are more popular in the United States and Canada than in Europe or other parts of the world. For uneven terrain a gooseneck hitch is an option to fifth-wheel.|$|R
50|$|Some hockey skates {{and other}} skates include a HiLo setup. HiLo setups {{resemble}} a flat setup in that all 4 wheels touch {{the ground at}} the same time. Unlike a flat setup, however, different wheel sizes are used. The front <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> will be smaller than the back <b>two</b> <b>wheels.</b> This is possible because of the location of the axles on the frame itself. One example is a Bauer frame that has <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> in the front that are 76mm and <b>two</b> <b>wheels</b> in the back that are 80mm.|$|R
5000|$|A 'through the road' {{hybrid vehicle}} uses a {{conventional}} piston engine to power <b>two</b> <b>wheels,</b> with electric motor/generators {{on the other}} <b>two</b> <b>wheels,</b> giving a form of part-time 4WD.|$|R

Bicycles must be single-rider, with a maximum of [...] in length, and tandem or three-wheel bikes are not allowed. Bulky attachments such as training <b>wheels,</b> <b>trailers,</b> saddlebags, and baskets are similarly not allowed. Folding bicycles are not restricted and can be carried on any car when folded; they may not be placed on seats or block aisles.|$|R
50|$|A <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> and launcher, each {{carrying}} two missiles in containers, was planned for deploying the Hadès. The original design had {{a range of}} 250 km, which was later increased to 480 km. The guidance system was an inertial platform which could be programmed to execute evasive maneuvers before hitting the target. A version designed to hit hardened underground targets also had a final guidance system which used a GPS-based digital system, resulting in a Circular Error Probable of only 5 m, compared to a CEP of 100 m for the standard version.|$|R

50|$|The Scott Carpenter Station was {{the only}} habitat ever {{designed}} to be launched from a <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailer,</b> much like a boat. This design feature enabled it to be transported to schools and other venues for touring and educational outreach between missions. The education and outreach function was one of its primary features, and figured importantly in its missions. Many classroom to seafloor connections were made, including links to schools in Oklahoma, Florida, California and north of the Arctic Circle in Canada’s Baffin Bay such as Pond Inlet, Nunavut.|$|R

30|$|Skid {{resistance}} is a {{property of the}} pavement which creates enough surface friction for vehicles to maintain control, especially during wet conditions. Although skid {{resistance is}} also {{a function of the}} driver and vehicle characteristics, surface conditions such as bleeding or polished asphalt or smooth macro-texture are used as indicators to identify the potential for skid resistance hazards. Skid resistance of a road is typically measured with a locked <b>wheel</b> <b>trailer</b> procedure where the trailer is pulled at a certain constant speed while the braking system of the test tire is actuated to lock the tire on a wet road surface.|$|R
50|$|In 1973 and 1974 a {{modified}} Travelall was marketed as the International Harvester Wagon Master. The roof over the cargo section was removed {{to make a}} short pickup type bed. The target market for the Wagon Master were people who pulled fifth <b>wheel</b> RV <b>trailers.</b> The exposed cargo area provided the space needed to mount the fifth <b>wheel</b> for the <b>trailer.</b> The Wagon Master was {{very much like the}} Chevrolet Avalanche produced in the early and mid 2000's.|$|R
