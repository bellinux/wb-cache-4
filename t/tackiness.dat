25|$|Osborne {{did change}} the world of theatre, {{influencing}} playwrights such as Edward Albee and Mike Leigh. However, work of his kind of authenticity and originality would remain {{the exception rather than}} the rule. This did not surprise Osborne; nobody understood the <b>tackiness</b> of the theatre better than the man who had played Hamlet on Hayling Island. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Writer's Guild of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{tests can}} be {{performed}} to assess the cardiovascular status of the patient. Packed Cell Volume (PCV) {{is a measure of}} hydration status, with a value 45% being considered significant. Increasing values over repeated examination are also considered significant. The total protein (TP) of blood may also be measured, as an aid in estimating the amount of protein loss into the intestine. Its value must be interpreted along with the PCV, {{to take into account the}} hydration status. When laboratory tests are not available, hydration can be crudely assessed by tenting the skin of the neck or eyelid, looking for sunken eyes, depression, high heart rate, and feeling for <b>tackiness</b> of the gums. Jugular filling and quality of the peripheral pulses can be used to approximate blood pressure. Capillary refill time (CRT) may be decreased early in the colic, but generally prolongs as the disease progresses and cardiovascular status worsens.|$|E
500|$|Though Jackson {{considered}} the ending [...] "overwrought", {{he felt that}} it [...] "pulled the rug"; [...] "turning on a sixpence, the screams of 'Kathy' turned truly horrifying; the <b>tackiness</b> suddenly real and disturbing". Mellor {{considered the}} ending [...] "a terrific twist {{as long as you}} didn’t look at it too closely", arguing that the interviewer's patience and the crew's collusion were unlikely. However, she suggested, there is little to be gained by criticising these aspects of the episode. For Baylis, the ending was unexpected, revealing [...] "darkness of the shabby human kind". In the closing seconds of the episode, he said, [...] "we suddenly saw it all, without seeing anything".|$|E
500|$|Other {{media outlets}} {{received}} the broadcast more positively. Film critic John Hartl of The Seattle Times {{noted that the}} ceremony [...] "was well-paced and filled with comics and comic film clips." [...] He also complimented producer Goldwyn for hiring comics including host Chase and presenters such as Rodney Dangerfield for helping [...] "to keep the show light and funny." [...] The New York Times columnist Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "This was the trimmest, most varied and best-paced program in years." [...] She also commented that without the witty banter of hosts Hogan and Chase, [...] "The show would have seemed notably lacking in luster." [...] Television editor Michael Burkett of the Orange County Register commented, [...] "Monday night's 59th installment was very nearly everything you could have wished it to be: quite entertaining, relatively fast-moving, unusually short on tastelessness and <b>tackiness</b> drenched in nostalgia, and featuring enough superbly chosen film clips for a monster round of Visual Trivial Pursuit.|$|E
2500|$|Each concert {{opened with}} a {{performance}} of [...] "Mofo." [...] Following [...] "Mofo" [...] at every show, the band performed [...] "I Will Follow", [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", [...] "Gone", [...] "Last Night on Earth", and [...] "Until the End of the World". As the group performed, the audience was bombarded with images and colors, all designed towards the show's ironic embrace of <b>tackiness</b> and pop-ular culture.|$|E
2500|$|In Mark Booth's 1983 book Camp {{he defines}} camp as [...] "to present oneself as being {{committed}} to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits." [...] He carefully discerns the distinction between genuine camp, and camp fads and fancies, {{things that are not}} intrinsically camp, but display artificiality, stylization, theatricality, naivety, sexual ambiguity, <b>tackiness,</b> poor taste, stylishness, or portray camp people, and thus appeal to them. He considers Sontag's definition problematical because it lacks this distinction.|$|E
2500|$|Result: Maria {{decided on}} a {{deliberately}} tacky hairspray brand called [...] "Strexy," [...] and decided to play up the <b>tackiness</b> in their campaign. Ashleigh {{thought this was a}} bad idea and attempted {{to take control of the}} task on the second day, leading to much friction between her and Maria during the filming of their advertising video. Their campaign was generally praised, though it was felt that the [...] "girl power" [...] message of their advert was rather dated. Andrew came up with a brand of hair gel called [...] "Chameleon," [...] which was supposed to appeal to people wanting to stand out from the crowd, only for the team to realise too late that this posed a problem in that chameleons actually blend into the background. Andrew also decided to incorporate a joke involving the model having toilet paper stuck to his shoe into their advert, which the executives felt had misfired. Platinum's campaign was deemed to be clearly the better one, with Odyssey's campaign suffering a confused concept and poor overall execution.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} episode of the sixth season, the {{audience}} discovers that Peyton was {{on the receiving end}} of Lucas's phone call. He waits to see if she actually arrives, and moments later, he finds her through the crowd, making her way toward him with bags packed. They share passionate kisses, Peyton glowing with happiness, and then board the plane on their way to Las Vegas. When they get there, they spend the night in a kinky Vegas hotel room. The next day, they go to the wedding chapel, but the <b>tackiness</b> of the place convinces them that this was the wrong decision. Instead, Peyton takes Lucas to the hotel room where he first proposed to her and they do it all over again, but this time Peyton says [...] "yes" [...] before he has even asked the question. With the upcoming release of his new book, Lucas travels to New York to meet with Lindsey, and eventually tells her about his engagement to Peyton. He soon starts his book tour, but it fails fast and is canceled, so he returns home to Peyton. After the two resolve problems and fears of moving in together, Lucas is offered a movie deal by Julian Baker. Julian asks Lucas questions about Peyton before she gets there, and after she runs into Julian near the bathroom, it is revealed that he is her ex-boyfriend. For three weeks, Peyton fails to tell Lucas about Julian, and Lucas is angry when he discovers their past on his own. Although he is initially angry, they patch things up, and Peyton convinces Lucas to continue taking a part in the making of the film, despite his reluctance to work with Julian. The film is to be shot in Tree Hill, North Carolina. He also learns Peyton is expecting their first child. Though they initially have problems with Peyton's pregnancy, the fact that she may die if the baby is born, the two are eventually married by the lake where they first met, and have their reception at Tric. They soon have a healthy daughter, Sawyer Brooke Scott, which Peyton names after her best friend Brooke (similar to the naming of James Lucas Scott), and the two ride off into the sunset.|$|E
50|$|Depending on context, {{the term}} has a {{connotation}} of worthlessness or disposability {{as well as}} <b>tackiness.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lubricant {{additives}} are {{organic and}} synthetic chemical components {{and the product}} segment includes couplers, dispersants and emulsifiers, friction modifiers, and <b>tackiness</b> additives.|$|E
50|$|Dry {{traction}} is {{measure of}} the tire's ability to deliver traction, or grip, under dry conditions. Dry traction {{is a function of}} the <b>tackiness</b> of the rubber compound.|$|E
5000|$|Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman gave it {{a letter}} grade of C- and said that it [...] "makes the <b>tackiness</b> of soap operas seem far more desperate than funny." ...|$|E
5000|$|A detackifier is {{a process}} {{chemical}} that is reducing <b>tackiness</b> of other substances. Spraying paint and paper making are processes where inputs {{may need to be}} detackified or [...] "denatured".|$|E
50|$|After {{his short}} {{stint in the}} NFL, Fustenburg became a co-founder {{and one of the}} {{original}} inventors of Grip Boost, a gel product with the purpose of restoring the <b>tackiness</b> of sports gloves.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{forming the}} solder joint itself, the paste carrier/flux must have {{sufficient}} <b>tackiness</b> {{to hold the}} components while the assembly passes through the various manufacturing processes, perhaps moved around the factory.|$|E
50|$|Hydrocarbon resin is a C5/C9 {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon used in industrial applications. It has a tackifying effect and {{is suitable for}} use in paint, printing ink, adhesives, rubber and other areas where <b>tackiness</b> is required.|$|E
50|$|As {{fixation}} agents used in {{pulp and}} paper production are minerals like talc and bentonite or different cationic polymers like polyDADMAC. The polymer based fixation agents are often called detackifiers as they reduce the <b>tackiness</b> of the pitch and stickies.|$|E
5000|$|In archery, {{when a new}} bowstring {{is being}} made or waxed for {{maintenance}} purposes, rosin may {{be present in the}} wax mixture. This provides an amount of <b>tackiness</b> to the string to hold its constituent strands together and reduce wear and fraying.|$|E
50|$|In modern chewing gum, if {{natural rubber}} such as chicle is used, it must pass several purity and {{cleanliness}} tests. However, most modern types of chewing gum use synthetic gum based materials. These materials allow for longer-lasting flavor, a better texture, {{and a reduction}} in <b>tackiness.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{separate}} review stated [...] "For all the garishness of the setting, {{in which}} <b>tackiness</b> reigns supreme, Hold Me largely avoids the gross characterizations that often mar self-consciously hip movies; {{the residents of}} the El Monte trailer park all reveal quirks and facets that give them a life beyond pure caricature." ...|$|E
50|$|An overgrip is a soft, padded, clothlike tape {{wrapped around}} {{the grip of a}} racquet. There are a few {{purposes}} for an overgrip. The two main uses are to add <b>tackiness</b> (stickiness) and to increase sweat absorption. Other purposes are for the expansion of the circumference of the grip, and for adding more padding or cushioning.|$|E
50|$|The aardvark's stomach has {{a muscular}} pyloric area {{that acts as}} a gizzard to grind {{swallowed}} food up, thereby rendering chewing unnecessary. Its cecum is large. Both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland. Its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck; their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its <b>tackiness.</b> The female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal region.|$|E

50|$|Another {{development}} of glue gun technology allows {{the user to}} 'spray' an area with a semi-pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive. Using compressed air to force the adhesive at a controlled rate through a specially developed glue gun nozzle, a spiral pattern of adhesive is applied. The <b>tackiness</b> of the adhesive / open time is limited {{to just a few}} minutes, after which the adhesive will lose its tack, so coverage is limited.|$|E
50|$|The stencil {{printing}} function is achieved through a single material namely solder paste {{which consists of}} solder metal and flux. Paste also acts as an adhesive during component placement and solder reflow. The <b>tackiness</b> of the paste enables the components to stay in place. A good solder joint is one where the solder paste has melted well and flowed and wetted the lead or termination on the component and the pad on the board.|$|E
5000|$|The Telegraph {{reviewed}} that movie: [...] "Chirodini... Tumi Je Aamar {{could as}} well be a version of QSQT or any other tragic teen love story done to death on screen. But Raj Chakraborty’s directorial debut turns the cliche on its head and makes a two-hour-20-minute entertainer, without the <b>tackiness,</b> sloppiness and meaningless melodrama typical of mainstream Tollywood ... Chirodini’s strength is its screenplay — smart, crisp and racy with neat shot divisions, life-like situations and convincing characters." ...|$|E

50|$|As the latex dries {{it becomes}} very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most {{manufacturers}} offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry {{to take away the}} stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the <b>tackiness</b> of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.|$|E
5000|$|Writing {{a review}} for Asian Trash Cinema, Jim McLennan {{observed}} {{about the first}} part of the video adaptation: [...] "The delight of this episode is its sheer, unrelenting, cheerful <b>tackiness.</b> Yes the girls are utter airheads but charges of sexism must be partly countered by the fact that the original manga was created by a woman, Junko Uemura. In addition, Yusuke is just as socially inadequate in his way, which is doubly amusing given that he is a parody of the likely intended target audience." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critics, however, {{were not}} as kind. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It is an obvious but feeble {{imitation}} of [...] "The Ten Commandments" [...] of Cecil B. de Mille, and {{it is much more}} concerned with salt-mining than it is with debauchery or lust." [...] Contemporary critics have viewed the film just as negatively; a 2008 Time Out review states that the film was a [...] "low point" [...] in Aldrich's career and that the film represented a 1960s <b>tackiness</b> thankfully not seen anymore.|$|E
5000|$|His first novel, Baroque-a-Nova, was {{published}} in Canada by Penguin in 2001, in the United States by Putnam in 2002, and in France by Ballard in 2002. The New York Times Book Review describes the book as [...] "a readable, if slightly gray, coming-of-age novel." [...] The Quill and Quire described the book as [...] "compact, clear-sighted, and nervy. Chong's grasp of suburban <b>tackiness</b> is laugh-out-loud awesome, {{right down to the}} ubiquitous copies of Maclean's magazine on parental coffee tables and trick or treaters dressed as Orville Redenbacher." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} of calcium chloride exploits its hygroscopic properties and the <b>tackiness</b> of its hydrates. A concentrated solution keeps a liquid layer {{on the surface}} of dirt roads, which suppresses formation of dust. It keeps the finer dust particles on the road, providing a cushioning layer. If these are allowed to blow away, the larger aggregate begins to shift around and the road breaks down. Using calcium chloride reduces the need for grading by as much as 50% and the need for fill-in materials as much as 80% ...|$|E
5000|$|Plonk is a {{non-specific}} and derogatory {{term used}} primarily in British and Australian English for cheap, low-quality wine. It {{is believed to}} come from Australian slang, in reference to blanc (the French word for [...] "white"), before it became naturalised in Britain. Despite the reference to the colour white, the term {{is not limited to}} white wine, and can as easily indicate a red wine or rosé. In this context, the phrase has even spawned the title of a novel which evokes the perceived <b>tackiness</b> of the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|When John Madden left FOX after 2001, {{the network}} {{introduced}} a new award starting in 2002, named the [...] "Galloping Gobbler." [...] It was represented by a small figurine of a silver turkey wearing a football helmet striking a Heisman-like pose. Much like Cleatus and Digger, the original Galloping Gobbler trophy reflected Fox's irreverent mascots, and went through several iterations. Unimpressed by its <b>tackiness,</b> 2002 winner Emmitt Smith (who holds the record for most Thanksgiving MVP awards and had won the Turkey Leg Award four previous times) famously threw his in a trash can.|$|E
50|$|The {{ethylene}} {{content is}} around 45% to 85%. The higher the ethylene content, {{the higher the}} loading possibilities of the polymer, better mixing, and extrusion. Peroxide curing these polymers gives a higher crosslink density compared with their amorphous counterpart. The amorphous polymer is also excellent in processing. This is very much influenced by their molecular structure. The dienes, typically comprising from 2.5% to 12% by weight of the composition, serve as cross-links when curing with sulphur and resin; with peroxide cures, the diene (or third monomer) functions as a coagent, which provides resistance to unwanted <b>tackiness,</b> creep, or flow during end use.|$|E
