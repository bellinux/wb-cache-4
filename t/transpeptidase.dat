5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the <b>transpeptidase</b> from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl <b>transpeptidase</b> and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl <b>transpeptidase.</b> In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E

Nucleophilic attack of the β-lactam carbonyl by the catalytic residue (Ser or Cys) of <b>transpeptidases</b> results in {{the opening of the}} β-lactam ring and in the formation of a stable acyl-enzyme. The acylation reaction is considered as irreversible due to the strain of the β-lactam ring. In contradiction with this widely accepted but poorly demonstrated premise, we show here that the acylation of the L,D-transpeptidase Ldtfm from Enterococcus faecium by the β-lactam nitrocefin is reversible, leading to limited antibacterial activity. Experimentally, two independent methods based on spectrophotometry and mass spectrometry provided evidence that recyclization of the β-lactam ring within the active site of Ldtfm regenerates native nitrocefin. Ring strain is therefore not sufficient to account for irreversible acylation of peptidoglycan <b>transpeptidases</b> observed for most β-lactam antibiotics...|$|R

25|$|The {{molecular}} correlate of the filament formation was described. The {{exposure to}} β-lactam antibiotics induced the SOS response in Escherichia coli. During repair of DNA damage, the SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division. Moreover, both β-lactam antibiotics and genetic mutation induce SOS in E.coli through the DpiBA two-component signal transduction system {{leading to the}} inactivation of the ftsl gene product, penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP-3). The ftsl gene {{is a group of}} filamentous temperature-sensitive genes implicated in cell division. In addition, it is a membrane <b>transpeptidase</b> required for peptidoglycan synthesis at the septum generated by cell division. The event to inactivate ftsl gene product requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA and transiently inhibits bacterial cell division. Consequently, the bactericidal effects of β-lactam antibiotics are limited. The DpiA is the effector for the DpiB two-component system. Interaction of DpiA with replication origins competes with the binding of the replication proteins DnaA and DnaB. When overexpressed, DpiA can interrupt DNA replication and induce the SOS response resulting in inhibition of cell division.|$|E
50|$|These {{antibiotics}} {{share common}} structure and mechanism of action. They enter the periplasmic space through porins, where they then inhibit <b>transpeptidases</b> (which are {{also known as}} penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)), enzymes that facilitate peptide cross-links during cell wall synthesis. Their binding to the PBP active site is facilitated in part by their common structure, {{which is similar to}} that of D-alanyl-D-alanine. D-alanyl-D-alanine is a residue on the NAM peptide subunit involved in building peptidoglycan. Carbapenem covalently binds to PBPs, which causes <b>transpeptidases</b> to irreversibly lose their catalytic activity. Inhibition of <b>transpeptidases</b> prevents the formation of cross-links between peptidoglycan polymers and causes a build-up of peptidoglycan precursors. Newly formed peptidoglycan is weakened from the absence of cross-linkages.The continued activity of autolysins, that function like lysozymes and cleave glycosidic and peptide bonds of peptidoglycan in periplasm, weakens the cell wall and leads to osmotic bursting of the bacterial cell.|$|R
5000|$|In general, carbapenem, a β-lactam antibiotic, targets cells by {{inhibiting}} <b>transpeptidases</b> (penicillin-binding proteins).

2500|$|For Burkholderia pseudomallei, some {{clinical}} antibiotic {{agents that}} are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some β-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving <b>transpeptidase</b> so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). [...] Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. [...] However, the B.pseudomallei filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. [...] Furthermore, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. [...] Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Two {{groups of}} penicillin-destroying enzymes, the class A and class C β-lactamases, may have evolved from {{bacterial}} <b>transpeptidases</b> that transfer x-d-Ala-d-Ala peptides {{to the growing}} peptidoglycan during cell wall synthesis. Both the <b>transpeptidases</b> and the β-lactamases are acylated by β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, which mimic the peptide, but breakdown and removal of the antibiotic is much faster in the β-lactamases, which lack the ability to process d-Ala-d-Ala peptides. Stereochemical factors driving this evolution in specificity are examined. Results: We have compared the crystal structures of two classes of β-lactamases and a β-lactam-sensitive d-alanyl-d-alanine-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase (DD-peptidase). The class C β-lactamase is more similar to the DD-peptidase than to another β-lactamase of class A. Conclusions: The two classes of β-lactamases appear to have developed from an ancestral protein along separate evolutionary paths. Structural differentiation of the β-lactamases from the DD-peptidases appears to follow differences in substrate shapes. The structure of the class A β-lactamase has been further optimized to exclude d-alanyl peptides and process penicillin substrates with near catalytic perfection.

40|$|Bacteria are {{surrounded}} by a peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall that must be remodeled to allow cell growth. While many structural details and properties of PG and the individual enzymes involved are known, how the process is coordinated to maintain cell integrity and rod shape is not understood.

We find that a simple model with no enzyme coordination fails to maintain cell wall integrity and rod shape. We then iteratively analyze failure modes and explore different mechanistic hypotheses about how each problem might be overcome by the macromolecules involved. In contrast to a current theory, which posits that long MreB filaments are needed to coordinate PG insertion sites, we find that local coordination of enzyme activities in individual complexes can be sufficient to maintain cell integrity and rod shape.

Therefore, to identify SrtA variants with improved catalytic efficiency, we used directed evolution to select a catalytically enhanced SrtA enzyme. An analysis of improved SrtA variants in the context of sequence conservation, NMR and x-ray crystal structures, and kinetic data suggests a novel mechanism for catalysis involving large conformational changes that delivers substrate to the active site pocket. Indeed, using DEER-EPR spectroscopy, we reveal that upon substrate binding, SrtA undergoes a large scissors-like conformational change that simultaneously translates the sort-tag substrate to the active site in addition to repositioning key catalytic residues for esterification.
