5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded <b>trip</b> <b>computer,</b> tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|The {{top level}} {{included}} such features as ABS, front and side airbags, window bags, remote locking, front power windows, electrical power steering, air conditioning, <b>trip</b> <b>computer</b> with four functions, CD player, CD changer, alloy rims and fog lamps.

25|$|With the V70 Bi-Fuel Volvo {{continued}} {{to offer a}} factory CNG powered car. A 95-litre tank installed in the trunk allowed for a claimed range of 250km running on CNG only. Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG {{at the touch of}} a button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster was replaced by a level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a <b>trip</b> <b>computer</b> and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E
50|$|The {{interiors}} {{were usually}} well-appointed, featuring velour trim, an arm rest with CD and tape storage, central locking (frequently remote), power windows (all round on higher models), power mirrors, illuminated entry, flat-folding rear seats, etc. Higher specification models had leather seats, <b>trip</b> <b>computers,</b> electric sunroof, CD changer and alloy wheels.|$|R

25|$|July 1982 saw the {{introduction}} of the range topping Alfetta Quadrifoglio Oro (meaning Gold Cloverleaf, a trim designation already used on the Alfasud), which took the place of the discontinued 2000 L. The Quadrifoglio Oro was powered by a 128PS (DIN) version of the usual 1962cc engine, equipped with the SPICA mechanical fuel injection used on US-spec Alfettas; standard equipment included several digital and power-assisted accessories like a <b>trip</b> <b>computer,</b> check control panel and electrically adjustable seats. Visually the Quadrifoglio Oro was distinguished by twin round headlights, concave alloy wheels, and was only available in metallic grey or brown with brown interior plastics and specific beige velour upholstery.|$|E
25|$|The Multi-information display, {{located in}} the center of the tachometer, can be toggled through nine {{different}} screens of vehicle information including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid system schematic, <b>trip</b> <b>computer,</b> and ECO Guide. The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a target zone for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the ignition switch is turned off, a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional ‘leaves’ on a plant stem when practicing fuel saving strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a ‘trophy’ graphic.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: There {{are clear}} personal, social and {{environmental}} benefits of cycling. However, safety concerns are among the frequently cited barriers to cycling. In Australia, there are no exposure-based measures of the rates of crash or ‘near miss’ experienced by cyclists. Design and setting: A prospective cohort study over 12 months, with all data collected via web-based online data entry. Participants: Two thousand adults aged 18 years and older, living in New South Wales (Australia), who usually bicycle {{at least once a}} month, will be recruited from March to November 2011. Methods: In the 12 months following enrolment, cyclists will be surveyed on 6 occasions (weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 from the week of the enrolment survey). In these survey weeks, cyclists will be asked to provide daily reports of distance travelled; time, location and duration of trips; infrastructure used; crashes, near misses and crash-related injuries. Information on crashes and injuries will also be sought for the intervening period between the last and current survey. A subsample of participants will receive bicycle <b>trip</b> <b>computers</b> to provide objective measurement of distance travelled. Discussion: This study protocol describes the prospective cohort study developed to assess near misses, crashes and injuries among cyclists by time and distance travelled and by type of infrastructure used, with recruited participants entering data remotely using the internet. We expect to be able to calculate event rate according to exposure overall and for different infrastructure types and to report in-depth information about event causation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a brief guide to {{recent developments in}} data imputation methods which are of value in transport studies. 'Non-response' or 'missing data' are found in many types of surveys commonly used in transportation research and development control practice. A number of the more common (imputation) methods, used to 'fill the gaps' when non-response has occurred, are demonstrated using a sample dataset taken from the <b>Trip</b> Rate Information <b>Computer</b> System (TRICS). In addition, {{some of the more}} recent and less well known developments such as the Approximate Bayesian Bootstrap (ABB) are discussed. Based upon a simple trip generation model (for a selection of UK Office developments), it is shown that the alternative methods can potentially lead to serious 'missing data bias'. Accordingly, it is suggested that considerable caution is exercised when drawing policy implications out of data analysis featuring imputed elements. A transparency principle is suggested as an appropriate guiding tool when dealing with transport survey data with missing elements...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} in the logistics industry is to calculate the carbon footprint of transportation activities based on the distance covered, using long-term fuel consumption averages per kilometer. However, fuel consumption may actually vary over time, because of differences in road characteristics, traffic situations, driving behavior, etc. Therefore, distance-based emission calculations are not accurate. Our approach is fuel-based and it calculates transport greenhouse gas emissions by obtaining the actual fuel consumption during <b>trips</b> via board <b>computers</b> installed in vehicles. Thus, we propose an architecture for a fuel-based Logistics Carbon Management System (LCMS) that monitors and collects real-time data about the fuel consumption during trips, and, consequently, calculates detailed and accurate carbon footprints of transportation services. Furthermore, this system is integrated with the logistics service provider’s business processes and with typical software applications (e. g., Transport Management Systems and Board Computers).
