For him, tax is fundamentally about the ideas that shape the sort of society {{we want to live}} in, not technicalities. His intention is to demonstrate that there is indeed a joy in tax, and by embracing it we can create a fairer society and change the world for the better. Tax has been a feature of human society for a very long time.

40|$|Many {{things in}} current {{interstellar}} dust studies are taken as well understood givens by {{much of the}} community. For example, it is widely held that interstellar dust {{is made up of}} only three components, i. e., astronomical silicates, graphite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and that our understanding of these is now complete and sufficient enough to interpret astronomical observations of dust in galaxies. To zeroth order this is a reasonable approximation. However, while these three pillars of dust modelling have been useful in advancing our understanding over the last few decades, it is now apparent that they are insufficient to explain the observed evolution of the dust properties from one region to another. Thus, it is time to abandon the three pillars approach and to seek more physically-realistic interstellar dust analogues. The analy- sis of the pre-solar grains extracted from meteorites, interplanetary dust particles and from the Stardust mission, and the interpretation of x-ray scattering and absorption observations, supports the view that our current view of the interstellar dust composition(s) is indeed too naive. The aim of this review is to point out where our current views are rather secure and, perhaps more importantly, where they are far from secure and we must re-think our ideas. To this aim ten as- pects of interstellar dust will be scrutinised and re-evaluated in terms of their validity within the current observational, experimental, modelling and theoretical constraints. It is concluded from this analysis <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> need to re-assess many of the fundamental assumptions relating to what we think we really do know about interstellar dust. In particular, it is clear that unravelling the nature dust evolution in the interstellar medium is perhaps the key to significantly advancing our current understanding of interstellar dust. [...] .

40|$|PREVIEW. Holt-Winters (HW) is {{the label}} we {{frequently}} give {{to a set}} of procedures that form the core of the exponential-smoothing family of forecasting methods. The basic structures were provided by C. C. Holt in 1957 and his student Peter Winters in 1960. Those of you unfamiliar with exponential smoothing should look at the brief tutorial on the next page. In this column, Paul Goodwin discusses recent research that extends the application of the HW method to deal with some important issues faced by the business forecaster. THE LEGACY OF HOLT-WINTERS Many companies use the Holt-Winters (HW) method to produce short-term demand forecasts when their sales data contain a trend and a seasonal pattern. Fifty years old this year, the method is popular because it is simple, has low data-storage requirements, and is easily automated. It also has the advantage of being able to adapt to changes in trends and seasonal patterns in sales when they occur. This means that slowdowns or speed-ups in demand, or changing consumer behavior at Christmas or in the summer, can all be accommodated. It achieves this by updating its estimates of these patterns as soon as each new sales figure arrives. The tutorial on the next page describes the basic features of the HW approach to exponential smoothing and provides useful references for further insights into this methodology. Over the years, the Holt-Winters method has been adapted for use in several important situations not originally examined by its creators. More specifically, researchers have recently looked at three issues: • �How can we stop the method from being unduly influenced by sales figures that are unusually high or low (i. e., outliers) ? •��Is the method useful when there are several different seasonal patterns in sales (such as when demand has hourly, daily, and monthly cycles mixed together) ? • �How can we obtain reliable prediction intervals from the method? For example, we might want the method to give us a range for next month’s sales so that there is a 90 % chance that sales will fall within this range. But how can we ensure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> have a 90 % chance of capturing sales within the range...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{national}} {{food and nutrition}} plans Suggested introduction: Poor nutrition can take many forms. It is a shocking truth that {{in some parts of}} the world, over-consumption of sweet and fatty foods is having a huge impact on health and fitness, while in others, people are weak and prone to disease because they do not have enough to eat, or lack sufficient protein, vitamins and minerals in their diet. Whilst the island states of the Caribbean region is perhaps unusual in having both these problems existing side by side - obesity and under-nutrition are, in some places, almost neighbours. As a way of addressing these problems, many Caribbean governments are now developing national food and nutrition security plans. This is a complex process, since food and nutrition involve many different areas of expertise, and require joint action by more than one ministry. At a recent conference on food and nutrition held in Belize, Susanna Thorp spoke to two people who have been heavily involved in the development of such plans. She spoke first to Lorraine Thompson, who works as country co-ordinator in Belize for the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and Panama (INCAP), and began by asking about Belize?s progress in implementing its national food and nutrition plan. IN:		?In Belize we are working on developing? OUT:		? financially as well as otherwise. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 28 ? Back announcement: Christine Bocage from the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute in Trinidad and Tobago emphasising the importance of good nutrition in supporting economic development. Transcript Thompson	In Belize we are working on developing a food and nutrition security plan. Our policy was adopted by government in 2001 and right after that a commission was named which is the body that would try to co-ordinate activities and try to make the plan operational. We have had some difficulties in trying to develop the plan and to implement it. One of them for instance has to do with co-ordination of activities. There are several different sectors that are working on nutrition in the country and I am sure this is what happens elsewhere. You have Ministry of Health has its programme, you have Ministry of Agriculture has its programmes related to food and nutrition security. You have the Ministry for Education for instance that has school feeding programmes. And what happens at the moment is that each of these bodies are carrying out their projects discreetly and what we need to do is to have some sort of co-ordinated approach to ensure that activities are co-ordinated and we are all working towards the same goal, that is improving food and nutrition security in the country. Thorp		So you would like to see better integration between the sectors? Thompson	Right and I think one of the ways we are trying to approach it from is to have a co-ordinator, somebody who would work with the different entities that are involved in food and nutrition security that would bring us together. We put all our activities into one plan and hopefully there can be a more co-ordinated approach and certainly less duplication of efforts and better utilisation of the resources that we have. Thorp	And how is the plan seen within the country policy as a whole, is it given the priority that you would like it to be given? Thompson	I think for the most part our problem in the area of food and nutrition has been the fact that nutrition was never seen to be a problem. Now we understand better the concepts of food and nutrition security and we recognise that in fact the problems in relation to nutrition in this country are big. We are having a lot of chronic non-communicable diseases and we still have pockets of under-nutrition and so our problems are in fact bigger than we thought. We do have a big problem and we do need to generate more support - financial, technical and other resources - to support the implementation of these plans. Thorp	So although you are struggling with a number of different issues, actually in Belize your food and nutrition commission is further along perhaps in being set up and implementing its plan than some of the other countries in the region? Thompson	Right. There is a lot of political will and that is what has helped us along. Our government has seen, and I think they recognise, that food and nutrition security can be a tool to development and I think it recognises that food and nutrition security can be a tool that would help to alleviate poverty. The bottom line is that we have the political commitment which has helped us to come this far. NARR	Christine Bocage is a nutritionist at the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute, and she is responsible for assisting countries to develop and implement their national plans. I put it to her that one of the main challenges Caribbean nations face is the low number of people who are trained in both agriculture and nutrition. Bocage	With respect to agricultural, the human resource in agriculture I think it is much better, 100 % better than with respect to nutrition personnel in the region. We do have countries with no nutrition experts at all and they rely very heavily on the services of the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute. And with respect to agriculture even countries that are importing 99 % of their foods that they utilise and consume in country, they do have a greater capacity in agriculture than they do have in nutrition. So it is something <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> need to take a long look at and to try to convince policymakers that there is a need for nutrition experts if we want to improve food and nutrition security at a national level as well as at a household level. And it is at the household level that we have the nutrition experts; particularly important because then they can give them knowledge and skills so that they can make the right choices and they can lead healthy lifestyles so that we can have a healthier population. Thorp	Because if nutrition can be seen in the right way governments would actually be saving themselves money? Bocage	Yes, I do think we have seen that in the past and again this will have to do with a lot of sensitisation. But you know politicians like to look at dollars and cents. How would improving nutritional status affect productivity or the economics of the country and so on. So we really need to, as nutrition professionals, agriculturists, persons in trade and planning, try to collect data, analyse the data, have sufficient information, as advocacy tools to convince the policymakers that if we do have a more productive society we can improve our situation financially as well as otherwise. End of track. Attempts in Belize to have a co-ordinated approach to food and nutrition planning, and the wider need for expertise and attention on nutrition...|$|E

5000|$|The {{psychology}} of unconscious racial prejudiceThe interest in sustainability {{also meant that}} he became interested in possible ‘dissociation’ {{in other areas of}} life and he explored this in the area of unconscious racial prejudice especially in the context of shortlisting for academic posts. Beattie showed that when White people were shortlisting candidates for jobs, they were ten times more likely to select two White candidates than two non-White candidates (despite the White and non-White candidates having identical CVs) and, in addition, using remote eye tracking to monitor their individual gaze fixation points, he found that those doing the shortlisting unconsciously fixated on the weaker parts of the CV of candidates from different racial backgrounds to themselves. One consequence of this selective attention, directed by the unconscious system, is that the final outcome might appear quite reasonable and might well satisfy our conscious and rational self.Beattie has argued <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> want to do anything about racism in society, then we need to understand these implicit, unconscious processes and how to combat them.

5000|$|Not {{long after}} the success of [...] "Mad Love" [...] in November 1953, Dixon {{approached}} Leonard Chess with [...] "Hoochie Coochie Man", a new song he felt was right for Waters. Chess responded, [...] "if Muddy likes it, give it to him". At the time, Waters was performing at the Club Zanzibar in Chicago. During an intermission, Dixon showed him the song. According to Dixon, Waters took to the tune immediately because it had so many familiar elements {{and he was able}} to learn enough to perform it that night. Jimmy Rogers, who was Waters' second guitarist, remembered that it took a little longer: Dixon came to the club and he would hum it to Muddy and write the lyrics out. Muddy would work them around for a while until he got it down where he could understand it and fool around with it. He would be onstage and try it out, do a few licks of it. We were building the arrangement, <b>that's</b> what <b>we</b> were <b>really</b> <b>doing.</b> On January 7, 1954, Waters entered the recording studio with his band to record the song. Considered the classic Chicago blues band, music critic Bill Janovitz described Waters' group as [...] "a who's who of bluesmen". [...] Waters sings and plays electric guitar along with Rogers, blues harmonica virtuoso Little Walter, and drummer Elgin Evans, all of whom had been performing with Waters since 1951. (Fred Below, who replaced Evans during 1954, is sometimes listed as the drummer.) Pianist Otis Spann, who joined in 1953, and Dixon, in his debut on double bass for Waters' recording session, round out the group. Two takes of the song were recorded. Although there are some moments in the alternate take when a player's timing rushes or drags perceptibly, because the band is so tight, the difference with the master is only six seconds (for a nearly three-minute song).|$|R
