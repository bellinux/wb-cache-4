5|$|For Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, {{creating}} <b>the</b> <b>version</b> {{better known}} today. In that version, transposed to D major, the laudes interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by flutes and including {{these in the}} tutti movements.

50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>version</b> was an {{ensemble}} performance while <b>the</b> second <b>version</b> put {{more emphasis on}} Lelia. The revelation that she was African American came much earlier in <b>the</b> second <b>version.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>version</b> had more of a conventional narrative but its pace was slow in sections. <b>The</b> first <b>version</b> contained a number of technical flaws such as lip-sync error. Lelia's date with Tony was greatly altered: In <b>the</b> first <b>version</b> she only talks with him but in <b>the</b> second <b>version</b> she loses her virginity to him. <b>The</b> first <b>version</b> had more scenes of Ben and his friends hanging around Times Square. Actor Anthony Ray, the son of famous director Nicholas Ray, had top billing in <b>the</b> first <b>version,</b> playing <b>the</b> part of Lelia's date Tony, but in <b>the</b> second <b>version</b> this billing was reduced to reflect his diminished screen time. His character was given greater dignity in <b>the</b> second <b>version.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{depiction}} {{between all}} of <b>the</b> <b>versions</b> graphics-wise {{is not the}} same especially on portable <b>versions.</b> <b>The</b> Microsoft Windows <b>version</b> varies by hardware and can look better compared to <b>the</b> console <b>versions.</b> <b>The</b> recommended hardware or above has a similar frame rate to <b>the</b> Xbox 360 <b>version.</b> <b>The</b> game makes heavy use of the HDRR and motion blur effects to give a more realistic feel.|$|R
50|$|True to Cassavetes' form, <b>the</b> 108-minute <b>version</b> is {{not just}} a simple edit of <b>the</b> 135-minute <b>version.</b> <b>The</b> order of several scenes has been changed, there are {{different}} edits of a few scenes, and there are a few segments unique to <b>the</b> 108-minute <b>version.</b> <b>The</b> bulk of the cutting in <b>the</b> 1978 <b>version</b> removed many of the nightclub routines that were in <b>the</b> 1976 <b>version.</b>|$|R
