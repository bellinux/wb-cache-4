50|$|As {{a mobile}} unit {{engaged in a}} call moves away from a cell site or {{formally}} known as Base transceiver station and its signal weakens, the BSC(GSM) or RNC(3G UMTS) will automatically instruct it to tune to a different frequency, one assigned to the newly entered BTS. This process is called handoff. The BSC/RNC determines when handoff should take place by analyzing measurements of radio signal strength made by the present controlling cell site and by its neighbors. The returning instructions for handoff sent during a call must use the voice channel. The data regarding the new channel are sent rapidly (in about 50 milliseconds), and the entire returning process takes only about 300 milliseconds. After handoff, if the SID on the control channel does not match the SID programmed into the phone, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> assumes that it is roaming.|$|E

50|$|The Record of the Year was {{an award}} voted by the United Kingdom public. For many {{years it was}} given in {{conjunction}} with television programmes of the same name.

For that reason it was much respected by the industry, labels, publishers and retailers. It was the only music award in the UK to be chosen by the public.

Since then it had been an online poll, administered through the Record of the Year website. In 2013, the online poll was axed, signaling the end of the award.|$|E
