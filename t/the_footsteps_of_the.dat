40|$|Long surface {{structures}} in fault regions {{are susceptible to}} serious damage by permanent ground deformations occurring during earthquakes as well as strong ground shaking. This thesis aims to develop a theoretical model to help understand and explain the behavior in earthquakes of long articulated surface structures located in earthquake-rupture zones. The earthquakes in Taiwan and Turkey in 1999 provided examples of damage to structures crossed by <b>the</b> surface ruptures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earthquakes. Among these examples, the Bolu Viaduct, a 2. 3 -km articulated structure comprising prestressed concrete girders and reinforced concrete columns, was a unique case. <b>The</b> fault rupture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1999 Duzce, Turkey earthquake crossed <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viaduct. <b>The</b> right-lateral movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fault during the earthquake changed <b>the</b> relative positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piers with respect to each other. The distance between the abutments was shortened by 2. 1 m. The change in <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure was estimated quantitatively by <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural survey data before and after earthquake. <b>The</b> investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earthquake effects on the Bolu Viaduct is performed in three major steps. First, a simple inelastic model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge is analyzed by using <b>the</b> records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earthquakes in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viaduct. The calculated response is compared with the observed damage. <b>The</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural response to the PGA and <b>the</b> PGV <b>of</b> <b>the</b> records is investigated. Second, the static inelastic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viaduct to ground distortion is calculated. Third, <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viaduct to ground distortion is evaluated by introducing pier movements assuming that they occurred in a few seconds. ...|$|R
