40|$|AbstractTumor {{necrosis}} factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (<b>TWEAK)</b> regulates apoptosis, {{proliferation and}} inflammation in renal epithelial cells and {{plays a role}} in acute kidney injury. However, there is little information on the chronic effects of <b>TWEAK.</b> We hypothesized that <b>TWEAK</b> may influence renal fibrosis and regulate kidney fibroblast biology, in part, through Ras pathway. We studied a chronic model of experimental unilateral ureteral obstruction in wild type and <b>TWEAK</b> deficient mice, and a murine model of systemic <b>TWEAK</b> overexpression. <b>TWEAK</b> actions were also explored in cultured renal and embryonic fibroblasts. <b>TWEAK</b> and <b>TWEAK</b> receptor expression was increased in the obstructed kidneys. The absence of <b>TWEAK</b> decreased early kidney tubular damage, inflammatory infiltrates and myofibroblast number. <b>TWEAK</b> deficient mice had decreased renal fibrosis 21 days after obstruction, as assessed by extracellular matrix staining. In mice without prior underlying kidney disease, systemic overexpression of <b>TWEAK</b> induced kidney inflammation and fibrosis. In cultured fibroblasts, <b>TWEAK</b> induced proliferation through activation of the Ras/ERK pathway. <b>TWEAK</b> also activated nuclear factor κB (NFκB) -dependent inflammatory chemokine production in murine renal fibroblasts. In conclusion, lack of <b>TWEAK</b> reduces renal fibrosis in a model of persistent kidney insult and overexpression of <b>TWEAK</b> led to renal fibrosis. <b>TWEAK</b> actions on renal fibroblasts may contribute to the in vivo observations, as <b>TWEAK</b> promotes inflammatory activity and proliferation in fibroblast cultures...|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} work indicated that <b>TWEAK</b> {{is associated with}} various types of cutaneous vasculitis (CV). Herein, we investigate the effects of <b>TWEAK</b> on vascular injury and adhesion molecule expression in CV mice. We showed that <b>TWEAK</b> priming in mice induced a local CV. Furthermore, <b>TWEAK</b> priming also increased the extravasation of FITC-BSA, myeloperoxidase activity and the expression of E-selectin and ICAM- 1. Conversely, <b>TWEAK</b> blockade ameliorated the LPS-induced vascular damage, leukocyte infiltrates and adhesion molecules expression in LPS-induced CV. In addition, <b>TWEAK</b> treatment of HDMECs up-regulated E-selectin and ICAM- 1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. <b>TWEAK</b> also enhanced the adhesion of PMNs to HDMECs. Finally, western blot data revealed that <b>TWEAK</b> can induce phosphorylation of p 38, JNK and ERK in HDMECs.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) {{family members}} are initially synthesized as type II transmembrane proteins, but some of these proteins are substrates for proteolytic enzymes that generate soluble cytokines with biological activity. <b>TWEAK</b> (TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis), {{a member of the}} TNF family, is a multifunctional cytokine that acts via binding to a cell surface receptor named Fn 14 (fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14). Studies conducted to date indicate that TWEAK-producing cells can co-express both membrane-anchored and soluble <b>TWEAK</b> isoforms, but there is little information on <b>TWEAK</b> proteolytic processing. Also, it is presently unclear whether membrane-anchored <b>TWEAK,</b> like soluble <b>TWEAK,</b> is biologically active. Here we show that full-length human <b>TWEAK</b> is processed intracellularly by the serine protease furin and identify <b>TWEAK</b> amino acid residues 90 – 93 as the predominant furin recognition site. In addition, we report that full-length, membrane-anchored <b>TWEAK</b> can bind the Fn 14 receptor on neighboring cells and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway.

40|$|Soluble tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) -like weak inducer of apoptosis (<b>TWEAK),</b> {{in contrast}} to membrane <b>TWEAK</b> and TNF, is only a weak activator of the classical NF-kappaB pathway. We observed that soluble <b>TWEAK</b> was regularly more potent than TNF {{with respect to the}} induction of TNF receptor associated factor 1 (TRAF 1), a NF-kappaB-controlled signaling protein involved in the regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways. TNF-induced TRAF 1 expression was efficiently blocked by inhibition of the classical NF-kappaB pathway using the IKK 2 inhibitor TPCA 1. In contrast, in some cell lines TWEAK-induced TRAF 1 production was only partly inhibited by TPCA 1. The NEDD 8 activating enzyme inhibitor MLN 4924, however, which inhibits classical and alternative NF-kappaB signaling, blocked TNF- and TWEAK-induced TRAF 1 expression. This suggests that TRAF 1 induction by soluble <b>TWEAK</b> is based on the cooperative activity of the two NF-kappaB signaling pathways. We have previously shown that oligomerization of soluble <b>TWEAK</b> results in ligand complexes with membrane TWEAK-like activity. Oligomerization of soluble <b>TWEAK</b> showed no effect on the dose response of TRAF 1 induction but potentiated the ability of soluble <b>TWEAK</b> to trigger production of the classical NF-kappaB-regulated cytokine IL 8. Transfectants expressing soluble <b>TWEAK</b> and membrane <b>TWEAK</b> showed similar induction of TRAF 1 while only the membrane <b>TWEAK</b> expressing cells robustly stimulated IL 8 production. These data indicate that soluble <b>TWEAK</b> may efficiently induce a distinct subset of the membrane TWEAK-targeted genes and argue again for a crucial role of classical NF-kappaB pathway-independent signaling in TWEAK-induced TRAF 1 expression. Other <b>TWEAK</b> targets, which can be equally well induced by soluble and membrane <b>TWEAK,</b> remain to be identified and the relevance of the ability of soluble <b>TWEAK</b> to induce such a distinct subset of membrane TWEAK-targeted genes for <b>TWEAK</b> biology will have to be clarified in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (<b>TWEAK)</b> is a cytokine of the TNF superfamily that activates the Fn 14 receptor. <b>TWEAK</b> may regulate cell proliferation, cell death, cell differentiation, and inflammation. <b>TWEAK</b> and Fn 14 are constitutively {{present in}} the kidney. Sources of <b>TWEAK</b> and Fn 14 include intrinsic renal cells and infiltrating leukocytes.

40|$|Background: Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) -like weak inducer of apoptosis (<b>TWEAK)</b> is {{a proinflammatory}} cytokine {{belonging to the}} TNF super family. <b>TWEAK</b> produces a variety of cellular responses through the binding to fibroblast growth factor inducible 14 (Fn 14), a member of TNF receptor superfamily. Although Fn 14 lacks a death domain, <b>TWEAK</b> {{has been found to}} induce apoptosis in some cell types by perturbing the activity of certain pathways such as TNF-receptor signaling. <b>TWEAK</b> is also known to regulate proliferation and differentiation of myogenic cells. We have previously reported that the TWEAK-Fn 14 system causes skeletal muscle wasting both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, {{it has been reported that}} <b>TWEAK</b> is a mediator of atrophy in disuse conditions such as denervation. However, it remains unknown whether <b>TWEAK</b> can affect the viability of muscle cells. Hypothesis: <b>TWEAK</b> induces oxidative stress and cell death in myotube cultures. Methods: We used primary myogenic cells and biochemical assays to study the effects of recombinant <b>TWEAK</b> protein on the survival of cultured mouse primary myotubes. Results: Our results demonstrate that <b>TWEAK</b> reduces myotube viability in a dose-dependent manner evident by increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in culture supernatants. Furthermore, we have found that the levels of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and cleaved (activated) caspase- 3 are increased upon treatment with <b>TWEAK.</b> <b>TWEAK</b> also induces oxidative stress in cultured myotubes. A general antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), partially blocked TWEAK-induced cytotoxicity in cultured myotubes. Conclusions: Our results provide initial evidence that in addition to causing atrophy, <b>TWEAK</b> can also diminish skeletal muscle mass by inducing oxidative stress, which diminishes the survival of myofibers in catabolic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Tumour {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) -like weak inducer of apoptosis (<b>TWEAK),</b> {{a member}} of the TNF family, is a multi-functional cytokine that regulates cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, inflammation and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated <b>TWEAK</b> expression in periodontally diseased tissues and the effect of <b>TWEAK</b> on human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that <b>TWEAK</b> and the <b>TWEAK</b> receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn 14), mRNA and protein were expressed in periodontally diseased tissues. HGF expressed Fn 14 and produced interleukin (IL) - 8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production upon <b>TWEAK</b> stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. The IL- 8 and VEGF production induced by <b>TWEAK</b> was augmented synergistically by simultaneous stimulation with transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 or IL- 1 β. IL- 1 β and TGF-β 1 enhanced Fn 14 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, <b>TWEAK</b> induced intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) expression on HGF in a dose-dependent manner. The ICAM- 1 expression induced by <b>TWEAK</b> was augmented by TGF-β 1. On the other hand, the TWEAK-induced VCAM- 1 expression was inhibited by TGF-β 1. Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) inhibitor inhibit both ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 expression induced by <b>TWEAK.</b> However, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor enhanced only VCAM- 1 expression on HGF. These results suggest that <b>TWEAK</b> may be involved in the pathophysiology of periodontal disease.

40|$|<b>TWEAK</b> is a {{recently}} cloned novel {{member of the}} TNF ligand family. Here we show that soluble <b>TWEAK</b> is sufficient to induce apoptosis in Kym- 1 cells within 18 h. TWEAK-induced apoptosis is indirect and is mediated by the interaction of endogenous TNF and TNF receptor (TNFR) 1, as each TNFR 1 -Fc, neutralizing TNF-specific antibodies and TNFR 1 -specific Fab fragments efficiently antagonize cell death induction. In addition to this indirect mode of action, co-stimulation of Kym- 1 cells with <b>TWEAK</b> enhances TNFR 1 -mediated cell death induction. In contrast to TNF, <b>TWEAK</b> does only modestly activate NF-kappaB or c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in Kym- 1 cells. Although <b>TWEAK</b> binding to Kym- 1 cells is easily detectable by flow cytometric analysis, we found neither evidence for expression of the recently identified <b>TWEAK</b> receptor Apo 3 /TRAMP/wsl/DR 3 /LARD, nor indications for direct interactions of <b>TWEAK</b> with TNFR. Together, these characteristics of TWEAK-induced signaling in Kym- 1 cells argue {{for the existence of}} an additional, still undefined non-death domain-containing <b>TWEAK</b> receptor in Kym- 1 cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{members of}} the tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) family play pivotal roles in the regulation of the immune system.

Like many {{members of the}} TNF family, <b>TWEAK</b> was able to induce interleukin- 8 synthesis in a number of cell lines. The human adenocarcinoma cell line, HT 29, underwent apoptosis in the presence of both <b>TWEAK</b> and interferon-gamma. Thus, <b>TWEAK</b> resembles many other TNF ligands in the capacity to induce cell death; however, the fact that TWEAK-sensitive cells are relatively rare suggests that <b>TWEAK</b> along with lymphotoxins alpha/beta and possibly CD 30 L trigger death via a weaker, nondeath domain-dependent mechanism...|$|R

We conclude that the cytokine <b>TWEAK</b> may play an important role in ischemia-induced brain injury and that inhibition of <b>TWEAK</b> expression or function in the brain may represent a novel neuroprotective strategy to treat ischemic stroke...|$|R
