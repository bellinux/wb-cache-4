50|$|The {{consumer}} {{decision-making process}} is highly influenced by brand <b>touch-points.</b> In saying this, <b>touch-points</b> influence the pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase {{stages of the}} decision making process. This {{is because they are}} constantly in contact with the consumer by way of consumer experiences with a brand or service, advertising (all forms), contact with employees, social media and many other ways. Each stage of the decision making process is also an opportunity for the brand to influence the consumer’s decisions, {{regardless of whether or not}} the consumer has made a decision to purchase.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} ways in which <b>touch-points</b> can {{influence}} the pre-purchase stage of the consumer’s decision making process. The pre-purchase stage can be said {{to be one of the}} most important stages of the consumer decision making process as it is where the consumer recognizes that they have a need for a product or a service. It is at this point of realization that pre-purchase <b>touch-points</b> are crucial, because of the fact that this is the stage where the consumer actively searches for information about a certain product. Such a search for information can be conducted via advertising, social media, internet search, word-of-mouth and family and friends’ experiences etc. It is important that during this stage, in order for consumers to consider purchasing from a brand, that they create relevant <b>touch-points</b> that increase brand appeal. To further reiterate such a statement, in the present day, consumers have access to multiple electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and television and are sometimes connected to all such devices simultaneously. As a result, brands may not acquire the desired amount of exposure because of the consumer’s tendency to frequently switch from one device to another and from one task to another task. Therefore, brands must create short and engaging advertisements in order to capture the attention of the consumer during the pre-purchase stage of his or her decision making process. Such action will ensure that the consumer will be able to relate to a brand and will instil the belief that the brand has their interests at heart. Although brands or companies cannot precisely manage the <b>touch-points</b> at the pre-purchase stage to work in their favour, they can only do so much as to make sure that they monitor the channels by which consumers search for product/service information to make sure they are readily accessible.|$|E

40|$|Ever-shrinking {{mobile device}} screens have made {{efficient}} text entry a substantial challenge. Many stylus-based {{methods have been}} proposed to tackle this problem, but most require {{a significant amount of}} already limited screen space. We present a novel stylus-based text entry method called <b>Touch-Point,</b> which does not require additional screen real estate or the use of complex gestures. The method features a variable-speed scrolling character set operated by the stylus. Characters are invoked by placing the stylus anywhere on a display, thereby allowing text entry in a space as small as a single character. In addition to the advantages <b>Touch-Point</b> can provide for smallscreen devices, it can also be modified for use by disabled users who have limited motor capability and cannot operate a standard keyboard. Initial testing of <b>Touch-Point</b> against a gesture-based PDA method shows it to be a promising alternative to current stylus-based text entry methods. ...|$|R

50|$|Touchpoints for the ‘purchase’ {{stage of}} the {{decision}} making process are somewhat more direct, whereby the consumer evaluates the information they searched for in the pre-purchase stage. Evaluation in this sense is when the consumer has selected a set of brands from their information search and compares them to one another. At this point of the consumer’s decision making process, brand <b>touch-points</b> become {{the difference between a}} decision to buy or a decision not to buy. <b>Touch-points</b> during the purchase stage, as mentioned earlier, are more direct. The reason is that <b>touch-points</b> during the purchase stage can be found in store (or office if looking for a service) as store layout, through the sales team and staff, the point of sale and many other elements. The store layout is a whole touch-point in itself as it includes all types of atmospherics that help influence consumers. Such atmospherics involve using the senses to relate to consumers on a more personal level through the use of store scents, visual appearance, music and the ability to touch products. This can be further explained using the concept of ‘The Consumer’s Culture’ where the psychological core of the consumer determines the effectiveness of brand <b>touch-points</b> and influence. When consumers are exposed to such elements of a brand, it is at that point where they make the decision to buy or even the decision not to buy. To reduce the chance of having the consumer turn away from buying a particular brand, {{there is a need to}} ensure that staff are properly trained in product knowledge and also in interpersonal skills. The reason for this is because the staff touchpoints are a physical and human representation of what brands are all about. Therefore, it is important to note that in order for the customer to have a sense of trust in the brand or the company, the staff need to build rapport with the customer to retain such trust. This can further be established at the point of sale where the customer purchases a product and feels that the product they have chosen may serve their needs.|$|E

40|$|Service {{delivery}} {{is critical to}} the customer’s perception of value and is core to the success of an organisation. Excellent customer service incorporates the critical aspects of: expedient service delivery; open and honest communication; individual, personalised service; engendering customer loyalty; problem-solving; under-promising and over-delivering; meeting and exceeding expectations; efficient use of infrastructure, systems and procedures to facilitate efficient operations and, in particular, effective use of knowledge management with a focus on customer lifecycle care (Kingstone, 2004, 2005; Zarbock, 2006). Best-practice organisations now use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programmes that are customer-centric based in order to ensure excellent customer service delivery. Recently, organisations such as Tesco and Nordstrom have adopted customer-centric CRM successfully, providing concrete proof that this CRM model is sustainable and that it produces the highly lucrative win-win benefits which organisations seek (Beasty, 2005; Hallberg, 2001 : 19; Gratehouse, 2002; Rowe, 2002). 5 Glossary • Continuous improvement: an approach to improving performance which assumes more and smaller incremental improvement steps (Pycraft, Singh, Phihlela, Slack, Chambers, Harland, Harrison, & Johnston, 2002); • Connectivity: the ability to communicate with another system or piece of hardware or software, or with an internet site (Encarta World English Dictionary); • Customer-centric: the use of every <b>touch-point</b> to stimulate interest, close business, satisfy a need or demonstrate commitment to the customer relationship (Gianforte, 2005); • Customer expectations: the customer's perception of the quality of service (LeBoeuf, 1991) and value (Thompson, 2004); • Customer Experience Management: managing customer interactions to build brand equity and long-term profitability (Thompson, 2006 a); • Customer lifecycle care: to ensure that every <b>touch-point</b> fulfils its value-potential, regardless of whether the interaction happens in marketing, sales or customer service (Gianforte, 2005); • Customer loyalty: customer’s attitudes and behaviour relating to their perception of value at every <b>touch-point</b> where they feel welcome, important and valued (Thompson, 2004); • Customer Relationshi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{contact center}} is a {{potentially}} strategic <b>touch-point</b> between consumers and organizations, but often the service obtained leaves much to be desired. Effective use of the information and technology in our digital society appears to have many inhibitors – organizational, technological and human. This study analyses some 2150 incidents regarding telecommunications service providers reported by customers to a South African consumer portal. Their main concerns were information related issues: inadequate communication channel integration, limited functional integration and customer information inaccuracies. System issues comprised system faults, system limitations and system unavailability. Compounding this in fewer cases were non-information service-related issues: incompetent or rude staff and lengthy delays. Although telecommunications products and contact center technology may be advanced examples of the digital age, unless there is sound management, organization and motivation, customers may not receive the service they expect.

40|$|The coordinated sorting of ion {{channels}} to specific plasma membrane domains {{is necessary for}} excitable cell physiology. KATP channels, assembled from pore-forming (Kir 6. x) and regulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits, are critical electrical transducers of the metabolic state of excitable tissues, including skeletal and smooth muscle, heart, brain, kidney, and pancreas. Here we show that the C-terminal domain of Kir 6. 2 contains a motif conferring membrane targeting in primary excitable cells. Kir 6. 2 lacking this motif displays aberrant channel targeting due to loss of association with the membrane adapter ankyrin-B (AnkB). Moreover, we demonstrate that this Kir 6. 2 C-terminal AnkB-binding motif (ABM) serves a dual role in KATP channel trafficking and membrane metabolic regulation and dysfunction in these pathways results in human excitable cell disease. Thus, the KATP channel ABM serves as a previously unrecognized bifunctional <b>touch-point</b> for grading KATP channel gating and membrane targeting and may play {{a fundamental role in}} controlling excitable cell metabolic regulation...|$|R
