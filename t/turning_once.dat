5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering or leaving. Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took Mars in pursuit, chasing the French squadron all through the night and into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was in danger of being captured, Lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, <b>turning</b> <b>once</b> more and retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E
5|$|De Montfort {{was unable}} to {{consolidate}} his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country. In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England {{with the support of}} Louis, while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army. Edward pursued de Montfort's forces through the Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then <b>turning</b> <b>once</b> more on the rebel leader himself. De Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, {{was unable to}} retreat and the Battle of Evesham ensued. Edward was triumphant and de Montfort's corpse was mutilated by the victors; Henry, who was wearing borrowed armour, was almost killed by Edward's forces during the fighting before they recognised the King and escorted him to safety. In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266. The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, holed up in the Isle of Ely, surrendered in July 1267, marking the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{parliament}} bought temporary calm but opposition grew once more, {{particularly as}} Montfort and his immediate family began to amass a huge personal fortune. Prince Edward escaped his captors in May {{and formed a}} new army, resulting in a fresh outbreak of civil war. Edward pursued Monfort's forces through the Welsh Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then <b>turning</b> <b>once</b> more on the rebel leader himself. Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, was unable to retreat and the Battle of Evesham ensued. Edward was triumphant and Montfort's corpse was mutilated by the victors. In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266. The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, holed up on the Isle of Ely, surrendered in July 1267, marking {{the end of the}} war.|$|E

50|$|The Great wheel <b>turns</b> <b>once</b> in 3600 seconds (1 hour), so {{the verge}} escape wheel <b>turns</b> <b>once</b> in 360 seconds. One full foliot swing thus takes 8 seconds, or 4 seconds per half swing.|$|R

2500|$|The masterful {{strategy}} {{adopted by}} William O'Brien of bringing about agreement on land purchase between tenants and landlords under the Act, may almost {{be said to}} have been too great a success as it resulted in a rush of landlords to sell and of tenants to buy. Dillon, the deputy party leader, disfavoured the Act because he opposed any negotiations with landlords, Michael Davitt objected to peasant proprietorship, demanding land nationalisation. Together with Thomas Sexton editor of the party's Freeman's Journal, they campaigned against O’Brien, ferociously attacking him for putting Land Purchase and Conciliation before Home Rule. O'Brien's appeal to Redmond to suppress their opposition went unheeded. After stating that he was making no headway with his policy, he resigned his parliamentary seat in November 1903. It was a serious setback for the party, at the same time <b>turning</b> <b>once</b> intimate friends into mortal enemies. [...] O'Brien subsequently engaged with the Irish Reform Association, equally condemned by his opponents.|$|E
