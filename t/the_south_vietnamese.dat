5|$|Unlike their adversaries, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> {{military}} suffered {{heavily in}} their attempts to recapture the village of Bình Giã and secure the surrounding areas. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> and their American allies lost the total of about 201 personnel killed in action, 192 wounded and 68 missing. In just four days of fighting, two of South Vietnam's elite Ranger companies were destroyed and several others suffered heavy losses, while the 4th Marine Battalion was rendered ineffective as a fighting force. At that stage of the war, Bình Giã was the worst defeat experienced by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese.</b> Despite their losses, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> army considered the battle as their victory and erected a monument {{at the site of the}} battle to acknowledge the sacrifices of the soldiers who had fallen to retake Bình Giã.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Buddhist crisis began, {{the leaders}} of the Buddhist protests {{arranged}} Đức's self-immolation.|$|E
5|$|Across the Central Highlands of Vietnam, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> {{military}} {{enjoyed a}} numerical superiority of about 78,300 soldiers against North Vietnam’s 65,141 soldiers. However, within {{the vicinity of}} Ban Me Thuot, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> were actually outnumbered by a ratio of 5:1. The North Vietnamese had more tanks, armoured vehicles, and heavy artillery, with a ratio of about 2:1. North Vietnamese General Van Tien Dung believed his tank and artillery units in the Central Highlands were the key factors that guaranteed a quick victory, because South Vietnam simply lacked the capability to withstand such large numbers of heavy weaponry.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh {{gained control}} of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> {{government}} after General Dương Văn Minh was overthrown in a military coup. Although General Khánh was able {{to gain control of}} the military junta, he failed to garner support from the civilian population when he implemented various laws which limited the freedoms of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> people. He then had a falling-out with the Catholic faction within his own government, when he became increasingly reliant on the Buddhist movement to hold on to power. Consequently, on February 20, 1965, General Khánh was ousted from power and was forced to leave South Vietnam forever. The political instability in Saigon gave North Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi an opportunity to step up their military campaign in the south. They believed <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> government was able to survive because it still had a strong military to combat the growing influence of the Viet Cong. With the summer campaign of 1965, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces aimed to inflict significant losses on <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> military. In Phước Long Province, the Communist summer offensive culminated in the Đồng Xoài campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to halt the North Vietnamese assault, Luat ordered two squadrons of M-113 {{armoured}} personnel carriers to confront the enemy at Nga Sau, but {{they were forced to}} turn back by tanks from the North Vietnamese 3rd Tank Battalion, 273rd Armoured Regiment. At around 5:30pm, a South Vietnamese ranger battalion was forced to abandon the nearby installation at Dac Lac after continuous assaults from the 95B Regiment. In the northeast, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 9th Ranger Battalion held off the North Vietnamese 95B Regiment until they abandoned their positions on the next day. In the western outskirts of Ban Me Thuot, eight A-37 Dragonfly bombers from <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 6th Air Force Division inflicted light casualties on the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment, but failed to stop their enemies’ momentum. In the southwest, Quang tried to retake Mai Hac De by mobilising his reserve units with tactical air support. Meanwhile, in the south-eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, the North Vietnamese 149th Regiment defeated <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 53rd Infantry Regiment, after they sustained heavy casualties from repeated air attacks from A-37 bombers.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{it was the}} {{ordinary}} South Vietnamese soldiers and their families who paid the ultimate price, as North Vietnamese artillery heavily destroyed much of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> military convoy on Route 7.|$|E

5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence required that <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the demilitarized zone, affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1964, the Viet Cong {{commenced}} {{a series}} of large-scale military operations against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), as ordered by the North Vietnamese government. As part of their Winter-Spring Offensive, the Viet Cong unleashed its newly created 9th Division against <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> forces at Bình Giã, fighting a large set-piece battle for the first time. Over a period of four days, the Viet Cong 9th Division held its ground and mauled the best units <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> army could send against them, only breaking after intense attack by U.S. bombers.|$|E
5|$|Although American {{officials}} {{at the highest levels}} of the intelligence community (e.g. CIA Director William Colby) were certain that <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> government would collapse, everyone in the U.S. government underestimated the speed of the North Vietnamese advance during the 1975 Spring Offensive and how quickly South Vietnam's Army would collapse.|$|E

5|$|For North Vietnamese field {{commanders of}} the Tay Nguyen Front, the {{withdrawal}} of South Vietnamese military forces from II Corps Tactical Zone came as a surprise, {{but it was not}} totally unexpected. What surprised the North Vietnamese the most was the speed of the withdrawal. Indeed, {{it was not until the}} evening of March 15, when the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron reached Cheo Reo, that the North Vietnamese began to receive information of Saigon’s decision to abandon the Central Highlands. At 8pm on March 16, the Tay Nguyen Front Command issued the first orders to pursue <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese.</b> The North Vietnamese 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment, part of the 320A Infantry Division, was the first unit to be mobilised to intercept <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> column south of Cheo Reo district. Subsequently, the entire North Vietnamese 320A Infantry Division was sent to destroy <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> column along Route 7, with the 2nd Tank Battalion of the 273rd Armoured Regiment, the 675th Regiment, and the 593rd Anti-Aircraft Regiment in support. By the early hours of March 17, tanks from the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron and the 6th Ranger Battalion clashed with the North Vietnamese 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment at Tuna Pass, about 4kilometres away from the district of Cheo Reo.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Hanoi {{established}} the 559th Transportation Group {{under the command}} of Colonel (later General) Võ Bẩm to improve and maintain a transportation system to supply the NLF uprising against <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> government. Originally, the North Vietnamese effort concentrated on infiltration across and immediately below the Demilitarized Zone that separated the two Vietnams.|$|E
5|$|In the Phước Bình sub-sector, the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment {{were able}} to overrun South Vietnamese {{government}} positions within 25 minutes, and they claimed to have killed 115 South Vietnamese soldiers in the process At 9am on May 11, the ARVN 34th Ranger Battalion was airlifted into a small town located about 14 kilometres away from Phước Bình in the south-east. As the ARVN 34th Ranger Battalion marched upward towards Phước Bình, the Viet Cong 272nd and 273rd Regiment was ordered to destroy <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Rangers. However, {{by the time the}} 272nd Regiment arrived at <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> staging area, the Rangers had already pulled out and successfully recaptured Phước Bình. Meanwhile, on May 15, the Viet Cong 274th Regiment defeated two South Vietnamese Regional Force companies along Route 20, and destroyed 20 vehicles in the process.|$|E
50|$|Trần Văn Bảy was a Private First Class of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam {{and is one}} of {{only two}} <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese,</b> and <b>the</b> only <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Army member, to receive the Navy Cross for actions on February 19, 1967 during the Vietnam War (the other being Nguyễn Văn Kiệt).|$|R
25|$|The next day, Chinese {{aircraft}} from Hainan {{bombed the}} three islands, and an amphibious landing was made. <b>The</b> outnumbered <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> marine garrison {{on the islands}} was forced to surrender, and the damaged navy ships retreated to Đà Nẵng.|$|R
50|$|The US {{military}} presence {{became an issue}} following collapse of the Khmer Republic of Marshall Lon Nol, the subsequent fall of Phnom Penh; and <b>the</b> 1975 <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> collapse, when many aircraft provided by the US, fled to U-Tapao.|$|R
5|$|Just {{before the}} ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion {{landed on the}} battlefield, the Viet Cong had intercepted a radio {{conversation}} between the aforementioned unit and the 52nd Ranger Battalion in the district centre; several months earlier the 7th Airborne Battalion {{was involved in the}} battle at Bình Giã, so they vowed to avenge the loss of their comrades. Thus, from the soccer field, the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion marched up to Thuận Lợi, against only light opposition. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> paratroopers arrived at the area where the first group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was dropped off and they collected seven survivors and 55 bodies. In the afternoon, as elements of the 7th Airborne Battalion moved through the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation to search for remnants of the second group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment started attacking <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> paratroopers in a manner which had characterised earlier ambushes. Taking advantage of the poor weather conditions that had limited U.S. air strikes, as well as their numerical superiority, the Viet Cong broke <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> formation into small groups and destroyed many of them. On the next day, the strength of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion was reduced from 470 to just 159 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 1975, the Tin-Ngai Campaign {{concluded}} with North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces exercising full {{control over the}} provinces of Quảng Tin and Quảng Ngãi, leaving Da Nang as the only major city in I Corps still held by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Relations {{with the}} former state of South Vietnam were {{established}} when South Vietnam recognised the Federation of Malaya's independence on 1957. Since then, Malaya was providing aid to <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> regime in its fight against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army.|$|E
50|$|The next day, Chinese {{aircraft}} from Hainan {{bombed the}} three islands, and an amphibious landing was made. <b>The</b> outnumbered <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> marine garrison {{on the islands}} was forced to surrender, and the damaged navy ships retreated to Đà Nẵng.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders never {{realized}} that Hanoi had given its field commanders the full flexibility {{to respond to}} the changing circumstances on the battlefield and had supplied North Vietnamese units with weaponry that was required to achieve their objectives. Ultimately, <b>the</b> average <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers would {{have to pay for the}} miscalculation of their commanders.|$|R
5|$|Norris readily {{supported}} {{the nomination of}} Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet for the Navy Cross, the highest award that the navy can give to a foreign national. Nguyen was <b>the</b> only <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Naval member awarded the Navy Cross during the Vietnam War, and {{one of only two}} <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> to receive <b>the</b> award.|$|R
5|$|Serong was {{appointed}} to command the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) in 1962. He was later seconded to the Americans and was senior advisor to <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Police Field Force between 1965 and 1968. Leaving the Army in 1968, he remained in Vietnam as a security and intelligence adviser to <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> government, as well as working for the Rand organisation, Hudson Institute and other corporations, and consulting to the Pentagon and several US presidents. He continued to serve in Vietnam until the fall of Saigon in 1975. He was considered a world authority on counter-insurgency warfare and wrote widely on the subject. In later life he maintained an interest in Australian defence issues and was at times a controversial figure due to his support for several citizens' militia groups, conspiracy theories and right-wing political causes. He died in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses {{that allowed them to}} purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to buy US goods, while the Saigon government kept <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts of money into the economy in an indirect way, through material goods, so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{were pleased}} by the coup, as <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> {{military}} was wasting its resources and energy on infighting. They did not make any attacks in the days immediately after the coup as they were worried their doing so might galvanize the divided society into action against a common cause.|$|E
50|$|Phạm Phú Quốc (1935-1965) was a French-trained <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> flying ace and {{lieutenant}} in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, best known for being one of two mutinous pilots involved in <b>the</b> 1962 <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Presidential Palace bombing on February 27, 1962, which aimed to assassinate President Ngô Đình Diệm and his immediate family, who were his political advisers.|$|R
500|$|While <b>the</b> main <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> column stalled at A Loui {{for three}} weeks and the Ranger and Airborne {{elements}} were fighting for their lives, President Thieu and General Lãm decided to launch a face-saving airborne assault on Tchepone itself. Although American leaders and news correspondents had focused on the town as one of Lam Son 719s main objectives, the PAVN logistical network actually bypassed the ruined town to <b>the</b> west. If <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> forces could at least occupy Tchepone, however, Thieu would have a political excuse for declaring [...] "victory" [...] and withdrawing his forces to South Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|During the Vietnam War, {{when the}} {{province}} was <b>the</b> <b>South's</b> border with North Vietnam, it suffered a major {{attack in the}} January 1968 Tet Offensive and it was <b>the</b> only <b>South</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> provincial capital to be captured by the North Vietnamese forces for a limited period in the 1972 Offensive.|$|R
