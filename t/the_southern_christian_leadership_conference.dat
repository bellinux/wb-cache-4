25|$|Connor {{enforced}} legal {{racial segregation}} and denied civil rights to black citizens, especially during <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference's Birmingham campaign of 1963.

These tactics to continue white supremacy were covered by national media and broadcast on national television, horrifying much of the nation. The outrages served as catalysts for major social and legal change in <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> United States and contributed to passage by the United States Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., {{leader of}} <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Council (SCLC), wrote the Introduction {{for the second}} edition of Huie's Three Lives for Mississippi.

It relates the story of an atrocity committed on our doorstep." [...] Subsequent editions of the work include an [...] "Afterword" [...] by Juan Williams. In 1970, Huie published He Slew the Dreamer, an account of the Memphis assassination of King, for which he had interviewed assassin James Earl Ray.|$|R
25|$|New {{organizations}} such as <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) rose up with different approaches to activism. These newer groups relied on direct action and mass mobilization to advance the rights of African Americans, rather than litigation and legislation. Roy Wilkins, NAACP's executive director, clashed repeatedly with Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders over questions of strategy and leadership within the movement.|$|E
25|$|With {{civil rights}} {{activity}} blocked by Judge Hare's injunction, Frederick Douglas Reese requested {{the assistance of}} King and <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> (SCLC).

2500|$|A century later, Martin Luther King, Jr. paraphrased {{these words}} in a {{prepared}} statement he read in 1956 following {{the conclusion of the}} Montgomery bus boycott.

5000|$|The {{rest of the}} {{convention}} week violence followed the pattern set Sunday night. Protestors were joined on 28 August by the Poor People's Campaign, now led by <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference's Ralph Abernathy. This group had a permit and was split off from other demonstrators before being allowed to proceed to the amphitheater. The hard line taken by the City was also seen on {{the convention}} floor itself. In 1968, Terry <b>Southern</b> described <b>the</b> convention hall as [...] "exactly like approaching a military installation; barbed-wire, checkpoints, the whole bit". Inside the convention, journalists such as Mike Wallace and Dan Rather were roughed up by security; both these events were broadcast live on television.|$|R
25|$|The Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) was a {{civil rights}} {{organization}} in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, which coordinated boycotts and sponsored federal lawsuits aimed at dismantling segregation in Birmingham and Alabama during the Civil Rights Movement.

The ACMHR's crowning moment came during the pivotal Birmingham Campaign which it coordinated along with <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> during the Spring of 1963.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 {{march was}} an {{important}} part of the rapidly expanding Civil Rights Movement, which involved demonstrations and nonviolent direct action across the United States. 1963 also marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln. Members of The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> put aside their differences and came together for the march. Many whites and blacks also came together in the urgency for change in the nation.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Rustin and King began organizing <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>Conference</b> (SCLC). Many African-American {{leaders were}} concerned that Rustin's sexual orientation and past Communist membership would undermine support for the civil rights movement. U.S. Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., {{who was a member}} of the SCLC's board, forced Rustin's resignation from the SCLC in 1960 by threatening to discuss Rustin's morals charge in Congress. Although Rustin was open about his sexual orientation and his conviction was a matter of public record, the events had not been discussed widely beyond the civil rights leadership.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} winter of 1968, the hospital's nonprofessional workers, led by Naomi White, {{contacted}} <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Council (SCLC) for assistance. [...] The SCLC asked Local 1199 - which had extensive {{links with the}} civil rights movement - to help the workers form a union, which it did. The new union was known as Local 1199B. Mary Moultrie was elected the local's first president, and she requested that Medical College Hospital recognize the union in February 1969. Medical College Hospital president Dr. William McCord, a native of South Africa, agreed to meet with the union leadership to discuss their grievances. But when union representatives arrived at his office, McCord was absent. The workers staged an impromptu protest, and the administration fired 12 of them.|$|R

Operating from 1869 to 1940, its campus, of which only the 1935 Dorchester Academy Boys' Dormitory survives, was the primary site of <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference's Citizen Education Program. This program, ran here from 1961 to 1970, worked toward {{attaining}} equality for blacks in the American South by teaching them their rights and helping them acquire the knowledge necessary to become registered voters by passing the required test. [...] The dormitory building was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2006 for its later role in the American Civil Rights movement, and for its association with activist Septima Poinsette Clark, who oversaw the education program.

2500|$|The {{imprecision}} of {{the targeting}} {{is demonstrated by}} {{the inability of the}} Bureau to define the subjects of the programs. The Black Nationalist program, according to its supervisor, included [...] "a great number of organizations that you might not today characterize as black nationalist but which were in fact primarily black." [...] Thus, <b>the</b> nonviolent <b>Southern</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Leadership</b> Conference was labeled as a Black Nationalist-"Hate Group." ...|$|R
