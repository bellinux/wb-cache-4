5|$|As {{with many}} English gardens, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> {{at its best}} in May and June, when the magnolias are in bloom and luxurious plants, such as peonies and alliums, are flowering. An ongoing {{initiative}} is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer. There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of agapanthus, crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} modest Coronet of Frederick {{was made in}} 1728 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of GeorgeII. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by CharlesII which states that the heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear a coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by a ball and cross. The single arch denotes that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal children, whose coronets have no arches. Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion {{in front of him}} when he took his seat in the House of Lords. It was used by his son, GeorgeIII, then his son, GeorgeIV, and last used by EdwardVII when he was Prince of Wales. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future GeorgeV, to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. After he became king in 1936, EdwardVIII abdicated later the same year and, as the Duke of Windsor, went into exile in France, taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad until his death in 1972. In its absence, another coronet had to be made for the investiture of Prince Charles in 1969. Unlike the defunct coronets, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> {{not a part of the}} Crown Jewels but the Honours of the Principality of Wales.|$|E

25|$|As a first example, {{consider}} the six vectors in 2-dimensional Euclidean space, R2, {{as shown in}} the image at the right; call them roots. These vectors span the whole space. If you {{consider the}} line perpendicular to any root, say β, then the reflection of R2 in that line sends any other root, say α, to another root. Moreover, the root to which it is sent equals α + nβ, where n is an integer (in this case, n equals 1). These six vectors satisfy the following definition, and therefore they form a root system; <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> known as A2.|$|E
