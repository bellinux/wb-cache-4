His prosecutors, Holder said, had “constructed a case that uses materials and evidence that does not derive from the techniques that were controversial,” which would “maximize our chances for success.” It was a driving concern to Holder that the case not rest on torture. “It’s a statement about what this Administration is about,” he said. “It’s a statement about this Attorney General.

5000|$|On April 20, 2008 the Times of India {{reported}} that Blackwill {{said that the}} next US President may not push the nuclear deal with India because he {{will not have the}} same sunk costs in the agreement as President Bush. [...] "If I may be characteristically blunt, the next American president will not have the same sunk costs in the US-India civil nuclear agreement <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>president</b> (George W Bush) and the top of the administration has," [...] Blackwill said. [...] "India will pay a substantial price in its future energy policy, and its lack of civil nuclear assistance from the outside world." [...] Blackwill added that the next US President would not go back to lecturing India about its nuclear program. [...] "They (Indians) did not have much tolerance before, and they have none now. That would be a substantial irritant in the relationship if it were to occur," [...] said Blackwill.|$|E
5000|$|Rangel {{has been}} long been {{opposed to the}} all-volunteer army and {{repeatedly}} called {{for the government to}} bring back the draft (military conscription). In 2003, Rangel said a draft would make the military more representative of the American public at large, that [...] "the poor, black and brown shouldn’t be the only Americans fighting and dying in Iraq", and that [...] "Fairness dictates that {{the sons and daughters of}} the white middle and upper classes share the burden of war". During 2006, Rangel said that no soldier would be fighting in Iraq if they had decent career possibilities and stated that:There's no question in my mind <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>president</b> and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way.|$|E
5000|$|Rep. Rangel {{argued that}} the bill was {{necessary}} since {{in the case of}} a mandatory draft members of the U.S. Congress would be much less likely to authorize an unnecessary war if they knew that their own children and family members might be sent to fight it. He was quoted as saying: [...] "There’s no question in my mind <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>president</b> and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm’s way". Rangel also argued that bringing back the draft would remedy the social disparity of the burden of military service falling disproportionately on the poor and the minorities. After the Democratic victories in the November 2007 congressional elections, Rangel repeated his call for re-introduction of the draft and for moving forward on the bill, and a more active public discussion of the proposal followed. Most of the reaction in the media, Congress and by the public was negative, although occasional support for the idea was expressed as well. The military leadership expressed opposition to the idea. Many conservative critics charged that the bill on re-introducing the draft was simply a political maneuver by Rangel aimed to underscore the unpopularity of the Iraq War. The debate was largely over soon after the incoming Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that she was not interested in advancing the bill to reintroduce the draft.|$|E
40|$|<b>This</b> thesis {{examines}} <b>President</b> Barack Obama’s address {{given on}} September 9, 2009 entitled “Remarks by the President to a Joint Session of Congress on Health Care. ” In {{order to address}} various situational and contextual elements such as legislative ambiguity, national expense, bureaucratic intrusion, abortion, euthanasia and illegal immigration, President Obama opportunely enters the conversation {{at a particular time}} so as to benefit his agenda of passing health care reform. Revolving around the notion of kairotic strategema, which includes the understating of deliberative address as well as the possession of kairos and phronesis, I assert <b>that</b> <b>this</b> aids <b>President</b> Obama in being able to strategically deliver a crucial address while influencing both the American public and Congress first toward acceptance and then toward the passing of health care reform...|$|R

Thomas Hayes writes <b>that</b> <b>this</b> move is <b>President</b> Obama’s latest effort to address inequality in America, an effort which has met with some success, despite opposition from a polarized Congress. Looking ahead to the general election, he comments that while Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would be very likely to continue Obama’s legacy with similar policy proposals geared towards tackling inequality, most of Donald Trump’s policies would make inequality worse...|$|R

40|$|Presidential policy czars {{have been}} an {{important}} and powerful component of President Barack Obama’s approach to management and leadership {{in the first part}} of his time in office. By using czars, the President has been able to demonstrate the importance of policy issues, both to his own agenda and to the broader political system. In this chapter, we find that performance outcomes for these czars have been a mixed bag, with as many stories of success to report as tales of frustration and failure. As such, we posit that the cost of czars, in political and organizational terms, has outweighed the benefits they have brought to the Obama Administration. Thus, we conclude that the rhetorical and institutional resistance to czars has increased to a point where it seems no longer pragmatic to utilize them, at least in the high-profile manner <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>president</b> and several of his predecessors have in recent decades...|$|E

50|$|The delayed {{nomination}} {{became the}} longest period on record {{that the agency}} was without a leader.

Republicans lost the presidential election {{and they have to}} realize <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the <b>president’s</b> choice of nominee. They can go after the president, but Gina McCarthy should get an up-and-down vote.” On July 18, 2013, the Senate confirmed McCarthy as the 13th Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by a vote of 59-40, largely along party lines. On September 11, 2015, 26 U.S. representatives introduced a resolution impeaching McCarthy. It was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and died.|$|R

2500|$|The {{dismissal}} of Nene caused a public outcry and a strongly negative reaction by international markets causing the South African Rand to lose 10% {{of its value}} and the withdrawal of an estimated R180 billion from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in the two days following the announcement. In addition {{to the public and}} opposition political parties the business community, COSATU and other trade unions, the Communist Party of South Africa, as well as many within the ruling ANC called for Zuma to reverse the decision. Four days after the announcement on 13 December a senior ANC delegation met with Zuma and told him to reinstate Nene or appoint former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan. A few hours later Zuma announced that van Rooyen would be replaced by the better known and trusted Pravin Gordhan. This event is thought to have increased the rift between Zuma {{and the rest of the}} ANC including Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, something that Ramaphosa denies. Ranjeni Munusamy of The Daily Maverick stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> has exposed <b>President</b> Zuma as a [...] "weak leader who acted recklessly without proper advice" [...] indicating that the firing of Nene has greatly damaged Zuma's political standing.|$|R
