5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood is difficult <b>to</b> <b>digest,</b> termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood {{because it is}} easier <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume {{a wide variety of}} materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E
5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} digestive enzymes needed <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E
5|$|Animals use {{muscles to}} move; {{even if we}} don't {{understand}} how they work, we can see they work mechanically, argues Paley, moving joints to and fro. Other organs such as the stomach work chemically <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> food.|$|E

5|$|Labour MPs criticised Key for not {{releasing}} {{specific policy}} information at their annual conference. Key responded that National would set its own policy agenda {{and that there}} was adequate time before the next election for voters <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> National Party policy proposals.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{this ability}} <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey {{much larger than}} their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|It {{spends much}} of its time {{underwater}} in order to hunt, but returns to land <b>to</b> <b>digest,</b> rest, and reproduce. It has very potent neurotoxic venom which it uses to prey on eels and small fish. Because of their affinity to land, banded sea kraits often encounter humans, but the snakes are not aggressive and only attack in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Lactose is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is {{formed by the}} combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form it and they are unable <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> lactose.|$|E

5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, and start <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> {{it in their}} cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, banded sea kraits {{frequently}} {{head into}} deep water far from land, but return {{to land in}} order <b>to</b> <b>digest,</b> shed skin, and reproduce. Individual banded sea kraits return to their specific home islands, exhibiting philopatry. One study found that when banded sea kraits on Fijian islands were relocated to different islands 5.3km away, all recaptured individuals were found on their home islands in an average of 30.7 days.|$|E

50|$|The {{microscopic}} anatomy shows {{a lighter}} staining tissue (when stained with H&E) containing no nuclei {{with very little}} structural damage, giving the appearance often quoted as 'ghost cells'. The decreased staining is due <b>to</b> <b>digested</b> nuclei which no longer show up as dark purple when stained with hematoxylin, and removed cytoplasmic structures giving reduced amounts of intracellular protein, reducing the usual dark pink staining cytoplasm with eosin.|$|R
50|$|The urease {{agar slant}} {{is used to}} measure an organism’s ability to produce urease, an enzyme capable <b>to</b> <b>digesting</b> urea in carbon dioxide and ammonia through hydrolysis. Because ammonia is alkaline, the media {{contains}} phenol red, an indicator that changes from orange to pink when a pH increases above 8.1.  When ammonia is increased to high enough concentrations, the media will change to a pink color, indicating the presence of urease production.|$|R

The issue numbering was consecutive from 1 to 85, with no volume numbers. The first issue had a publication date of 1 January 1951, and the first eight issues had publication dates of the 1st and 15th of each month. From the ninth issue to the end Authentic maintained a completely regular monthly schedule; the publication date was given in the magazine as the 15th of each month from issue 9 through issue 73; thereafter the date was just given as the month and year.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> their prey.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult <b>to</b> <b>digest.</b> Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generally}} omnivorous; the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds {{on a great}} variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing. Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|Dr. George Spomer of the University of Idaho has {{discovered}} protocarnivorous activity and function in several glandular plant species, including Cerastium arvense, Ipomopsis aggregata, Heuchera cylindrica, Mimulus lewisii, Penstemon attenuata, Penstemon diphyllus, Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, Ribes cereum, Rosa nutkana var. hispida, Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana, Solanum tuberosum, Stellaria americana, and Stellaria jamesiana. These species {{tested positive for}} protease activity, though {{it is unclear whether}} the protease is produced by the plant or by surface microbes. Two other species evaluated by Dr. Spomer, Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta, exhibited protease activity and were further examined with 14C-labeled algal protein for nutrient absorption activity. Both of these latter species displayed an ability <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> and absorb the labeled protein.|$|E
5|$|Grasses {{generally}} comprise {{at least}} 80 {{percent of the}} hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season, October to May. Jasminum kerstingii {{is part of the}} hartebeest's diet {{at the start of the}} rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the culms of grasses. A study found that the hartebeest is able <b>to</b> <b>digest</b> a higher proportion of food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.|$|E
25|$|This idea is {{referred}} to as Cuvier's principle of correlation of parts, which states that all organs in an animal's body are deeply interdependent. Species' existence relies on the way in which these organs interact. For example, a species whose digestive tract is best suited <b>to</b> <b>digesting</b> flesh but whose body is best suited to foraging for plants cannot survive. Thus in all species, the functional significance of each body part must be correlated to the others, else the species cannot sustain itself.|$|R
