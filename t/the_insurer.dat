5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E

25|$|The insured {{receives}} a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and {{circumstances under which}} the insured will be financially compensated. The amount of money charged by <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> to the insured for the coverage {{set forth in the}} insurance policy is called the premium. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> for processing by a claims adjuster.|$|E
25|$|The “chief motive in all {{insurance}} crimes is financial profit.” Insurance contracts {{provide both}} the insured and <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> with opportunities for exploitation.|$|E
25|$|When insured parties {{experience}} {{a loss for}} a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims – in theory for a relatively few claimants – and for overhead costs. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's profit.|$|E
50|$|The wreck made legal history, when in 1765 an iron trunk {{containing}} bullion was recovered. <b>The</b> <b>insurers</b> {{had already}} paid {{out on the}} loss and the case established that where insurers paid out on cargo and the owners subsequently recovered their property, <b>the</b> <b>insurers</b> were entitled to a refund.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} was to measure the {{efficiency}} of non life insurance companies operating in India.

25|$|PwC {{was also}} criticised by several {{witnesses}} {{during the investigation}} into AIG's collapse, after <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> was unable to fulfil its collateral obligations to Goldman Sachs. <b>The</b> <b>insurer</b> was expected to cover the difference in value between the credit default swap contracts it had sold to Goldman Sachs, however {{the head of the}} unit at AIG disagreed with the valuation that Goldman presented. According to a memo published by Business Insider, witnesses wondered how PwC was signing off on the accounts for both AIG and Goldman Sachs, when they were using different valuation methods for the swaps contracts (and therefore booked different values for them in their accounts).|$|E

25|$|Large loss: The size of {{the loss}} must be {{meaningful}} {{from the perspective of}} the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that <b>the</b> <b>insurer</b> will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the {{size of the}} expected cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} how an insurer should invest {{in order to}} hedge the maturity guarantees inherent in participating policies. Many papers have considered the case where the guarantee is increased each year according {{to the performance of}} an exogenously given reference portfolio subject to some guaranteed rate. However, in this paper we will consider the more realistic case whereby the reference portfolio is replaced by <b>the</b> <b>insurer’s</b> own investments which are controlled completely at the discretion of <b>the</b> <b>insurer’s</b> management. Hence in our case any change in <b>the</b> <b>insurer’s</b> investment strategy leads to a change in the underlying value process of the participating contract. We use a binomial tree model to show how this risk can be hedged, and hence calculate the fair value of the contract at outset...|$|R
