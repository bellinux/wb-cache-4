500|$|For season three's [...] "Resurrection" [...] and [...] "Memoria", {{songs were}} chosen as {{symbolism}} for the characters. In [...] "Resurrection", The Rapture's [...] "Infatuation" [...] was used during a scene with Lex and Lana {{to symbolize the}} question, [...] "Are we ever {{going to figure out}} what <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> think of each other?" [...] For [...] "Memoria" [...] Gough wanted to use Evanescence's [...] "My Immortal" [...] for the episode's final scene, telling Wade-Reed that he saw the song as being about mothers. In that scene Clark tells Martha that his first childhood memory was of his mother, Lara.|$|E
500|$|A {{scene was}} shot of Brandon finding his ward in a poverty-stricken area in London, {{but this was}} {{excluded}} from the film. [...] Thompson's script included a scene of Elinor and Edward kissing, as the studio [...] "couldn't stand the idea of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> who we've been watching {{all the way through}} not kissing." [...] It {{was one of the first}} scenes cut during editing: the original version was over three hours, Lee was less interested in the story's romance, and Thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate. The scene was included in marketing materials and the film trailer. Thompson and Doran also cut out a scene depicting Willoughby as remorseful when Marianne is sick. Doran said that despite it [...] "being one of the great scenes in book history," [...] they could not get it to fit into the film.|$|E
500|$|Kiersten Warren also {{returned}} to the series as Nora Huntington after being introduced {{at the end of}} the second season. On her storyline, Warren commented, [...] "There's a lot of families who are going through this. Not quite the surprise ooh, boo, child, but children from other marriages and trying to meld these families. I think a lot of people have to deal with it. I think it's fantastic that they’re doing this on the show." [...] Dougray Scott made his debut in this episode as Ian Hainsworth, Susan's romantic interest. Cherry opined that the character [...] "can legitimately rival Mike for [...] affections." [...] Daily commented on the storyline, saying: [...] "Talk about dark comedy — we're trying to find the humor in <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> bonding over the fact that they each have a partner in a coma." [...] Scott called his character [...] "bumbling at times," [...] adding, [...] "He kind of blossoms after he rediscovers his romantic juices with Susan." ...|$|E

500|$|Alex's {{friendships with}} her fellow {{trainees}} also form {{the crux of}} the character as well as the series, especially her friendship with her roommate and best friend Shelby. Johanna Braddy, who plays Shelby, told TV Guide that Shelby's friendship with Alex {{is a big part of}} Quantico. Safran talked to Entertainment Weekly that the idea for their friendship came from the similarity between the characters. He said [...] "So for Alex and Shelby, you know, as roommates and as friends, we just really loved the idea of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> from two different parts of the world, all these things that don't touch upon each other, but they actually at their core are both very driven, successful, smart, and kind humans that find each other." [...] One of the other characters Alex is very close to, other than Shelby, was Simon, who is killed in the finale. Talking about losing a friend and its repercussions on the Season2, Chopra explained: [...] "She's extremely affected [...] doesn't believe in sharing her emotions or opening up with someone." ...|$|E

[...] "He was ill last year, {{so we started}} speaking to one another," [...] Lewis told The Independent. [...] "There were no hard feelings. He just wasn't around. Every couple of years I'd get a postcard from the road – {{a picture of him}} standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But I thought this was the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened. But for some reason, <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up, that I want to keep writing about them... and maybe figure out who I am in the process." ...|$|E
2500|$|Figures are {{generally}} considered averages, and depend greatly on individual physiology and fitness. For example, an endurance runner's rates will typically be lower {{due to the}} increased size of the heart required to support the exercise, while a sprinter's rates will be higher due to the improved response time and short duration.

50|$|The Svecomans {{promoted}} {{the idea that}} Finland harbours <b>two</b> <b>peoples,</b> or nations, speaking different languages, with different cultures, and originating from separate parts of the country. In accordance with contemporary science, <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>peoples</b> were consequently denoted as members of different “races”. This idea was radically new. Until then, the Swedish-speaking rural population had been mostly ignored, but now this minority was considered important and directly associated with the elite of Finland.|$|R

2500|$|Former {{contestant}} and runner-up Saira Khan has criticised the programme {{because the}} final two candidates both work with Sir Alan Sugar {{for a few months}} before he decides whom he will hire. Khan stated that [...] "Sir Alan Sugar's final decision is not based on the programme that people see, his final decision is based on <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> who have been working with him for the six months." [...] Khan also said that the show is more concerned with giving viewers a rags-to-riches ending than employing the most able candidate, and that the show promotes bullying in the workplace. The series has been notably edited afterwards to show the winner in a different light. This has led to some viewers correctly guessing the winner of the series partway through the series.|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2015, Comey said, [...] "We can {{see from}} our {{investigation}} that in late 2013, before there is a physical meeting of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> [...] resulting in their engagement and then journey to the United States, they are communicating online, showing signs in that communication of their joint commitment to jihadism and to martyrdom. Those communications are direct, private messages." [...] Comey said that the FBI's investigation had revealed that the perpetrators were [...] "consuming poison on the Internet" [...] and both had become radicalized [...] "before they started courting or dating each other online" [...] and [...] "before the emergence of ISIL." [...] As a result, Comey said that [...] "untangling the motivations of which particular terrorist propaganda motivated in what way remains a challenge in these investigations, and our work is ongoing there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series {{introduced}} {{new love}} interests for both Tony and Ziva {{in the latter}} half of Season 8, and in February 2011, Michael Ausiello from TVLine announced that Ziva's boyfriend [...] "Ray arrives in this season's 20th episode and is described as a handsome, charming, intelligent federal agent of Mediterranean or Latin American descent. He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor but—I'm quoting from the casting notice here—'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'" [...] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a [...] "fun, smart, exciting addition", and Michael Weatherly commented, [...] "I think it’s going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and wants to make sure she’s not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so he’s going to be watchful and protective of her." [...] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, [...] "You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, and since I had no say in the casting, I was sort of waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano." [...] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: [...] "There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light and we kept it fun, and we kept it like two people who are genuinely in to each other and wanting to move things along. It's about what's going on between the lines. <b>These</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> are touchy-feely, and that's different for Ziva." ...|$|E

25|$|The Raeti tribes, {{together}} {{with those of}} their Celtic-speaking neighbours to the north, the Vindelici, were subjugated by the Imperial Roman army in 15 BC and their territories annexed to the Roman empire. The Roman province of Raetia et Vindelicia was named after <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>peoples.</b> The Raeti tribes quickly became loyal subjects of the empire and contributed disproportionate numbers of recruits to the imperial Roman army's auxiliary corps.|$|R
2500|$|Wesley {{undergoes}} {{yet another}} drastic personality change in Angels fifth season {{following the death}} of his love, Fred. Denisof believes that the loss of Fred caused Wesley to become understandably [...] "unbalanced". [...] "By the time we get to the last few episodes, he's got a handle on the grief and is functioning in a more level-headed way," [...] says Denisof. [...] "But underlying it is a huge hole in his heart and it makes it possible for the decision that they make in the final episode. For him emotionally, the stage is set for a life or death battle, possibly for the last time, because at this point, there's nothing more for him to lose." [...] Denisof talked with Whedon about what storylines would have been in place had the television series received another season; Wesley would not have died, and he and Illyria would have featured in an arc in which the transformation of Illyria to Fred would have been extended over many episodes and taken to a [...] "much deeper, darker place" [...] than it briefly was in the late fifth-season episode, [...] "The Girl in Question". Denisof continues, They would have progressed the relationship between Wesley and Illyria in such a way it would conflict with his own feelings for Fred, in a much more profound way. And then we would have gone into the switching of Fred and Illyria and having <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> that he was having these strong feelings about. That {{was going to be a}} fairly long journey in the following season, all of which got abbreviated tremendously when [...] decided to cancel the show. The cancellation of the show was the inspiration for Wesley's death; Whedon gave Denisof the option of keeping the character alive, but Denisof believed killing the character was right for the story, [...] "It was very upsetting to read. It's too good a story because it hurts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott Collura from IGN {{praised the}} {{interactions}} and dialogue {{between him and}} Davros in [...] "The Witch's Familiar". Den of Geek praised Capaldi in [...] "Before the Flood" [...] noting [...] "his performance continues to mix grumpiness, friendliness, intelligence and a large dose of alien, he's been on excellent, excellent form". Catherine Gee of The Telegraph credited Capaldi's acting in [...] "The Woman Who Lived" [...] noting [...] "he has grown into the role utterly and completely. He embodies {{the weight of the}} Doctor's responsibility; his face wears every nuanced expression with a flickering ease". His performance in [...] "The Zygon Inversion" [...] was heavily praised by fans and critics most specifically his anti-war speech, with Dan Martin of The Guardian stating [...] "this Doctor has never been written better, Capaldi has never channelled Tom Baker more". Most prominently Capaldi's performance in [...] "Heaven Sent" [...] received universal widespread acclaim, with Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times noting that [...] "Peter Capaldi's one-man show is an instant classic", and that [...] "Capaldi delivers 100%, carrying every scene and showing every facet of his Doctor: anger, terror, playfulness, intensity, resignation and, finally, a fierce refusal to do anything other than do what he has always done: find a way to win". In a review for [...] "Hell Bent", Catherine Gee stated [...] "Peter Capaldi proved that {{he is one of the}} greatest Doctors". Den of Geek praised the dynamic between the Doctor and River Song in [...] "The Husbands of River Song", with Simon Brew noting the pair as a [...] "strong double act", with Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy stating [...] "this, combined with Capaldi and Kingston's sensitive work, means you feel a weight of history between <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>people</b> who've never shared a screen before". Andrew Billen of The Times praised the Twelfth Doctor for being at his [...] "warmest" [...] in [...] "The Return of Doctor Mysterio", along with The Guardian applauding the dynamic between the Doctor and Nardole noting [...] "Peter Capaldi and Matt Lucas are 'a pantomime treat'". In June 2016, Peter Capaldi was shortlisted for a national TV Choice Award for Best Actor. He had also been submitted for a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. In addition, Capaldi was announced as a BAFTA Scotland Awards nomination as Best Actor on Television.|$|E

50|$|Concerning this region, Huntington {{departs from}} Kitsikis contending that a civilizational fault line {{exists between the}} two {{dominant}} yet differing religions (Eastern Orthodoxy and Sunni Islam), hence a dynamic of external conflict.
