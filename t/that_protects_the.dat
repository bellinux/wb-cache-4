5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity <b>that</b> <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux <b>that</b> <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer <b>that</b> <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas {{to be caught in}} bubbles of {{magnetic field}}, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) <b>that</b> <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E
5|$|The {{polygonal}} gun platform {{around the}} keep has 16 sides, {{with a total}} of 14 gun embrasures. The two-storey forebuilding dates from {{the second half of the}} 16th century, with three rooms on each level linked by a spiral-staircase, and was originally used to house the captain of the castle. Its entrance was guarded with a portcullis, and the roof was designed to be defendable with handguns. The stone bridge that stretches across the ditch <b>that</b> <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> castle dates from 1902; it would originally have been protected at the front by a rectangular gatehouse, but this was demolished at the start of the 20th century.|$|E

Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat. In the damper areas, sea wormwood, sea {{lavender}} and scrubby sea-blite also thrive. The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other saltmarsh specialists. The upper saltmarsh {{has a number of}} scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer <b>that</b> <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Indy recovers {{the cross}} {{off the coast}} of Portugal and donates it to Marcus Brody's museum. Later, Indy is {{introduced}} to Walter Donovan, who informs him that Indy's father, Henry Jones Sr., has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, using an incomplete inscription as his guide. Indy then receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from Venice. Realizing that he would not have sent the diary unless he was in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they meet Henry's Austrian colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover the tomb of a First Crusade knight, which also contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, this one revealing the location of the Grail. They flee, however, when the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a secret society <b>that</b> <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, Kazim, and Indy tells him that his goal is only to find his father and that he has no interest in finding the Grail. Kazim tells him that Henry is being held in Castle Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. Marcus later reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the pages containing the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping and sends Marcus to İskenderun, the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah, and he and Elsa head to Castle Brunwald.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin <b>that</b> <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show polyembryony, where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E
