He sponsored legislation for strict reporting requirements for lobbyists; criticized the leadership of his own party for the hiring practices of former legislators; and provided Governor Thornburgh with the deciding vote which defined the authority of the state's first elected Attorney General over the objections of the leadership in his party.|$|E

500|$|As {{a congressman}} for three months, Greeley {{introduced}} legislation for a homestead act {{that would allow}} settlers who improved land to purchase it at low rates—a fourth of what speculators would pay. He was quickly noticed because he launched a series of attacks on legislative privileges, taking note of which congressmen were missing votes, and questioning the office of House Chaplain. This {{was enough to make}} him unpopular. But he outraged his colleagues when on December 22, 1848 the Tribune published evidence that many congressmen had been paid excessive sums as <b>travel</b> <b>allowance.</b> In January 1849, Greeley supported {{a bill that would have}} corrected the issue, but it was defeated. He was so disliked, he wrote a friend, that he had [...] "divided the House into two parties—one that would like to see me extinguished and the other that wouldn't be satisfied without a hand in doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{head-to-head}} {{competition for the}} Memorial Cup has changed formats several times. [...] The CAHA moved to a best-of-three format in 1925 as {{the first team to}} win two games was declared the champion. [...] In 1938, the series was increased to best-of-five, and to best-of-seven in 1943. [...] There were two exceptions to these formats. The 1949 final between the Montreal Royals and the Brandon Wheat Kings required an eighth game after the third game ended in a tie. The 1971 final between the Quebec Remparts and the Edmonton Oil Kings was nearly canceled outright in the wake of controversy surrounding the inclusion of the previously outlawed Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) as the western league was allowed to use more over-age players and received a larger <b>travel</b> <b>allowance</b> from the CAHA. [...] The differences were resolved, and an abbreviated best-of-three series was held in Quebec City.|$|E
500|$|Within a {{month of}} moving into the Governor's Mansion, Brown noticed {{significant}} deterioration in the wiring and ordered a full inspection. The Department of Buildings and Construction's preliminary report stated [...] "If this was a privately operated structure, this office would have no alternative other than to give the operator 30 to 60 days to rewire the structure." [...] The report {{went on to say}} that the mansion was a virtual firetrap. Upon receiving the report, Brown immediately moved his family out of the mansion and back to Cave Hill, his estate in Lexington. The Department of Buildings and Construction forbade use of the mansion for overnight purposes or group meetings until repairs could be made. Brown's Cave Hill estate was officially designated the temporary executive mansion, and the state agreed to furnish Brown's groceries, reimburse him for entertaining official guests, and pay for telephone calls made in his capacity as governor. He was also given a <b>travel</b> <b>allowance.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Trollope based {{himself in}} Banagher, King's County, {{with his work}} {{consisting}} largely of inspection tours in Connaught. Although he had arrived with a bad reference from London, his new supervisor resolved to judge him on his merits; by Trollope's account, within a year he had the reputation of a valuable public servant. His salary and <b>travel</b> <b>allowance</b> went much further in Ireland than they had in London, {{and he found himself}} enjoying a measure of prosperity. He took up fox hunting, which he pursued enthusiastically for the next three decades. His professional role as a post-office surveyor brought him into contact with Irish people, and he found them pleasant company: [...] "The Irish people did not murder me, nor did they even break my head. I soon found them to be good-humoured, clever—the working classes very much more intelligent than those of England—economical and hospitable." ...|$|E
