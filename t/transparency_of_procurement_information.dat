The main aspect of the work is to compare the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> public <b>procurement</b> in selected towns of Pilsen, South Bohemia, Karlovy Vary and Ústí Region in the years 2006 - 2014. Based on the data <b>of</b> public <b>procurement</b> were observed characteristics, that highlight the risk of corruption. Partial aim was to assess possible influence of political environment and their changes on the practice and <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> public <b>procurement.</b> The results show, that the towns, which are positively evaluated in terms <b>of</b> their <b>transparency</b> are characterized by high participation in elections and low unemployment rate.

The subjects of public control in developed countries have been identified {{on the basis of a}} comparative analysis, the high degree of electrification of the state as a whole and of the system <b>of</b> public <b>procurement</b> in particular has been identified as its necessary material precondition, and its formally institutionalized entities in Russian Federation have been monitored. Statistical data, which characterizes the process of Russian public sector expansion and determines the scale of the established system <b>of</b> public <b>procurement,</b> has been presented. The article identifies features and effects (including negative ones) <b>of</b> escalating <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> corporate <b>procurement,</b> and formulates the problem of defining the optimal level <b>of</b> informational <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> public sector corporate organizations with regard to the competitors, including foreign ones.

The problematic areas of public control mechanisms are determined; the ways of their localization are tested.

The public sector in Malaysia is going through period of rapid change. The government’s leading role in spearheading the surge forward into the information age has compelled the public sector to lead the way. The Government launched the Electronic Government (e-Government) initiative to reinvent itself to lead the country into the Information Age.

With this in mind the governments have set regulations for public <b>procurement.</b> <b>Procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Systems is especially challenging due to the complexity of procuring unknown technology and the importance an information system has for different stakeholders in an organization. Public <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> systems (IS) and services provides several challenges to the stakeholders involved in the procurement processes. However, these are not well established or understood, and there is a knowledge gap that needs to be covered. This paper presents results from a Delphi study, which involved 46 experienced <b>procurement</b> managers, chief <b>information</b> officers, and vendor representatives in the Norwegian public sector. The participants identified 98 challenges related to IS procurement, and subsequently ranked the relative importance of the top issues. The study supports findings from previous research related to diverging stakeholder goals; challenges in balancing between objectives; in requirement specifications; and in too narrow cost focus. In addition to providing empirical confirmation of these previous propositions the study revealed new findings, such as benefits realization in IS procurement; coordinating and standardizing public procurement processes; complex and constraining government regulations; issues of technological integration and compatibility; and inter-municipal cooperation. Developing clear requirements specifications stands out as critical for public sector officials.
