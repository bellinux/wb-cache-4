2500|$|Redundancies are {{a special}} kind of dismissal, which attract {{specific}} regulation. Since the Redundancy Payments Act 1965, staff must receive a payment for losing their jobs if the employer no longer has an economic need for their job. This policy is designed to internalise some of the social costs that employers create if they dismiss staff, to try and disincentivise unnecessary job losses, and contribute to employees' costs in unemployment. Under ERA 1996 section 162, employees over age 40 receive 1½ weeks' pay per year they had worked, employees aged 22 to 40 receive 1 week's pay per year worked, and employees age 21 or less receive half a week's pay, though the upper limit was £464 per week in 2014. Dismissal for redundancy counts [...] "fair" [...] in substance under ERA 1996 section 98, but the employer may still carry out an unfair procedure to dismiss the redundant employees. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 139, a [...] "redundancy" [...] exists when an employer's demand for an employee's role ceases or diminishes. In situations where employees have lost their jobs, this may be straightforward. In cases where an employer uses its discretion practically to worsen the employees' position the answer may depend on the employees' contracts. In Lesney Products & Co v Nolan a toy company stopped giving its workers overtime. Some refused to work. They were dismissed, and the workers claimed they were redundant. Lord Denning MR held they were not made [...] "redundant" [...] by their terms being changed, even worsened, because [...] "nothing should be done to impair the ability of employers to reorganise their work force and their times and conditions of work so as to improve efficiency." [...] Apparently, they had simply left stopped working of their own accord. This view is controversial, because if the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> <b>bill</b> spent by the employer is reduced, it would follow that demand for work (reflected in the employer's willingness to pay) must also be diminished. Thus, other courts have suggested the contract terms are irrelevant, and that the test should be purely based on the economic reality of diminished demand. Employers can also argue that a dismissal is for [...] "some other substantial reason". In Hollister v National Farmers’ Union a farmer's refusal to accept decreased pension entitlements, after a consultation process, was said to be a [...] "substantial" [...] reason for dismissal. It is not clear whether worsening employees' contract terms, without their consent or collective approval, was envisaged by the Act as way to evade redundancy payments.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to model}} the cost {{behaviour}} of Chinese state-owned enterprises in the 1980 s. Given production autonomy and profit-related bonus incentives, state firms are expected to increase profits and therefore bonuses by changing their cost behaviours more rationally. However, since institutional constraints remain and distort the rational demand of the firm for input factors, the changes cannot {{go as far as}} expected by the standard neoclassical cost minimisation theory. Based on this, we derived a total cost function for Chinese state firms restricted by the government control over their <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> <b>bills.</b> We then test it using a panel data of 386 state manufacturing enterprises in the period 1983 - 87. It is found that the model predicted well. Despite the constraints, the reform did lead the firms to respond to both changes in factor prices in the directions expected by cost minimising behaviour and to bonus incentives to produce more efficiently. ...|$|R

50|$|For Karl Marx, {{property}} income is {{a component of}} surplus value, which refers to the net value above the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> <b>bill.</b> The surplus value is distributed among {{a small minority of}} passive owners, or capitalists. The capitalists appropriate the product of social labor by holding ownership titles to the means of production. In Marx's view, socialism implied an end to this class dynamic - the surplus value would be appropriated by the working class as a whole. However, even though Marx was opposed to the distribution of {{property income}} under capitalism, this was not the instrumentality of capitalist collapse nor was it the primary reason for the desirability of the abrogation of capitalism. In Marx's view, capitalism was not to be opposed due to any supposedly moral defect in its distribution, but because its underlying dynamic of capital accumulation and surplus value appropriation was unstable and ultimately unsustainable.|$|E

30|$|The {{number of}} workers in Table  6 is taken from Table 9 in the Appendix, while the <b>total</b> weekly <b>wage</b> <b>bill</b> for the native born and {{immigrants}} {{is the product of}} the {{number of workers}} and average weekly wages in each of the five classifications of the NRI. The weekly gain from a move to the highest level of relatedness (the 0.8 – 1 range of NRI) is given in the third and sixth rows of the table by the estimated coefficients of Eq. (1) reported in Table  5, for internationally educated immigrants and the native born, respectively. The total weekly WG is then the product of these coefficients and the <b>total</b> weekly <b>wage</b> <b>bill</b> for immigrants and native-born workers. The ratio of the TWB terms serves the role of an adjustment rate for the native born and makes both WGs comparable. Since this adjustment rate, which works out to 9.35  % (as shown in Table  5), removes from the WGs differences in average wages and labor market sizes, the difference between WGs in (2) shows the wage gain of immigrant workers had their occupational matching improved to what native-born workers experience in labor markets. The calculations in Table  6 show that, when the occupational match of immigrants is measured relative to that of native-born workers, the <b>total</b> weekly <b>wage</b> gain that immigrants would experience amounts to no more than 2  % of the <b>total</b> weekly <b>wage</b> <b>bill</b> (10.3 / 554.9), implying that the wage gain of 8.8  % calculated earlier using conventional methods largely overestimates the true underutilization cost. The important point is that, regardless of whether we use a narrower or broader NRI classification than the five-category classification reported in this paper, the cost associated with immigrants’ occupational mismatch should be calculated in relative terms when immigrants have the same occupational distribution as native-born workers. That this would entail a smaller cost of underutilization is also evident from the fact that our estimate of the annual cost of underutilization of about 540 million dollars is substantially smaller than that suggested by Reitz (2001), as well as the 5 billion dollars cost estimated by the Conference Board of Canada (2001).|$|R

50|$|In early 1889, a Royal Commission inquired {{into the}} {{viability}} of the sugar industry which was in decline at that time. From its 1865 initiation by Louis Hope, the industry had expanded rapidly over the subsequent twenty years. However, there was a marked decline between 1885 and 1893, attributed to drought and a slump in world sugar prices. Bundaberg farmers formed a small company which set up a rum distillery in 1888 which helped the industry through these hard times. Edward Turner's evidence to the commission indicated that he owned 250 acre in total, 110 (44.5ha) of which were under sugar cultivation, and a further 20 (8ha) cultivated for other purposes. He employed seven Europeans and 45 Islanders. His <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> <b>bill</b> for 1888 was £588 to Europeans and £1420 to the Islanders, which indicates an annual income of £84 for a European and £31.10/- for an Islander.

5000|$|According to many analysts, {{deficiency}} of effective demand {{is the most}} fundamental economic problem. That is, modern society does not earn enough income to purchase its output. For example, geographer David Harvey claims, [...] "Workers spending their wages is one source of effective demand, but the <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> <b>bill</b> is always less than the total capital in circulation (otherwise {{there would be no}} profit), so the purchase of wage goods that sustain daily life (even with a suburban lifestyle) is never sufficient for the profitable sale of the total output." [...] While balanced mixed economies have existed briefly throughout history, veteran Project Manager for the U.S. Treasury Department, Richard C. Cook, and other critics claim that command economies are predominate, citing state capitalism and imperialism as related. As common resources are monopolized by imperial centers of wealth and power, conditions of scarcity are imposed artificially upon the majority, resulting in large-scale socio-economic imbalance.|$|E

30|$|One {{conventional}} {{approach to}} measuring {{the cost of}} underutilized, internationally educated immigrants, given the wage penalty information in Table  5 and the incidence of mismatch in Table  4, would be to consider an alternative distribution where all immigrants work in their most matching occupations. This {{can be seen in}} the upper section of Table  5 : if all immigrants working in unrelated jobs characterized by NRIs lower than 0.8 were reassigned to the most related occupations (with NRIs between 1.0 and 0.8), using the estimates from Table  4 (column 4), the <b>total</b> weekly <b>wage</b> gain would be 49.3 million dollars (2.5 billion dollars annually or 8.8  % of the <b>total</b> weekly <b>wage</b> <b>bill),</b> which can be considered the underutilization cost.

30|$|Without {{comparing}} their gain {{relative to}} that of native-born workers, the total weekly gain for immigrants holding a medical degree amounts to 6.8  % of the <b>total</b> weekly <b>wage</b> <b>bill.</b> The comparative gain, on the other hand, is 585, 000 dollars, which is 4  % of the weekly <b>wage</b> <b>bill.</b> Since the improvement in matching for immigrants {{would be much better}} among medical degree holders than for others, the comparative gain is twice as much as the average of 2  % shown in Table  6. Although similar calculations can be done for different groups of workers to ascertain differential underutilization costs, the observed magnitude of the cost would likely be smaller. This is because jobs requiring medical degrees would likely be ones that display the highest degree of occupational distinctiveness among regulated or self-regulated professions. It is interesting to see that while medical degree holders (13, 360) account for only 2  % of all immigrant workers (661, 675), their comparative weekly wage gain (30.4 million dollars) makes up more than 6  % of the <b>total</b> weekly <b>wage</b> gain of all immigrant workers (537 million dollars).|$|R
40|$|Professional {{football}} {{clubs are}} extraordinary businesses since their performance is evaluated {{both on and}} off the field of play. This study examines how close to their potential English Premier League Clubs play. Employing a deterministic Data Envelopment Analysis Approach, which has proved particularly useful when production involves multiple inputs and outputs, the efficiency of the 13 clubs that remained in the English Premier League throughout the period from 2001 / 2 to 2006 / 7, is measured. The input variables selected are <b>total</b> <b>wage</b> <b>bills</b> for all staff and transfer expenditure. Output is measured by points awarded, total revenues and transfer income. The results demonstrate that efficiency scores are not correlated with the final league position and that medium- and small-sized teams like Bolton Wanderers often outperform renowned teams like Chelsea. The sources of inefficiency are broken down into technical inefficiency and scale inefficiency and are analysed explicitly, with weaknesses of individual teams and how to overcome them being disclosed. The exemplar performance of Bolton is explored in depth with the club's sources of sustained competitive advantage being investigated. The study concludes that while most clubs operate close to efficient levels for the assessed models, there is scope for input reduction. Staff are being overpaid relative to their performance and clubs are being very inefficient in the transfer market due to incorrect evaluation of playing talent or because resources are not combined optimally. Consequently, this study has certain significant implications for the management of teams in both the business world, but especially in the sports world...|$|R

First, if the two firms collude in setting prices on the product market, this leads to an increase in the symmetric equilibrium wage in the qualified labour market, as well as a rise in productivity. Unions are not considered. Second, although the number of unqualified workers hired decreases along with the <b>total</b> employment, the <b>wage</b> <b>bill</b> can rise because of intensified competition on the qualified labour market.

40|$|Considerable {{controversy}} exists {{regarding the}} costs and benefits of growth in the meat packing and processing industry in the rural Midwest. This study uses proprietary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Longitudinal Database (LDB) to investigate the effects of this industry on social and economic outcomes in non-metropolitan counties of twelve Midwestern states from 1990 - 2000. A difference-in-differences specification is used to measure how local growth in meatpacking and processing affects growth in local economies, government expenditures, and crime rates. Propensity score matching is used as a check on possible non-random placement of meatpacking and processing plants. Results suggest that as the meat packing industry’s share of a county’s <b>total</b> employment and <b>wage</b> <b>bill</b> rises, <b>total</b> employment growth increases. However, employment growth in other sectors slows, as does local wage growth. There is some evidence that slower wage growth swamps the employment growth so that aggregate income grows more slowly. We find no evidence that growth in the industry changes the growth rates for crime or government spending...|$|R
