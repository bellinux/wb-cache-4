25|$|During initial episodes from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, {{director}} Mitsuo Fukuda did {{not want}} to <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about Shinn's character. However, he defined him as Kira's opposite in regards to their personalities when comparing the two lead characters. Shinn is defined as a civilian whose character could already go through a large development in contrast to Kira who was forced to become a soldier in the prequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. In comparison with Kira, Shinn was stated to be character harder to predict his role in the TV series. As with Kira in Gundam SEED, Fukuda mentioned Shinn's character would also change across the series. Kenichi Suzumura was especially hired to work as Shinn's Japanese voice actor with Fukuda stating he was not a character difficult to play. Fukuda also anticipated Suzumura's work as Shinn's voice actor in an optimistic way. Before the series' premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn's character, telling that the Gundam SEED Destinys protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> about it. I was just gonna stew on it, {{and then do}} it. That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E
500|$|Christopher Thale {{writes in}} the Encyclopedia of Chicago that lacking {{credible}} evidence regarding the bombing, [...] "...the prosecution focused on the writings and speeches of the defendants." [...] He further notes that the conspiracy charge was legally unprecedented, the Judge was [...] "partisan," [...] and all the jurors admitted prejudice against the defendants. Historian Carl Smith writes, [...] "The visceral feelings of fear and anger surrounding the trial ruled out anything but the pretense of justice right from the outset." [...] Smith notes that scholars have long considered the trial a [...] "notorious" [...] "miscarriage of justice." [...] In a review somewhat more critical of the defendants, historian Jon Teaford concludes that [...] "he tragedy of Haymarket is the American justice system did not protect the damn fools who most needed that protection... It is the damn fools who <b>talk</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> and too wildly who are {{most in need of}} protection from the state." [...] Historian Timothy Messer-Kruse revisited the digitized trial transcript and argued that the proceedings were fair for their time, a challenge to the historical consensus that the trial was a travesty.|$|E
