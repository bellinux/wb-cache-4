5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons.

The Major wrote directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector.

40|$|Social primes (pro-social, anti-social) can {{modulate}} mimicry behaviour. To date, {{these social}} modulation effects have been explained by <b>the</b> <b>primed</b> incentive <b>to</b> affiliate with another (Social Top-Down Response Modulation; STORM) and <b>the</b> <b>primed</b> active-self-concept leading <b>to</b> behaviour that is either consistent or {{inconsistent with the}} prime-construct (Active-Self account). The present study was designed <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> explanatory power {{for each of these}} accounts, and thereby gain a greater understanding of how social modulation unfolds. To do this, we assessed social modulation of motor contagion in individuals high or low in self-monitoring. It was reasoned that high self-monitors would modulate mimicry according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>primed</b> social incentive, whereas low self-monitors would modulate according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>primed</b> active-self-concept. Participants were primed with a pro-social and anti-social cue in the first-person and third-person perspective. Next, they completed an interpersonal observation-execution task featuring the simultaneous observation and execution of arm movements that were either congruent or incongruent to each other. Results showed increased incongruent movement deviation (motor contagion) for <b>the</b> anti-social compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pro-social <b>prime</b> in <b>the</b> high self-monitors only. Findings support the STORM account of mimicry by showing observers modulate behaviour based on the social incentive underpinning an interpersonal exchange...|$|R
