5|$|The T-26-4 {{with the}} KT <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> passed tests {{successfully}} and five vehicles {{were built in}} 1933–1934 as pilot batch. Initially it was planned to arm three of these T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> mod. 1927/32 {{and the other two}} tanks with the 76.2mm PS-3 <b>tank</b> <b>gun.</b> The PS-3 <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> was developed at the Experimental Engineering-Mechanical Department (OKMO) of the Factory No. 174 by engineer P. Syachentov. The PS-3 had better specifications in comparison with the series-produced KT <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> and also had several technical innovations (foot firing switch, original training gear, travelling position fixing, binocular optical sight). The T-26-4 armed with the PS-3 <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> was tested in October 1933 but {{it was found that the}} PS-3 was too powerful for the T-26 light tank—turret's race ring and hull roof were deformed during gun fire, and the suspension springs were damaged. It was decided to arm the T-26-4 with the 76.2mm KT <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> only. All five experimental T-26-4 artillery tanks were tested during military exercises near Leningrad in September 1934 before scheduled series production of 50 such vehicles in 1935. But on 19 September 1934 an incident with a T-26-4 took place: a blow-back because of shell case destruction during gun fire. Despite the fact that this defect was unrelated to turret design, the military representatives cancelled the order to produce the T-26-4. Also the work to design turretless AT-1 artillery tanks armed with the powerful 76.2mm PS-3 <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> started at that time. The T-26-4's turret construction was the design used in the series-produced BT-7A artillery tank.|$|E
5|$|The longer <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> {{has been}} {{retrofitted}} into the Leopard 2, creating a model {{known as the}} Leopard 2A6. Both the Spanish Leopard 2E and the Greek Leopard 2HEL, as derivatives of the Leopard 2A6, use the 55 caliber-long <b>tank</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
5|$|Poland has {{introduced}} a series of projectiles for Rheinmetall's <b>tank</b> <b>gun,</b> including an armor-piercing penetrator target practice round (APFSDS-T-TP), a high-explosive round, and a high-explosive target practice (HE-TP) projectile. The ammunition is manufactured by Zakłady Produkcji Specjalnej Sp. z o.o.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{artillery}} types, German industry built for example, 570 heavy (caliber 88-128 mm) flak guns, 1,020 field artillery pieces (caliber 75-210 mm), and 1,300 <b>tank</b> <b>guns,</b> anti-tank guns, plus self-propelled guns in December 1943.|$|R
5|$|Production of the German Leopard 2 {{and the new}} 120mm <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> {{began in}} 1979, {{fulfilling}} an order for the German Army. Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with the M68A1 105mm gun (a version of the L7), the United States Army had planned to fit the tank with a larger main gun at a later date, and the tank's turret had been designed to accommodate a larger 120mm gun. The larger gun was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams, with the first vehicle coming off the production line in 1985 The gun, known as the M256, {{was based on the}} L/44 <b>tank</b> <b>gun,</b> although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of the barrels to fracture and fatigue. Tanks armed with versions of Rheinmetall's gun produced under licence include Japan's Type 90 and South Korea's K1A1. The gun had made a huge turn in technological history.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1938: new conical turret, {{small changes}} in hull parts, {{increased}} volume of fuel tanks. <b>Tank</b> <b>gun</b> mod. 1937 and mod. 1938 were equipped with an electric breechblock and a vertically stabilized TOP-1 telescopic sight (or a TOS telescopic sight on the 1938 model).|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Armoured Directorate of the Red Army (ABTU RKKA) {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a new conical turret for the T-26 similar to the BT-7's turret and to arm it with the 76.2mm L-10 <b>tank</b> <b>gun.</b> Engineers of the Factory No. 174 felt it was impossible to implement this project because it would lead to a significant overload of T-26's chassis.|$|E
5000|$|According to Heinz Guderian (supplied by Q.M.G of the General Staff of the Army): Total 33,324 <b>tanks,</b> assault <b>guns,</b> <b>tank</b> destroyers, {{self-propelled}} <b>guns,</b> {{armored personnel}} carriers and armored cars lost on the Eastern Front from 22/6/1941 until November 1944 (inculd 15,673 <b>tanks,</b> 8,129 self-propelled <b>guns,</b> 9,153 armored vehicles and 369 others) ...|$|R

5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 turret was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard to}} rotate the turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1933: single turret version {{armed with}} 45mm 20K <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> and DT tank machine gun. This version {{had a new}} {{cylindrical}} turret with a large rear niche. Some tanks were equipped with a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the turret (so-called radio tanks). They were upgraded in 1935 with a welded hull and turret, and again in 1936 with a rear DT tank machine gun in the turret. In 1937, some tanks were equipped with an anti-aircraft machine gun and a searchlight. The model 1933 was the most numerous variant.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately the Verdeja program's end {{came with}} the arrival of {{military}} equipment from the United States, beginning in 1953. From 1954, the Spanish Army received 389 M47 Patton Tanks, replacing the T-26s, Panzer Is and Panzer IVs then in service. The Verdeja had become completely obsolete when compared to larger, more potent tanks such as the German Panther, the Soviet T-54 and the US M47. The T-54 had 200millimetre of steel armor on the turret mantlet, far greater than the Verdeja 2's maximum armor thickness of 40millimetres. The Soviet 45millimetre model 1932 gun was replaced by the T-34's 76.2millimetre gun, while the Germans adopted the 75millimetre L/70 <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> on the Panther. By 1950, Soviet tanks such as the T-54 were armed with the D-10T 100millimetre <b>tank</b> <b>gun,</b> and American tanks adopted the 90millimetre main gun. Although the Verdeja was Spain's most successful indigenous design, it was outclassed as foreign countries produced superior products. Furthermore, the need for self-propelled artillery was soon eliminated as the United States offered Spain M37 and M44 self-propelled howitzers. As a result, interest in the Verdeja dried up after 1954. Spain would not attempt another indigenous tank until the advent of the Lince main battle tank in the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{developing}} specialized anti-tank artillery, some nations, including South Africa and Israel, grafted obsolete <b>tank</b> <b>guns</b> onto towed carriages {{for use in}} that role.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Soviet {{military}} {{concluded that the}} armor-piercing ammunition used by the T-54 and T-55 medium tanks, and the T-10 and T-10M heavy tanks was unable to penetrate the frontal armor of the newest American M60 and British Chieftain main battle tanks. The Soviets therefore began parallel research on several different anti-tank weapon systems: development of new APDS and shaped charge ammunition for existing <b>tank</b> <b>guns,</b> new rifled and smoothbore <b>tank</b> <b>guns</b> with a caliber of 115-130 mm and anti-tank missiles among others.|$|R
50|$|On 7 November 1950, the US Ordnance Committee Minutes (OCM), order #33476, ceased {{utilizing}} the terms heavy, medium, and light tanks and redesignated <b>tanks</b> by the <b>gun</b> system, e.g. 90 mm <b>Gun</b> <b>Tank</b> M48 Patton, etc. with heavy <b>gun</b> <b>tanks</b> (120 mm), medium <b>gun</b> <b>tanks</b> (90 mm), and light <b>gun</b> <b>tanks</b> (76 mm), although these gun terms were often still shortened to simply heavy, medium, and light tanks.|$|R
5|$|Due to tank sales, Rheinmetall's L/44 <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> {{has been}} {{manufactured}} for other nations. For example, the Leopard 2 {{armed with the}} 44 caliber long gun, has been sold to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, and other countries. Egypt had manufactured 700–800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005, and in 2008 requested permission to build another 125 tanks; their M256 main guns (the US version of the L/44) were manufactured by Watervliet Arsenal. The M1A1 has also been exported to Australia, while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The American license-built M256 has also been offered by General Dynamics Land Systems {{as part of the}} M60-2000 Main Battle Tank which would upgrade older M60 Patton tanks to have capabilities of their M1A1 Abrams at a reduced cost, though the company has not yet found a buyer.|$|E
5|$|The British up-gunned the Sherman {{with their}} highly {{effective}} QF 17 pounder anti-tank gun, {{resulting in the}} Firefly; although {{this was the only}} Allied tank capable of dealing with all current German tanks at normal combat ranges, few (342) were available in time for the Normandy invasion. From D-Day {{to the end of the}} Normandy campaign, a further 550 Fireflies were built. A second British tank equipped with the 17pdr gun, the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger, could not participate in the initial landings having to wait for port facilities to be ready to land. It was not until July 1944 that American Shermans, fitted with the 76-mm (3-inch) M1 <b>tank</b> <b>gun,</b> achieved a parity in firepower with the Panzer IV.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Soviets {{unveiled}} the T-26 mod. 1933. The Model 1933, {{with a new}} single cylindrical turret carrying one 45mm cannon L46 (length in calibers, which meant quite high initial velocity, over 700–800m/s depending on ammunition) and one 7.62 mm machine gun, became the most common T-26 variant. The 45mm 20K <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> {{was based on the}} Soviet 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 (19-K) {{and it was one of}} the most powerful anti-tank guns of its time. Actually, few, if any, western tanks existed with similar guns. The T-26 could carry up to three secondary DT 7.62mm machine guns in coaxial, rear, and anti-aircraft mounts. This increased firepower was intended to aid crews in defeating dedicated anti-tank teams, as the original machine gun armament had been found insufficient. The turret rear ball mounting for the additional DT tank machine gun was installed on the T-26 tanks from the end of 1935 until 1939.|$|E

50|$|The Arjun MBT's 120 mm main gun is a rifled gun {{developed}} and tested by ARDE {{for use with}} the Arjun <b>tank.</b> The <b>gun</b> {{is one of the}} few rifled <b>tank</b> <b>guns</b> in modern <b>tanks</b> (the Challenger 2 Tank also uses a rifled gun). It is capable of firing rounds at velocities over 1650 m/s, and can sustain pressures of up to 612 MPa.|$|R
5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E

50|$|A smoothbore {{weapon is}} one that has a barrel without rifling. Smoothbores range from {{handheld}} firearms to powerful <b>tank</b> <b>guns</b> and large artillery mortars. The majority of shotguns are smoothbores and the term can be synonymous.|$|R
50|$|Heavy tanks {{such as the}} T-10 {{continued}} to be developed and fielded along with medium tanks until the 1960s and 1970s, {{when the development of}} anti-tank guided missiles and powerful <b>tank</b> <b>guns</b> rendered them ineffective in their role.|$|R

25|$|PT-76 (Ob'yekt 740, 1951) - An {{original}} PT-76 {{armed with}} the D-56T 76.2mm rifled <b>tank</b> <b>gun</b> (no bore evaluator, long multi-slotted muzzle brake, no fume extractor). It was produced between 1951 and 1957.|$|E
50|$|On 9 June, Ramillies, {{directed}} by forward observation posts, fired on German <b>tanks,</b> <b>guns,</b> infantry concentrations and motor vehicles with great success, breaking up units {{before they could}} launch counterattacks. She also beat off an attack by German E-boats.|$|R
50|$|Adaptations to {{existing}} <b>tank</b> <b>guns</b> were somewhat more difficult, although all major forces {{had done so}} {{by the end of}} the war. Since velocity has little effect on the armor-piercing ability of the round, which is defined by explosive power, HEAT rounds were particularly useful in long-range combat where slower terminal velocity was not an issue. The Germans were again the ones to produce the most capable gun-fired HEAT rounds, using a driving band on bearings to allow it to fly unspun from their existing rifled <b>tank</b> <b>guns.</b> The HEAT round was particularly useful to them because it allowed the low-velocity large-bore guns used on their many assault guns to also become useful anti-tank weapons.|$|R
50|$|As {{time passed}} on, more {{accurate}} artillery guns were made, {{and they came}} in different varieties. Small artillery pieces were used as mortars, medium sized artillery <b>guns</b> became <b>tank</b> <b>guns,</b> and the largest artillery guns became long range land batteries and battleship armaments.|$|R
