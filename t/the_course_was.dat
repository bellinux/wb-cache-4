50|$|<b>The</b> <b>courses</b> <b>were</b> rated four star by Golf Digest in 1999. <b>The</b> <b>courses</b> <b>are</b> {{named after}} Forest Akers, an alumnus of who donated {{the land to}} the institution. A {{condition}} of the donation <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> <b>course</b> also had {{to serve as a}} arboretum and as a result it hosts a variety of plant life native to Michigan. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only golf <b>course</b> to feature an arboretum. <b>The</b> original <b>course</b> <b>was</b> designed by W. Bruce Matthews. <b>The</b> West <b>course</b> <b>was</b> opened in 1958. <b>The</b> West <b>Course</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most challenging of the two, and <b>the</b> East <b>course</b> <b>is</b> a par-72 <b>course</b> since its redesign in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Eton Summer <b>Course</b> <b>is</b> {{a three-week}} <b>course</b> for Chinese {{students}} at Eton College in England. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> has <b>been</b> run every summer since 2005.

5|$|Loper was {{appointed}} to the United States Military Academy at West Point from Nebraska and entered on 14 June 1917. However, due to World War I, <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> truncated and his class was graduated early on 1 November 1918. He was ranked sixth in the class, two places behind Alfred Gruenther, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} to be as spectator-friendly as possible. The athletes passed through the main grandstand area 12 times. The men's triathlon {{was one of the}} few events with free viewing points.|$|E
5|$|The {{profile for}} the first road race stage was largely flat, with two small climbs coming {{about two-thirds of the}} way in. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> easterly, heading from the start town of Carrara to the frazione of Indicatore in Arezzo.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> SM100 <b>course</b> {{starts and}} {{finishes}} in Stokesville Campground near the Stokesville Observatory.

5|$|In 1973, Biko had {{enrolled}} for a {{law degree}} by correspondence from the University of South Africa. He passed several exams, but had not completed the degree at his time of death. His performance on <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> poor; he was absent from several exams and failed his Practical Afrikaans module. The state security services repeatedly sought to intimidate him; he received anonymous threatening phone calls, and gun shots were fired at his house. A {{group of young men}} calling themselves 'The Cubans' began guarding him from these attacks. The security services detained him four times, once for 101 days. With the ban preventing him from gaining employment, the strained economic situation impacted his marriage.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{there was}} also severe wind damage in Palm Beach. A few {{buildings}} constructed by Henry Flagler, such as The Breakers, the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and Whitehall were damaged. At the Royal Poinciana, the hotel's botanical garden, which contained hundreds of exotic trees and plants, was almost completely destroyed. The golf club suffered severe roof damage, while <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> flooded with several inches to several feet of water. Waves inundated and swept away the foliage and trees {{at the house of}} J. Leonard Replogle.|$|E
5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> a 50 mi out-and-back dogleg, {{starting}} at 10200 ft. The centerpiece of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> climb up to Hope Pass at 12620 ft, encountered {{on both the}} outbound trek and on the return.|$|R
50|$|Rim Rock Farm is a {{historic}} cross country <b>course.</b> <b>The</b> cross country <b>course</b> <b>is</b> renowned for its two covered bridges as part of <b>the</b> <b>course.</b> <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> located at 2276 Burnett Lane, Lawrence, Kansas.|$|R

5|$|The lengthy {{individual}} {{time trial}} featured a climb {{in the middle}} of it, but no KOM points were on offer. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> technical and featured several turnarounds. It was the same course that was raced four times in stage eight, except that the finish line was not situated at the same place. Midway through the stage, the riders took on the difficulty of the day, the -long Liebewill. There were other small climbs to pepper the course.|$|E
5|$|Worthington {{built the}} Buckwood Inn, an {{exclusive}} resort, with an eighteen-hole golf course designed by A. W. Tillinghast. This {{later became the}} Shawnee Country Club. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> completed around 1910. In 1913, John McDermott won the Shawnee Open golf tournament at Shawnee-on-Delaware, ahead of top Englishmen Harry Vardon and Ted Ray. After trying unsuccessfully to keep the fairways in shape by grazing sheep on them, Worthington designed the gang mower with three moving wheels. He launched the Shawnee Mower Factory to manufacture it.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{returned}} to Washington Barracks {{to attend the}} Engineer School but his course was interrupted by the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> abruptly terminated and Somervell, along with hundreds of other junior officers, was ordered to appear before an examination board that would determine his fitness for promotion. Following a favorable report from the board, Somervell was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. He helped organize the 15th Engineers, a rail transport unit, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas, arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month. The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects, including a munitions dump at Mehun-sur-Yèvre and an advanced depot and regulating station at Is-sur-Tille. Somervell got his projects completed by working his men around the clock and deploying every available resource regardless of the cost. For his role, Somervell was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{founding}} the Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell saw {{the need}} for leader training. Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire. Baden-Powell wanted practical training in the outdoors in campsites. World War I delayed the development of leader training, so the first formal Wood Badge course was not offered until 1919. Gilwell Park, just outside London, was purchased specifically to provide a venue for the course and the Opening Ceremonies were held on July 26, 1919. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief at Gilwell Park, conducted the first Wood Badge course there from September 8–19, 1919. It was produced by Percy Everett, the Commissioner of Training, and Baden-Powell himself gave lectures. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> attended by 18 participants, and other lecturers. After this first course, Wood Badge training continued at Gilwell Park, and it became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year. Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E
5|$|The first {{training}} courses at No.3 EFTS were not conducted by RAAF instructors {{under the auspices}} of EATS but by Essendon's civil organisations under government contract. The training aircraft were privately owned deHavilland Tiger Moths and Gipsy Moths. All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by Squadron Leader King. The initial intake of sixteen students arrived on 8January 1940, and received eight weeks of instruction that finished on 4March; {{all but one of the}} trainees had prior flying experience, and <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>was</b> accident-free. The next student intake at No.3 EFTS arrived on 5February 1940. The school's inaugural EATS course commenced in May. Overall student numbers at this time were reported as being 48, while staff totalled 50. The second EATS course began in July. By this time, Essendon's civilian presence had effectively been absorbed by the military organisation; privately owned aircraft were taken over by the RAAF, which had also begun employing its own aircraft, the first being a Gipsy Moth that arrived in March. Training accidents were frequent, particularly during landings, but did not result in any fatalities.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> {{fast and}} flat {{with only one}} minor {{elevation}} change of 28 ft at around mile eight. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> offers ten miles (16 km) of oceanfront views and over 30,000 spectators. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> also USAT&F Certified, making it a qualifier for the Boston Marathon.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> located 1.5km west of {{the town}} centre. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> an oval right handed track of one and a quarter miles with 6 flights of hurdles and 7 steeplechase fences in each circuit with a steep uphill finish.|$|R
