2500|$|In {{assembly}} {{the bare}} board is populated (or [...] "stuffed") with electronic components {{to form a}} functional printed circuit assembly (PCA), [...] sometimes called a [...] "printed circuit board assembly" [...] (PCBA). In through-hole technology, the component leads are inserted in holes surrounded by conductive pads; the holes keep the components in place. In surface-mount technology (SMT), the component {{is placed on the}} PCB so that the pins line up with the conductive pads or lands on the surfaces of the PCB; solder paste, which was previously applied to the pads, holds the components in place; if surface-mount components are applied to both sides of the board, the bottom-side components are glued to the board. In both <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> and surface mount, the components are then soldered.|$|E
2500|$|Subtractive methods remove copper from {{an entirely}} {{copper-coated}} board to leave only the desired copper pattern. [...] In additive methods {{the pattern is}} electroplated onto a bare substrate using a complex process. The advantage of the additive method is that less material is needed and less waste is produced. In the full additive process the bare laminate {{is covered with a}} photosensitive film which is imaged (exposed to light through a mask and then developed which removes the unexposed film). [...] The exposed areas are sensitized in a chemical bath, usually containing palladium and similar to that used for <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> plating which makes the exposed area capable of bonding metal ions. [...] The laminate is then plated with copper in the sensitized areas. [...] When the mask is stripped, the PCB is finished.|$|E

60|$|She {{slightly}} {{moved the}} door. The {{interior of the}} brewhouse was wrapped in gloom, but a streak of light fell towards her in a line across the floor from the inner or workshop door, which was not quite closed. This light was unexpected, none having been visible <b>through</b> <b>hole</b> or crevice. Glancing in, the woman found that he had placed cloths and mats at the various apertures, and hung a sack at the window to prevent the egress of a single ray. She could also perceive from where she stood that the bar of light fell across the brewing-copper just outside the inner door, and that upon it lay the key of her bedroom. The illuminated interior of the workshop was also partly visible from her position through the two half-open doors. Manston was engaged in emptying a large cupboard of the tools, gallipots, and old iron it contained. When it was quite cleared he took a chisel, and with it began to withdraw the hooks and shoulder-nails holding the cupboard to the wall. All these being loosened, he extended his arms, lifted the cupboard bodily from the brackets under it, and deposited {{it on the floor}} beside him.|$|E

50|$|A <b>through</b> <b>hole,</b> also {{thru-hole}} or clearance hole, {{refers to}} a hole that is reamed, drilled, milled etc., completely through the material of an object.

40|$|In this report, Silicon wafer based multi-layered {{print circuit}} board is presented. The {{developed}} stacked circuit board {{will lead to}} realization of 3 dimensional MEMS packaging. The <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches were formed by ICP Si deep etching and the stacked layered structure was prepared with Si fusion bonding of ICP etched wafers. Metal was filled into ICP fabricated <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches to make electrical feed through. Four Silicon wafers with ICP <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> are aligned and successfully joined by fusion bonding. The target application of this work is multi-layered Silicon based print circuit board. The electrical feed through was fabricated by injecting the Ag (80 wt%) + Cu(20 wt %) mixed with binder, low melting temperature metal, and Ag electrical conductive paste into the small diameter <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> and trenches in oxidized Silicon wafer stacked structure. A multi-component binder system comprising of EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate 35 wt%) + PW (Paraffin Wax 65 wt%) was used. Super critical debinding method is applied prior to final sintering process. The ratio of metal powder and binder was optimized. Low melting point metal and electrical conductive paste filling methods were also tried by injection and vacuum extraction. SEM observation shows that the <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> are filled with metal for a single wafer. However we have still difficulty in filling the metal into four wafers stacked layer. The electrical conductivity test was sufficient between top and bottom. Several feed through formation methods have been proposed...|$|R
