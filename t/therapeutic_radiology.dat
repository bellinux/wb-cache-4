30|$|In {{an era of}} “personalised” medicine, {{in which}} {{decisions}} and practice are tailored to the individual patient in whatever ways possible (systematic use of genetic or other personal information to optimise the patient’s preventative and <b>therapeutic</b> care), <b>radiology</b> is also becoming “personalised” [5]. On the other hand, the concept of “patient-centred” medicine is developing (care designed to suit patient’s and not doctor’s needs, shared decision-making, patient governance, mutual commitment to quality and health outcomes) [6] and “patient-centred” radiology is evolving as well [7, 8].|$|R

Results: The Interventions was technically successful in 92. 6 % of the cases. Peri- and post interventional complications occurred in 17. 1 %. 5. 3 % were classified as major class according to the SCVIR.

40|$|Sir Brian Windeyer was {{professor}} of <b>radiology</b> (<b>therapeutic)</b> from 1942 to 1969, and dean from 1954 to 1967, at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School. He {{also served as}} dean of the Faculty of Medicine of London University from 1964 to 1968, and then vice-chancellor of the University from 1969 to 1972. Sir Brian begins the interview by discussing his Australian family background, education at Sydney Church of England Grammar School, and medical studies at the University of Sydney, where {{he was also a}} keen sportsman, rowing in the college crew and playing rugby in the university team. Sir Brian then talks of interviewing prospective medical students when he was dean at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School, and of how the admission policy did not rely solely on examination results. The interview moves to the period when he was dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of London and the discussions that took place about possible mergers of the medical schools within the University. The interview then returns to his early career and Sir Brian talks of the two-year period as an assistant at the Fondation Curie, Paris, after leaving the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, where he worked in house jobs and as a radium registrar, after qualifying in 1927. He speaks of meeting Marie Curie at the Fondation Curie, and training under the direction of Claudius Regaud, one of the pioneers of radiotherapy. The interview then progresses to Sir Brian's distinguished career in radiotherapy at the Middlesex Hospital. In 1931 he was appointed radium officer at the Middlesex Hospital and he became the medical officer in charge of the Meyerstein Institute of Radiotherapy, which was created in 1936. During the war he was director of the emergency medical service radiotherapy department at Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex, and after the war he became director of the Meyerstein Institute and of the radiotherapy department at Mount Vernon Hospital. He was made the first {{professor of}} <b>radiology</b> (<b>therapeutic)</b> at the Middlesex Hospital in 1942. In the interview Sir Brian discusses with Sir Gordon Wolstenholme some aspects of radiotherapy {{during the early years of}} its development in the UK.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Acute lower {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding (LGIB) {{is a common}} indication for emergency hospitalisation worldwide. In contrast to upper GIB, patient characteristics, modes of investigation, transfusion, treatment and outcomes are poorly described. There are minimal clinical guidelines to inform care pathways {{and the use of}} endoscopy, including (diagnostic and <b>therapeutic</b> yields), interventional <b>radiology</b> and surgery are poorly defined. As a result, there is potential for wide variation in practice and clinical outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The UK Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding Audit is a large nationwide audit of adult patients acutely admitted with LGIB or those who develop LGIB while hospitalised for another reason. Consecutive, unselected presentations with LGIB will be enrolled prospectively over a 2 -month period at the end of 2015 and detailed data will be collected on patient characteristics, comorbidities, use of anticoagulants, transfusion, timing and modalities of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, clinical outcome, length of stay and mortality. These will be audited against predefined minimum standards of care for LGIB. It is anticipated that over 80 % of all acute hospitals in England and some hospitals in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will participate. Data will be collected on the availability and organisation of care, provision of diagnostic and therapeutic GI endoscopy, interventional radiology, surgery and transfusion protocols. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This audit will be conducted as part of the national comparative audit programme of blood transfusion through collaboration with specialists in gastroenterology, surgery and interventional radiology. Individual reports will be provided to each participant site as well as an overall report and disseminated through specialist societies. Results will also be published in peer-reviewed journals. The study has been funded by National Health Services (NHS) Blood and Transplant and the Bowel Disease Research Foundation and endorsed by the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland...|$|R
