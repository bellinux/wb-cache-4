5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's commitment <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> {{accordance with}} his or her moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> that way.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> the best interests of Norway and decided to use this {{as a starting point for}} the defence.|$|E

Once established, the 2/6th then led the way back west towards Bitoi Ridge, ranging ahead of the Americans as the Allies began to {{encircle}} Mubo. In early July, the 2/7th attacked Observation Hill and as the Japanese began to withdraw from Mubo, the 2/5th was sent north <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> support of the newly arrived Militia 15th Brigade, which was moving on Bobdubi Ridge. In mid-July, amidst heavy close-quarters fighting, the 2/5th Infantry Battalion captured the southern parts of Mount Tambu.|$|E

Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not feel that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is not often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> the Telugu films.|$|E

By the time Monty Python went on tour in 1973, Chapman's drinking had begun to affect his performance, causing him to miss cues to go on stage.

DragonFly's messaging subsystem has the ability <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, and attempts to use this capability to achieve the best performance possible in any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Every five years, two censors {{were elected}} for an eighteen-month term. Since the {{censorship}} {{was the most}} prestigious of all offices, usually only former consuls were elected to it. Censors were elected by the assembly of Roman Soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly, usually after the new consuls and praetors for the year began their term. After the censors had been elected, the Centuriate Assembly granted the new censors censorial power. Censors did not have imperium powers, {{and they were not}} accompanied by any lictors. In addition, they did not have the power to convene the Roman Senate or Roman assemblies. Technically they outranked all other ordinary magistrates (including consuls and praetors). This ranking, however, was solely a result of their prestige, rather than any real power they had. Since the office could be easily abused (as a result of its power over every ordinary citizen), only former consuls (usually patrician consuls) were elected to the office. This is what gave the office its prestige. Their actions could not be vetoed by any magistrate other than a plebeian tribune, or a fellow censor. No other ordinary magistrate could veto a censor because no ordinary magistrate technically outranked a censor. Tribunes, by virtue of their sacrosanctity as the representatives of the people, could veto anything or anyone. Censors usually did not have <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> unison, but if a censor wanted to reduce the status of a citizen in a census, he had <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> unison with his colleague.|$|E

Though {{there is no}} statutory definition of this obligation <b>to</b> <b>act</b> “dutifully and <b>in</b> good faith”, {{it has been suggested}} that it requires principals and agents <b>to</b> <b>act</b> [...] "with honesty, openness and regard for the interests of the other party to the transaction".|$|R
5|$|Filming {{took place}} at Saint Hilda's Primary School, Presbyterian High School and other {{locations}} during the school holidays in June. Neo hired real gangsters <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> several gangster scenes as he was dissatisfied with the extras. According to him, communicating with the gangsters was difficult, but {{when he decided to}} apply the lessons from the movie and praised them for a good take, they reacted well. Several members of the cast also said that I Not Stupid Too inspired them to communicate better with their family members. On 26 January 2006, distributor United International Pictures released I Not Stupid Too on 36 screens in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> the film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E

In her feature film debut, McDougal's character, Jessemina, is a slave girl who is forced into fighting as a female gladiator in an Ancient Roman colony by its corrupt governor. The role offered McDougal her first opportunity <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> a dramatic role and to demonstrate her physical abilities with the movie's sword fighting sequences. The movie, initially titled Gladiatrix was deemed to be a knockoff of Gladiator. Although the movie was not well received, it {{has turned into a}} lesser known cult film.|$|E

5|$|One action RPG that avoided these {{limitations}} is Deus Ex (2000), designed by Warren Spector.

Players were challenged <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> character through dialog choices appropriate {{to his or her}} chosen role, and by intelligent use of the surrounding environment. This produced a unique experience that was tailored to each player. According to Spector, the game's dialogue choices were inspired by a console role-playing game, Suikoden.|$|E
