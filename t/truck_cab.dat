25|$|Lack of {{exercise}} is another contributing factor to the obesity epidemic {{in the truck}} driver population. Almost 90% of truck drivers exercise only sometimes or never and only 8% exercise regularly. This is largely determined by long work hours and tight deadlines, {{the adoption of a}} sedentary lifestyle and a lack of a place to exercise. Though some fitness resources are available for truckers, most are scarce. Available areas are truck stops, highway rest areas, trucking terminals, warehouses, and the <b>truck</b> <b>cab.</b> However, there are many parking restrictions and safety concerns in trying to incorporate exercise into the daily routine.|$|E
500|$|Developments in {{satellite}} technology have fostered increased communication and productivity within the trucking industry. Drivers may input {{the information from}} a bill of lading into a simple text-only dot matrix display screen (commonly called a [...] "Qualcomm", for their ubiquitous OmniTRACS system). This allows the driver to communicate with their dispatcher, who is normally responsible for determining and informing the driver of their pick-up and drop-off locations. Drivers are no longer required to find the nearest public phone in order to relay information regarding their load status, {{it can be done}} without leaving the <b>truck</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E
500|$|Trucks of the 1930s and 1940s {{included}} a 1937 Ford tow truck, a 1940 Dodge VK, a 1940 Mack FN, a 1941 Federal Model 25K and a 1942 Dodge WC-21. The 1950s' vehicles were {{represented by a}} 1952 Diamond T 950RSa, 1955 IH DFC405 and a 1955 GMC Model 860. Later vehicles included two Autocar Company trucks, a 1962 DC75T and a 1974 DC9364 10-wheel dump truck. The 1963 Mack B61 was of special importance to the founder Richard Guerrera who acquired the truck with {{the purchase of a}} local company, Oil Transport. Guerrera sold the truck and reacquired the same vehicle in 1985 to restore it. This Mack B61 was described as the [...] "impetus" [...] for the museum. Also on display was a 1996 Volvo prototype <b>truck</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E

500|$|The fight {{scenes in}} the town were filmed in Kairouan, while Ford was {{suffering}} from dysentery. Stuntman Terry Richards had practiced for weeks with his sword to create the scripted fight scene, choreographing a fight between the swordsman and Jones' whip. However, after filming the initial shots of the scene, after lunch due to Ford's dysentery, Ford and Spielberg agreed to cut the scene down to a gunshot, with Ford saying to Spielberg [...] "Let's just shoot the sucker". It was later voted in at No.5 on Playboy magazine's list of best all time scenes. Most of the truck chase was shot by second unit director Michael D. Moore following Spielberg's storyboards, including Indiana being dragged by the truck (performed by stuntman Terry Leonard), in tribute to a famous Yakima Canutt stunt. Spielberg then filmed all the shots with Ford himself {{in and around the}} <b>truck</b> <b>cab.</b> Lucas directed a few other second unit shots, in particular the monkey giving the Nazi salute.|$|E
500|$|When not driving, {{truck drivers}} need to idle their engines to {{maintain}} climate control within the <b>truck</b> <b>cab</b> (interior), {{as well as}} provide electricity for appliances. Engine idling is inefficient and only adds to the problem of air pollution. This unnecessary idling can be remedied with shore power (which is a term and idea borrowed from the shipping industry), or Truck Stop Electrification. When ships are docked in a port, they connect to a land-based power supply to provide electricity and eliminate the need to idle their engines. The idea of shore power was transferred to the trucking industry, and now there are companies such as IdleAire and Shorepower which provide electricity to diesel trucks, which eliminates the need for the driver to idle the engine. IdleAire also provides access to the Internet, cable television, and land line phone services. IdleAire promises to eliminate one-eighth of nitrogen oxide pollution through [...] "electrified parking", however, particulate pollution may increase in those areas where the electricity is provided by coal burning power plants. Some drivers are also experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells, which provide clean and silent power for appliances when trucks are not running.|$|E
2500|$|The {{successor}} to the successful Series I was the Series II, which saw a production run from 1958 to 1961. It came in [...] and [...] wheelbases (normally {{referred to as the}} 'SWB' and 'LWB'). This was the first Land Rover to receive the attention of Rover's styling department- Chief Stylist David Bache produced the familiar 'barrel side' waistline to cover the vehicle's wider track and the improved design of the <b>truck</b> <b>cab</b> variant, introducing the curved side windows and rounded roof still used on current Land Rovers. The Series II was the first vehicle to use the well-known 2.25-litre petrol engine, although the first 1,500 or so short wheelbase (SWB) models retained the [...] 2.0-litre petrol engine from the Series I. This larger petrol engine produced [...] and was closely related to the 2.0-litre diesel unit still in use. This engine became the standard Land Rover unit until the mid-1980s when diesel engines became more popular.|$|E
5000|$|The {{same basic}} design family {{was used for}} all of its trucks {{including}} the Suburban, panel trucks, canopy express and cab overs. The cab overs used the same basic cab configuration and similar grille but used a shorter and taller hood and different fenders. The unique Cab Over fenders and hood required a custom cowl area which makes the Cab Over Engine <b>cabs</b> and normal <b>truck</b> <b>cabs</b> incompatible with one another while all <b>truck</b> <b>cabs</b> of all weights interchange.|$|R

2500|$|Truck stops such as rest {{areas and}} welcome centers are centers for sex trafficking. [...] They are often {{geographically}} isolated and {{insulated from the}} communities, {{making it easier for}} traffickers and customers to avoid detection and harder for victims to escape. [...] The transient nature of truck stops makes it easier for traffickers to frequently relocate without arousing suspicion and attracts a customer base of men who have been traveling and are in search of commercial sex. [...] Truck stops have both individual pimps who are constantly relocating their victims and brothels that have a use local businesses, [...] typically massage parlors, as store fronts. [...] Traffickers often force their victims to advertise over CB radio, knock on <b>truck</b> <b>cab</b> doors, or directly offer services to customers. Victims also may be forced to walk down the tarmac, and customers will flash their lights if they are interested. [...] Customers may also solicit services on their CB radio by asking for commercial company.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{presents}} {{data from}} a large-scale anthropometric study of U. S. truck drivers and the multivariate anthropometric models developed {{for the design of}} next-generation <b>truck</b> <b>cabs.</b> BackgroundUp-to-date anthropometric information of the U. S. truck driver population is needed for the design of safe and ergonomically efficient <b>truck</b> <b>cabs.</b> MethodWe collected 35 anthropometric dimensions for 1, 950 truck drivers (1, 779 males and 171 females) across the continental United States using a sampling plan designed to capture the appropriate ethnic, gender, and age distributions of the truck driver population. ResultsTruck drivers are heavier than the U. S. general population, with a difference in mean body weight of 13. 5 kg for males and 15. 4 kg for females. They are also different in physique from the U. S. general population. In addition, the current truck drivers are heavier and different in physique compared to their counterparts of 25 to 30 years ago. ConclusionThe data obtained in this study provide more accurate anthropometric information for cab designs than do the current U. S. general population data or truck driver data collected 25 to 30 years ago. Multivariate anthropometric models, spanning 95 % of the current truck driver population {{on the basis of a}} set of 12 anthropometric measurements, have been developed to facilitate future cab designs. ApplicationThe up-to-date truck driver anthropometric data and multivariate anthropometric models will benefit the design of future <b>truck</b> <b>cabs</b> which, in turn, will help promote the safety and health of the U. S. truck drivers. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 01 - 04 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23156628 PMC 469884...|$|R
