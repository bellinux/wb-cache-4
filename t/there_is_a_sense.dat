25|$|There {{are many}} {{religions}} being {{followed by the}} people of this city. Usually <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of harmony and co-existence without incident. However, there have been situations in the past in which this delicate social fabric has broken down. Today the city {{is considered to be a}} great example of communal equality.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{in which}} this kind of {{additivity}} expresses a fundamental postulate {{that goes beyond the}} simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author {{goes so far as to}} say that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.|$|E

25|$|Klingons see {{something}} that isn't growing as something that is dying. A Klingon fights not for sport but to gain an advantage for the Empire, for his family and for himself. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of paranoia, as others are constantly watching all one's activities in order to seek advancement. This leads to a morality that Federation races see as often cruel and remorseless.|$|E
25|$|Croatian, Portuguese and Italian fishing families, {{many of them}} Catholic, founded San Pedro. Content {{with the}} beauty of the hills rising from the harbor, they built their homes, their church, their {{businesses}} and dutifully produced large families to do the same. More than 100 years later, some of their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren live in those family homes, work still on the docks or in town and worship still at Mary Star of the Sea. The town's population has remained steady for the last two decades, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of continuity that is palpable in this town, an intimacy--among the people, and between the people and the place.|$|E
25|$|Lyrical {{abstraction}} shares similarities {{with color}} field painting and abstract expressionism {{especially in the}} freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from abstract expressionism and action painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.|$|E
60|$|It was {{all very}} {{pleasant}} and genuine; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of ease and peacefulness, {{quite different from the}} mechanical, slightly sullen manoeuvring of the Germans.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of irony}} to CBS' {{coverage}} of the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy gave an interview with Cronkite, helping CBS inaugurate network television's first half hour evening newscast.|$|R
60|$|Violet blushed excessively, {{and made}} some inarticulate disavowals. She felt it {{presumption}} to let her name be coupled with Miss Martindale's, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of something dangerous and wrong in expecting admiration.|$|R
25|$|The pair were {{nominated}} for the Turner Prize in 1999, cited for their exhibition, Gamma at the Lisson Gallery in London. On the run up to the Turner Prize winner announcement, they also had a solo exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London (1999). Art works that were exhibited included Stasi City, Parliament (A Third House), and Gamma, a multiscreen video installation that was filmed at the former US military base at Greenham Common in Berkshire. This site was used to house nuclear cruise missiles during the Cold War and decommissioned in 1992. The Wilsons' video moves through the deserted institution, where nothing is now happening, evoking disturbing memories and possibilities. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of unease and threat, implied but never realised. They are the only characters in the film, appearing in military-style skirts and polished black shoes.|$|E

25|$|In Livy’s account <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{that the}} peace with the Samnites {{had been on a}} thin edge for years. It has also to be noted that Cales was in an {{important}} strategic position not only for the route from Rome to Capua but also for some of the routes which gave access to the mountains of Samnium. Yet the Samnites had not responded militarily to Roman interventions in Campania. One factor might have been the conflict between the Lucanians (the Samnites’ southerly neighbours) and the Greek city of Taras (Tarentum in Latin, modern Taranto) on the Ionian Sea. The Tarentines called for the help of the Greek king Alexander of Epirus, who crossed over to Italy in 334 BC. In 332 BC Alexander landed at Paestum, which was close to Samnium and Campania. The Samnites joined the Lucanians and the two were defeated by Alexander, who then established friendly relations with Rome. However, Alexander was killed in battle in 331 or 330 BC. The grievance of the Samnites about Fregellae might have been an addition to aggravations caused by Roman policy in Campania in the previous eight years.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of mission}} and {{excitement}} at the Mint, {{and it was}} the same thing here at the Institute. We were banded together by a common purpose—and by the sheer terror of it all.|$|R
6000|$|These remarks {{checked her}} intention. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{weakness}} in following them {{by saying that}} she had just met her husband by appointment. [...] "Then you would advise me not to communicate with him?" [...] she observed.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of motion, <b>a</b> {{very slight}} jar, and Robert, without moving from his seat, was {{conscious}} {{that the room}} had vanished, and that a large arched oaken door stood in the place which it had occupied.|$|R
25|$|Chimnabai I was {{knowledgeable}} in Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music, {{and brought}} a troupe with her comprising two dancers, two nattuvanars (leaders of Bharatanatyam concerts) and two teachers (Khandwani 2002). Others followed later, including Nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, {{two members of the}} Tanjore Quartet. After the death of Appaswamy in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Guru Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar, left Baroda to teach in Lucknow, and then worked in the film industry in South India until Sayajirao's successor, Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad recalled the family to Baroda in 1949 to teach in the Music Department in the Kalavan Palace, later absorbed into the Maharaja Sayajirao University (Gaston 1996: 158-160). Later Guruvarya Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar established his own Institute, the Tanjore Dance Music & Art Research Centre at Baroda with his son Guru Shri Ramesh Tanjorkar and Guru Smt. Leela R. Tanjorkar (Kubernath Tanjorkar's family is devoted to Bharatnatyam dance now including their grandsons Rajesh and Ashish). So {{what we have here is}} a tradition of very distinguished Bharatanatyam dancers and teachers, members of a family considered an offshoot of the Tanjore Quartet bani (stylistic schools; Gaston 1996: 159), already established in Gujarat by the time Mrinalini set up her own academy. Yet <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that what she did was not new.|$|E
500|$|Steve Redgrave, {{vice-president}} of the BOA, added [...] "I don't think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of disappointmentI think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of celebration of winning that gold medal. I would take one gold medal over five bronze medals any day." [...] Hunt also {{announced that the}} BOA would conduct a strategic review of funding and may support the channeling of more funds towards realistic medal hopes.|$|E
500|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{in which}} some {{multiples}} of 2 are [...] "more even" [...] than others. Multiples of 4 are called doubly even, since they can be divided by 2 twice. Not only is zero divisible by 4, zero has the unique property of being divisible by every power of 2, so it surpasses all other numbers in [...] "evenness".|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{violation}} in the air, as if {{too much}} was said, the unforgivable. Yet Ursula was concerned now only with solving her own problems, {{in the light}} of his words. She was pale and abstracted.|$|R

500|$|In {{a special}} {{commentary}} for Hamasaki's compilation album A Ballads (2003), where a third {{version of the}} track is included, she stated that the lyrical content was written in third person perspective, a trait that is shared {{with the rest of}} the album's tracks. She stated that the song is about the third person watching a happy and loving relationship: [...] "It's about lovers who appear to be happy and are living each day in their usual way. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that a third person is watching from a distance." [...] The song's title is loosely based on the album's title Loveppears, which was originally planned to be called [...] "Lovers Appear".|$|E
500|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation has {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly has called it [...] "a cult hit", and The New York Times named it [...] "Tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD (The best teen TV in the world)". Of the first season, The Ottawa Citizens Tony Atherton had mixed {{feelings of the}} new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since... <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of déjà vu {{with regards to the}} plots and characters". He did, however, praise the show for having [...] "the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [...] ".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the development}} of Super Mario Sunshine with producer Takashi Tezuka and directors Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kenta Usui, it was mentioned that the game's development began with the idea of gameplay involving a water pump. However, at first the developers thought that the world was too daringly out of character with Mario. Therefore, they tried using a man-type character, but thought this was too odd and that [...] "if there was a man next to Mario, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of incongruity." [...] There were ten candidates for possible water nozzles, and FLUDD was chosen because of fitting in the game's setting, despite it not being one of the favorites. They also stated that several Yoshi features were omitted, such as Yoshi vomiting water fed to him.|$|E
60|$|He {{answered}} dreamily, and sluggishly, reluctantly, as if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of repose in him {{which he}} disliked to break by putting {{any of his}} sensations into words.

30|$|A {{space between}} two trees {{revealed}} {{an expanse of}} lawn. For the first time, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of distance and on the horizon one could see a dwelling place: low-roofed, broad, and so green in color that it almost melted into the countryside.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not quite}} so dark; and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> as of open country {{stretching}} out {{to the limits of}} the horizon. Overhead a vague greyish light suffused the sky, and the wind swept the clouds in great rolling banks right across that light.|$|R
500|$|Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} of the new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since", adding that because there is [...] "little ground left to break in teen drama <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of déjà vu {{with regards to the}} plots and characters". He did, however, praise the show for having [...] "the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [...] It is light years from far-fetched high-school melodramas like Boston Public and Dawson's Creek ... is every bit as good as its beloved predecessor. In fact, in some respects it is even better".|$|E
500|$|The {{texts and}} images of the Book of the Dead were magical as well as religious. Magic was as {{legitimate}} an activity as praying to the gods, even when the magic was aimed at controlling the gods themselves. Indeed, there was little distinction for the Ancient Egyptians between magical and religious practice. The concept of magic (heka) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word. [...] The act of speaking a ritual formula {{was an act of}} creation; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> in which action and speech were one and the same thing. The magical power of words extended to the written word. Hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by the god Thoth, and the hieroglyphs themselves were powerful. Written words conveyed the full force of a spell. This was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted, as often occurred in later Book of the Dead scrolls, particularly if the accompanying images were present. The Egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it; thus, the Book of the Dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife, giving him power over them.|$|E
500|$|The Spectator {{was more}} equivocal in its {{appraisal}} of She. The review described the narrative as [...] "very stirring" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] and of [...] "remarkable imaginative power", adding: [...] "The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, {{and from the}} day when Leo and Holly land {{on the coast of}} Africa, to the day when the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: [...] "To the present writer <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of the ludicrous in the end of She that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story". Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that [...] "in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, she lifts herself up against the Omnipotent. Therefore, at the appointed time she is swept away by It... Vengeance, more heavy because more long delayed, strikes her in her proudest part – her beauty".|$|E
6000|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Moral <b>sense,</b> and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> Immoral <b>Sense.</b> History {{shows us}} that the Moral Sense enables us to {{perceive}} morality and how to avoid it, and that the Immoral Sense enables us to perceive immorality and how to enjoy it.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> by the CFA, however, {{that work}} on the statue groups was {{proceeding}} so well that the commission might approve the work before the full-size models were complete. Consequently, the commission visited Fraser's Westport, Connecticut, studio on October 24, 1932, and approved his models.|$|R
