5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{meets his}} girlfriend Elisa's {{grandmother}} (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother {{does not like}} Jack because he reminds her of the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor who plays the Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, {{his role as the}} Generalissimo allows him <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> line at Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack by making the character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, but makes one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage of pictures of Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of Matt Lauer.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} has been cracking down on unregulated mining operations, which account for almost 80percent of the country's 16,000mines. The closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half {{the average number of}} miners killed, to about six a day, {{in the first six months}} of this year, the {{government has}} said. Major gas explosions in coal mines remain a problem, though the number of accidents and deaths have gradually declined year by year, the chief of the State Administration of Work Safety, Luo Lin, told a national conference in September.|$|E
25|$|The miners {{were able}} to survive by {{drinking}} groundwater, seeping through the rock overhead, which they had collected in their helmets. Webb also had a muesli bar with him, which he offered <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half and share with Russell. The men initially agreed to wait 24 hours to eat it, but they continually extended the time, until they decided to eat it on 29 April. They then ate small pieces of the bar at a time, to make it {{last as long as}} possible. However, Russell later lost a large portion of his half of the bar when it fell out of his pocket.|$|E

50|$|On October 19, 2009, {{the three}} {{candidates}} for City Council - Vallone, Serpe and Populist Party candidate Gerald F. Kahn - {{engaged in a}} public debate. Serpe affirmed a number of her positions, including opposition <b>to</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> mass transit, particularly Access-a-Ride; support for a Newtown pedestrian plaza; opposition <b>to</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> funding <b>to</b> schools; support for downzoning; and support for making the community's streets safer and more sustainable.|$|R

25|$|Then on 21 April, off Cape St. Nicholas in San Domingo, Reindeer {{captured}} the French privateer schooner Creole. She was pierced for 14 guns but only mounted six, not including swivel guns. She had {{a crew of}} 59 and had put another 16 men on prizes. Creole {{had a reputation for}} being the fastest vessel in those waters; Fyffe believed that he would not have caught her if Creole's captain had not been so confident that he could outrun Reindeer that he tried <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> front of her bow to gain the wind. Reindeer also destroyed another small privateer of two guns. The crew, however, escaped.|$|E
500|$|Finally, the Deetzes and Maitlands {{agree to}} live in harmony within the house. Betelgeuse is stuck in the afterlife waiting room; there he {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> front of a witch doctor, who shrinks his head in retaliation. Being Betelgeuse, however, he remains upbeat: [...] "This {{could be a good}} look for me". Meanwhile, Adam, Barbara, and Lydia are seen in a remodeled part of the house dancing to Harry Belafonte's [...] "Jump In The Line" [...] (with Lydia floating in the air) to celebrate Lydia getting an [...] "A" [...] on her math test at school.|$|E
500|$|Investigations {{were held}} in various states, {{including}} Arkansas, Michigan, and Missouri, which led to lawsuits that accused brokers of illegally reselling tickets from the Best of Both Worlds Tour. [...] "When you allow the hijacking of the market, it's literally the worst of both worlds. You get charged too much, and there's no access for the locals", said Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon. Numerous ticket brokers accessed tickets prior to fans {{as a result of}} a software program by RMG Technologies Inc, which permitted its clients to circumvent Ticketmaster.com's CAPTCHA access controls, and use the copyrighted website in a manner that violated the site's [...] "Terms of Use". Ticketmaster took legal action against RMG Technologies via the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claiming that the developed software for ticket brokers illegally [...] "allows them <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> line". RMG Technologies representative denied the allegations and said they should not be held accountable because Ticketmaster is getting still paid for the tickets. [...] "This may be the only time in history that any seller sued its customers for paying them too much money", the attorney for RMG Technologies wrote in court documents.|$|E

2500|$|Fast Lane is Canada's Wonderland's [...] 'two line' system since 2012, {{which is}} also {{implemented}} at other Cedar Fair parks. For a cost between $55 and $65 (in addition to normal admission charges), visitors receive a wrist band {{that enables them to}} bypass the 'normal-wait' line and enter the 'Fast Lane'. Opting for this benefit essentially allows purchasers <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> {{at the front of the}} line on 18 of the most popular attractions without waiting. In 2013, the park introduced Fast Lane Plus, which allowed purchasers to bypass the lines of additional attractions that standard Fast Lane users would not have access to. An unspecified limited amount of both types of passes are sold each day.|$|E
2500|$|Vang further {{testified that}} Joseph Crotteau {{deserved}} to die [...] "because he {{accused me of}} giving him the finger and tried <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> front of me to stop me from leaving." [...] And Laski deserved to die {{because he had a}} gun, he said. Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski [...] "deserved to die," [...] his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.|$|E
2500|$|With Landis again directing, {{the sequel}} to The Blues Brothers was made in 1998. It fared {{considerably}} worse than its predecessor with fans and critics, though it is more ambitious in terms of musical performances by the band and has a more extensive roster of guest artists than the first film. The story picks up 18 years later with Elwood being released from prison, and learning that his brother has died. He is once again prevailed upon to save some orphans, and with a 10-year-old boy named Buster Blues (J. Evan Bonifant) in tow, Elwood again sets about the task of reuniting his band. He recruits some new singers, Mighty Mack (John Goodman) and Cab (Joe Morton), a policeman who was Curtis' son. All the original band members are found, {{as well as some}} performers from the first film, including Aretha Franklin and James Brown. There are dozens of other guest performers, including Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Junior Wells, Lonnie Brooks, Eddie Floyd, Wilson Pickett, Isaac Hayes, Sam Moore, Taj Mahal and Jonny Lang, Blues Traveler, as well as an all-star supergroup led by B.B. King called the Louisiana Gator Boys. On the run from the police, Russian mafia and a racist militia, the band eventually ends up in Louisiana, where they enter a battle of the bands overseen by a voodoo practitioner named Queen Moussette (Erykah Badu). During a song by the Blues Brothers (a Caribbean number called [...] "Funky Nassau"), a character played by Paul Shaffer asks <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> on keyboards, which Murph allows. This marks {{the first time in a}} film that the Blues Brothers play with their original keyboardist.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Kahn {{signed a}} {{petition}} {{and threatened to}} resign from his post {{as head of the}} Paris-based, publicly financed Cochin Institute, due <b>to</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> government spending on research.|$|R

5000|$|The {{union was}} {{formally}} inaugurated in 1931, {{it came about}} {{partly as a result}} of vulnerabilities exposed by the great depression, which led <b>to</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> teachers salaries and a seemingly lack job security.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The theta {{bodies of}} a {{polynomial}} ideal are {{a series of}} semidefinite programming relaxations of the convex hull of the real variety of the ideal. In this paper we construct the theta bodies of the vanishing ideal of cycles in a binary matroid. Applied <b>to</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> graphs, this yields a new hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of the cut polytope of the graph. If the binary matroid avoids certain minors we can characterize when the first theta body in the hierarchy equals the cycle polytope of the matroid.

50|$|Due to {{the small}} school size, there was {{generally}} no need to qualify {{for any of the}} sports, as cutoffs would be meaningless and there was simply not a large enough applicant pool <b>to</b> allow <b>cuts.</b> <b>In</b> later years, higher demand led <b>to</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> both cheerleading, basketball, and girls' football (soccer). While this allowed for {{a large percentage of the}} student body to participate (an estimated 85% of students are involved in athletics), some teams were less successful than larger more-competitive schools.|$|R
