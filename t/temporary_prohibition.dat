40|$|Ra'ui (traditional marine managed areas) in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, are a form {{of marine}} {{protected}} area re-implemented in the late 1990 s when communities became concerned about declining fish and invertebrate stocks in the lagoon. In this thesis I quantified the effects of Ra'ui on fish and invertebrates. First, for a single focal species of abundant reef fish (Ctenochaetus striatus), I developed a novel framework to incorporate environmental heterogeneity into a Control-Impact assessment of Ra'ui effectiveness using an index of habitat selectivity (Manly's alpha) to 'adjust' the density of a reef fish by 'preferred' substrates. My results empirically demonstrated that substrate heterogeneity impinged upon the interpretation of MPA effects. This suggests that habitat heterogeneity should be quantitatively incorporated into analyses of MPA effects {{to provide a more}} robust and defensible set of inferences. The novel framework was then used to assess the effects of Ra'ui on densities of other common reef fish and invertebrates, as well as fish functional groups. Averaged across all Ra'ui, a higher percentage of the invertebrate species (20 %) had greater abundances inside Ra'ui relative to corresponding Control sites than fish species (15 %). This may suggest spatial management is more effective for sessile organisms such as the invertebrates in this study. Even when environmental heterogeneity was 'controlled' in my analyses, responses to Ra'ui were variable between species and sites, illustrating that factors other than environmental heterogeneity may be driving varying patterns of species abundances. However, for the broad-scale functional groups, there were indications of inverse relationships between predator and prey functional groups at 3 of the Ra'ui. I applied meta-analytical techniques to my data to assess whether there was an island-wide effect of Ra'ui on the densities of fish and invertebrate species, and functional groups. There was no evidence in the metaanalyses for an island-wide Ra'ui effect for any species or functional groups. However, analysis of covariance suggested there was an island-wide Ra'ui effect for a number of fish and invertebrate species. The body size of fish and invertebrates is another metric of MPA effectiveness that is expected to increase with protection. However, in determining an island-wide effect of Ra'ui on size, only two fish species, Mulloidichthys flavolineatus and Stegastes nigricans, had greater mean size in Ra'ui relative to Control sites, and Siganus argenteus was the only reef fish to exhibit greater maximum size in the Ra'ui. Two of the lagoon invertebrates (Echinometra mathaei and Tripneustes gratilla) and three of the reefcrest invertebrates (Echinothrix diadema, Echinometra oblonga, and Trochus niloticus) exhibited an island-wide positive response to Ra'ui for mean size. At individual Ra'ui sites, a number of invertebrates had greater mean and maximum size. Further, at individual sites, M. flavolineatus had greater mean size across the most Ra'ui (4 sites), again indicating that the site fidelity of a species may influence its response to protection. Ontogenetic shifts in habitat use are known to occur in fish and invertebrates. For five fish species, juveniles used habitat differently to adults of the same species. Further, of the five species, only densities of both juvenile and adult Acanthurus triostegus exhibited a positive relationship with the proportion of their preferred habitat (juveniles: r 2 = 0. 44, p = 0. 011; adults: r 2 = 0. 46, p = 0. 009). Densities of adult Ctenochaetus striatus also increased linearly with the proportion of preferred substrate cover (r 2 = 0. 43, p = 0. 035). These results suggest that habitat within an MPA may be limiting for different benthic stages of an organism's ontogeny. Some knowledge of the characteristics that underpin MPA effectiveness can aid in their design. Using commonly occurring fish and invertebrate species, I explored the effectiveness of individual Ra'ui using three separate metrics of effectiveness (the proportion of fish and invertebrates exhibiting 1) greater densities, 2) greater mean size, and 3) greater maximum size in Ra'ui relative to Control sites. Ra'ui area and total fish density in each Ra'ui were characteristics that best described the effectiveness of Ra'ui in enhancing mean fish and invertebrate size. The level of compliance with Ra'ui may also have some impact on Ra'ui effectiveness. This study highlights the importance of incorporating environmental heterogeneity into assessments of MPA effects. Further, <b>temporary</b> <b>prohibitions</b> such as Ra'ui may be more effective for some species if certain conditions are met e. g., compliance is good, and the species Ra'ui are protecting / enhancing have high site-fidelity and high growth rates. These findings provide important information for fisheries and conservation managers (e. g., traditional leaders, governmental agencies, non-governmental agencies, communities) that will aid in better design of monitoring programmes and facilitate improved MPA design, not only in the Pacific region, but worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Eritrea was an Italian colony from 1890 to 1941, and was since annexed by Ethiopia in 1956. Eritrea gained {{their freedom}} in 1991, after a nearly thirty year long war for independence, {{and is now}} one of the poorest {{countries}} in the world. The political situation with Ethiopia remains unresolved. During the Italian hegemony, the Eritrean capital Asmara grew to become Africa’s most modern city, peaking in the late 1930 s with over 60, 000 Italian inhabitants. New architectural styles emerged in the early 20 th century, when Asmara was built, and Asmara has one of the highest concentrations of modernist buildings anywhere in the world. Because of the instability in Eritrea since the 1940 s, there has been little development in Eritrea since the Italian period, and the urban environment in Asmara is virtually untouched. Due to neglected maintenance, the historical city of Asmara is in dire need of rehabilitation. The government of Eritrea has recognized Asmara’s unique urban qualities, and conservation and rehabilitation of the historic city is an explicit goal. It is wished to keep this part of the city a functioning and active part of Asmara, not conserving it to be a museum area. A project was initiated in the late 1990 s working towards conservation (the Cultural Asset and Rehabilitation Project, CARP), which has resulted in a formal delineation of a historical perimeter in Asmara, mapping and categorization of historical buildings, and a <b>temporary</b> building <b>prohibition</b> among other things. This project is now terminated, and the rehabilitation of the historical city is frozen, awaiting completion of long anticipated building regulations and guidelines for the rehabilitation. Asmara also faces many other challenges. Many people live under poor conditions in informal housing areas, and there are needs for further housing, water supply and infrastructure, due to a growing population and an expanding city. The perspective of this thesis is How to facilitate the rehabilitation of historical buildings in Asmara? This paper looks at possibilities for facilitating the rehabilitation through mobilizing private and external funds, relieving the government from the economic strain. This is presented through the proposal of various schemes. The ideology followed is that rehabilitation does not have to be done in a big fix, but can be an incremental process. Enabling smaller repairs will gradually improve the buildings, and perhaps more importantly, will remove some sources of damage that are causing further deterioration, e. g. leakages etc. The historic rehabilitation cannot be seen out of context with the greater challenges of the city. The larger planning challenges are sought combined with the rehabilitation work, through measures such as implementation of rainwater harvesting tanks, groundwater utilization and stimulation of commercial activity, especially related to tourism. Rehabilitation of the HP also has various socio-economic benefits, such as providing jobs (more than new construction), preventing urban sprawl, reusing infrastructure and through having a catalytic effect for further investment. The main proposals towards facilitating the rehabilitation are recapitulated below. These suggestions are not embellished to a detail-level, but are meant suggestions to be considered further. Inscription on the World Heritage List Inscription gives access to certain resources provided by UNESCO, which includes conservation consultancy and assistance. Inscription also creates publicity, which can strengthen Asmara as a tourist destination and also makes Asmara more probable to receive potential funding and assistance from various foundations and NGOs. Micro-finance for repairs and rehabilitation within the historical perimeter  This proposal is inspired by the rehabilitation of the old city of Aleppo, Syria, which has implemented such a program to enable private building owners to contribute in the rehabilitation. Tax incentives Many western countries have tax benefits as their main stimulant for historic rehabilitation. VAT and property tax reduction and income tax benefits are proposed, inspired by western models. Offering technical assistance to private owners The application process can be a hindrance for non-professionals, and simplifying this process and offering technical advice would lower the threshold for undertaking rehabilitation projects for private owners. Custodial Assignments with foreign organizations under the requirement of rehabilitation  Applies for selected public buildings. When the rehabilitation is recouped, the organization is expected to pay rent. Utilizing NGOs Different international NGOs can provide assistance through training and education, consultancy and financial aid. Such opportunities should be sought after. These proposals have a long time frame, and results will not be immediate. It is hard to assess the impact of these proposals at this stage. However, similar schemes are implemented in other countries with success, e. g. the micro-finance scheme in Aleppo. Any measure towards rehabilitating the historical perimeter of Asmara must be a long-term commitment, and political support is crucial. There is competence available through NGOs, UNESCO and the African World Heritage Fund (AWHF), that should be utilized in this process. Interviews conducted with several commercial tenants in the historical perimeter revealed a will to contribute in the rehabilitation, which shows promise, and can indicate that a micro-finance scheme could be well received in Asmara. Further work related to this thesis would involve feasibility studies, including financial and technical analyses of the various proposals. The main challenge, also in regard to the historical rehabilitation, is the international perception of Eritrea and the unresolved border dispute with Ethiopia. Tourism is argued for as a potential future industry for Eritrea, and Asmara undoubtedly has potential of attracting many visitors. Investments in tourism and tourist infrastructure may be in vain, if there are other barriers that are preventing the tourists from coming. </ul...|$|R

Moratorium space is this ‘absent’ imaginary room we are homesick of, and that often contains mystery and the promise of a new insight, which paradoxically may be generated by a new outlook into the world through the incorporation of ‘the window’ “… as practical device … and an epistemological metaphor” (Friedberg 2006), only accessible for those who make the effort to go into the moratorium space from one end (fig. 2), to wade through the thickness of its substance, and to keep wading until the outlook through ‘the window’ at its other end occurs and anatomically explains.
