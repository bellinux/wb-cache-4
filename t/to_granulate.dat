25|$|High-quality {{compound}} fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated {{with other}} components such as phosphates {{have been produced}} routinely since {{the beginnings of the}} modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology <b>to</b> <b>granulate</b> urea on its own. But {{at the end of the}} 1970s three companies began to develop fluidized-bed granulation. The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now Yara International). Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde GmbH, whose Uhde Fertilizer Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the same time Toyo Engineering Corporation developed its spouted-bed process, comprising a fluidized bed deliberately agitated to produce turbulent ebullation. Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (UFT) process. As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough to not require screens.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the results of}} transplantation of autologous graft and epidermal layer, grown outside {{the body of a}} patient, <b>to</b> <b>granulating</b> wounds after deep burns in 18 patients as well as methods which found no practical application due to poor healing abilities. It has been shown that the main cause of poor engraftment of the dermal graft is nutritional deficiency at the cellular level. This conclusion is confirmed by morphological studies of epidermal and dermal autograft. On the views of the authors, the further study of dermal autograft transplantation will put it to the worthy place among the other surgical methods restoring skin lesioned with burns...|$|R

50|$|Erethistes species lack a {{thoracic}} adhesive apparatus, {{a smooth}} <b>to</b> <b>granulate</b> anterior margin on a strong dorsal fin spine, a papillate upper lip, and 8 - 12 anal fin rays. The pectoral fin spine is serrated anteriorly and posteriorly. The anterior {{margin of the}} pectoral fin spine either has serrations all pointing toward tip of spine; arranged in divergent pairs; or outwardly directed and not divergent. The head is large and broad with a conical snout. The body is robust rather than slender as in some other erethistid genera, and is moderately short and flattened. All barbels are annulated with black rings.|$|E
50|$|In {{the tablet}} {{pressing}} process, the main guideline {{is to ensure}} that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is in each tablet. Hence, all the ingredients should be well-mixed. If a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes, the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet. Two basic techniques are used <b>to</b> <b>granulate</b> powders for compression into a tablet: wet granulation and dry granulation. Powders that can be mixed well do not require granulation and can be compressed into tablets through direct compression.|$|E
40|$|Silicone foam {{elastomer}} is {{used extensively}} <b>to</b> treat <b>granulating</b> wounds. A case {{is presented in}} which the catalyst to the polymer was inadvertently applied to the eye.

50|$|Low shear wet {{granulation}} processes use very simple mixing equipment, {{and can take}} a considerable time to achieve a uniformly mixed state. High shear {{wet granulation}} processes use equipment that mixes the powder and liquid at a very fast rate, and thus speeds up the manufacturing process. Fluid bed granulation is a multiple-step wet granulation process performed in the same vessel <b>to</b> pre-heat, <b>granulate,</b> and dry the powders. It is used because it allows close control of the granulation process.|$|R
5000|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{received}} fragmentary remains {{from the}} Judith River Formation, collected by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. From these bones, he provided the first names for North American dinosaurs: Deinodon, Palaeoscincus, Trachodon, and Troodon (then spelled Troödon), {{the latter being}} the only name still in use. The type species of Trachodon is T. mirabilis. The generic name is derived from Greek τραχυς, trakhys, [...] "rough", and όδον, odon, [...] "tooth", referring <b>to</b> the <b>granulate</b> inner surface {{of one of the}} teeth.

50|$|Externally, {{these fish}} {{resemble}} {{members of the}} sisorid catfish genus Glyptothorax. Pseudolaguvia is diagnosed {{by the presence of}} a short thoracic adhesive apparatus with median depression; wide gill openings nearly meeting one another {{on the underside of the}} body; serrations on anterior margin of pectoral fin spine pointing toward tip; smooth <b>to</b> <b>granulate</b> anterior margin on the dorsal fin spine; slender body; papillate upper lip; and 8 - 10 anal fin rays. Both the dorsal fin and pectoral fin have strong spines. The head and body are slightly depressed. The eyes are small, dorsal, and located in the middle of the head. The barbels are annulated with black rings.|$|E
50|$|Erethistoides is {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} erethistids by having the anterior margin of the pectoral fin spine with serrations directed toward {{the tip of the}} spine distally, and away from the tip proximally; however, the use of this as a diagnostic character has been questioned as some specimens of Erethistes filamentosa also show this trait. They also lack a thoracic adhesive apparatus present in some other erethistids, and a smooth <b>to</b> <b>granulate</b> anterior margin on the dorsal fin spine, moderate gill openings that extend to the underside of the fish, a papillate upper lip, and 9 - 11 anal fin rays. The head is depressed and triangular, and the body is elongate and compressed. The eyes are small to moderate and are placed dorsolaterally in the posterior half of the head. The pectoral fin spine is serrated anteriorly and posteriorly. The dorsal fin spine is serrated posteriorly but not anteriorly.|$|E

40|$|The removal {{efficiency}} of LECA and cork granulates as support matrix for pharmaceuticals active compounds in a constructed wetland system was investigated using the diuretic drug Furosemide. Kinetics studies were performed testing three different concentrations of Furosemide in an ultrapure water matrix, along seven days. LECA achieved higher removal values compared <b>to</b> cork <b>granulates.</b> However, cork granulates presented a higher removal {{in the first}} 24 h of contact time {{compared to the other}} adsorbent. The kinetic studies showed that LECA and cork granulates have different adsorption behaviours for Furosemide which is controlled by different adsorption mechanisms.

40|$|The {{granulation}} {{procedure of}} a catalyst powder {{is a crucial}} step in designing a high-quality catalyst granulate for industrial applications. New granulation processes have been developed that make it possible <b>to</b> form <b>granulates</b> with a very {{narrow particle size distribution}} and high sphericity. The innovative granulation techniques offer a great potential to produce layered catalysts with inert cores and an active shell. The novel spherical granules consist of an inexpensive inert core coated with an active catalyst material. New core shell granules with an accurately designed spherical geometry have been synthesized and compared to conventional homogeneous spherical granules of the same shape.

One patient underwent a second operation 28  days following {{the application of}} the ring fixator. This patient had an open fracture from a gunshot wound and was a two-pack-per-day cigarette smoker. His fixator was removed and the wound was irrigated. Following a course of antibiotics, the patient was reviewed in the clinic with a healed wound and no signs of infection. Three patients had superficial infection, which resolved with oral antibiotics and pin site care.

This presentation focuses on continuous filtration, washing and drying. Darcy’s law and subsequent modifications describe the rate of filtration; however, there is no equivalent which addresses the removal of closely related impurities of synthesis by filtration and washing, especially when the product exhibits solubility. API solubility also poses challenges during drying. Presuming the upstream crystallization has delivered particles of the desired size and they are largely unaffected by filtration and washing then drying process {{has the potential to}} break fragile particles and <b>to</b> <b>granulate</b> all particles through the formation of crystal-crystal bridges.
