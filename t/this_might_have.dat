5|$|A 1997 {{study found}} lower protein {{polymorphism}} in Antilope {{in comparison with}} Antidorcas, Eudorcas and Gazella. This was attributed to a history of rapid evolution of an autapomorphic phenotype of Antilope. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been aided by a particularly strong selection of a few dominant males due to its lekking behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been an attempt to modernise the story, to make it more in tune with the political sensibilities of the 1990s, when it was published.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E

5|$|His biographer, Brian Little, {{suggests}} that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been {{a way for}} the newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also {{suggests that}} it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E
5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out {{similarities and differences between}} the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|In July 1886 an Australian {{prospector}} {{reported to}} the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic's formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg, which {{within a few years}} was the largest city in southern Africa, populated almost entirely by uitlanders. The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight—the South African Republic went from the verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority.|$|E

5|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} after Thrud issue 1 was published, Critchlow {{returned}} to 2000AD using his new computer-drawn style. His first story was the Judge Dredd, Out of the Undercity story written by John Wagner. The new style was initially well received by 2000AD Review and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with clearer figures and atmospheric colouring. As the Undercity story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using too narrow a palette, with too many greys and blues, although <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been {{as a result of}} the story being set underground.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the pyramid}} and {{mortuary}} temple of Nyuserre's mother, Khentkaus II, had begun during her husband's rule but was {{stopped in the}} tenth year of his reign, at which point only the pyramid core was still uncased. After a delay of 12 years, Nyuserre Ini restarted the building work, and expended much effort in completing {{the majority of the}} construction. The motivation for <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been to legitimise his rule following the premature death of Neferefre and the possible challenge by Shepseskare.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the small}} range of the bluebuck {{at the time of}} European {{settlement}} of the Cape region in the 17th and 18th centuries compared to the much wider area evidenced by fossil remains, it is thought the species was already in decline before this time. The bluebuck was the sole species of Hippotragus in the region until 70,00035,000 years ago, but the roan antelope appears to have become predominant about 11,000 years ago. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> coincided with grasslands being replaced by, for example, brush and forest, thereby reducing what is presumed to be the preferred habitat of the bluebuck, the grasslands. The results of the sea level changes in the early Holocene may also {{have played a role in}} the decline of the species, and left only the southern population to survive into historical times.|$|E

5000|$|The Lower Guadalquivir valley shows {{its first}} clearly {{differentiated}} culture, defined by internally burnished pottery. <b>This</b> group <b>might</b> <b>have</b> some {{relation with the}} semi-historical, yet-to-be-found, Tartessos.|$|R
50|$|Horticulturist Walter Clore has {{postulated}} that <b>this</b> grape <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{been one of}} the first Vitis vinifera varieties planted in Washington State in the early 19th century.|$|R
5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> something to do with hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E
5|$|Other ceratopsians {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation include Einiosaurus and Rubeosaurus. In addition, remains of other {{indeterminate}} and dubious centrosaurines, including Brachyceratops, are {{known from the}} formation and though they may represent younger stages of the three valid genera, this {{is not possible to}} demonstrate. Whereas Horner assumed that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were separate in time, in 2010 Donald M. Henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or sympatric and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been niche partitioning. The skull of Achelousaurus was more than twice as strong than that of Einiosaurus in its bending strength and torsion resistance. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition. The bite strength of Achelousaurus, measured as an ultimate tensile strength, was 30.5newtonsper squaremeter (N/m²) at the maxillary tooth row and 18N/m² at the beak.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield {{had long}} felt {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of medical {{officers}} marrying. Louise Hind, in Gender and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the result of misogynist tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had met her in Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before going to Paris to seek treatment for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as starosta of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E

25|$|Probably as a side-effect of the nocturnal life, mammals {{lost two}} of the four cone opsins, photoreceptors in the retina, present {{in the eyes of the}} {{earliest}} amniotes. Paradoxically, <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> improved their ability to discriminate colors in dim light.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 {{he made a}} {{surprise}} return to Zimbabwe, and played in several National League matches for Old Hararians.

25|$|De la Gardie was {{the most}} renowned and {{influential}} among the regency members, although he was often challenged. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been {{due to the fact}} that he was, reportedly, unable to work enough and that he often left the centre of power to spend significant time on his different estates, a disadvantage for both the government and De la Gardie's own position of power.|$|E
25|$|Under these circumstances, some Georgians doubted {{whether the}} {{uprising}} could be successful. The captured rebel leader, Jugheli, urged Cheka officials {{to allow him}} to inform his comrades that their plans had been discovered and advise them to abandon their proposed revolt, but the Cheka refused. Jugheli's message still reached the rebels, but the conspirators decided that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been a Cheka provocation and went ahead with plans for the uprising.|$|E
