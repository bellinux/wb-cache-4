2500|$|Simona Halep has {{self-described}} her playing {{style as}} being [...] "an aggressive baseliner" [...] and [...] "she models her game on Justine Henin".

There {{is a little}} something <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> myself... it is offensive and aggressive." ...|$|E
60|$|LAMB I'm {{not so sure}} of that. She's got a way of {{shutting}} {{her mouth}} <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my old woman.|$|E
60|$|Some {{sinister}} note in her father's voice {{caused the}} girl to grow of a sudden calm and to assume a rigidity <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her sister.|$|R
60|$|The brown, expressionless, ageless eyes, <b>that</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a monkey's, or of onyx, {{wait for}} me. I feel the {{responsibility}} devolve upon me. I am anxious.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, {{they had}} lit large fires, about which they flitted in an ominous and {{unpleasant}} fashion, <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> some mediaeval pictures of hell, which I {{had seen in}} an old book.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{part from}} {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> him," [...] she said. [...] "Keep the key wherever you please--I shall never want it again." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a {{distinction}} you suggest between Ossian and Homer. I fashion {{it in this}} way: Homer sometimes nods, but Ossian makes his readers nod.|$|E
6000|$|... "No harm {{in looking}} at a pretty woman, you know. I'm a {{bachelor}} still, thank the Lord! <b>That</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a funny story I heard at the club." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{bystanders}} surged {{to and fro}} {{about the}} speakers in a manner <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> corraled cattle; others hurried towards them, and our broker's voice rang out: [...] "I'll trade with you at two dollars better." ...|$|R
60|$|The head of {{the valley}} had that half-tamed, ancient aspect <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the Romans. I could only expect the Roman legions to be encamped down there; and the white goats feeding on the bushes belonged to a Roman camp.|$|R
60|$|LESBIA. <b>That</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} very important. Boxer believes in vaccination: I do not. There {{must be a}} clause that I am to decide on such questions as I think best.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Lady Merton; 'though Lizzie's whole countenance and air {{is almost}} exactly her mother's, {{yet there is}} nothing about Kate but her voice, which they have in common, <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. It {{had better}} be done by {{somebody}} else, Dan'l,' said Mrs. Gummidge. 'I'm a lone lorn creetur' myself, and everythink <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> creetur's that ain't lone and lorn, goes contrary with me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|To Clemantiny {{she added}} in a low, gentle tone, [...] "There's a {{look on his face}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Johnny. It came out so strong when he sat up just now that it made me feel like crying. Don't you notice it, Clemantiny?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You!' she says, {{with a smile}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> lemon sherbet. I {{was waiting}} up-stairs in the slosh, then, and I was right down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|R
60|$|The robber again paused with agitation. I sat musing {{upon his}} last Frightful words, which proved to what excess the passions may be carried when escaped from all moral restraint. There {{was a horrible}} verity in this story <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> some of the tragic fictions of Danté.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't say, I'm sure," [...] she answered. [...] "I haven't seen {{anything}} here yet <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> fairies, but Cap'n Bill said a floating {{island in the}} sky was {{sure to be a}} fairyland." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well. Bring Ann--Oh, Peter, <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> what I {{wanted to}} say to you, which this dreadful thing in the paper drove {{completely}} out of my mind. Lord Wisbeach has asked Ann to marry him!" ...|$|E

6000|$|He slipped round it, {{making a}} wide circle {{with his usual}} caution, then, seeing the snake which was, by the way, I think, the biggest immamba I ever killed, {{suddenly}} froze, as it were, in a stiff attitude <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a pointer when it scents game. Having made {{sure that it was}} dead, he nodded and said, ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me a while again, and then she said, in a little {{reasoning}} voice <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her mother's, only that it was conscious and studied, [...] "I was not aware that I am under any particular obligation to please you!" [...] And then she gave a clear laugh, quite at variance with her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} it is," [...] he said at last, [...] "but there's a {{something}} about you <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her. It ain't your voice, 'cos {{she had a very}} nice voice--when she wasn't in a temper--and it ain't your face, because--" ...|$|E

'Someone that I know, Trot,' my aunt pursued, after a pause, 'though {{of a very}} pliant disposition, has an earnestness {{of affection}} in him <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> poor Baby.

60|$|She {{looked at}} me a while again, {{and then she said}} in a little {{reasoning}} tone <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> her mother’s, only that it was conscious and studied, “I wasn’t aware that I’m under any particular obligation to please you!” But she also gave a clear laugh, quite at variance with this stiffness. Suddenly I thought her adorable.|$|R
60|$|There {{are four}} painted glass windows, {{given by the}} King of Bavaria. I have got for H. the {{photograph}} of two of them, representing the birth and death of Christ. They are gorgeous paintings by the first masters. The windows round the choir were painted in a style <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> our forests in autumn.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] {{replied the}} gentle Hafrydda, with a sigh. [...] "But I am saved from that now," [...] she added, {{brightening}} up suddenly, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the good news. Do {{you know who}} the handsome youth is who rescued me from this monster?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} what I said, when we once talked of your will?" [...] he asked. I set his doubts at rest immediately--but he was not quite satisfied yet.

6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will," [...] Wrayson answered. [...] "An income {{of that sort}} could {{scarcely}} disappear into thin air, could it? By the bye, Mr. Barnes, <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a very important circumstance which, up to now, we have not mentioned. I mean the way your brother met with his death." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "For {{the first}} time in my life I was a member of a brotherhood," [...] Colin Powell would later say about the Pershing Rifles. [...] "The discipline, the structure, the camaraderie, the sense of {{belonging}} were what I craved. … I found a selflessness within our ranks <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the caring atmosphere within my family.

60|$|The {{first morning}} I noticed a white object on the rocks, {{about half a}} mile away, and turned my glass on it. There--apparently within a stone's throw of me--was a young man.

60|$|Becoming an {{inhabitant}} {{of a great}} English town, I often turned {{aside from}} the prosperous thoroughfares (where the edifices, the shops, and the bustling crowd differed not so much from scenes with which I was familiar in my own country), and went designedly astray among precincts <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> some of Dickens's grimiest pages. There I caught glimpses of a people and a mode of life that were comparatively new to my observation, a sort of sombre phantasmagoric spectacle, exceedingly undelightful to behold, yet involving a singular interest and even fascination in its ugliness.|$|R
