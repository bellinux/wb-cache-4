5|$|Settlements were a type {{of rural}} {{locality}} that first appeared in Adygea during the Soviet times. Most were established by migrant peasants from outside of Adygea, although some also resulted from internal migration. Today, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> common in the Belaya River valley near {{the foothills of the}} Caucasus Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Silvertip {{sharks are}} found over {{continental}} and insular shelves {{at a depth}} of , occupying all levels of the water column. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> common around isolated islands, coral banks, and reef drop-offs. Juveniles frequent coastal shallows or lagoons, while adults occur in deeper water, with little overlap between the two age groups.|$|E
5|$|Substrates <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> {{commonly}} found {{on in their}} native habitats include beds and floating clumps of macroalgae like Sargassum muticum, Sargassum miyabei, Sargassum pallidum, Neorhodomela larix, Polysiphonia morrowii, Cystoseira crassipes, Laminaria japonica, Chondrusspp., and Desmarestia viridis; {{as well as in}} marine plants (like eelgrass of the genus Zostera), hydrozoans, and bryozoans.|$|E

5|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> closely {{allied with}} maniraptoran coelurosaurs. A {{minority}} of scientists, most notably Alan Feduccia and Larry Martin, have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal, or that maniraptoran theropods are {{the ancestors of}} birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only convergent with dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a {{vertical}} axis, {{usually in the}} same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E

25|$|The {{account of}} the siege {{does not make it}} clear as to what was the {{ethnicity}} of the slaves who helped the Muslims repel the Byzantines. The source implies that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not Muslim, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>most</b> likely not Arabs, although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> believed to have spoken Arabic. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>most</b> likely Sicilian or Slav Christians or Christian converts to Islam, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> probably assimilated with any Maltese survivors from the massacre of 870.|$|R
5|$|In many East Asian cultures, salt is not {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} condiment. In its place, condiments such as soy sauce, {{fish sauce}} and oyster sauce {{tend to have a}} high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.|$|E
5|$|Mast cells {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and regulate the inflammatory response. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> {{often associated with}} allergy and anaphylaxis. Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators {{that are involved in}} defending against parasites and play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E
5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E

5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and when the Sun is below the horizon for the observer, but while the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotides find {{a variety}} of {{applications}} in molecular biology and medicine. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> commonly used as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, primers for DNA sequencing and amplification, probes for detecting complementary DNA or RNA via molecular hybridization, tools for the targeted introduction of mutations and restriction sites, and for the synthesis of artificial genes.|$|E
5|$|On the one hand, {{there is}} little {{question}} that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> closely related to three other families of streamlined, surface water fishes: the flyingfishes, needlefishes, and sauries. Traditionally, these four families {{have been taken to}} together comprise the order Beloniformes. The halfbeaks and flyingfishes are considered to form one group, the superfamily Exocoetoidea, and the needlefishes and sauries another, the superfamily Scomberesocoidea.|$|E

5|$|Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and {{are related}} to other living lorisoids, such as slender lorises (Loris), pottos (Perodicticus), false pottos (Pseudopotto), angwantibos (Arctocebus), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> {{closely related to the}} slender lorises of South Asia, followed by the angwantibos, pottos and false pottos of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the slender and slow lorises of today.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat and is only found near the seashore living among sand dunes. They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> sheltered from storms and sand movement. They can sometimes be associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea when these dunes extend inland for long distances.|$|E
5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles {{and a handful of}} other locales. This is because of their ability to survive on {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally useless. Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they also may be kept for their meat.|$|E

50|$|Early {{biscuits}} were hard, dry, and unsweetened. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>most</b> often cooked after bread, in {{a cooling}} bakers' oven; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> a cheap form of sustenance for the poor.|$|R
5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|After Guy and Joanna have sex, Martin arrives to {{tell them}} that Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst she was an {{exchange}} student in Switzerland. Guy then stabs a syringe full of Botox into Martin's legs as an act of revenge. Martin is taken into an ambulance, and Caroline helps Joanna, but Guy punches Mac in a drunken rage and steals the ambulance. Mac tries to stop him and gets on the ambulance, which drives away. Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff. The first series ends with Guy, Mac and Martin teetering on the edge – a literal cliffhanger – while ending up in a discussion about which of The Three Musketeers <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> like.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
