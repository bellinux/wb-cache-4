5|$|Lightly calcified darts {{occur in}} <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> and semi-slug family Urocyclidae, within the {{superfamily}} Helicarionoidea.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>snail</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} at Chittenango Falls in August 1905 by a field party from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In 1908, Henry Augustus Pilsbry reported the discovery, describing <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> as a subspecies of the widely distributed Succinea ovalis. Because of this, the Chittenango ovate amber snail {{is referred to}} in many publications as Succinea ovalis chittenangoensis.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem here is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. <b>The</b> <b>snail</b> then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E
50|$|This {{superfamily}} includes <b>the</b> murex <b>snails,</b> <b>the</b> chank <b>snails,</b> <b>the</b> true whelks, <b>the</b> dove <b>snails,</b> <b>the</b> crown conchs and busycon whelks, {{the spindle}} and tulip <b>snails,</b> <b>the</b> volutes and olives, <b>the</b> harp <b>snails,</b> <b>the</b> margin <b>snails,</b> <b>the</b> miters, and others.|$|R
50|$|In captivity <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> {{can feed}} on cucumber, lettuce, carrots, apple, and boiled eggs. <b>The</b> <b>snails</b> can eat chalk for calcium, and commercially {{available}} rat food for protein.|$|R
50|$|North America: Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio and others. Worm eggs unknowingly {{ingested}} by <b>the</b> amber <b>snail</b> hatch in <b>the</b> <b>snail's</b> digestive tract. <b>The</b> larva then {{change into}} sporocysts, causing drastic mutations in <b>the</b> <b>snail's</b> neural ganglia and physiology. Healthy snails seek darkness {{to hide from}} predators, but <b>the</b> infected amber <b>snail</b> moves itself into dangerous open space and light. It is also helpless to retract its newly swollen, pulsating tentacles.|$|R
5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often than they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Build-A-Bear Workshop {{introduced}} the new SpongeBob SqaurePants collection in stores and online in North America on May 17, 2013. Shoppers can dress their SpongeBob and Patrick plush {{in a variety}} of clothing and accessories. Sandy Cheeks and Gary <b>the</b> <b>Snail</b> are also available as pre-stuffed minis. Build-A-Bear Workshop stores nationwide celebrated the arrival of SpongeBob with a series of special events from May 17 through May 19.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Réunion became extinct after {{the arrival of}} man and the {{resulting}} disruption of the island's ecosystem. The Mascarene parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the hoopoe starling, the Réunion ibis, the Réunion parakeet, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon. Extinct Réunion reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> Tropidophora carinata lived on Réunion and Mauritius but vanished from both islands.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>snails</b> {{within this}} family are {{sophisticated}} predatory animals. They hunt and immobilize prey using a modified radular tooth {{along with a}} venom gland containing neurotoxins; the tooth is launched out of <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> mouth in a harpoon-like action.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>snails</b> {{are able}} to float {{securely}} because they create a raft of clear chitin around air bubbles formed near the ocean surface. They anchor to this raft using their foot. [...] <b>The</b> <b>snails</b> {{do not have an}} operculum.|$|R
50|$|The native {{distribution}} {{of this species}} is Western Europe and Central Europe. The range of <b>the</b> white-lipped <b>snail</b> extends closer to the Arctic in Northern Europe than the range of <b>the</b> grove <b>snail.</b> <b>The</b> white-lipped <b>snail</b> has been introduced to northeastern parts of the USA, but has not established itself as successfully as <b>the</b> grove <b>snail.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} on Réunion became extinct after {{the arrival of}} humans and the {{resulting}} disruption of the island's ecosystem. The Mascarene parrot lived with other now-extinct birds, such as the Réunion ibis, the Mascarene parrot, the Réunion parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon. Extinct Réunion reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> Tropidophora carinata lived on Réunion and Mauritius before vanishing from both islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} tables or charts show {{numerous examples}} of love dart morphology, {{on a family}} by family and species by species basis. Not all families and species are included. The drawings show first the cross section, and then the lateral view, of the dart in that particular species. Darts vary in size according {{to the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> or slug species, but here they are all shown at the same size, for purposes of comparison.|$|E
5|$|The love dart {{is not a}} penial stylet (in {{other words}} {{this is not an}} {{accessory}} organ for sperm transfer). The exchange of sperm between both of the two land snails is a completely separate part of the mating progression. Nevertheless, recent research shows that use of the dart can strongly favor the reproductive outcome for <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> that is able to lodge a dart in its partner. This is because mucus on the dart introduces a hormone-like substance that allows far more of its sperm to survive.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>snails</b> from Barra Mansa and Floriano, {{locations}} {{with smaller}} precipitation index (1198  mm/year) (IBGE 2011), presented smaller shell aperture values {{when compared to}} <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> from Cruzília and Juiz de Fora with higher precipitation indexes of 1568  mm/year and 1536  mm/year (IBGE 2011), respectively.|$|R
50|$|This genus of snails is {{medically}} important, because <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> {{can carry}} a parasite of humans which represents a serious disease risk: <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> serve as an intermediate host (vector) for the human parasitic blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, that infects about 83 million people.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{method is}} to make a square pen with a -square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., nettles and artichokes, inside <b>the</b> pen. <b>The</b> <b>snails</b> will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> are not mature {{at the end of the}} year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.|$|R
5|$|The mud snail {{was first}} {{detected}} in the U.S. in Idaho's Snake River in 1987. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> has spread to the Madison River, Firehole River, and other watercourses around Yellowstone National Park, and has been discovered throughout the western U.S. The exact means of transmission is unknown, but {{it is likely that}} it was introduced in water transferred with live game fish and has been spread by ship ballast or contaminated recreational equipment such as wading gear.|$|E
5|$|The snail's {{oesophageal}} gland houses symbiotic gammaproteobacteria {{from which}} <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> appears to obtain its nourishment. This species {{is considered to}} be one of the most peculiar deep-sea hydrothermal-vent gastropods, and it is the only known extant animal that incorporates iron sulfide into its skeleton (into both its sclerites and into its shell as an exoskeleton). Its heart is, proportionately speaking, unusually large for any animal: the heart comprises approximately 4% of its body volume.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). <b>The</b> <b>snail</b> is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>snails</b> {{primarily}} feed on benthic diatoms.|$|R

50|$|This snail {{feeds on}} cirratulinid polychaete worms. The toxins from these worms become {{incorporated}} into <b>the</b> <b>snail's</b> tissues and are then used for <b>the</b> bubble <b>snail's</b> own defense.|$|R
5|$|Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis {{include several}} species of trematodes. <b>The</b> <b>snail</b> serves as first {{intermediate}} host to Plagioporus skrjabini and as second intermediate host to Cotylurus cornutus. Asymphylodora demeli {{is also found in}} this small snail, as is Notocotylus zduni. This small snail is also parasitized by {{several species of}} ciliates. It is the main host for the ciliate Trichodina baltica; the snails are usually 100% infected in the mantle cavity Another ciliate found in the mantle cavity is a species of Scyphidia. Two other parasitic ciliate species found in this snail are Protospira mazurica, and Hypocomella quatuor. Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach (a freshwater fish), Rutilus rutilus. Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal {{rainfall}} {{patterns of}} the Western Ghats necessitate a period of dormancy for its land snails, resulting in their high abundance and diversity including at least 258 species of gastropods from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species of freshwater molluscs (52 gastropods and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This include 28 endemics. Among the threatened freshwater molluscs are the mussels Pseudomulleria dalyi, which is a Gondwanan relict, and <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> Cremnoconchus, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, 4 species of freshwater molluscs are considered endangered and 3 are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Howe Island {{stick insect}} {{disappeared}} from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918. In 2001 a tiny population was discovered in a single Melaleuca howeana shrub {{on the slopes of}} Ball's Pyramid, has been successfully bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island. The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also been affected by the introduction of rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program is under way to save <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> from extinction.|$|E
50|$|In French cuisine, {{edible snails}} are served for {{instance}} in Escargot à la Bourguignonne. The practice of rearing snails for food is known as heliciculture. For purposes of cultivation, <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> are kept in a dark place in a wired cage with dry straw or dry wood. Coppiced wine-grape vines are often used for this purpose. During the rainy period, <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> come out of hibernation and release most of their mucus onto the dry wood/straw. <b>The</b> <b>snails</b> are then prepared for cooking. Their texture when cooked is slightly chewy.|$|R
50|$|Snails are a {{delicacy}} in French cuisine, {{where they}} are called escargots. 191 farms produced Escargots in France as of 2014. In an English-language menu, escargot is generally reserved for snails prepared with traditional French recipes (served in the shell with a garlic and parsley butter). Before preparing <b>snails</b> to eat, <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> should be fasting for three days with only water available. After three days of fasting, <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> should be fed flour and offered water {{for at least a}} week. This process is thought to cleanse <b>the</b> <b>snails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Heliciculture is <b>the</b> farming of <b>snails.</b> Some {{species such}} as <b>the</b> Roman <b>Snail</b> are {{protected}} in the wild in several European countries and must not be collected, but <b>the</b> Roman <b>Snail</b> and <b>the</b> Garden <b>Snail</b> (Cornu aspersum) are cultivated on snail farms.|$|R
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
5|$|While Finn distracts her, the Ice King {{uses his}} ice powers to freeze Bubblegum. Their moment of success, however, is cut short when the still-frozen Bubblegum tips over and {{shatters}} everywhere. Her body parts are again {{rushed to the}} hospital where she is reassembled. However, there are not enough pieces to complete her, and so she ends up reverting to a 13-year-old girl. Finn, who is also 13, is excited, but the Ice King temporarily gives up his pursuit of Bubblegum due to her age. As the episode ends, it is revealed that the Lich has once again possessed the body of <b>the</b> <b>snail,</b> who angrily waves goodbye to the camera.|$|E
5|$|Many {{endemic species}} of Mauritius became extinct after {{the arrival of}} humans, so the {{ecosystem}} of the island is badly damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of them today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and <b>the</b> <b>snail</b> Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|E
40|$|Snails {{living in}} an {{intertidal}} rocky shore can be collected easily and are good materials for observing living spermatozoa. This paper described the seasons suitable for the observation of the spermatozoa, the advices on collecting <b>the</b> <b>snails,</b> <b>the</b> methods for the observations and the morphological characters of the spermatozoa of the common species in the Archaeogastropoda (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Prosobranchia) living in the intertidal rocky shore of the Pacific coast of the central and southern Japan. In the Archaeogastropoda, the sperm morphology of <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> in which fertilization is internal {{differs from that of}} <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> in which fertilization is external. Besides, the sperm morphology of <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> performing external fertilization can be classified into two types mainly from the shapes of the acrosomes. That is, the spermatozoa in the Archaeogastropoda can be classified into three types. The classification based upon the morphological characters of the spermatozoa coincides with that based upon the comparative anatomical characters. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} <b>the</b> <b>snails</b> in <b>the</b> Archaeogastropoda are good teaching materials for the observation of the sperm morphology, and for the explanation on the relations of sperm morphology to the type of fertilization and phylogeny...|$|R
