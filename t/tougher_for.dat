His first major race {{of the year was}} the Tirreno–Adriatico, where he won the race's final stage which was an {{individual}} time trial. Cancellara came to the Milan–San Remo with the hopes of winning the race a second time. He positioned himself in an eight-man breakaway that made {{it all the way to}} the finish. As the group approached the finish line, Cancellara was bested in the sprint for the line by Australian Matthew Goss and Cancellara crossed the line in second.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it <b>tougher</b> <b>for</b> children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E

Also, the process does not work well on thin-walled workpieces owing to a tendency to expand when the tool is inserted.|$|E

The Black Cats returned to the Premiership as Football League Championship champions, amassing an impressive 94 points. Life in the Premiership was much <b>tougher</b> <b>for</b> McCarthy though, as {{he was unable to}} spend much to strengthen the team.

In an ironic postscript, Sunderland eventually appointed Roy Keane as their next permanent manager.|$|E
25|$|As {{emissions}} regulations become <b>tougher</b> <b>for</b> {{manufacturers to}} adhere to, {{a new generation}} of high-performance cars will be powered by hybrid technology (for example the Porsche GT3 hybrid racing car). Aside from the emissions benefits of a hybrid system, the immediately available torque which is produced from electric motor(s) can lead to performance benefits by addressing the power curve weaknesses of a traditional combustion engine. Hybrid racecars have been very successful, as is shown by the Audi R18 and Porsche 919, which have won the 24 hours of Le Mans using hybrid technology.|$|E

Tritt told Insight on the News, that he is a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights and believes the answer to crime is not gun control but criminal control. [...] "I'm a pro-gun guy. I'm an NRA National Rifle Association member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment <b>tougher</b> <b>for</b> the criminals to start with.

[...] In other interviews that asked the same question, Ali replied “I'm Muslim, and that'll always be the case, but I'm here to push good issues and good policy for all Marylanders.... We're looking for good ideas", and [...] "I'm here to push good ideas, not so much to push my faith." ...|$|E
