25|$|Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) {{is known}} to impair memory, {{and the ability to}} learn and retain information.

Aboriginal cultural knowledge is taught to new generations through song, dance and storytelling, and Oscar was concerned. “These kids may have speech delays and difficulty remembering. But memory is critical to our whole heritage because Aboriginal culture and language is passed down orally. Language is the essence of who we are; it identifies us and <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> come from”.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, James {{was forced}} to leave the US under threat of {{deportation}} for having overstayed his visa. In his attempt to remain in America, James wrote a study of Herman Melville, Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>We</b> Live In, and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book while being detained on Ellis Island. In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, James said that in Mariners that he was using Moby Dick as a parable for the anticommunism sweeping the United State, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.|$|E

There, he studied mathematics and physics; and so brilliant was his progress in these sciences that in 1740 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the college.|$|E

This is the {{greatest}} failure of any enterprise in the industrial history of <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>We</b> don’t mean that as a criticism of nuclear power’s practitioners, on whose skill and devotion we all continue to depend; the impressive operational improvements in U.S. power reactors in recent years deserve great credit. It is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions and immense effort. In nuclear power’s heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came end-use efficiency, combined-cycle plants, distributed generation (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match.|$|E

25|$|If the Standard Model is correct, the {{particles}} and forces we observe in our universe exist {{as they do}} because of underlying quantum fields. Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable', or 'metastable' (meaning very long-lived but not completely stable). If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise {{as they do in}} the universe's present state. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. <b>The</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, everything around us, from subatomic particles to galaxies, and all fundamental forces, would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields.|$|E

Where the excited gas crosses Pleione's equator, it obscures her violet light." ...|$|E
