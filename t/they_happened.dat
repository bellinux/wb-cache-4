5|$|When Johnny Carson, {{a fan of}} jazz music, was {{preparing}} to take over as the permanent host of The Tonight Show starting in October 1962, he recognized that he would need a theme song. Carson and Anka had worked together in England on the television special An Evening with Paul Anka in 1961; when <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> to meet up again in New York City the following year, Carson manager Al Bruno mentioned needing a theme.|$|E

25|$|His Inward Bound: Of {{matter and}} {{forces in the}} {{physical}} world (Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, 1988) describes the events in physics during the preceding 100 years, and tries to explain why <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> as they did.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of new episodic memories requires the medial temporal lobe, {{a structure that}} includes the hippocampus. Without the medial temporal lobe, one is able to form new procedural memories (such as playing the piano) but cannot remember the events during which <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> (See the hippocampus and memory).|$|E

25|$|The {{expected}} changeover to the {{new structure}} proved to be rare, irregular, and sometimes reversed. The new brigades that appeared were mostly divisions that had broken down until <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> {{to be at the}} proposed brigade strengths. New divisions—such as the new 3rd Motor Rifle Division in the Moscow Military District, formed on the basis of disbanding tank formations—were formed, rather than new brigades.|$|E
25|$|The riots have {{generated}} significant ongoing debate among political, {{social and academic}} figures about the causes and context in which <b>they</b> <b>happened.</b> Attributions for the rioters' behaviour include such social factors such as racial tension, class tension, economic decline and the unemployment that it had brought, {{as well as individual}} factors like criminality, hooliganism, the breakdown of social morality and the development of gang culture.|$|E
25|$|Aside from NASA, {{a number}} of groups and {{individuals}} tracked the Apollo missions as <b>they</b> <b>happened.</b> On later missions, NASA released {{information to the public}} explaining where and when the spacecraft could be sighted. Their flight paths were tracked using radar and they were sighted and photographed using telescopes. Also, radio transmissions between the astronauts on the surface and in orbit were independently recorded.|$|E

25|$|On 30 November 1919, Benedict XV {{appealed to}} all Catholics {{worldwide}} to sacrifice for Catholic missions, stating {{at the same}} time in Maximum Illud that these missions should foster local culture and not import European cultures. The damages of such cultural imports were particularly grave in Africa and Asia, where many missionaries were deported and incarcerated if <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> to originate from a hostile nation.|$|E
25|$|Brilliant as {{this book}} is as a novel, {{and a piece of}} {{brilliant}} literature, it is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow “confessions” by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was not the fact that <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> – for obviously such things are necessary in a totalitarian society – but the eagerness of Western intellectuals to justify them.|$|E
25|$|It was {{generally}} believed that babies would not remember any pain that <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> to feel, and {{that lack of}} conscious memory meant lack of long-term harm. Scientific studies on animals with various brain lesions were interpreted as supporting {{the idea that the}} responses seen in babies were merely spinal reflexes. Furthermore, the whole effort of relieving pain was considered futile since it was thought to be impossible to measure the child's pain.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the DVD edition, the German TV {{release was}} re-cut {{to include some}} {{flashback}} scenes at points where they mattered within the story, {{and not in the}} chronological order in which <b>they</b> <b>happened.</b> For example, Stanley's capture by the pirates was shown as a flashback in the fourth episode ("Gigashadow") of the miniseries, whereas the DVD version includes it prior to the Cluster scenes early on in the first episode of the show, somewhat out of context.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the {{disturbances}} {{broke out}} in South Central, local television news cameras were on the scene to record the events as <b>they</b> <b>happened.</b> Television coverage of the riots was near-continuous, starting with the beating of motorists at the intersection of Florence and Normandie broadcast live by television news pilot/reporter Bob Tur and his camera operator Marika Gerrard. By virtue of their extensive coverage, mainstream television stations provided a vivid, comprehensive and valuable record of the violence occurring on the streets of Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Pope John XXIII's Code of Rubrics divided Sundays {{into two}} classes. Sundays of the I class were {{the four of}} Advent, the four of Lent, the two of Passiontide, Easter Sunday, Low Sunday, and Pentecost. No feast {{whatsoever}} could replace the celebration of these Sundays, with the sole exception of {{the feast of the}} Immaculate Conception. All other Sundays were of II class, and outranked feasts of II class, with the exception that feasts of the Lord, whether I or II class, replaced celebration of a II class Sunday on which <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> to fall.|$|E

Hornbeck lived with Devlin, who presented the boy as his son. He was separated from his family for a total of four years, three months and six days, during which time the Shawn Hornbeck Foundation and Search and Rescue Team were established. Both boys were reunited with their families after their discovery.|$|E
25|$|In September 1961, American {{automotive}} designer Carroll Shelby {{wrote to}} AC asking {{if they would}} build him a car modified to accept a V8 engine. AC agreed, provided a suitable engine could be found. Shelby went to Chevrolet {{to see if they}} would provide him with engines, but not wanting to add competition to the Corvette they said no. However, Ford wanted a car that could compete with the Corvette and <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> to have a brand new engine which could be used in this endeavor: the Windsor 221 in³ (3.6 L) engine – a new lightweight, thin-wall cast small-block V8. Ford provided Shelby with two engines.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{crossing}} where the crash occurred {{is known as}} an interconnected crossing {{because of the need}} to link the railroad signals to the road signals to ensure safe passage. On this particular route, bus drivers on Algonquin Road had been known to cross the tracks to stop at the line at Northwest Highway, leaving them vulnerable to passing trains if <b>they</b> <b>happened</b> to still be stopped when the gates lowered. In addition, vehicle sensors were only present {{on the north side of}} the railroad tracks. Buses, trucks and other large vehicles were forced to pull through the railroad crossing in order to activate the signals at the intersection.|$|E
