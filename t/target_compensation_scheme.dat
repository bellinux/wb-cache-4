40|$|Bankers’ <b>Compensation</b> <b>Schemes</b> {{have long}} been a topic of {{interest}} for regulators and academics alike, with early seminal work on the links between pay and performance by Jensen and Meckling (1976), and early discussions around the impact of compensation on risk taking by Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1982). Despite interest saturating over time, the Financial Crisis of 2007 / 2008 catapulted Bankers’ <b>Compensation</b> <b>Schemes</b> back into the headlines of media and the forefront of politics. Much of the focus was generated due to the speculation that bankers’ <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> were thought to allow and reward excessive risk taking behavior, which Jickling (2010) describes {{as one of the}} contributing factors to the Financial Crisis. Naturally a succession of reforms in the Financial Sector have been proposed aimed at averting future financial catastrophes. Notably, the Dodd Frank Review (2010) which forms part of what Obama describes as ‘the biggest reform of the Financial Sector since The Great Depression’. Part of the proposed reform has <b>targeted</b> bankers’ <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes,</b> from official reports such as the Dodd Frank review but also academic studies such as Bebchuk and Spamann (2009). Whilst the proposed reform responds logically to evidence on the risk-compensation relationship from studies such as Rajgopal and Shevlin (2002), the reforms fail to address the counter evidence and concerns. Such concerns are raised by numerous academics and financial commentators such as Carpenter and Walter (2010), Jensen and Murphy (1990), with particular reference to excessive shareholder risk taking and the composition of equity payments. The primary goal {{of this paper is to}} provide further more conclusive evidence on the extent to which current Bankers’ <b>Compensation</b> <b>Schemes</b> induce excessively risky strategies, whilst addressing some of the flaws in previous studies, detailed in the unique contributions of this paper. The findings will be of crucial importance as compensation reform will undoubtedly trouble the Financial Industry, so reform will need to have solid economic rationale, thus dismissing claims from the industry that it is a political knee jerk reaction to punish Bankers for the Crisis...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes the {{enactment}} of an ex gratia <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> for loss of Indigenous languages in Australia. Although some Australian states have enacted ex gratia <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> {{for the victims of}} the Stolen Generation policies, the victims of 'linguicide' (language killing) are largely overlooked by the Australian Government. Existing grant schemes to support Aboriginal languages are inadequate, and they should be complemented with <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are based on a claim of right. The proposed <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> for the loss of Aboriginal languages should support the effort to reclaim and revive the lost languages.

After evaluating the limits of existing Australian law in supporting the language revival efforts, this paper proposes a statute-based ex gratia <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme,</b> which can be colloquially called 'Native Tongue Title'.

Time and time again, architects of workers <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> (drawn primarily from business and the legal communities), have proposed workers compensation arrangements where rehabilitation is an ‘add-on’, rather than the primary focus of the scheme.

40|$|With a {{two-stage}} {{computer lab}} experiment in which three-person groups develop marketing slogans {{for a range}} of products shown, this paper investigates whether the presence of relative performance feedback has different effects on creativity-weighted performance when groups are compensated with a tournament <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> based on quantity only or on both quantity and creativity. Creativity-weighted performance is defined as the product of quantity and the average creativity rating of that quantity. Additionally, we also examine the effects of relative performance feedback and <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> on both dimensions underlying this multi-dimensional performance measure, namely quantity and creativity. We find that a creativity-weighted <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> can enhance creativity, but consistent with research at the individual level, is not successful in stimulating higher creativity-weighted performance as compared to a quantity only <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme.</b> A quantity only <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme,</b> in turn, leads to higher quantity as compared to a creativity-weighted <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme.</b> Furthermore, our findings indicate that the effect of relative performance feedback on creativity-weighted performance strongly depends on the type of <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme.</b> Providing relative performance feedback to quantity only groups appears to be beneficial for creativity-weighted performance, whereas the reverse seems to hold for groups compensated for both quantity and creativity. In order to explain these results, we also report on differences and changes in groups’ behavior related to communication and task division. More specifically, we argue that groups compensated for both quantity and creativity decide to a larger extent jointly on the task and communicate more than groups compensated for quantity only. For practice, our study has several implications for the design of <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> and reporting systems related to providing feedback in organizations. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Inverter dead-time, {{which is}} meant to prevent {{shoot-through}} fault, causes harmonic distortion and change in the fundamental voltage in the inverter output. Typical dead-time <b>compensation</b> <b>schemes</b> ensure that the amplitude of the fundamental output current is as desired, and also improve the current waveform quality significantly. However, even with compensation, the motor line current waveform is observed to be distorted close to the current zero-crossings. The IGBT switching transition times being significantly longer at low currents than at high currents is an important reason for this zero-crossover distortion. Hence, this paper proposes an improved dead-time <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme,</b> which makes use of the measured IGBT switching transition times at low currents. Measured line current waveforms in a 2. 2 kW induction motor drive with the proposed <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> are compared against those with the conventional dead-time <b>compensation</b> <b>scheme</b> and without dead-time compensation.
