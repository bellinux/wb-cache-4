40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore what effect manager {{involvement}} in the delivery of training has on employee learning (<b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning) and on student behavior after training (<b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training). Study participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups and a customer service training program was delivered with and without manager involvement. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected immediately after training using a retrospective pretest-then/posttest-now instrument developed to measure the participants' perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected approximately 4 weeks after training also using a retrospective pretest-then/posttest-now instrument developed to measure the participants' perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. Quality assurance data generated by the organization for the first full month after the training program was completed were collected to measure the actual <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. A 13 -item version of the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MC-C) was included with the perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training survey to measure the potential for self-perception bias with the perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning and the perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training data. ANOVA results for the perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning and perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training data indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups. ANOVA results for the actual <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training data mirrored the results found for the perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. The possibility of self-perception bias in using the retrospective pretest-then/posttest-now instruments was recognized as a study concern with MC-C data indicating a much higher level of social desirability with the sample population than with reported non-forensic norms. A slight positive influence on the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning and on the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training was found when a participant's direct manager was involved in the delivery of training...|$|R

5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium.

40|$|Employee {{training}} programs {{need to develop}} ways of increasing the likelihood that learned skills and behaviours are used when employees return to their jobs, i. e., that "transfer of training" occurs. One way to facilitate <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training is to perform a post-training intervention designed to increase <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. This dissertation has four main purposes. The first purpose was to test the effects of two post-training interventions, relapse prevention and transfer enhancement, in a 2 x 2 experimental design. The two interventions were designed to increase <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training by increasing self-efficacy for the training task, or a person's belief {{in his or her}} ability to perform the training task. Subjects were 147 nurses from one hospital who participated in a two day workshop. Self-efficacy and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training were measured by both self-reports and supervisor reports at two and six months following training. Contrary to prediction, the two post-training interventions did not result in higher <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training than the control group. It is suggested that the training itself was effective in increasing self-efficacy and in leading to <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training in control subjects, making post-training interventions redundant for this training program. The second purpose was to test the effect of "motivation to learn" on <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. Strong support was found for the hypothesis that "motivation to learn" is positively related to <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. The third purpose of the dissertation was to examine the process by which <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training occurs. This study hypothesized that self-efficacy would be positively related to <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training, and strong support was found for this hypothesis. The fourth purpose of the dissertation was to examine the influence <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> climate on <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. It was found that supervisor and coworker support had a positive effect on self-reported but not supervisor-reported <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training.

5|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{gun control}} advocates have voiced {{concern over the}} {{perceived}} loophole in legislation, and campaigned to require background checks and record-keeping for all gun sales. Contrarily, gun rights advocates have stated {{that there is no}} loophole, that current laws provide a single, uniform set of rules for commercial gun sellers regardless of the place of sale, and that no part of the United States Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate non-commercial, intrastate <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> legal firearms types between private citizens.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Brady bill loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> firearms require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E
40|$|Within our commercialised market society, {{contractual}} relationships are objectified and valued in monetary terms. This {{raises the question}} of the transferability <b>of</b> contracts. <b>Transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract implies a substitution of one the existing contractual parties. It intends the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the entire contractual position of the transferor to a third party, as a result of which the latter would fully replace the transferor, who is completely discharged from the contractual relationship. An important advantage is that the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract upholds the identity of the contractual relationship and thus maintains that relationship with all its securities and defences. The term of the contract and any prescription which has commenced, will continue to run and the contract will in principle be governed by the law as applied {{at the time of its}} conclusion. In Belgian and French law a general theory <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract is lacking. Not only the possibility of a full substitution of a contractual party, but also the requirements for the conclusion <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract and its consequences are highly debated. Moreover, the distinction between a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract and a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contractual rights/debts is unclear. The research therefore envisages to develop a general legal regime for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract ut singuli. The first part of the research is a conceptual analysis of the possibility <b>of</b> a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract. It focuses on the concept of contractual relationship/contractual position as distinct from the concept of contractual right or contractual debt/ obligation. Subsequently, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract is considered as a (subjective) modification of the contractual relationship. The second part of the research discusses the conclusion <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract and more specifically the consent requirement and clarifies the different consequences <b>of</b> a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> contract such as the discharge of the transferor. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> {{learning}} {{refers to}} {{the application of the}} knowledge and skills learners acquire in training sessions to their workplace. In this sense, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning has been a vital concern for training effectiveness. For training to be effective, trainees(learners) should be able to use what they learn in training program back on the job. However, while the importance of training is generally accepted in practice, there has been little attention paid to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning. In addition, although the government, and in particular the Ministry of Employment and Labor, has supported training for employees in companies, the concern for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training knowledge remains a compelling need to examine the status <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning in companies and to suggest measures to improve the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> learning.

5|$|Consequently, by 1612–13, the Wodeyars {{exercised}} a {{great deal}} of autonomy and even though they acknowledged the nominal overlordship of the Aravidu dynasty, tributes and <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> revenue to Chandragiri stopped. This was in marked contrast to other major chiefs Nayaks of Tamil country who continued to pay off Chandragiri emperors well into the 1630s. Chamaraja VI and Kanthirava Narasaraja I attempted to expand further northward but were thwarted by the Bijapur Sultanate and its Maratha subordinates, though the Bijapur armies under Ranadullah Khan were effectively repelled in their 1638 siege of Srirangapatna. Expansionist ambitions then turned southward into Tamil country where Narasaraja Wodeyar acquired Satyamangalam (in modern northern Coimbatore district) while his successor Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar expanded further to capture western Tamil regions of Erode and Dharmapuri, after successfully repulsing the chiefs of Madurai. The invasion of the Keladi Nayakas of Malnad was also dealt with successfully. This period was followed by one of complex geo-political changes, when in the 1670s, the Marathas and the Mughals pressed into the Deccan.|$|E

Instead, he taught himself as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harmáček was required {{to go through the}} film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were cropped, Boba Fett's voice was changed, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray release, while other sequences were upscaled from GOUT. To create the cuts, source material was taken from the 2011 Blu-ray releases, HDTV broadcasts of the 2004 DVDs, GOUT, digital broadcasts of the 1997 Special Edition, the 1993 LaserDiscs, digital <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> a Spanish 35mm Kodak LPP and 70mm film cels, a 16mm print, and still images of the original matte paintings.

5|$|In 1873, Barton S. Alexander {{completed}} a {{report for the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{that was the first}} attempt at creating a Central Valley Project. In 1904, the Bureau of Reclamation (then the Reclamation Service) first became interested in creating such a water project, but did not get far involved until a series of droughts and related disasters occurred in the early 1920s. The State of California passed the Central Valley Project Act in 1933, which authorized Reclamation to sell revenue bonds in order to raise about $170 million for the project. Unfortunately, because of insufficient money in the state's treasury and the coincidence with the Great Depression, California turned to the national government for funding to build the project. This resulted in several <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> the project between California and the federal government, and between Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The first dams and canals of the project started going up in the late 1930s, and the last facilities were completed in the early 1970s.

The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent.
