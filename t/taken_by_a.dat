5|$|Eggs are <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, {{with the latter}} being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, common loon eggs are especially vulnerable if the adult is absent.|$|E

The judgement was overturned in David's favour in May 2008.|$|E

5|$|High Explosive Research was the British {{project to}} {{independently}} develop atomic bombs after the Second World War. This decision was <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> cabinet sub-committee on 8 January 1947, {{in response to}} apprehension of an American return to isolationism, fears that Britain might lose its great power status, and the actions by the United States to unilaterally withdraw from sharing of nuclear technology under the 1943 Quebec Agreement. The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948.|$|E

There is also ambiguity in similar murders as to the sex of the killer. Evidence from the crime scene leads the duo to an Amish-like community in Steveston, Massachusetts, which Mulder calls the Kindred.|$|E

Intelligence gained from decrypting German radio messages during early July, and photos <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> RAF aircraft on 12 July, provided further evidence that the battleship was once again fully operational and possibly preparing to put to sea. The airmen were informed on 13 July that they would attack Kaafjord in four days time.|$|E
