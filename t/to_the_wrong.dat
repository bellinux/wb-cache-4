5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years introduced him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, {{he and his brother}} Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{criminal}} genius Lex Luthor {{plans to}} make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert land, then using a nuclear explosion on a weak point in the San Andreas Fault, sinking California and leaving Luthor's desert as the new West Coast, greatly increasing its value. Upon learning the U.S Army and U.S. Navy will launch a twin nuclear missile test, he diverts one missile to the weak spot, after his incompetent henchman Otis accidentally redirects the first missile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> place.|$|E

Only 26 men from F Company returned, the rest were killed or captured in the subsequent ambush. Altogether, the 5th Cavalry Regiment suffered 275 casualties on July 25.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E

25|$|The flawed {{primary mirror}} of the Hubble Space Telescope was ground and {{polished}} in Danbury by Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit from 1979 to 1981.

25|$|The orange litter-mates {{of white}} tigers are not prone to strabismus. Siamese cats and albinos of every species {{which have been}} studied all exhibit the same visual pathway {{abnormality}} found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality {{is that there is}} a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.|$|E
