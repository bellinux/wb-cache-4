25|$|The Chief Physician (Hekim Başı) and the Chief Tutor {{shared this}} place as their residence. The Chief Physician was {{responsible}} for the health of the sultan and the imperial family and used to prepare the medicines here.

25|$|In 2002, the {{new housing}} projects, Huei Long Hospital (迴龍醫院) was initiated, {{but instead of}} ‘houses’ which were earlier promised <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> the new {{director}} gave them two tall buildings with modern hospital facilities. It {{became clear that the}} new administration team intended to run a hospital business. The skyscraper-ish hospital buildings were designed mainly for housing short-term patients; therefore it has inadequate space for residents to move around freely. Moreover, the hospital management team forbids the patients from bringing with them personal belongings, from cooking, and from coming over to the front building, which policy is nothing less than discriminative.|$|E
25|$|In a {{judgment}} delivered on 16 July 1999 Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, speaking {{on behalf of}} the Court of Appeal, upheld the judgment of the High Court. He held that Coughlan had established a legitimate expectation of a substantive nature {{as a result of the}} promise made by the Health Authority <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> who had agreed to move from Newcourt Hospital to Mardon House. The legitimate expectation arose from the fact that the promise made to Coughlan had been specific to those premises, expressly made to a small group of people within the same category, conveyed in unqualified terms, and repeated and confirmed in representations made to the group.|$|E
25|$|The goal of most {{emergency}} medical services is to either provide treatment to those in need of urgent medical care, {{with the goal of}} satisfactorily treating the presenting conditions, or arranging for timely removal of the patient to the next point of definitive care. This is most likely an emergency department at a hospital. The term {{emergency medical}} service evolved to reflect a change from a simple system of ambulances providing only transport, to a system in which preliminary medical care is given on scene and during transport. In some developing regions, the term is not used, or may be used inaccurately, since the service in question does not provide treatment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> but only the provision of transport to the point of care.|$|E

25|$|For many {{patients}} with stage I cancer, adjuvant (preventative) therapy following surgery {{may not be}} appropriate and patients will undergo surveillance instead. The form this surveillance takes, e.g. the type and frequency of investigations and the length time it should continue, {{will depend on the}} type of cancer (non-seminoma or seminoma), but the aim is to avoid unnecessary treatments in the {{many patients}} who are cured by their surgery, and ensure that any relapses with metastases (secondary cancers) are detected early and cured. This approach ensures that chemotherapy and or radiotherapy is only given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> that need it. The number of patients ultimately cured is the same using surveillance as post-operative “adjuvant” treatments, but the patients {{have to be prepared to}} follow a prolonged series of visits and tests.|$|E
25|$|Wen was {{involved}} in two major episodes involving public health. In early 2003, he {{was involved}} in ending the official inaction over the SARS crisis. On 1 December 2004, he became the first major Chinese official to publicly address the problem of AIDS, which has devastated parts of Yunnan and Henan and threatens to be a major burden on Chinese development. Since May 2004, Wen made various visits to communities devastated by AIDS, trips shown prominently on national media. By showing these actions, Wen displayed an effort to reverse years of what many activists have described as a policy of denial and inaction. Furthermore, Wen is concerned about {{the health and safety of}} previous drug addicts; since March 2004, Wen had visited several drug addict treatment facilities in southern China and addressed the issue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> in person, recognizing that AIDS is more likely to be spread by drug abuse and the reuse of hypodermic syringes than by sexual contact.|$|E
25|$|In medieval Europe, traditionally, {{there are}} three methods one can use to cure a victim of werewolfism; medicinally (usually via the use of wolfsbane), surgically, or by exorcism. However, many of the cures {{advocated}} by medieval medical practitioners proved fatal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> A Sicilian belief of Arabic origin holds that a werewolf can be cured of its ailment by striking it on the forehead or scalp with a knife. Another belief from the same culture involves the piercing of the werewolf's hands with nails. Sometimes, less extreme methods were used. In the German lowland of Schleswig-Holstein, a werewolf could be cured {{if one were to}} simply address it three times by its Christian name, while one Danish belief holds that merely scolding a werewolf will cure it. Conversion to Christianity is also a common method of removing werewolfism in the medieval period; a devotion to St. Hubert has also been cited as both cure for and protection from lycanthropes.|$|E
50|$|Raising {{the head}} (known as a Fowler's position) can provide some {{benefits}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> <b>the</b> staff, or both.

25|$|Reed Hall was {{the main}} {{building}} at Dixmont and was named after the first superintendent of Dixmont, Dr. Joseph A. Reed. It was typical of other Kirkbride facilities with the exception that the outermost wings swept forward instead of to the rear in the typical V-shape. This was to afford {{a better view of}} the river valley and better airflow, which was said to be more calming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> in keeping with the want of a serene setting. Early on, It had gas lighting, a central hot air system for heat, and more than ample supply of water from the Ohio River. Construction of the west wing was not complete until 1868, at which time construction of the east wing began. The center section of the building contained the front lobby, administrative offices, and chapel. This was mostly destroyed by fire in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Video game {{rehabilitation}}, {{also known}} as gaming rehabilitation {{is a process of}} using common video game consoles and methodology to target and improve physical and mental weaknesses through therapeutic processes. Platforms that feature motion control, notably the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft's Xbox Kinect, and Sony's Eye Toy, and virtual reality scenarios have all been effective in this field of research. Methodologies have been applied to all age groups, ranging from toddler to elderly aged people worldwide and have been used in a variety of cases ranging from stroke rehabilitation, cerebral palsy and other neurological impairments, to people with tendinitis and multiple sclerosis. Researchers have promoted such technology based on the personalization of gaming systems to patients which allows for further engagement and interaction. Additionally, gaming consoles have the ability to capture real-time data and provide instant feedback <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> using the systems. Currently, several researchers have performed case studies to demonstrate the benefits of this technology, however, repeat trials and experiments have shown that outcomes are easily replicated among several groups worldwide. Additionally, the outcomes have increased interest in the field, growing experiments beyond simple case studies to experiments with larger participant basis.|$|E
25|$|Archibald's work in {{investigating}} the disease of pancreatitis {{led to the}} development of the sphincterotomy, a procedure still in use today. His earlier experience with tuberculosis prompted him to look beyond neurosurgery into other areas of the body, and his work in fighting tuberculosis led to the refining of thoracic surgery. When World War I began, Archibald went with the Third Canadian General Hospital to France, where he was able to apply his experience in combating the disease <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> he encountered on the war front. The surgeon was also greatly interested in the education of new surgeons, and believed that the standard of doctor education had been declining, leaving incapable surgeons to perform procedures. Archibald returned to McGill University, this time as a staff member in the Department of Surgery, and revitalised it following almost thirty years of stagnation. In 1929, he served as a member of the first Royal College of Surgeons of Canada Examining Board in Surgery, and after becoming President of the American Surgical Association in 1935, made a speech entitled Higher Degrees in the Profession of Surgery, triggering the formation of the American Board of Surgery. He was also considered a key influence in the surgical education of Norman Bethune, however he reportedly disapproved of Bethune and his actions. Additionally, he was a mentor to Wilder Penfield, another famous physician who worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital.|$|E

500|$|Having {{arrived at}} Holby as an F1, Oliver quickly progressed onto his F2 training. This {{resulted}} in [...] "professional jealousy" [...] forming with Penny, and in retaliation to their disagreements, he put {{her career in}} jeopardy by revealing her affair. Registrar Greg Douglas was appointed as Oliver's mentor. The fast-paced storyline saw Greg initially [...] "kick against his newfound responsibility", before realising that Oliver could be beneficial to his own career, which resulted in an [...] "unlikely friendship" [...] forming between them. Though a [...] "fairly light, buddy-buddy" [...] storyline to begin with, Anderson felt that filming their scenes was [...] "intensive". Speaking of their friendship, Anderson explained: [...] "We start {{off on the wrong}} foot with each other and we're competitive, which is unhelpful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> and (initially) we're not out to help one another at all. But they have similarities... in terms of dropping people in it." [...] The pace of the storyline had to be changed when Anderson injured his knee upon falling down a ten foot cellar. The pair clashed over conflicting medical opinions on patient care, and their friendship soon created a negative effect over Oliver's work ethic. Greg's jokes at his expense left Oliver unable to carry out simple procedures correctly.|$|E
