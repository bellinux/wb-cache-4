5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} in the bar, Diane returns to the office and accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> her. They argue, admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
25|$|By November 2006, Kip and B.G. {{began to}} show displeasure in TNA and {{threatened}} to go find work elsewhere {{if they did not}} receive gold soon. They began performing the crotch chop, a reference to the WWE's DX. On the November 2 edition of Impact!, Kip and B.G. threatened to quit. Kip grabbed the mic and tried <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the TNA administration and Spike TV, but each time his mic was cut off. Kip then tried to use the announcer's headset, but it was cut off as well. Frustrated, he started yelling loudly to the crowd, but he was cut off again as the show went to a commercial break. When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was reported that the segment was a worked shoot that Vince Russo had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return. Kip and BG appeared in an internet video on TNA's website where they addressed the owner of WWE Vince McMahon.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] {{contains}} {{an allusion to}} the 1989 film, Batman, with the line, [...] "You're my number one guy". In an interview with The Fader magazine, Taylor said the reference {{was a result of}} thinking about the Batman film, which has many things that Taylor is fond of, such as the Prince soundtrack. He commented that sometimes those items [...] "seep into what we're writing about" [...] and said that he likes to reference [...] "in an oblique way". He conjectured that he had included the line <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> [...] "everyone in the band, particularly to Joe , 'You're my number one guy, why is there any problems between any of us?' [...] " ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was at this}} juncture, when Walt {{had just}} {{decided it was time}} for him <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> relieve the strain, that Wolf, who had been away nosing through the brush, trotted wolf-like into view.|$|R
2500|$|According to Plutarch, {{after the}} assassination, Brutus stepped forward as if <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> his fellow senators; they, however, fled the building. Brutus {{and his companions}} then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: [...] "People of Rome, we are once again free!" [...] They were met with silence, as the {{citizens}} of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses {{as soon as the}} rumour of what had taken place had begun to spread. Caesar's dead body lay where it fell on the Senate floor for nearly three hours before other officials arrived to remove it.|$|E
2500|$|Queen {{said that}} to stand out in the male-dominated world of reggaeton, {{she would have to}} deliver a strong point of view from a female perspective, saying, [...] "God blessed me with a {{powerful}} voice. It is not feminine. It is not masculine. It is just a thick voice." [...] Queen also stated that her achievements are all {{due to the fact that}} she is an artist who, “always [...] something <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> contribute. [...] never came with empty rhythm or lyrics. [...] the girl that could write and sing and go to the platform and kill, as we say”. She created music people's bodies could move to but was consistent in standing her ground and standing for agency and women empowerment with lyric like in [...] "Quiero Baliar" [...] where she states [...] "Yo quire bailar/Tu quires sudar/Y pegarte a mi/El cuerpo rozar/Yo the dig si tu me suedes provocar/Eso no quiere decir qui pa la came voy". In these lyric she explicitly states she wants to dance, and her partner wants to sweat, and as long as she gives her partner the go ahead they can provoke her, but it still does not give her partner permission to think she is sexually bound to them, because according to Ivy, that is a common misunderstanding when regarding certain forms of reggaeton dance. Since beginning her career, Queen has wanted to create and compose songs [...] "that have some kind of subject matter" [...] so that people understand the concept and message. Instead of the vulgar lyrics common in reggaeton, Queen prefers to sing about defending women while touching on themes of social political matters, homosexuality, racism, love and heartbreak. Queen says she writes songs that [...] "put bad men in their places or stand up for the single mothers". In [...] "Que Lloren" [...] she discusses romance from a woman's perspective while belittling the stereotype that men shouldn't cry or show emotions. In [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] she [...] "berates a lover who thinks that just because they dance she is automatically going to bed with him." [...] "Mi Barrio" [...] is a socio-political charged song which criticizes [...] "the problems present in Añasco, Puerto Rico". Queen compared the song to [...] "Corazones" [...] by Daddy Yankee from his album Barrio Fino.|$|E
