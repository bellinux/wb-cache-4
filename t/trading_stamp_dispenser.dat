50|$|The use of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> {{began in}} Canada circa 1900 but their use was {{banned by the}} Canadian {{government}} in 1905. In 1959 the grocery chain Loblaws introduced their Lucky Green Stamps program and a <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> program was started by an IGA grocery store in Winnipeg. Although faced with legal challenges the use of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> in these instances was upheld as legal since they {{did not meet the}} definition of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> in the Canadian Criminal Code.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> grew {{with the}} spread of chain {{gasoline}} stations in the early 1910s and the then new industry of chain supermarkets in the 1920s. Merchants found it more profitable to award them to all customers rather than cash only customers. Legal challenges {{regarding the use of}} <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> were raised in various jurisdictions around the United States but were often struck down. Some merchant groups disliked <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> and actively worked to have them banned in their areas. Following World War II the use of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> expanded when supermarkets began issuing them as a customer incentive. By 1957 it was estimated that nearly 250,000 retail outlets were issuing <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> with nearly two thirds of American households saving various <b>trading</b> <b>stamps.</b> During this time <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> companies had between 1,400 - 1,600 retail centers where consumers could redeem their <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> for consumer goods. In the early 1960s, the S&H Green Stamps company boasted that it printed more stamps annually than the number of postage stamps printed by the US government. In 1968 it was reported that more than $900 million in stamps were sold in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|In 1896 the Sperry and Hutchinson Company {{was created}} as an {{independent}} <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> company in the United States and by 1957 {{it was estimated that}} there were approximately 200 <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> companies in operation. [...] Typically, merchants would pay a third-party <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> company for the stamps and would then advertise that they gave away <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> with purchases. Large retailers were usually given a discount on the stamps while smaller retailers generally had to pay the full cost of adopting the <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> program for their business. The intent of this was to get customers to be loyal to the merchant, so that they would continue shopping there to obtain enough stamps to redeem for merchandise. Customers would fill books with stamps, and take the books to a <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> company redemption center to exchange them for premiums. [...] Books could also be sent to the <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> company in exchange for premium merchandise via mail order catalogs. An example of the value of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> would be during the 1970s and 1980s where the typical rate issued by a merchant was one stamp for each 10Â¢ of merchandise purchased. A typical book took approximately 1200 stamps to fill, or the equivalent of US $120.00 in purchases.|$|R

50|$|FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson <b>Trading</b> <b>Stamp</b> Co., 405 U.S. 233 (1972). Case {{held that}} the FTC is {{entitled}} to bring enforcement action against businesses that act unfairly, as where supermarket <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> company injured consumers by prohibiting them from exchanging <b>trading</b> <b>stamps.</b> The FTC could prevent the restrictive practice as unfair, {{even though there was}} no specific antitrust violation.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> were {{introduced}} in 1891, the Blue <b>Stamp</b> <b>Trading</b> System, where <b>stamps</b> affixed to booklets could be redeemed for store products. [...] The Sperry and Hutchinson Company, started in 1896 in Jackson, Michigan, was the first third-party provider of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> for various companies, including dry goods dealers, gas stations and later supermarkets. S&H Green Stamps, as the company was commonly called, opened its first redemption center in 1897. Customers could take their filled booklets of [...] "green stamps" [...] and redeem them for household products, kitchen items, and personal items. When the G.I.s returned from World War II the <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> business took off when numerous third-party companies created their own <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> programs to offer to supermarkets and other retailers.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 76 - 78) <b>Trading</b> <b>stamps</b> {{are used}} as a promotional device by retailers {{as a method of}} non-price competition. In widespread use since the 1890 's, <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> sales reached the billion dollar mark in revenues in 1968 but have since declined in earnings. Prior studies concerning <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> have examined the reasons why people save stamps, the psychological benefits derived from saving them, the demographics of savers, and the attitudes of savers towards <b>trading</b> <b>stamps.</b> The purposes of this study are 1) to compare the personality profiles of <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> savers versus those of non- savers, and 2) to examine certain personality characteristics of husbands and wives in stamp saving households. An abbreviated form of the Thurstone Temperament Schedule was used to measure five personality traits (Active, Vigorous, Impulsive, Dominant, and Social) of stamp savers and non-stamp savers. The act of saving <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> was divided into stamp "collecting" and stamp "redeeming. " Five classifications were designed to describe stamp "collectors" and three classifications were designed to describe stamp "redeemers. " A sample of 320 married individuals was selected from among shoppers at two supermarkets which gave <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> and at two which did not give stamps. All four supermarkets were located in the Northridge-Granada Hills area of the San Fernando Valley. Willing respondents were interviewed at the supermarkets and then given a questionnaire to take home. The results of this study may be used by retailers in their advertising and promotional campaigns in appealing to both stamp savers and non-savers. The marketing implications for the <b>trading</b> <b>stamp</b> companies relate to the planning and organizing of inventory and store layouts for their redemption centers...|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s the use of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> began to decline.

During the 1980s there was a resurgence in the popularity of <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> for a time but overall their use continued to decline.

5000|$|The {{practice}} of retailers issuing <b>trading</b> <b>stamps</b> started in 1891 at the Schuster's Department Store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
