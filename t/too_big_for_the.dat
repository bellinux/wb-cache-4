5|$|As a youth, Ezeh {{was unable}} to play {{football}} because he was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> local leagues according to Grand Rapids area officials. As a sophomore running back for the 2003 Catholic Central Cougars football team, Ezeh had several 100-yard games as well as multiple touchdown games, {{even though he was}} not the primary weapon in the backfield. Ezeh was {{also a member of the}} Cougars rugby team that placed 11th at the 2004 United States High School Rugby National Championships.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, the Government {{felt that}} the best way to ensure {{minority}} representation in Parliament was to introduce the GRC scheme. In addition, it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates, as it would be economical for a town council to manage a group of three constituencies. Subsequently, in 1991, the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies which had grown <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> MPs serving them, and, in 1996, GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents that they needed to be effective.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit {{what was in the}} script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E

50|$|During the {{construction}} of Tegel Airfield in the French sector of Berlin, large construction equipment was needed to build new runways. But this equipment, including a rock crusher, was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> even <b>the</b> Globemaster to accommodate. The mission was accomplished by having the equipment cut into pieces by welding torch at Rhein-Main and flown aboard the C-74 into Gatow for reassembly.|$|R
50|$|The Lord {{poured out}} his spirit upon {{us and the}} brethren began to confess their faults one to the other. The {{congregation}} was soon overwhelmed in tears {{and some of our}} hearts were <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> utterance. <b>The</b> gift of tongues come upon us also like the rushing of a mighty wind and my soul was filled with the glory of God.|$|R
5|$|The {{importance}} of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886, {{the year in}} which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea. The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond, and ships became <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> port. The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971, and although they now house a marina they are currently little used. The surrounding quays have been developed for housing, although the remains of wooden quays on the riverbank can still be seen. All but a small remnant of the mump (a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations) was removed in the 1980s {{to make way for the}} development on the north side of the dock. Due to the port, ship building was also an important industry, and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century by companies including David Williams, Joseph Gough, Watsons and William Lowther. F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town— the Irene. The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{originally}} {{ordered the}} construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered {{the construction of}} 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy.|$|E

50|$|Pedrolino's costume was {{essentially}} like Pierrot's -- white, big buttons, short hat, and white face -- {{but it was}} way <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> him, and <b>the</b> sleeves covered his hands, to emphasize that Pedrolino was a little person in hand-me-downs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I declare I shouldn't {{have known}} you!" [...] exclaimed the good woman, {{surveying}} {{the boy with}} great satisfaction; for, though still very thin and tired, the lad had a tidy look that pleased her, and a lively way of moving about in his clothes, like an eel in a skin rather <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> him. <b>The</b> merry black eyes seemed to see every thing, the voice had an honest sound, and the sunburnt face looked several years younger since the unnatural despondency {{had gone out of}} it.|$|R
25|$|The {{picture was}} to be {{exhibited}} in the King's Hall of the then Parliament House with the other historic records of events as {{the opening of the}} first Parliament in Canberra in 1927 and the Royal opening of Parliament in 1954, however it was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> available space. The decision was made to store the painting at the Australian War Memorial after a tour of the various state galleries. In 1969, the painting was moved to the Parliament House basement where it remained until 1980.|$|E
25|$|Roach invited President Rutherford B. Hayes and {{the entire}} U.S. Congress to the launch of City of Para in 1878, but to his consternation, his {{attempts}} to secure subsidies from the U.S. and Brazilian governments were both to meet with failure. Meanwhile, Mallory's misgivings that the ships were <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> available trade proved correct, and Roach was faced with cutthroat competition from a British shipping line. After several years of increasing losses, he was forced in 1881 to sell the ships and wind up the Line.|$|E
25|$|With its capture, Phan Rang Air Base {{became a}} Vietnam People's Air Force base. It is unclear {{to what extent}} the former USAF {{facilities}} were used, although aerial imagery shows that a large amount of the station was torn down over the years, the large base simply being <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> VPAF, in addition the 04L/22R runway was inactivated, and today is almost obliterated. A few of the hangars remain standing, others have been torn down. The large aircraft parking ramp and concrete aircraft shelters remain, although the shelters appear to have been left unused. Steel and sand revetments also remain on the ramp.|$|E

50|$|The music project Modern System {{was created}} in tribute of Modern Talking and Blue System, with the main idea of make new {{versions}} of their old hits. They invited to the original choir of these projects, Rolf Köhler, Michael Scholz and Detlef Wiedeke, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> falsettos, and they recorded {{some of the most}} famous Modern Talking and Blue System songs, like Brother Louie, You're My Heart, You're My Soul, Cheri, Cheri Lady, My Bed is <b>Too</b> <b>Big,</b> Ready <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Victory, and others.|$|R
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} how the hull shape for Cutty Sark was chosen. Willis chose Hercules Linton {{to design and}} build the ship but Willis already possessed another ship, The Tweed, which he considered to have exceptional performance. The Tweed (originally Punjaub) was a frigate designed by Oliver Lang based on the lines of an old French frigate, built in Bombay for the East India Company as a combination sail/paddle steamer. She and a sister ship were purchased by Willis, who promptly sold the second ship plus engines from The Tweed for more than he paid for both. The Tweed was then lengthened and operated as a fast sailing vessel, but was considered <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tea runs. Willis also commissioned two all-iron clippers with designs based upon The Tweed, Hallowe'en and Blackadder. Linton was taken to view The Tweed in dry dock.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} the structure {{are thought to be}} a window on the west side and the porch, dating back to the late 13th century. Pevsner considered the porch to be [...] "astounding, but much <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> present house". Most of the main structure, consisting of two and a half storeys, and of rubble stone and stone-tiled roofs, dates to c. 1659 when it was built for a Mr Forster, although some parts are earlier. Later additions date to post-1711 and improvements to c. 1911.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{lasted from}} 15 September 2003 to 15 January 2004. The film was shot entirely using eight sound stages at Pinewood Studios, where, on the Pinewood backlot, {{the bottom half}} exterior of the Palais Garnier was constructed. The top half was implemented {{using a combination of}} computer-generated imagery (CGI) and a scale model created by Cinesite. The surrounding Paris skyline for [...] "All I Ask of You" [...] was entirely composed of matte paintings. Cinesite also created a miniature falling chandelier, since a life-size model was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> actual set.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} roadmapping process conducts {{three phases}} (see figure 1): preliminary activities, {{the development of}} the roadmap, and the follow-up activities phase. Because <b>the</b> process is <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> one model, <b>the</b> phases are modeled separately. In the models no different roles are made; this is because everything is done by the participants as a group.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the hand tools are hydraulically powered tools attached to heavy machinery.

500|$|During {{their stay}} in Cleveland during the tour, Gabriel told the band {{he would leave}} at its conclusion. He wrote a {{statement}} regarding his departure to the English press that was published in August 1975 titled [...] "Out, Angels Out", explaining he had become disillusioned with the music industry and wanted to spend extended time with his family. Banks later stated, [...] "Pete was also getting <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group. He was being portrayed {{as if he was}} 'the man' and it really wasn't like that. It was a very difficult thing to accommodate. So it was actually a bit of a relief." ...|$|E
500|$|Bovis Lend Lease, {{noted for}} work on Disneyland Paris, Petronas Towers, and the Time Warner Center, was the {{construction}} company. James McHugh Construction Co, the concrete subcontractor, implemented a comprehensive formwork {{for the construction of}} the building. At the completion of construction the building was the tallest formwork structure in the world, and follows in the footsteps of its neighbor, Marina City, as well as Chicago's Two Prudential Plaza, as past recordholders. Concrete moulding was used, because using a traditional ironwork structure would have required a building footprint that would have been <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> property size, proportional to the height of the designed building. A steel frame would have had to be [...] wider to have supported a building of this proportion. Concrete will counteract the force of wind with the force of gravity of the [...] building. A new chemical process that leveraged more fluid liquid concrete facilitated pumping concrete up several hundred feet to the elevating construction site. Although previous technology limited formwork to , this technology permitted the pumping of concrete [...] high.|$|E
500|$|As German film {{professor}} Anton Kaes wrote, [...] "The {{style of}} German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers {{to experiment with}} filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires, unconscious fears, and deranged fixations". The visual style of Caligari conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer, giving {{the impression of a}} nightmare or deranged sensibility, or a place transformed by evil, in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings [...] "amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments". The majority of the film's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator, and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown, giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman. As with German Expressionist paintings, the visual style of Caligari reflects an emotional reaction to world, {{and in the case of}} the film's characters represents an emotional response to the terror of society that Dr. Caligari and Cesare represent. Often in the film, set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene. For example, the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion. The characters seem <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> small building, and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern, all of which represent the patients' damaged frames of mind. Likewise, the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads, pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken-down state.|$|E

[...] Knowing this phase of the feud code, but not having practised it sufficiently, I overdid the thing by telling some slightly funny anecdotes. Sam laughed at exactly the right place--laughed with his mouth. When I caught sight of his mouth, I wished I had been blessed with enough sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes.|$|R
40|$|Telecommunications {{companies}} traditionally offer several tariffs {{from which}} their customers {{can choose the}} tariff that best suits their preferences. Yet, customers sometimes make choices that are not optimal for them {{because they do not}} minimize their bill for a certain usage amount. We show in this paper that companies should be very concerned about choices in which customers pick tariffs that are too small for them because they lead to a significant increase in customers churn. In contrast, {{this is not the case}} if customers choose tariffs that are <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> them. <b>The</b> reason is that in particular flat-rates provide customers with the additional benefit that they guarantee a constant bill amount that consumption can be enjoyed more freely because all costs are already accounted for...|$|R

2500|$|In 1985, Lim {{tried his}} hand at {{directing}} with David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, retitled Paradise Heights, for the Drama Festival. The Straits Times Rebecca Chua found that Lim's debut as director [...] "displayed some uncertainty". In the same year, Lim resigned from The Straits Times to set up TheatreWorks in February. TheatreWorks, the first adult professional theatre company in Singapore, was formed to [...] "promote theatre that is relevant to Singaporeans" [...] and create work for English-language actors. Lim served as the company's press and media relations consultant, in addition to acting in several of their plays. Lim also acted in the English-language versions of Kuo Pao Kun's influential plays The Coffin is <b>Too</b> <b>Big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hole (1985) and No Parking on Odd Days (1986). Both productions travelled to the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 1987. Of the role he originated in The Coffin is <b>Too</b> <b>Big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hole, Lim remembers: [...] "For me, [...] was panic stations. I had never done a long monologue. In drama school, we had to prepare monologues based on a Shakespearean character. Nothing like this, which was 30 to 35 minutes long. And [...] spent {{at least a couple}} of weeks just talking to me. I was worried. Because I thought, when is he going to get down to it?" [...] In preparation, Kuo and Lim visited a coffin-maker and discussed the nature of funerals while Lim memorised the script.|$|E
2500|$|The Docks {{brought with}} them many {{associated}} industries, such as flour and sugar processing, and also ship building. On 31 January 1858 the largest ship of that time, the SS Great Eastern designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was launched from the yard of Messrs Scott, Russell & Co, of Millwall. The [...] length was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> river so the ship had to be launched sideways. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch {{this was the last}} big ship to be built on the Island and the industry fell into a decline. However, parts of the launching slipway and plate works have been preserved in situ and may be seen close to Masthouse Terrace Pier.|$|E
2500|$|It {{may seem}} {{counterintuitive}} that a channel should allow potassium ions {{but not the}} smaller sodium ions through. However in an aqueous environment, potassium and sodium cations are solvated by water molecules. When moving through the selectivity filter of the potassium channel, the water-K+ interactions are replaced by interactions between K+ and carbonyl groups of the channel protein. The diameter of the selectivity filter is ideal for the potassium cation, but <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> smaller sodium cation. Hence the potassium cations are well [...] "solvated" [...] by the protein carbonyl groups, but these same carbonyl groups are too far apart to adequately solvate the sodium cation. Hence, the passage of potassium cations through this selectivity filter is strongly favored over sodium cations.|$|E

50|$|However {{some authors}} {{have argued that}} the cohomology of spacetime with {{integral}} coefficients is <b>too</b> <b>big.</b> <b>For</b> example, in <b>the</b> presence of Neveu-Schwarz H-flux or non-spin cycles some RR fluxes dictate the presence of D-branes. In the former case this is a consequence of the supergravity equation of motion which states that the product of a RR flux with the NS 3-form is a D-brane charge density. Thus the set of topologically distinct RR field strengths that can exist in brane-free configurations is only a subset of the cohomology with integral coefficients.|$|R
40|$|In Australia, when {{issues of}} health status are discussed, these discussions are often {{influenced}} by bigger issues affecting health outcomes including housing, education, transport, employment, income {{and access to}} healthcare services. There is strong evidence that these social determinants impact on {{the health and well-being}} of individuals and communities. Health-care providers and their agencies, however, are not deemed responsible for addressing these determinants of health – they are seen as <b>too</b> <b>big</b> and intractable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> health sector alone...|$|R
