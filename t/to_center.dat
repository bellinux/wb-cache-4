5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos {{doubled in the}} bottom half of the sixth to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose in the top of the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive <b>to</b> <b>center</b> field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E

He frequently clashed with coach Hubie Brown during the 1975–76 season, {{and at the end}} of the year, he accepted $3 million to fold the team during the 1976 ABA–NBA merger rather than paying $3 million for the team to join the National Basketball Association (NBA).|$|E

5|$|In July 2003, Linx {{reduced the}} number of daily {{services}} from Gothenburg to Copenhagen from ten to four. The company stated that this was because of insufficient ridership. Linx had offered tickets with a lower price than Scandinavian Airlines, who operated the airline service between Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. Ryanair also provided an airline service, but with fewer departures and with the same center-to-center transport time because it flew from the secondary Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. From 1 September 2003, Norwegian Air Shuttle started services from Gardermoen to Arlanda, and became a more direct competitor to Linx. From 27 October, Nordic Airlink (later FlyNordic) also started a flight between the same airports. With shorter travel time from center <b>to</b> <b>center</b> and comparable fares, Norwegian and Nordic started taking market shares away from Linx.|$|E
