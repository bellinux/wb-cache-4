5|$|In {{the final}} {{practice}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton managed to beat Ferrari, with <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> ahead of second-placed Massa by 0.063 seconds. Hamilton {{and the two}} Ferraris completed the top three, but Alonso was again down in eighth, having missed nearly {{the whole of the}} session with a faulty brake sensor. The Renaults sparked a return to form with Heikki Kovalainen and Giancarlo Fisichella fourth and fifth, both ahead of rivals BMW, who were sixth and fifteenth respectively.|$|E

5000|$|The Scots {{went over}} the water of Solway...and come into England, and robbed and {{destroyed}} all they might and spared no manner of thing until they come to York. And when <b>the</b> <b>Englishmen</b> at last heard of this thing, all that might travel-as well as monks and priests and friars and canons and seculars-come and meet with the Scots at Myton-on-Swale, the 12th day of October. Alas! What sorrow for the English husbandmen that knew nothing of war, they were quelled and drenched in the River Swale. And their holinesses, Sir William Melton, Archbishop of York, and the Abbot of Selby and their steeds, fled, and come to York. And that was their own folly that they had mischance, for they passed the water of Swale; and the Scots set fire to three stacks of hay; and the smoke of the fire was so huge that <b>the</b> <b>Englishmen</b> might not see the Scots. And when <b>the</b> <b>Englishmen</b> were gone over the water, so come the Scots with their wings in manner of a shield, and come toward <b>the</b> <b>Englishmen</b> in a rush; and <b>the</b> <b>Englishmen</b> fled, for they lacked any men of arms...and the Scots hobelars went between the bridge and <b>the</b> <b>Englishmen.</b> And when <b>the</b> great host had them met, <b>the</b> <b>Englishmen</b> almost all were slain. And he that might wend over the water was saved; but many were drenched. Alas, for sorrow! for there was slain many men of religion, and seculars, and also priests and clerks; and with much sorrow the Archbishop escaped; and therefore the Scots called it 'the White Battle'...|$|R

Ferrari was confirmed as Constructors' Champions as McLaren could not pass its points total {{in the final}} race. Coulthard's second-place finish helped to secure him third position in the World Drivers' Championship.

5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> Alan Hunter, concluded that it had occurred {{as a result of}} the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E
5|$|Settlers of European descent {{arrived on}} or near Catawissa Creek before 1776. The {{settlers}} included Alexander McCauley and Andrew Harger. McCauley left the area in 1776 and Harger was abducted by Indians. <b>The</b> <b>Englishman</b> Thomas Wilson was another early settler in the area. He lived in a cave on Catawissa Creek. The first mill in Columbia County was built on Catawissa Creek in 1774. Two other mills were built on the Creek in 1789 and 1799.|$|E

5|$|Australia had {{retained}} the Ashes, but England struck back at The Oval, where they posted the then-record Test score of 7/903. Early on, O'Reilly trapped Edrich lbw for 12, to secure his 100th Test wicket against England. In a timeless match, Len Hutton made {{a world record}} Test score of 364 in a fastidious and watchful innings of 13 hours, surpassing Bradman's 334. When he was on 333, O'Reilly deliberately bowled two no-balls {{in an attempt to}} break Hutton's concentration by tempting him to hit out, but <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> blocked them with a straight bat.|$|E
5|$|Cricket was {{introduced}} to Ireland by the English in the towns of Kilkenny and Ballinasloe in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, the game began to spread; many of the clubs which were founded in the following 30years are still in existence today. The first Irish national team played in 1855 against The Gentlemen of England in Dublin. In the 1850s, <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> Charles Lawrence was responsible for developing the game in Ireland through his coaching. In the 1850s and 1860s, Ireland was visited {{for the first time}} by touring professional teams. Ireland's first match against Marylebone Cricket Club (the M.C.C.) was in 1858.|$|E

5|$|Nigel was {{a married}} bishop, {{and his son}} Richard fitzNeal was later Lord Treasurer and Bishop of London. Another son was William, called William <b>the</b> <b>Englishman.</b> Richard, who wrote the Dialogus de Scaccario, or Dialogue {{concerning}} the Exchequer about the procedures of the Exchequer, had been taught those procedures by his father. Nigel's uncle Roger {{had at least one}} son, Roger, who was King Stephen's chancellor; Adelelm, who succeeded Nigel as treasurer after his first term, was probably Roger's son also. Another relative was William of Ely, who succeeded Richard fitzNeal as treasurer in 1196, although the exact relationship is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The first {{professional}} astronomer {{to support the}} concept of an infinite Universe was <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{reconcile}} some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case. To explain the degree of facial resemblance (which even Cockburn accepted) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family, Onslow suggested in <b>The</b> <b>Englishman</b> that Orton's mother was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Roger Tichborne's grandfather. An alternative story has Orton's mother seduced by James Tichborne, making Orton and Roger half-brothers. Other versions have Orton and Roger as companions in crime in Australia, with Orton killing Roger and assuming his identity. The Claimant's daughter by Mary Ann Bryant, Teresa Mary Agnes, maintained that her father confessed to her that he had killed Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years. There is no direct evidence for any of these theories. Teresa continued to proclaim her identity as a Tichborne daughter, and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family.|$|E

Graham reunites with his former lover, who is in an arranged marriage of mutual trust and respect. Reconciled, <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> dies of an existing heart condition. Evelyn and Douglas grow increasingly close, angering his wife, which results in an outburst from Douglas denouncing this marriage.

5|$|In the country's {{final game}} before the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, on 21 March Scotland played host to an English team that had already defeated Wales and Ireland. The Scots, with the wind behind them, opened the scoring in the first half with a try but England equalised just before half time. After the break, England got up a lead of 6–16 and the visitors seemed certain to win. Scotland responded and closed the gap to one point. The English were then playing with fourteen men after Cherry Pillman's leg was broken in a tackle, since substitutions at the time were not allowed. They managed to hold on, beating Scotland 15–16, thereby winning both the Triple Crown and the Calcutta Cup, as well as the Five Nations. It was England's last international test on British soil before the First World War: of the 30 players in the match, 11 went on to be killed in it, including <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> Arthur James Dingle, who died the same day as Wallace.|$|E

After reaching an elevation of , they turned back because they did not reach the summit before sundown. They reached the summit on their third attempt at 3:15 p.m. on October 9, 1829. Abovian dug a hole in the ice and erected a wooden cross facing north. Abovian picked up a chunk of ice from the summit and carried it down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On November 8, Parrot and Abovian climbed up Lesser Ararat. Years later, in 1845, the German mineralogist Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich climbed Ararat with Abovian. Abovian's third and last ascent of Ararat was with <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> Henry Danby Seymour in 1846.|$|E
5|$|The Adelaide leak was {{the revelation}} {{to the press}} of a dressing-room {{incident}} during the third Test, a cricket match played during the 1932–33 Ashes series between Australia and England, more {{commonly known as the}} Bodyline series. During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by the managers of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. He said {{he did not want to}} speak to <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter became public knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time, and the players were horrified that the confrontation became public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|With Keith Miller {{injured and}} playing purely as a batsman, Johnston took the new ball, {{sharing it with}} Lindwall. He was unable to take a wicket initially, but the English openers were uncomfortable when he and Lindwall were taking the new ball. Following the tea break, he {{returned}} with the second new ball after Compton and Yardley had put on an 87-run partnership to stabilise the middle-order. Johnston took Compton's outside edge and Miller completed the catch in slips. The left armer then claimed Evans, caught by a diving Miller after <b>the</b> <b>Englishman</b> had taken a swing of the bat wide outside off stump; this left the hosts at 7/145. Johnston ended with 2/43 from 22 overs as England were bowled for at 215 early on the third morning. After Australia declared at 7/460 on the fourth afternoon to leave the home side a target of 596, Johnston troubled the English openers with the new ball, but did not take a wicket.|$|E
