40|$|Traditional LED (light {{emitting}} diode) packaging always adopts hemisphere lens, and {{can ensure}} high light output efficiency, but its radiation pattern yields Lambert distribution and is non-uniformity. To enable LED light sources {{be applied in}} uniform illumination system, a method to obtain freeform LED lens based on energy equipartition and tangent iteration is proposed. Firstly, according to the Lambertian distribution of LED light intensity and its rotationally symmetric peculiarity, the LED emission angle is divided into N parts in Two-dimensional coordinate system, and the energy contained in each part is equal; Secondly, the <b>target</b> <b>plane</b> is divided into N equal areas along its radii, and the discrete points are corresponding to the N parts of emission angle. So that if the energy in each divided solid angle is controlled to illuminate the equal divided area, the illumination of each corresponding micro-belt on the <b>target</b> <b>plane</b> will be uniform; Finally, to avoid the total reflection of large emission angle rays, the designed lens will refract the rays with 0 ∼ 450 emission angle and reflect the rays with 450 ∼ 900 emission angle. Choosing an initial point on the freeform generatrix, and using Snell equation and tangent iteration method, the coordinates of all points on the freeform generatrix are obtained, which could be rotated into the freeform surface of the lens.

40|$|Background: Resection of bone tumors {{within the}} pelvis {{requires}} good cutting accuracy to achieve satisfactory safe margins. Manually controlled bone cutting {{can result in}} serious errors, especially due to the complex three-dimensional geometry, limited visibility, and restricted working space of the pelvic bone. This experimental study investigated cutting accuracy during navigated and non-navigated simulated bone tumor cutting in the pelvis. Methods: A periacetabular tumor resection was simulated using a pelvic bone model. Twenty-three operators (10 senior and 13 junior surgeons) were asked to perform the tumor cutting, initially according to a freehand procedure and later {{with the aid of}} a navigation system. Before cutting, each operator used preoperative planning software to define four <b>target</b> <b>planes</b> around the tumor with a 10 -mm desired safe margin. After cutting, the location and flatness of the cut planes were measured, as well as the achieved surgical margins and the time required for each cutting procedure. Results: The location of the cut planes with respect to the <b>target</b> <b>planes</b> was significantly improved by using the navigated cutting procedure, averaging 2. 8 [*]mm as compared to 11. 2 [*]mm for the freehand cutting procedure (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). There was no intralesional tumor cutting when using the navigation system. The maximum difference between the achieved margins and the 10 -mm desired safe margin was 6. 5 [*]mm with the navigated cutting process (compared to 13 [*]mm with the freehand cutting process). Conclusions: Cutting accuracy during simulated bone cuts of the pelvis can be significantly improved by using a freehand process assisted by a navigation system. When fully validated with complementary in vivo studies, the planning and navigation-guided technologies that have been developed for the present study may improve bone cutting accuracy during pelvic tumor resection by providing clinically acceptable margins...|$|R

The present study investigated accuracy of patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) for bone-cutting during simulated tumor surgery within the pelvis. A synthetic pelvic bone model was imaged using a CT-scanner. The set of images was reconstructed in 3 D and resection of a simulated periacetabular tumor was defined with four <b>target</b> <b>planes</b> (ischium, pubis, anterior ilium, and posterior ilium) with a 10 -mm desired safe margin. Patient-specific instruments for bone-cutting were designed and manufactured using rapid-prototyping technology. Twenty-four surgeons (10 senior and 14 junior) were asked to perform tumor resection. After cutting, ISO 1101 location and flatness parameters, achieved surgical margins and the time were measured. With PSI, the location accuracy of the cut planes {{with respect to the}} <b>target</b> <b>planes</b> averaged 1 and 1. 2  mm in the anterior and posterior ilium, 2  mm in the pubis and 3. 7  mm in the ischium (p <  0. 0001). Results in terms of the location of the cut planes and the achieved surgical margins did not reveal any significant difference between senior and junior surgeons (p =  0. 2214 and 0. 8449, respectively). The maximum differences between the achieved margins and the 10 -mm desired safe margin were found in the pubis (3. 1 and 5. 1  mm for senior and junior surgeons respectively). Of the 24 simulated resection, there was no intralesional tumor cutting. This study demonstrates that using PSI technology during simulated bone cuts of the pelvis can provide good cutting accuracy. Compared to a previous report on computer assistance for pelvic bone cutting, PSI technology clearly demonstrates an equivalent value-added for bone cutting accuracy than navigation technology. When in vivo validated, PSI technology may improve pelvic bone tumor surgery by providing clinically acceptable margins...|$|R
