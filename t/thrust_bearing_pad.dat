40|$|Tutorialpg. 223 - 242 The {{hydrodynamic}} {{thrust bearing}} load capacity-speed envelope {{is divided into}} three major regions by speed. Each region has its own set of limiting physical phenomenon that must be included in the analysis and presents a design challenge. For instance, the high speed region has high lubricant shear rates possibly including turbulence that change pad thermal crowning and local babbitt temperature and pressure, thus limiting the bearing performance in terms of load and speed. Various design tools are used to set the bearing geometry such that the phenomenon limits are not exceeded, and an appropriate design safety factor is present. Several applications are presented that illustrate how the various design modifications such as pivot type, pivot radial and circumferential offset, pad spacing, and pad thickness may be varied to design a thrust bearing for a specific region. Three dimensional finite element models for the fluid film generate film thickness, pressure and temperature distributions, which when coupled with a pad finite element model for thermal conduction, convection, thermal deflection, and elastic deflection show <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> performance. Turbulence is included along with hot oil carryover from the previous pad. Methods are shown that reduce vibratory motion by using the squeeze film damping attributes of double thrust bearings. The benefits of offset pivot, chrome copper pads, and controlled lubrication in a load-speed region are reviewed so that the user has an appreciation of how each feature is affecting his thrust bearing's performance. Of primary interest {{is an example of a}} high speed application where controlled lubrication increased machine efficiency by minimizing parasitic losses. Three dimensional maps of velocity, fluid mixing, temperature, and viscous heating in the pocket result in two dimensional temperature fields at the pad entrance. Accurate determination of the pad entrance temperature distribution allows for calculation of the pad maximum temperatures or bearing capacity. The examples and results presented will be of use to rotating equipment manufacturers and machinery users in applying thrust bearings to their machines...|$|E

The length to diameter ratio was 0. 75. One pad was mounted on a flexible diaphragm. The bearing supply pressure ranged from 0 to 690 kilonewtons per square meter (0 to 100 psig), and speeds ranged to 38, 500 rpm. Heavy mass pad tilting-pad assemblies produced three rotor-bearing resonances above the first two rotor critical speeds. Lower supply pressure eliminated the resonances. The resonances were oriented primarily in the direction normal to the diaphragm...|$|R
40|$|LectureThe {{residual}} {{axial thrust}} {{acting on the}} rotor of a centrifugal compressor {{is the result of}} the non-uniform pressure distribution on the surfaces in contact with the process gas, plus the differential pressure acting on the faces of the balance piston(s) and the contribution due to the momentum variation of the process gas. During the design phase the axial load shall be verified to remain safely lower than the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity, under all possible operating conditions; this requires a high degree of accuracy in the calculation model used to evaluate each thrust component. Errors in this calculation may lead to high <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> temperature during operation, to early wearing of the pad surfaces and ultimately to the damage or failure of the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> (Moll and Postill, 2011), thus jeopardizing the integrity of the whole compressor. The main difficulty of axial thrust calculation lies in the correct prediction of the static pressure distribution over the external surface of the impeller hub and shroud. This distribution depends on a large set of parameters, including rotor geometry, operating conditions, properties of the process gas, leakages flows across the rotor-stator seals. A detailed fluid-dynamic model of the gas in the cavities between impeller and diaphragm was developed and applied first to stage model tests and then to high-pressure centrifugal compressors, and its predictability was assessed by direct comparison with experimental data. The compressors were tested in full load conditions, with <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> equipped with load cells, and the thrust values were recorded for several points across the operating envelope...|$|R

40|$|For {{dynamical}} systems having several {{degrees of}} freedom, motion {{in one direction}} can induce motion in the other. This {{means that there is}} a certain coupling between these two motions. Coupling can in some cases be a source of instability that causes self-excited vibrations in rotating machinery. In classical modeling of rotor systems, couplings other than those that are the result of gyroscopic effect are normally not considered. This is due to thecomplexity of the reasons for coupling which mainly depends on machinery hardware, for example, the bearings’ design (type) and the asymmetry in machine components. Plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal-bearings provide high damping to the rotorsystem, but they also cross couple the rotor translational motions. Cross coupling is the main source of oil induced instability; therefore, the rotor speed should not exceed the speed at which oil-induced instability occurs. The inherent nonlinearity of plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal- bearings becomes strong for eccentricities greater than 60 % of the bearing clearance, where most existing linear models are not able to accurately predict the rotor trajectory. Strong nonlinearities together with cross coupling are the source of complex dynamics in fluid-film journal bearings. The journal bearing impedance descriptions method, a method that is valid for all bearing aspect ratios and all eccentricities, was used to evaluate linear analysis of the rotor steady-state imbalance response. The results show that linear bearing models derived from the nonlinear impedance descriptions of the Moes-cavitated (π-film) finite-length bearing can predict the steady-state imbalance response of a rigid symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical journal-bearings at high eccentricities. This is, however, only the case when operating conditions are below the threshold speed of instability and when the system has period one solutions. The error increases in the vicinity of resonance speed. A combi-bearing is a fluid-film lubricated tilting-pad <b>thrust</b> and journal <b>bearings</b> combined together. <b>Thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> is used in vertical rotating machinery and shafts designed to transmit thrust. The total axial load is carried by the single <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing.</b> The analyzed combi-bearing is an existing machine component used in the hydropower unit Porjus U 9 situated in northern Sweden. The linearized model shows that the combi-bearing couples the rotor’s lateral and angular motions. However, if the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing’s</b> <b>pads</b> arrangement is not symmetrical or if all the pads are not angularly equidistant the rotor axial and angular motions are also coupled. This last case of coupling will also occur if the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> equivalent total stiffness is not evenly distributed over the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing.</b> A defected <b>pad</b> or unequal hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the pads’ surfaces may be the cause. The Porjus U 9 ’s simulation results show that the combi-bearing influences the dynamic behavior of the machine.

40|$|Surface texture in {{the surface}} of the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> reduces the {{friction}} coefficient and wear rate of the matting surface. Significant improvement in load carrying capacity, wear resistance and friction coefficient of the tribiological mechanical component can be achieved by forming regular micro structure in form of micro dimple on the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> surface. In the present work numerical analysis is carried out to investigate the effect of spherical, cylindrical, elliptical, rectangular and square texture on the <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> hydrodynamic <b>bearing</b> and a comparison is done with the plain <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing.</b> The above texture profile was chosen in the view to easy fabrication of such texture using laser technology or etching process. These textured pads are tested on the various type of operating condition. The Reynolds equations are solved numerically by the finite difference method and an analysis is done on the effect of texture height, aspect ratio, and number of textures both in radial and circumferential directions on <b>thrust</b> <b>pad</b> <b>bearing.</b> It is observed that the load carrying capacity increases with increase of texture height ratio. This is because as texture height is increased it restricts the flow of lubricants which increases pressure and load carrying capacity. The analysis shows as aspect ratio is increased the roughness of surface is increased so pressure is increased, which result is increasing load carrying capacity. However with very larger value of aspect ratio the roughness of surface decreases, which decreases the load carrying capacity. Similar studies the done for behavior of coefficient of friction on variation of aspect ratio, texture height ratio etc. The author believes that such detail analysis on different texture profile on thrust pad hydrodynamic to study different tribological behavior under different condition will help researchers around the world...|$|R

40|$|The {{spiral groove}} <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> can be {{operated}} at the dynamic stable condition and furthermore {{can bring a}} large load capacity comparing with the other type of gas bearing such as the Rayleigh pad or the tilting pad types. Accordingly this type of gas bearing {{has been used as}} a practical one for a <b>thrust</b> gas <b>bearing</b> of rotary performance. Although the principle and its function have been studied much enough on their theoretical points, it is quite difficult at present to get the plentiful experimental data for practical design. In the spiral groove <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing,</b> when the <b>pad</b> which has the spiral groove on the surface rotates over the other surface, the air as lubricant can be introduced into the centre of the bearing along the centre line of the spiral groove (call it as pumping-in condition). Consequently the pressure can yield the load capacity to separate each surface, but if the depth of the groove is too much high to keep the air in it, the leakage of air will become larger and loose its load capacity. Thereupon the number of the grooves, a spiral angle, the depth of the groove and the bearing clearance are the main and important design factors to confine the ability.

40|$|LectureTilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in high power and/or high speed pump applications. Traditional white metallined {{also known as}} babbitted tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> are used for oil lubricated <b>bearings.</b> Babbitted tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearings</b> are not ideal for applications with low viscous lubricants, like waterbased fluids. For these applications, polymer bearings offer many advantages over traditional bearing materials including: Low friction coefficient, Higher flexibility, Wide range of operational temperature, High corrosion and chemical resistance, High shock and impact resistance, Tolerance against particle contamination, Electrical insulation. To achieve the desired improvement in performance, the material specifics of the polymer have to be carefully considered in the design process. One option available is a polymer lined tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> which combines the excellent tribological properties of polymers and the high structural stiffness of the steel back. But a polymer lined metal pad does not provide the same equalizing effect offered by the higher compressibility of a solid polymer pad. For example the problems of an edge carrier can be reduced for a tilting <b>pad</b> journal <b>bearing</b> and the self-equalizing mechanism can be avoided for a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> while considering the higher flexibility of solid PEEK pads. An additional advantage of a solid polymer pad is {{the elimination of the}} bonding between the polymer and the steel, so that a possible source of a bearing failure can be avoided upfront already. During a qualification test of a commercially available solid polymer tilting <b>pad</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing,</b> the high Hertzian contact stress at the pivot let to indentations in the polymer. After a few operating hours these indentations are clearly visible and will finally lead to a complete loss of the advantages of a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> over a fixed geometry bearing. This lecture describes the steps involved in the optimization of the solid polymer tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> design, with the objective to increase the reliability of the bearing assembly.

40|$|The {{principal}} task in {{this research}} project was to analyse the causes and consequences of coupled vibrations and parametric instability in hydropower rotors; where both horizontal and vertical machines are involved. Vibration is a well-known undesirable behavior of dynamical systems characterised by persistent periodic, quasi-periodic or chaotic motions. Vibrations generate noise and cause fatigue, which initiates cracks in mechanical structures. Motions coupling can in some cases augment the stability characteristics of a rotating machine, {{but it can also}} be a source of instability that causes self-excited vibrations. In this thesis, motions coupling due to a bearing’s design, gyroscopic effect and geometric misalignment in rotating components were studied. The performed studies include mathematical modelling and numerical simulation of the above named sources of motions coupling. Experiments were also performed in order to evaluate the derived analytical models. Plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal bearings cross couple the rotor translational motions. This cross coupling is the main source of oil induced instability. The inherent nonlinearity of plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal bearings becomes strong for eccentricities greater than 60 % of the bearing clearance, where most existing linear models are not able to predict accurately the rotor trajectory. Therefore, the journal bearing impedance descriptions method, a method that is valid for all bearing eccentricities and aspect ratios, was used to analyse the rotor steady-state imbalance response. Strong nonlinearities together with cross coupling are the source of complex dynamics in fluid-film journal bearings. The simulation results show that linear bearing models derived from the nonlinear impedance descriptions of the Moes-cavitated (π - film) finite-length bearing can predict the steady-state imbalance response of a rigid symmetric rotor that is supported by two identical journal bearings at high eccentricities. This is, however, only the case when operating conditions are below the threshold speed of instability and when the system has period one solutions. The speed at which oil induced instability occurs, also called the instability threshold speed, will depend upon the low stability characteristics of the less loaded bearing for an offset rigid rotor. However, for a flexible rotor the gyroscopic coupling effect will increase the instability threshold. The gyroscopic coupling effect not only increases the instability threshold, but the journal trajectories’ magnitude also significantly increases. This is normally not a preferable condition since high vibrations will induce heat and stress in babbited bearings. Adding rotor imbalance would enable the system to be operated beyond its threshold speed of instability with reduced vibration amplitudes. A tilting-pad combi-bearing is a bearing designed as a combination of both tilting-pad journal and <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>Thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> is a component used in vertical rotating machines and shafts designed to transmit thrust, e. g. hydropower rotors and aircraft engines. The total axial load is normally carried by one <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing.</b> In hydropower applications, the influence of the combi-bearing is strongly simplified in the rotor dynamic modelling. The derived linear model shows that the combi-bearing couples the rotor’s lateral and angular motions at the contact point between the combi-bearing and the rotor. However, if the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing’s</b> <b>pads</b> arrangement is not symmetrical or if all the pads are not angularly equidistant, the rotor vertical (axial) and angular motions are also coupled. This last case of coupling will also occur if the axial equivalent stiffness is not evenly distributed over the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing.</b> A defected <b>pad</b> or unequal hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the pads’ surfaces may be the cause. The Porjus U 9 ’s simulation results show that the combi-bearing influences the dynamic behavior of the machine. The rotor motions’ coupling due to combi-bearing changes the system’s natural frequencies and vibration modes. Introducing an angular misalignment in the combi-bearing’s rotating collar will generate an asymmetry in the rotor system at the combi-bearing’s location. The rotor system’s stiffness in its two translational directions differ at the combibearing’s location. Constant parameters and/or coefficients in rotating asymmetric structures appear to change with time when observed in the stationary frame. These time dependent parameters (coefficients) are the source of parametric instability in rotating systems. If the collar angular misalignment is located in one plane, all rotor motions in this plane at the contact point between the combi-bearing and the rotor will be coupled. A parametric instability is observed within certain ranges of the rotor speeds, depending on the magnitude of the angular misalignment. The studied cases of motions coupling due to plain cylindrical hydrodynamic journal bearings, motions coupling due gyroscopic effect, motions coupling due to tilting-pad combi-bearing and motions coupling due to manufacture or assembling errors in rotating components are cases that can be encountered in hydropower rotors. The results have revealed in particular that if the combi-bearing is manufactured or assembled with a certain angular misalignment, this may cause a parametric instability in the hydropower rotor. The parametric instability can even occur below the rotor critical speed, which would cause problems for undercritical machines as hydropower plants. The outcomes of these studies will contribute in further understanding of vibration problems and particularly in helping to improve and sustain the functionality of new and existing hydropower plants in Sweden.

Starting from the first, a small industrial steam turbine experienced a very strange behavior during megawatt load. When the unit was approaching the maximum allowed power, {{the temperature of the}} babbitt metal of the <b>pads</b> of the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> showed constant increase with an unrecoverable drift. Bearing inspection showed that pad trailing edge had the typical aspect of electrical pitting. This kind of damage was not reparable and <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> had to replaced. This problem occurred several times in sequence and was solved only by adding further ground brushes to the shaft-line. Failure analysis indicated electrodischarge machining as the root fault. A specific model, able to take into consideration the effect of electrical pitting and loading capacity decreasing {{as a consequence of the}} damage of the babbitt metal, is proposed in the paper and shows that the phenomenon causes the irretrievable failure of the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Analysis, design, {{and testing}} of two types of pivoted <b>pad</b> journal <b>bearings</b> and a spiral-grooved <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> {{suitable}} for direct installation into the NASA 2 to 15 KW Brayton Cycle Rotating Unit (BRU) have been accomplished. Both types of tilting <b>pad</b> <b>bearing</b> assemblies are of the preloaded type, consisting of three pads with one pad flexibly mounted. One type utilizes a non-conforming pivot, while the other replaces the conventional spherical pivot with a cruciform flexible member. The <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> is flexure mounted to accommodate static machine mislinement. Test results indicate that both types of journal bearings should satisfy the requirements imposed by the BRU. Hydrostatic tests of the spiral-grooved <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> showed it {{to be free of}} pneumatic hammer with as many as 24 orifices over the BRU pressure and load range...|$|R

Common designs are <b>Thrust</b> ball <b>bearings,</b> spherical roller <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings,</b> tapered roller <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> or cylindrical roller <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> Also non-rolling-element bearings such as hydrostatic or magnetic bearings see some use where particularly heavy loads or low friction is needed.|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{discharges}} {{in bearings}} may occur in shaft lines equipped with electrical machines. This effect, known as electrical pitting, {{consists of the}} removal of material from the pad surface; {{this can lead to}} <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> failure mainly because of overheating and reduced load capacity. The case history of a fault caused by electrical discharges that occurred in the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> of a turbine is described {{in the first part of}} the paper. This phenomenon is then simulated by means of a thermal elastohydrodynamic model of the bearing, considering the effect of electrical pitting on the surface of the pad. Finally, the results of the simulations allow the irreversible failure of the bearing caused by the electrical pitting to be shown...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 31 - 42 Analysis, design, and {{optimization}} of {{high performance}} journal and <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> {{in a high}} speed integrally geared compressor are described. The high speed and relatively small bearing size stretches the applicable limits of conventional style tilt <b>pad</b> <b>bearings.</b> The variation in the load magnitude, {{as is the case}} with most gear loaded bearings, requires careful analysis of the stability and unbalance response characteristics. An optimized new flexible pivot bearing was used in this application to provide stable operation throughout the wide ranges of load and inlet temperature. The bearing incorporated a directed lubrication feature to reduce the hot oil carry over which is known to be a major contributor to high bearing temperatures in high speed applications. The precision inherent in the manufacturing process used to produce this style of bearing allowed further optimization of the preload and pivot offset. The use of an offset pivot configuration demonstrated lower sensitivity to bearing clearance variation. The necessity for high rotational speeds in integrally geared compressors increases the frictional power losses in the journal and <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> The parasitic losses constitute a significant percentage of the overall bearing power losses. Bearing designs that were utilized to reduce both the frictional and parasitic losses in the <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> are discussed. The new <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> were designed to provide an optimum crown-to-film thickness ratio allowing the bearing to carry the design thrust load with fewer pads. The analytical results for the conventional and deflection journal and <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> are presented and compared to the test data. The new bearing resulted in lower steady state vibrations. At surge conditions, the synchronous and subsynchronous vibrations were about 25 percent of the conventional tilt <b>pad</b> <b>bearing.</b> The frictional and parasitic power losses with the new <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> were about 20 percent lower than those of the conventional bearings. The temperature rise was also lower which indicated that the inlet temperature can be further increased with the new bearing allowing a wider operating temperature range and lower frictional losses...|$|R
