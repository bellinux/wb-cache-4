5|$|Following {{the death}} of Emir Abu Hafs, Melitene renounced its Byzantine allegiance. After {{attempts}} to take the city by storm or subterfuge failed, the Byzantines established a ring of fortresses on the hills around the plain of Melitene, and methodically ravaged the area. By early 931, the inhabitants of Melitene were forced to come to terms: <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> tributary status and even undertook to provide a military contingent to campaign alongside the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|Over 100 auditions {{were held}} before the {{suitable}} baby {{was found to}} star in the film. Benny Chan chose Matthew Medvedev, a one-year-old infant of Chinese and Colombian descent. Medvedev, known as Baby Matthew, was literally recruited off the street when an assistant director spotted him with his parents on the MTR. Although his family was simply visiting Hong Kong, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> stay and let Matthew appear in Rob-B-Hood.|$|E
5|$|A less {{contentious}} standoff {{also occurred}} when settlers sent by William Penn sought to establish {{what is now}} Burlington, New Jersey. Andros insisted they {{had no right to}} settle there without the duke's permission, but agreed to allow their settlement after <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> receive commissions falling under the authority of the New York gubernatorial administration. This situation was permanently resolved in 1680 when York renounced in favor of Penn his remaining claims to West Jersey.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} the Khawarij met in Mecca and {{discussed}} the 659 Battle of Nahrawan, at which former supporters of Ali had rebelled against him for agreeing to discuss {{the leadership of the}} community with Muawiyah. <b>They</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> assassinate three of the leaders of Islam: ibn Muljam, a Jewish convert to Islam was to kill Ali, al-Hujjaj al-Tamimi was to kill Muawiya, and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi was to kill 'Amr ibn al-'As. The assassination attempts were to occur simultaneously as the three leaders came to lead morning prayer in their respective cities of Damascus, Fustat and Kufa. The method was {{to come out of the}} prayer ranks and strike the targets with a sword dipped in poison.|$|E
5|$|Around 376BC, Timanoridas of Corinth and Eukrates of Lefkada paid thirty minae to {{purchase}} Neaira from Nikarete, {{at the high}} end of prices for hetaerae. When the men married, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> let Neaira buy her freedom for twenty minae, which, with the aid of gifts and loans from her former customers, she did. As part of this deal, Neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in Corinth, and so left the city for Athens with Phrynion, who had helped her buy her freedom.|$|E
5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E

5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} February, Bothwell was {{generally}} believed to be guilty of Darnley's assassination. Lennox, Darnley's father, demanded that Bothwell be tried before the Estates of Parliament, to which Mary agreed, but Lennox's request for a delay to gather evidence was denied. In the absence of Lennox, and with no evidence presented, Bothwell was acquitted after a seven-hour trial on 12 April. A week later, Bothwell managed to convince {{more than two dozen}} lords and bishops to sign the Ainslie Tavern Bond, in which <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> support his aim to marry the queen.|$|E
5|$|Chikhachov {{instructed}} Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard {{to draft}} two proposals, one armed with 10-inch {{and the other}} with 12-inch guns. Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least 8,880 tons. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch caliber, which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. <b>They</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning toward accepting 12-inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexey resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller caliber.|$|E

5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it for the stage. When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> work with him. The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Hurcomb {{put forward}} at a ministerial meeting a {{solution}} whereby {{the members of}} the inquiry would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds they would have approved the scheme, but due to the opposition of Morrison, they had decided not to proceed to a decision. Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds, thus entitling them to compenstation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, and even if the scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage, they would have refused consent anyway.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Waterfall Gully {{was first}} {{explored}} by European {{settlers in the}} early-to-mid-19th century, and quickly became a popular location for tourists and picnickers. The government chose to retain control over portions of Waterfall Gully until 1884, when <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> place the land {{under the auspices of}} the City of Burnside. 28 years later the government took back the management of the southern part of Waterfall Gully, designating it as South Australia's first National Pleasure Resort. Today this area remains under State Government control, and in 1972 the Waterfall Gully Reserve, as it was then known, became part of the larger Cleland Conservation Park.|$|E

However, legislators from Springfield, Massachusetts blocked the legislation on the grounds the official book should be by Springfield native Dr. Seuss. Legislators reached a compromise when <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> make Dr. Seuss the official children's author of the commonwealth and Make Way for Ducklings the official children's book.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the Roman–Persian Wars {{continued}} until 561 when the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau {{agreed on a}} 50-year peace. By the mid-550s, Justinian had won victories in most theatres of operation, with the notable exception of the Balkans, which were subjected to repeated incursions from the Slavs and the Gepids. Tribes of Serbs and Croats were later resettled in the northwestern Balkans, {{during the reign of}} Heraclius. Justinian called Belisarius out of retirement and defeated the new Hunnish threat. The strengthening of the Danube fleet caused the Kutrigur Huns to withdraw and <b>they</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> a treaty that allowed safe passage back across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|Malick {{was upset}} that the studio {{screened}} his unfinished version for critics and Penn ended up helping {{him in the}} editing room, shaping the final version. Malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional minutes from the film. The director refused to subject his film to test screenings before delivering his final cut.
