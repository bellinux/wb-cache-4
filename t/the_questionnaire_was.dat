25|$|The {{first phase}} of the study was {{designed}} mainly by Christopher Gillberg and Peder Rasmussen. Initially, preschool teachers in all areas of Gothenburg were asked to answer a questionnaire with a series of yes and no questions to identify children that possibly had MBD. (<b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> based on an earlier pilot study.) The researchers used a purely operational (symptom-based) definition of MBD that had been devised especially for the study and was later termed DAMP.|$|E
25|$|The main {{interest}} of <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> {{to see if}} a participant answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49, confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E

However, a portion of respondents agreed to complete an online questionnaire asking many of the same questions asked live before. <b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> to be taken one to two months after the original interview.

2500|$|The Eysenck Impulsiveness Scale (EIS) is a 54-item yes/no {{questionnaire}} {{designed to}} measure impulsiveness.
