25|$|The {{stipulation}} {{in favor}} of Armenian autonomy in the treaty of Berlin produced an immediate change. Unfortunately there were special difficulties for {{the realization of the}} so-called Ottoman liberal political program that could end with what article stipulated. For one thing not all the Armenians were under the Ottoman Empire. As the population considered, there was Armenians in the Russian Empire approaching to 900,000 at the nineteenth century. Ottoman subjects amounting perhaps to 1,200,000, were distributed through the six vilayets of Sivas, Bitlis, Erzerum, Harput, Diabekir, and Van. In some of these districts, they had the highest ethnic minority, among the Turks, Greeks, Assyrians, Jews, and Kurds but Armenians failed to represent more than %50 percent, a clear majority, in any district with which they were associated. Besides other difficulties, Armenians perceived the conditions of treaty (Article LXI) of Berlin as an early realization of their autonomy, if the powers should have proceeded straightway to enforce the Armenian provision. The rationalization of humanitarian intervention depended also to the Cyprus Convention besides the Treaty of Berlin, 1878. In 1879, one year of after the agreements, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>missing</b> was the practical events to enable the articles for the demand of an Armenian state.|$|E

The Songs of Innocence tries to reflect child's innocence and ignorance of worldliness. They focus on childhood happiness and improvisation. Those who work in the field of literary translation are aware of those limitations and bounds which a translator may face with, (sociolinguistic matters, cultural bounds, discourse issues…) none of which will lead us toward rejecting the essence of translator and translation. As Robert Frost says: "in a literary translation <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> we <b>miss</b> is <b>the</b> poem itself" and even the best translators can not be aware of the exact philosophy of the poem, because it's just in the mind of poet and inaccessible to others.

So a sort of comparative, contrastive analysis between original English version and its Persian translation appeared.
