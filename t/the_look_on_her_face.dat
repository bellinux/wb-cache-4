2500|$|... "Alive" [...] {{has been}} {{revealed}} by Vedder {{to be part}} autobiographical and part fiction. When Vedder was a teenager, his mother revealed {{to him that the}} man he thought was his father was actually his stepfather, and that his biological father was dead. The first and last verses detail those actual events, but the second verse is storytelling on Vedder's part. The lyrics of the second verse read, [...] "Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room/She said I'm ready...for you/I can't remember anything to this very day/'Cept the look, the look.../Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare...," [...] and Vedder revealed that [...] "she" [...] was the mother, and [...] "the look" [...] referred to was not <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> but [...] "the look is between her legs. Where do you go with that? That's where you came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amanda Dobbins of New York {{magazine}} {{concluded that}} [...] "the secretly devastating video" [...] for [...] "Someone like You" [...] will remind Adele's ex-lover {{what he has}} done by leaving her. A writer of The Huffington Post praised the simplicity and the sadness in the video. Sarah Dean of the same publication called it an [...] "uncomplicated, moving film" [...] and wrote, [...] "the video is nothing more than Adele wandering around the deserted city of love alone, under its grey skies, singing her sorrowful notes, but because it's her, we don't need any more." [...] That was somehow echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine who said that the video was [...] "simply constructed as the song's vocal-and-piano arrangement." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin said that the scene in which Adele looks in the camera, [...] "speak for itself" [...] about the sadness in the video. Andrew Matson of The Seattle Times said, [...] "the song of the year now has a simple, perfect video: Adele in Paris, singing and strolling, apparently processing the breakup detailed in the song's lyrics. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> during the 'I wish nothing but the best for you' line is the best, just gutting, a real achievement how she plays it cold but not sarcastic. I think in times of emotional devastation, everyone wants stand on a bridge over the Seine on a cold day, squinting into the wind, sorting it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur is {{in a cell}} in {{the town}} prison, and Hook wants to know who Nimue is and what he’s hiding, but Arthur says that Emma took his {{memories}} so he doesn't know anything. David pries Hook away, saying that Arthur was right, he doesn't remember anything from the events in Camelot, and the now, Arthur was [...] "no longer important." [...] Hook says Emma told them this was about him, but Regina says that Emma is manipulating him, like all the Dark Ones do, and Regina and Mary Margaret are convinced that Emma has fully succumbed to the darkness. Hook believes Emma hasn't fully caved to the darkness yet, since she hasn't used the sword yet, but Regina thinks Emma still needs another ingredient for her spell. Hook is determined {{to find out what}} went on in Camelot, saying {{that the only way to}} help her is to find out what happened between him and Emma. Hook visits Gold at his shop, and Mr. Gold tells Belle to put down the crossbow, since Hook wasn't Emma. Mr. Gold says he had some squid ink set aside, but the new Dark One took it. Hook says that Dark Ones are clever, being able to convince everyone that they've really changed when they haven't, and then asks what’s going on inside Emma’s head. He tells Gold what Emma said about her actions being about him. Gold says he recognizes <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> – regret. He says he became the Dark One to save his son. He adds that he convinced himself everything he did was for that, and that once he saved his son, he would atone for his sins, but things did not work out. He tells Hook to find out what Emma is trying to atone for to get the answers. Hook says he can’t find her, and Gold says that he will have to give her a reason to find him. Hook goes outside and calls for Emma and asks what happened between them and what she wants.|$|E

6000|$|... "Terms! It'll {{always be}} the same. When he recovers--cards and betting, drink and...!" [...] She was silent, remembering <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> husband's face. <b>The</b> burnt child--the burnt child. Perhaps...! ...|$|R
6000|$|STRANGWAY. Never loved me? Never loved me? That {{night at}} Tregaron? [At <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face] You might {{have told me}} before you went away! Why keep me all these---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} lost it," [...] she replied. [...] "I cannot blame you--as I should," [...] she added, and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> mystified him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is my mother,' Peter explained; and Jane descended {{and stood}} by his side, with <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> that he liked to see on ladies when they gazed at him.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Francie. Her head drooped, {{but she had}} not taken her hand away, and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was not all embarrassment, {{but there was a}} rosy sunrise dawning on it.|$|E
60|$|COKESON. [On his dignity] He shouldn't {{have done}} that until he's sent for. [Then {{softening}} at <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face] We've got a vacancy, as it happens, but I can't promise anything.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BRENNAN (nudging Carmody {{with her}} elbow--in a harsh whisper). She don't see us. It's a dream she's {{in with her}} eyes open. Glory be, it's bad she's lookin'. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face'd frighten you. Speak to her, you! ...|$|R
50|$|For {{eighteen}} years, Fran Benedetto {{kept her}} secret. And hid her bruises. And stayed with Bobby {{because she wanted}} her son to have a father. And because, in spite of everything, she loved him. Then one night, when she saw <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> ten-year-old son's face, Fran finally made a choice and ran for both their lives...|$|R
60|$|He {{was just}} about to begin a third, when his mother entered the cottage almost breathlessly. From <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> it was plain to see she had {{something}} to tell that was of great importance.|$|E
6000|$|Bartley turned around, and saw <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> that {{he could}} not mistake. He rose and took her by the chin. [...] "Look here, Marsh!" [...] he said, [...] "didn't you promise me you'd stop that?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> such as he {{had never}} seen there before, such as she had always hidden from him, was full of secret resentments, and longings, and fears. Her eyes, under their {{twitching}} brows, stared painfully. And she was silent.|$|E
60|$|The old {{druggist}} {{glanced up}} at the girl under his spectacles, noted her patriotic attire and <b>the</b> eager <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> pretty face, and slowly shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>the</b> English <b>looked</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> and cried: [...] "She is a prophetess! We {{will surely}} do some great deed this day, or die around her feet like heroes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|And <b>the</b> Wind <b>looked</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{and knew}} her again, {{for he had}} seen her in the cottage and in the palace, and he spake to her and said: ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes and}} teeth and finger nails were yellow. Her chops hung low and shook when she moved. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was exactly that smileless look of fatal melancholy {{that you may}} have seen on the countenance of a hound left sitting on the {{doorstep}} of a deserted cabin.|$|E
60|$|Go in alone, John. I daren't, I'm {{afraid to}} look at her. I can't bear <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face....</b> I killed her--as surely as if I'd strangled her with my own hands. I've {{been looking at the}} door all night, and once I thought I heard a sound. I thought she was coming to reproach me for killing her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Adoration! There it was again! Hopeless! Incurable devotions {{to those}} who cared no more for her than for a slice of suet-pudding to be eaten hot, gulped down, forgotten, or loathed in the recollection. And there they are, these girls, one to almost every village of this country--a {{nightmare}} to us all. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was with me all that evening and in my dreams.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes, and clasped her hands, and looked as {{beautiful}} and true, I thought, as any Spirit. <b>The</b> Doctor <b>looked</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> henceforth, as steadfastly as she on him.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> little anxious <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face {{gave way}} to a bright smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you are all}} home safe," [...] {{she said}} gaily. [...] "I hope you feasted your eyes on your beloved Governor, boys. I can tell that Cecilia forgathered with Nan by <b>the</b> beatific <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face." ...|$|R
6000|$|She sang 'The Castle of Dromore' {{again that}} night with its queer {{haunting}} lilt. And when she had gone up, and he was smoking over the fire, the girl in her dark-red frock seemed to come, and sit opposite with her eyes fixed on his, {{just as she had}} been sitting while they talked. Dark red had suited her! Suited <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> when she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|He had {{not seen}} the widow since, for she had left the town at once; but he recollected her distinctly, a tall, dark woman with bright brown eyes, much younger than her husband, and only married to him {{eighteen}} months before he died. He remembered her slim figure standing by the grave, at that long-past funeral, and <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> which had puzzled him so terribly--a look of--a most peculiar look! ...|$|E
60|$|In {{some way}} {{she found herself}} {{a few moments later}} walking out through the iron gate into the throng of promenaders back of the seats. It was the most splendid moment of her life. She forgot her fear of Mason in the {{excitement}} of the moment. She walked with hands clenched tightly and head lifted. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and the burning color in her face made scores of people turn to look at her.|$|E
5000|$|Ure is a {{recovering}} alcoholic, something he openly admits and discusses {{in his autobiography}} If I Was. In an interview with The Guardian in 2012 Ure said: [...] "If my family hadn't supported me through my alcoholism, I don't know if I'd be here today." [...] He said that the turning point came {{when he was on}} a holiday and {{he went back to his}} car to get a bottle of alcohol.

60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>the</b> father <b>looked</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{steadily}} as she approached, {{and in that}} instant his determination was formed. A flight of steps at his feet led to the narrow doorway of a small temple, the nearest building to him.|$|R
6000|$|Noel {{fastened}} {{her great}} {{eyes on her}} cousin. [...] "We loved each other; and children are born, aren't they, after you've loved? But mine won't be!" [...] From <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> rather than from her words, the full reality of her meaning came to Leila, vanished, came again. Nonsense! But--what an awful thing, if true! That which had always seemed to her such an exaggerated occurrence in the common walks of life--why! now, it was a tragedy! Instinctively she raised herself and put her arms round the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{perhaps you}} haven't heard of Miss Olive comin' past on a bicycle," [...] old Jane remarked. [...] "I saw her comin', and I knew by <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{that it made}} her sick to see that woman sittin' here, and I don't blame her a bit.

6000|$|... "Tell Grizel"! They {{were among}} the first words of many mothers. None, they were aware, would receive the news with quite such glee as she. They might think her cold and {{reserved}} with themselves, but to see <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> as she bent over a baby, and to know that the baby was yours! What a way she had with them! She always welcomed them as if in coming they had performed a great feat. That is what babies are agape for from the beginning. Had they been able to speak they would have said [...] "Tell Grizel" [...] themselves.|$|E
50|$|Claire Clairmont {{lived with}} Mrs Mason in <b>the</b> 1830s, <b>looking</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> as a mother, and {{considering}} {{that time the}} happiest in her life.

60|$|Richard {{told her}} that she might come in, and, as she slowly advanced, she thought she had never seen {{anything}} so ineffably mournful as <b>the</b> affectionate <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> father's face.
