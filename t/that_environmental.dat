5|$|In 1981, Kenneth Clarke, {{then the}} Secretary of State for Transport, stated that, since {{the route of}} the M3 was then fixed as far as Bar End, to the north of St. Catherine's Hill, that its route from there to Compton would undergo a fresh study, {{specifically}} stating that the Winchester Bypass should continue to be operational during construction of any new road, and <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> matters were a key concern. By February 1983, consulting engineers Mott Hay and Anderson had submitted a recommendation to complete the M3 through Twyford Down. Following the completion of the motorway to Bar End in the summer of 1985, the junction at Hockley was the only set of traffic lights between London and Southampton.|$|E
5|$|On February23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{an area of}} convection in the Mozambique Channel.

Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, noting <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions favored development, including weak wind shear. The system developed organized convection in a circular pattern, and on February26, the MF and JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 13 and Tropical Cyclone 19S, respectively. With a mid-level ridge to the south, the depression moved generally westward, and after intensifying further, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Japhet by the Direction de la Météorologie et de l'Hydrologie of Madagascar late on February26.|$|E

5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Scientists once {{believed}} that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology, including {{the size of the}} mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion, which had the thickest, most extensive manes amongst wild lions. Research results indicate <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> factors such as average ambient temperature influence the colour and size of a lion's mane. The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies. The males of the Asiatic subspecies, however, are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions.|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression originated from a tropical wave off {{the southern coast}} of Mexico in late May2006. An area of convection {{was associated with the}} wave, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions favored gradual development. The system, which was enhanced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), drifted northward with an anticyclone to its east and west. On June1, the convection became more concentrated, and by early the next day it developed a low pressure area; by that time, it began a steady northwestward track.|$|E
5|$|On June18, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coastline of Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic. Tracking steadily westward, it maintained a small but organized area of convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—along its axis {{for the next several}} days. The wave crossed the Lesser Antilles on June24 and Central America on June29, emerging into the eastern Pacific shortly thereafter. During the evening of July1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system, noting <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions were expected to become favorable for slow development. The wave interacted with a larger area of low pressure on July2, leading to an increase in convective coverage and the formation of a broad low-pressure area. Continuing slowly westward, the system acquired enough organization to be declared {{a tropical}} depression at 1200UTC on July4, while centered 205mi (330km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Despite the initially exposed center of circulation, a byproduct of moderate wind shear, the depression soon began to organize as convective banding increased and gained more curvature. This led to the classification of Tropical Storm Erick at 0000UTC on July5.|$|E
5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Government of India's Environment Impact Assessment Notification of 1994 was made in 2004, which required <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> clearance be granted to any parcel of land that falls under the Yamuna floodplain before beginning any construction activities. Since Akshardham commenced construction activities in 2000, prior to the enactment of this amendment, it {{did not apply to}} Akshardham. However certain NGOs and activists felt that the temple was constructed without obtaining the necessary environmental clearances. On January 2005, the U.P. Employees Federation presented their case before the Supreme Court of India that the temple had not obtained necessary environmental clearances {{and that it would be}} harmful to the environment. After hearing the case, the Supreme Court observed that in the construction of Akshardham, all the Land Use Plans had been adhered to and clearance of expert bodies like the Central Water Commission and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute has been obtained. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the Akshardham construction was lawful and did not violate environmental norms. Despite this ruling, some activists and politicians continued to assert that the Akshardham construction was illegal and posed a threat to the Yamuna River floodplains. In a 2009 ruling on a related issue, the Supreme Court further clarified that it rejected as false the assertions that Akshardham did not have environmental permissions and was harmful to the Yamuna riverbed. It reiterated its earlier 2005 Ruling that Akshardham had received all necessary environmental permissions from Central Water Commission and NEERI, which is an autonomous body, and that the Akshardham site was not located on the Yamuna “riverbed” or “floodplain”, but 1700 meters away from the Yamuna River bank.|$|E

5|$|As most meat ant colonies {{rarely have}} a second queen, polydomy is not always {{associated}} with polygyny, although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to {{the high level of}} relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate with the level of aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> cues {{play a vital role in}} nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there has}} been {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether the}} European species known as Battarrea stevenii is a unique species or merely a polymorphic variant of B.phalloides. The taxon has been described as both a variety (as B.phalloides var. stevenii by Cleland and Cheel in 1916) and as a form (as B.phalloides f. stevenii by Calonge in 2004). In 1995, mycologist Roy Watling opined that B.stevenii differs in having spores that are colored more orange-tawny, slightly larger (5–6.5 by 5.75–7µm, as opposed to 4.5–5.25 by 4.5–5.75µm), and less ornamented. Further, B.stevenii is thought to have a larger fruit body size, a more coarsely scaly stipe, and lack of mucilage in the volva and the innermost parts of the stem. The presence or absence of mucilage has been traditionally considered the significant characteristic separating the species. In 1904, Lászlo Hollós proposed the idea of a single polymorphic species; in 1942, Paul Marshall Rea, after studying 25 specimens from southern California, concluded that B.stevenii was conspecific with B.phalloides and represented a single species. An analysis of a number of European specimens—using both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in addition to molecular analysis of ITS regions of the 5.8S rDNA—also suggested both to be conspecific. The authors of this study considered the differences in spore ornamentation and stipe hyphae to be insufficient to discriminate them as two species; they did, however, note that their inability to locate the type material for both species limited the conclusiveness of their suggestion. The conspecificity of the species was supported in a later study that used traditional and molecular methods to compare field-collected English specimens and an extensive range of herbarium material collected from around the world. They found that material labeled B.stevenii generally had a greater range of cap and stem sizes, while that labeled B.phalloides was generally more consistent, and smaller. However, the B.phalloides material they studied was generally from similar habitats in the UK, while the B.stevenii material originated {{from a wide variety of}} locales and habitats, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>environmental</b> factors influence fruit body morphology. Evidence pointing to conspecificity included the continuum of spore sizes between the two, and the lack of any significant differences between their DNA. In 2006, however, based on a study of specimens collected in China, other scientists considered them to be independent species.|$|E
