5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a {{revised version of}} an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E
5|$|While {{the saga}} records that Frakökk was killed to avenge {{the burning of}} Óláfr, {{recently}} scholars Angelo Forte, Richard Oram, and Frederick Pedersen, stated that her fate was actually sealed by her support of Erlendr Haraldsson's bid for the earldom, over the claim of Haraldr Maddaðarson. Haraldr {{was the son of}} Earl Maddaðr, and Margrét Hákonardóttir (married in about 1134). Margrét was a niece of Frakökk, and Earl Maddaðr was possibly a cousin of the David I. The union between Earl Maddaðr and Margrét benefited the Scottish Crown by increasing Scottish influence in the north at the expense of Norwegian influence. Also, in the 1120s and 1130s, David I had faced challenges to his authority. A large part of the support for these challengers came from Moray and Ross—these lands were directly between the northern lands of Caithness and Orkney, and David's strength to the south. According to the Forte, Oram, and Pedersen, the prospect of having the son of one of his northern supporters as the earl of Caithness was <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the king to pass up—especially since Haraldr was still a minor, and would thus be under the direction of an appointed tutor. As it turned out, the installation of Haraldr as an earl of Orkney and Caithness was a triumph for the Scottish Crown: in the 1140s, Sutherland and Caithness were further integrated into the kingdom, and the Norwegian influence in Orkney was neutralised.|$|E

25|$|Slovakia {{who were}} group favourites took on GB {{in the final}} game. Slovakia just were <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Team GB, who despite getting a goal back in the 3rd, went down to a 4–1 defeat and {{finished}} second in their group {{for the third consecutive}} year.|$|E
25|$|Despite no player {{reaching}} fifty, East Africa's 261/8 {{was always}} {{likely to be}} <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Argentina, and so it proved as the South Americans were dismissed 84 runs short for 177, A Kumar claiming 6-26. The other match on this day saw Malaysia bowled out for 89 by Zimbabwe (Brandes 4-13, Rawson 4-22) who reached their target with little drama {{for the loss of}} just two wickets.|$|E
25|$|In the European Championships in Helsinki, Perković's main rival was Nadine Müller of Germany, the 2011 World Championships silver {{medalist}} and the 2012 world leading discus thrower with 68.89 m. After successfully qualifying, Perković {{found herself in}} serious trouble in the final after posting two no-throws. Under pressure, she threw 67.62 m in the third round, which ultimately proved <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Müller {{and the rest of}} the field, and gave Perković her second European title.|$|E

25|$|His {{effort was}} {{backed up by}} Hemu Adhikari's first half-century of the series, 51. Adhikari lent Hazare {{valuable}} support and the two batsmen added 132 runs, but the end came soon enough when the Indian tailenders succumbed to Lindwall's pace, as the last three wickets fell for six runs. Australia inflicted another innings defeat to seal a well-deserved series win, but Hazare emerged with his head held high due to his personal triumph. However, the Australian team was <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the Indians.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the team won their next Leinster title in 1978, the great team of the early 1970s was {{breaking}} up. Kilkenny played Cork in that year’s All-Ireland final. However, the Munster champions were <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> an ageing Kilkenny side and duly captured their third championship in-a-row. 1979 saw an injection of new blood into the team as Kilkenny won their seventh provincial title of the decade. The side later took on and defeated Galway {{in one of the}} least memorable finals of the decade.|$|E
25|$|The other quarter-final {{followed}} after with Nicole Vaidišová beating compatriot Lucie Šafářová 6–1, 6–4 to {{make her}} second major semi-final after the 2006 French Open. Vaidišová completely overpowered her fellow Czech in the first set, needing just thirty minutes to take it and compiling a 14–4 winner to unforced error ratio. Although Šafářová gave more of a battle in the second set, Vaidišová was still <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> her and managed to close out the one hour eleven-minute match with ease. In the semi-finals she will face Serena Williams, the first meeting between the pair.|$|E

25|$|In early February, Sunline {{recorded}} her eighth win in New Zealand {{when she}} was <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> seven other Group One winners in the Waikato Sprint. The victory kept alive Sunline's wonderful record in her home country, which at career end would stand at 10 wins from as many starts. Sunline's next step came with a hit-and-run trip to Sydney for the Apollo Stakes, at Warwick Farm. For {{the second year in}} a row, the race was run on a rain-affected track, and Sunline accounted for the veteran mudlark Celestial Choir, with Tie the Knot unplaced.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1878, the {{official}} formation of Northants CCC {{took place at}} a meeting in the George Hotel, Kettering based on an existing organisation that dated back to 1820. The 1820 date, if it could be verified, would make Northants the oldest club in the present-day County Championship. The club came to prominence in the Minor Counties Championship during the 1890s as, between 1900 and 1904, the bowling of George Thompson and William East was much <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> almost all batsmen at that level. The county applied for first-class status in 1904 and was promoted the following year when it joined the County Championship. They played its inaugural first-class match versus Hampshire CCC at Southampton on 18, 19 & 20 May 1905 when making its County Championship debut.|$|E
25|$|Rex Alston was a pupil at Trent College, Derbyshire, {{before going}} on to study at Clare College, Cambridge. A {{considerable}} sportsman in his own right, he obtained a Cambridge Blue for athletics in 1923, captained Bedfordshire County Cricket Club in 1932, and played on the wing for Bedford and Rosslyn Park rugby clubs. He was a schoolmaster at Bedford School from 1924 to 1941, before joining the BBC. He was originally a billeting officer, but it was soon realised that his voice - a clear, light baritone - was <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> him to remain in an administrative role. He remained on the BBC staff until 1961, and continued broadcasting {{for a few years}} after that as a free-lance. He wrote on cricket and rugby for the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, continuing to report on county cricket for the former until 1987. He also had a column in Playfair Cricket Monthly.|$|E

25|$|Football League runners-up {{and twice}} champions Preston North End sent an under-strength eleven for a {{friendly}} meeting with Small Heath. The team was further weakened when their trainer {{had to play}} in place of Bob Roberts, who failed to turn up, {{but they were still}} <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> their hosts. Aston Villa did much of the attacking in the semi-final of the Birmingham Charity Cup but Charsley and his defenders were up to their task, and Small Heath progressed to the final by two goals to nil. In the final, at Aston Lower Grounds, Hallam scored with a header after only five minutes, and failed to take a good chance when Wolverhampton Wanderers' goalkeeper lost his grip on the ball, but at the interval the score was 1–1. In the second half, with both sun and wind in their favour, Heath struck the woodwork several times, but the only goal came when an error from their backs allowed Harry Wood a free run.|$|E
25|$|After winning The Ashes the MCC went {{to their}} final Country match in a jovial mood. Only three regular bowlers were taken, Alec Bedser, Peter Loader and Johnny Wardle, both wicket-keepers and the manager Geoffrey Howard. The Country XI won the toss, batted and were out for 182 with one W. Young making 52 as Loader (4/29) and Wardle (5/46) were far <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> {{the bulk of the}} local batsmen. Len Hutton (75) and Reg Simpson (59) were 130/0 {{at the end of the}} day and Tom Graveney made 50 in the morning and Hutton was {{impressed}} with Rex Hollioake (2/69), the fast bowler from Ballarat, who he thought was quicker than any Australian outside the Tests. Vic Wilson, Godfrey Evans and Wardle all made 17, and Hutton declared with Howard unbeaten on 0 at 307/8. The Country team were completely unable to read Johnny Wardle's highly varied off-breaks, leg-breaks and reverse-googlies and he finished with 7/45 (12/91 in the match), though R. Milne came in a number 4 and finished 22 not out in a score of 99. The MCC won by an innings and 26 runs.|$|E
25|$|Clare becomes {{interested}} in Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) {{when he gets}} a lucrative property development job. They grow closer to him and she attempts to seduce him but he rebuffs her advances, due to recently separating from his wife, Stacey (Lacey Turner), but relents when Clare dresses up as Princess Leia to impress him. He propositions her but Clare refuses {{to have sex with}} him, breaking down and telling him about an affair she had with an aggressive, married man named Arnold. Arnold traces Clare to Walford, wanting to rekindle their affair but Clare only wanted Arnold to buy her expensive gifts and when he stopped, she fled. Clare knows that Arnold had bought his wife expensive jewellery and persuades Bradley to help her steal it by claiming that it belongs to her. Believing Arnold is a bully, Bradley agrees. The robbery goes off without a hitch, but Arnold sees Clare leaving and returns to Walford to confront her. Clare admits that she never loved Arnold and was only using him for his money. When he threatens to call the police, Clare threatens to ruin his marriage and Bradley throws him out after Clare lies that he was verbally abusing her. Satisfied with her pay off, Clare realises that Bradley is <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> her and tells him this, refusing to start a relationship, but is jealous, however, when Bradley reconciles with Stacey.|$|E

25|$|With The Clash of the Nations tournament over, the Celtic {{nations were}} to play each other once over October and November {{in a new}} competition. The matches were to {{coincide}} with the Great Britain versus Australia matches, in which Great Britain ended up being badly beaten. Dale Laughton was the only Scotman in the Great Britain team and so the Bravehearts didn't suffer from withdrawals as much as Ireland and Wales did. It is generally regarded that the Rugby Football League made the same mistakes as the 1998 tournament with matches being held on Friday nights and competing against both the football and rugby union seasons and consequently attendances were very low for the matches. The first of Scotland's matches was against Wales in which many of the best Welsh players were with Great Britain. Scotland took the lead through Danny Arnold but The Dragons quickly made the game level. Captain Danny Russell went over for Scotland's second try, but once again Wales hit back within minutes. Andrew Lambert scored just before half-time for The Bravehearts but the lead did not last long after the break with Wales scoring. However, the Welsh were unable to reply to the next four tries, with Mike Wainwright and Matt Crowther each getting themselves onto the scoreboard and both Lambert and Arnold getting their second tries. A win or a draw would seal Scotland's place {{at the top of the}} table but Ireland mixture of Super League and local players were <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Scotland. They raced into a 1ten point lead before Russell and Arnold, with Crowther converting one, allowed Scotland to claw their way back into the match. In the final quarter the Bravehearts fell apart, leaking in 21 points to lose the match.|$|E
25|$|Hoad started 1953 {{poorly in}} the singles {{with a second}} round exit against Clive Wilderspin at the Australian Championships in Melbourne after playing an uncharacteristic {{baseline}} game. He was more successful in doubles when he and Rosewall became the youngest team to win the Australian doubles title after {{a victory in the}} final against Mervyn Rose and Don Candy. In March he successfully defended his singles title Australian Hardcourt Championships, defeating 34-year-old John Bromwich in the final. In the semifinal he had survived six matchpoints against Rosewall. Two weeks later Hoad lost the final of the N.S.W. Hardcourt Championships against Mervyn Rose. Hoad's second overseas tour started in late April and after an exhibition in Cairo at the Gezira Sporting Club he entered the Italian Championships in Rome. He reached the final, losing to Drobný in straight sets but won the doubles title with Rosewall. At the 1953 French Championships in May Hoad was seeded fourth and made it to the quarterfinal which he lost to Vic Seixas due to overhitting and an unreliable serve. Hoad and Rosewall followed up their Australian title with a win at the French Championships after a convincing three-set win in the final against countrymen Rose and Wilderspin. In June Hoad's attacking serve-and-volley game proved <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Wimbledon favorite Rosewall in the final of the Queen's Club Championship and he won the tournament without losing a set. At Wimbledon Hoad was seeded sixth and as at the French Vic Seixas defeated him in the quarterfinal, this time in a close five-set match that ended 7–9 in the final set on a Hoad double fault. In an all-Australian doubles final Hoad and Rosewall defeated Hartwig and Rose to win their Grand Slam doubles title of the year. Hoad lost to Enrique Morea in the final of the Dutch Championships in mid July. Hoad won his first title on U.S. soil in South Orange at the Eastern Grass Court Championships in mid August, defeating compatriot Rex Hartwig in the final. In the semifinal against Rosewall he pulled a back muscle, the first sign of the back problems that would later plague his career. Hoad and Rosewall's hopes of winning the doubles Grand Slam, two years after fellow Australians Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgman had first achieved that feat, were dashed when they lost surprisingly in the third round of the U.S. Doubles Championships.|$|E
