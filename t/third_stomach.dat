40|$|Background This {{study was}} {{performed}} to estimate the incidence of gastric cancer by tumour location and to clarify whether the relative and absolute rates of gastric cancer in Japan changed between 1975 and 1989. Methods The stomach was anatomically divided into the upper, middle, and lower thirds. Age- and sex-specific incidences by tumour location were estimated by multiplying the age- and sex-specific national incidences of gastric cancer by the corresponding proportions of tumour location. We studied 171 721 cases of gastric cancer from the Gastric Cancer Registry of Japan. Results Over 15 years, the proportion of tumours in the upper <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> increased in men but did not change much in women. The proportion of tumours in the middle <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> increased among {{both men and women}} while the proportion of tumours in the lower <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> decreased among both men and women. The incidence of tumours in the upper <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> showed an increasing trend among elderly men and women but not among young ones. The incidence of tumours in the lower <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> decreased significantly among men and women of most age groups. Conclusions The present study added evidence of disparate trends in the incidence of gastric cancer by tumour location. The separate epidemiological features may indicate different aetiologies as well as changes in the degree of influence of these aetiologies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In resectable gastric cancer, choice {{regarding}} {{the extent of}} resection depends on tumor size, location, and distance from resection margin. However, there remains controversy for choice of resection for tumors in the middle <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach.</b> This study investigated patients who underwent gastrectomy in order to analyze the differences between total gastrectomy (TG) and subtotal gastrectomy (STG). Materials and Methods: From 2000 to 2006, 125 patients with a tumor in the middle <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> underwent radical gastric resection at EUMC. We retrospectively conducted comparative analysis for the differences in clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis between TG and STG. Results: The average tumor size was 6. 7 cm for TG, and 4. 1 cm for STG. The number of metastatic lymph nodes were 13. 3 for TG, and 3. 7 for STG. Patients with more advanced cancer {{were more likely to}} receive TG. The 5 -year survival rate for TG was lower (38. 1 %) than STG (69. 0 %). However, if tumor stages were stratified, {{there was no significant difference}} in the survival rate. Histologically, for the undifferentiated type of cancer (Stage 1, 2), the 5 -year survival rate of STG was higher (88. 1 %) than TG (75. 0 %). Conclusions: Comparing patients with tumors in the middle <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> who underwent TG and STG, there was no statistically significant difference in the 5 -year survival rate. If stages were stratified, the clinicopathological characteristic becomes a key factor in deciding the prognosis, rather than the choice of resection.

40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} impact of tumor size on {{outcomes}} in patients with advanced gastric cancer in the lower <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach.</b> METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of 430 patients with advanced gastric cancer in the lower <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> who underwent distal subtotal gastrectomy and D 2 lymphadenectomy in our hospital from January 1998 to June 2004. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve {{analysis was used to}} determine the appropriate cutoff value for tumor size, which was measured as maximum tumor diameter. Based on this cutoff value, patients were divided into two groups: those with large-sized tumors (LSTs) and those with small-sized tumors (SSTs). The correlations between other clinicopathologic factors and tumor size were investigated, and the 5 -year overall survival (OS) rate was compared between the two groups. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox&#x 2019;s proportional hazard model analysis. The 5 -year OS rates in the two groups were compared according to pT stage and pN stage. RESULTS: The 5 -year OS rate in the 430 patients with advanced gastric cancer in the lower <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> was 53. 7 %. The mean 1; SD tumor size was 4. 9 1; 1. 9 cm, and the median tumor size was 5. 0 cm. ROC analysis indicated that the sensitivity and specificity results for the appropriate tumor size cutoff value of 4. 8 cm were 80. 0 % and 68. 2 %, respectively (AUC = 0. 795, 95 %CI: 0. 751 - 0. 839, P = 0. 000). Using this cutoff value, 222 patients (51. 6 %) had LSTs (tumor size &#x 2265; 4. 8 cm) and 208 (48. 4 %) had SSTs (tumor size 0. 05).

40|$|Between 1977 and 1989, 958 {{patients}} were admitted for gastric carcinoma to the Second Department of Surgery, University of Siena, Italy. Of these, 142 (15 %) had early gastric cancer. The diagnosis {{of this form}} of cancer has increased from 7 % in 1977 to 22 % in 1989. Following {{a detailed analysis of}} the clinical data and diagnostic techniques, it can be concluded that endoscopy is a far better method for diagnosis than x-ray. The data presented in the present paper strongly support this conclusion. Tumors were classified according to the Japanese Research Society Committee on Histological Classification of Gastric Cancer. The five-year survival rate which we have obtained is 89 %, slightly lower than that of Japanese authors, but higher than that reported by other western authors. Lesions confined to the mucosa were observed in 75 patients (52. 8 %) while those involving the submucosa were observed in 67 patients (47. 2 %), with survival rates of 94 and 85 %, respectively. Lymph node involvement was present in 14 cases (9. 8 %), with primary lymph nodes (N 1) in 11 cases (7. 7 %) and secondary lymph nodes (N 2) in three (2. 1 %). The five-year survival rates, with respect to lymph node involvement, was 57 % in the presence of lymph node metastases and 93 % in their absence (P < 0. 001).

Basic {{biological}} {{information for}} a sublittoral {{population of the}} rock goby Gobius paganellus Linnaeus, 1758 is presented based on a 2 -year study involving 1680 specimens. The length-weight relationship was given by TW = 0. 0089 * TL^ 3, 163 (where TW= total weight in g; TL= total length in mm). Age at length data were inferred by modal analysis of the monthly length-frequency distributions. The parameters of the fitted Von Bertalanffy growth equation (with seasonal component, birth date on the 1 st of January) were L 1 = 13. 8 cm; K = 0. 73 yr^- 1; to = - 0. 22 yr; C = 0. 95; W = 0. 07.

Methods A total of 289 patients in pT 1 - 2 stage with 1 - 3 positive nodes confined to same compartment were included in this study with informed consents. The primary lesion was solitary (≤ 5. 0 cm in diameter) and D 2 or D 3 lymph node dissection had been performed. The location of metastatic lymph nodes was analyzed retrospectively. Results Most positive nodes occurred in N 1 compartment, with frequency of 79. 6 % to 85. 7 % based on site of tumor. In the lower <b>third</b> of <b>stomach,</b> no. 6 was the most common metastatic site and no. 3 was the second; the order was reversed for SLM. With increasing depth of tumor invasion, a progressively augmented nodal involvement was shown. Nearly a half appeared transverse metastasis when the tumor located at the lesser or greater curvature. Among skip metastasis, no. 7, 8 a, 9 and 11 p were the most common metastatic sites and the prognosis was as similar as that of patients with N 1 involved only. Conclusions The 1 - 3 positive nodes in the same compartment should be possible SNs, and most of which are restricted in N 1 in pT 1 - 2 gastric cancer. Transversal and 2 stations lymph node metastasis are common. </p...|$|R
40|$|With the {{implementation}} of a small-caliber panendoscope which was made according to our suggestion, we gradually replaced the conventional barium meal as the first line of the upper gastrointestinal tract examination by pan-endoscopy after 1976. The efficacy of panendoscopy for the early detection of gastric cancer in our 8 -yr experience was investigated. In 910 matched pairs of patients subjected to "screening " fluoroscopy or panendoscopy two and six cases of early gastric cancer were detected respec-tively. Panendoscopy was superior to fluoroscopy in its sensitivity for detection of gastric cancer (86. 4 % vs. 80. 0 %), in its specificity (99. 5 % vs. 97. 0 %) and in its low false-positive rate (17. 4 % vs. 69. 2 %). After 1976, the detection of early gastric cancer increased year by year. The frequency of early gastric cancer detected by panendoscopy was about three times that of early gastric cancer detected by fluoroscopy (61. 5 % vs. 21. 7 % of all cancer). Early cancer located in the proximal <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> an...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{dissection}} of splenic hilar {{lymph nodes}} in gastric cancer surgery is indispensable for treating gastric cancers {{located in the}} proximal <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach.</b> Splenic vascular injury {{is a matter of}} debate resulting on time or delayed splenectomy. We aimed to share our experience and plausible mechanisms causing this complication in two case reports. Case presentations: Two male patients with gastric cancer were diagnosed with acute splenic infarction following gastric surgery in the early postoperative period. Both underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy. Splenectomy was performed due to splenic infarction. Discussion: Because we observed this rare complication in recent patients whose surgery was performed using vessel-sealing device for splenic hilar dissection, we suggested that extensive mobilization of the surrounding tissues of splenic vascular structures hilum using the vessel sealer could be the reason. Conclusion: In case of acute abdominal pain radiating to left shoulder, splenic complications should be taken into consideration in gastric cancer patients performed radical gastrectomy. Meticulous dissection of splenic hilar lymph nodes should be carried out to avoid any splenic vascular injury...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous {{occurrence}} of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and gastric {{cancer in the}} same patient {{has not yet been}} reported in the English literature. MCL comprises 2. 5 - 7 % of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and is characterized by a poor prognosis with a median survival probability of 3 - 4 years in most series. A 62 -year-old man was referred to our hospital for evaluation of an abnormal gastric lesion. The endoscopic finding was compatible with type IIc early gastric cancer (EGC) in the middle <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach,</b> and a biopsy of the lesion proved to be carcinoma. Radical total gastrectomy with splenectomy and Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy were performed. The resected specimen revealed two grossly separated lesions. Postoperative histological examination reported both adenocarcinoma and MCL. Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for CD 5, CD 20, and cyclin D 1 in the infiltrated lymphoid cells. MCL is an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the current treatment approach is still unsatisfactory. Further advancements in the understanding of the synchronous {{occurrence of}} both diseases, and more efforts on investigations of treatment are needed...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To assess {{risk factors}} for {{bleeding}} after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and to develop preventive measures. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in a tertiary referral center. A total of 328 patients underwent ESD for 398 gastric neoplasms between July 2007 and June 2009. The main outcome was association between post-ESD bleeding and the following: age; sex; comorbidities; daily use of medicine potentially related to gastric injury/bleeding; location, size, and histological depth of lesions; ulceration; experience of operator coagulating the ulcer floor, and duration of operation. We also determined {{the relationship between the}} location of post-ESD bleeding and {{risk factors for}} hemorrhage. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed significant risk factors: tumor location [odds ratio (OR), 2. 86; 95 % CI: 1. 21 - 6. 79, P = 0. 024], coagulator experience (OR, 4. 29; 95 % CI: 1. 43 - 12. 86, P = 0. 009), and medicine potentially related to gastric injury/bleeding (OR, 2. 80; 95 % CI: 1. 14 - 6. 90, P = 0. 039). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed significant, independent risk factors: tumor in lower <b>third</b> of <b>stomach</b> (OR, 2. 47; 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 5. 96, P = 0. 044), beginner coagulator (OR, 3. 93; 95 % CI: 1. 29 - 11. 9, P = 0. 016), and medicine (OR, 2. 76; 95 % CI: 1. 09 - 6. 98, P = 0. 032). We classified cases of post-ESD bleeding into two groups (bleeding at the ulcer margin vs bleeding at the center) and found that bleeding at the margin occurred more frequently with beginner coagulators compared with experts (OR, 16. 00; 95 % CI: 1. 22 - 210. 59, P = 0. 040). CONCLUSION: Beginner coagulators, tumor in the antrum, and medicines were significant risk factors for post-ESD bleeding. Bleeding at the ulcer margin frequently occurred with beginner operators...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Multifocal early {{gastric cancer}} (MEGC) is {{frequently}} observed and represents a serious risk when minimally invasive treatments are performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present {{the experience of}} two Italian centers situated in a relatively high incidence area for gastric cancer. Out {{of a total of}} 791 surgical resections for EGC carried out in two Italian centers from 1976 to 2006, we identified 98 patients with multifocal EGC (12. 3 %). Two hundred and sixteen lesions were observed. Generally sited near the principal tumors, secondary lesions were, however, sometimes detected distally from the upper primary lesion. No secondary lesions were detected in the upper third when the principal lesion was sited at the lower third. RESULTS: Survival of MEGC patients was not significantly lower than that of patients with monofocal EGC. No cases of gastric remnant relapse were observed at a mean follow-up of 9 years (range 1 - 28) after subtotal gastrectomy. DISCUSSION: When EGCs are detected, the possibility of MEGC must always be investigated by endoscopy and chromoendoscopy. When a MEGC is found in the lower <b>third</b> of the <b>stomach</b> and chromoendoscopy of the upper third has been performed, subtotal gastrectomy can be considered as sufficient treatment...|$|R
