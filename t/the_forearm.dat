5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. The bones of <b>the</b> <b>forearm</b> (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E

5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around <b>the</b> <b>forearm</b> seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs were {{proportionally}} {{shorter than}} in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus. <b>The</b> <b>forearm</b> was only a quarter the size of the upper arm. There were no carpalia in the hand, so that the metacarpals articulated directly with <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> The hand showed four basic digits, though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones, while the fourth consisted of a single splint-like metacarpal that may have represented an external 'spur'. The fingers themselves were fused and immobile, and may have lacked claws. Carnotaurus differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs, and in having the fourth, splint-like metacarpal as the longest bone in the hand. A 2009 study suggests that the arms were vestigial in abelisaurids, because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today's emus and kiwis, which also have vestigial forelimbs.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} showing that dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers. Some dromaeosaurid fossils preserve long, pennaceous feathers on the hands and arms (remiges) and tail (rectrices), as well as shorter, down-like feathers covering the body. Other fossils, which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers, still preserve the associated bumps on <b>the</b> <b>forearm</b> bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life. Overall, this feather pattern looks very much like Archaeopteryx.|$|E

5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs were robustly {{built and}} {{proportionally}} long, measuring 70% {{of the length}} of the hind limbs. The radius of <b>the</b> <b>forearm</b> measured 70% {{of the length of}} the humerus (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five fingers equipped for grasping. The second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (the thumb). The first three fingers ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.|$|E
5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of <b>the</b> <b>forearm,</b> where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature {{is the presence of}} an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
40|$|The {{relatively}} new term dermatoporosis refers to chronic {{deficiencies in the}} skin's functions in the elderly population due to aging. This syndrome is marked by chronic cutaneous fragility clinically represented by skin atrophy, senile purpura, stellate pseudoscars, skin laceration, and dissecting hematoma of the skin. In this paper, we report three cases of sacral pressure ulcers presenting primary dermatoporosis on <b>the</b> <b>forearms.</b> Case 1 was a 74 -year-old male who presented with a stage IV sacral pressure ulcer. The signs of dermatoporosis appeared on <b>the</b> <b>forearms.</b> Histopathology of <b>the</b> lesions revealed epidermal thinning with loss of rete ridges. Azan and Elastica van Gieson staining demonstrated the degeneration of the dermal collagen fibers and elastic fibers, respectively. In spite of 6 months of treatment, the ulcer failed to heal sufficiently. Case 2 was a 74 -year-old male and Case 3 was a 97 -year-old female. Both cases presented with a stage II sacral pressure ulcer and dermatoporosis on <b>the</b> <b>forearms.</b> Histopathological examinations and the clinical course of the wound could not be ascertained in Cases 2 and 3. None of the patients had previously used corticosteroids. The presence of a primary dermatoporosis on <b>the</b> <b>forearms</b> in these cases {{may be associated with}} the increased risk of pressure ulcer development...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{examined}} the influence of repetition of weight-related sentences on the involuntary pressure forces of <b>the</b> <b>forearms,</b> when in a relaxed state. These forces were involuntary oscillations, exerted by muscle movements of the breathing-cycle and muscle movements of the arm on force sensors. We constructed a linguistic bio-mechanical system (Ablasmi), where in each arm of a padded relaxation chair contained special sensors that were specifically designed to detect the pressure forces of each forearm while participants listened to the specific recorded weight-related sentences. In this experiment we used some classic sentences, such as ‘‘your right/left arm is heavy,’’ inspired by Autogenic Training (Schultz in Le training autogene. Paris, PUF, 1974) and some sentences, such as ‘‘your right/left arm is made of lead,’’ inspired by Grossmann’s relaxation technique. We observed that when the recorded sentences were directed to the right arm {{there was a significant}} increase of involuntary pressure forces on <b>the</b> right <b>forearm.</b> Additionally, we observed the same effect on <b>the</b> left <b>forearm</b> for <b>the</b> sentences directed to <b>the</b> left <b>forearm.</b> Thus, we believe we have provided experimental evidence of a definite linguistic effect of weight-related sentences on the involuntary pressure forces of <b>the</b> <b>forearms.</b> <b>The</b> implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

He had 10 points in an 80–54 victory over Seton Hall on February 17, 2015, and received a hit on the nose from <b>the</b> <b>forearm</b> of Seton Hall guard Sterling Gibbs, who was suspended and subsequently apologized. On March 3, Arcidiacono scored 23 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer, in a 76–72 win over Creighton.

5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of <b>the</b> <b>forearm,</b> arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
5|$|Theropods, {{including}} spinosaurids, {{could not}} pronate their hands (rotate <b>the</b> <b>forearm</b> so the palm faced the ground), but a resting {{position on the}} side of the hand was possible, as shown by fossil prints from an Early Jurassic theropod. A 2014 paper describing new material of Spinosaurus, proposed that its legs were too short for it to move effectively on land. The reconstruction used in the study was an extrapolation based on different sized individuals, scaled to what was assumed to be the correct proportions. Palaeontologist John Hutchinson of the Royal Veterinary College of the University of London has expressed scepticism to the new reconstruction, and cautioned that using different specimens can result in inaccurate chimaeras. Scott Hartman also expressed criticism because he believed the legs and the pelvis were inaccurately scaled (27% too short) and didn't match the published lengths. However, responses from Ibrahim et al. to Mark Witton have been positively received as reliable. The 2015 re-description of Sigilmassasaurus Evers et al. 2015 doubted whether the material assigned to Spinosaurus by Ibrahim et. al. belonged to it.|$|E
5|$|Before {{arrival at}} the Ely Road, a small {{detachment}} of troops were ordered across the Hemp Field to enter the village from the east. The larger group then charged at a hard gallop down the Mill Street incline through to Main Street. The rioters were found making a stand in The George and Dragon near {{the west end of}} Station Road. The militia were called to the front when the rioters would not come out after being ordered to by Bate Dudley. Thomas South, shooting from a window, hit trooper Wallace in <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> The militia got the rioters out of the public house and assembled them in the street, surrounded by the troopers. Thomas Sindall attempted to take a musket from trooper William Porter but was not successful. Sindall ran away and when he did not stop after being called on to do so by Porter, he was shot through the back of the head. Thomas Sindall was killed; he was the only person known to be at both Downham Market and Littleport. The result of this shooting was to subdue the rest of the rioters. Those captured were taken to Ely gaol {{and the rest of the}} rioters were rounded up.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in <b>the</b> <b>forearm,</b> but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

During the Second Test, it was the turn of Charlie Griffith to send O'Neill to hospital, after hitting him on <b>the</b> <b>forearm</b> and causing a large bruise. His 51 and 74* in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, the last Test of his career, was the only time he passed 50 for the series. He ended with 266 runs at 44.33, missing the Fifth Test due to a broken hand. He managed a healthy return with the ball, taking nine of his 17 Test wickets in the series with an average of 25.55. This included his Test best of 4/41 with his leg-spinin the Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad. In this match, he cleaned up the hosts' tail in the first innings, removing Jackie Hendriks, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith and Lance Gibbs.|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx was anatomically {{similar to}} Compsognathus, differing from its European {{relatives}} in its proportions. The skull of Sinosauropteryx was 15% longer than its thigh bones, unlike in Compsognathus, where {{the skull and}} thigh bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of Sinosauropteryx (humerus and radius) were only 30% the length of its legs (thigh bone and shin), compared to 40% in Compsognathus. Additionally, Sinosauropteryx had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 vertebrae in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod. Its hands were long compared to its arms, about 84% to 91% {{of the length of}} the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot. The first and second digits were about the same length, with a large claw on the first digit. The first fingers were large, being both longer and thicker than either of the bones of <b>the</b> <b>forearm.</b> The teeth differed slightly (they were heterodont) based on position: those near the tips of the upper jaws (on the premaxillae) were slender and lacked serrations, while those behind them (on the maxillae) were serrated and laterally compressed. The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.|$|E
