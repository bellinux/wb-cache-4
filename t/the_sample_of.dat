5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} from two specimens: a damaged cranium (skull without mandibles, or lower jaws) lacking the back part (the parietal bones and further back) {{as well as}} the incisors, canines, and second premolars; and another damaged cranium lacking the same parts {{as well as the}} left toothrow. Both show no {{evidence}} of ongoing tooth replacement, indicating that the permanent dentition is complete. M.macpheei was larger in most measurements than M.brevicaudata, but because of small samples, some differences are not statistically significant. The length of the bony palate in the two specimens of M.macpheei is 9.4 and 9.7mm, compared to 7.1 to 9.0mm in eight adult M.brevicaudata. In both specimens, the length of the molar row is 3.0mm, compared to 2.4 to 2.8mm in <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> M.brevicaudata.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, about a quarter of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E

25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> galaxy clusters studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample of galaxy clusters detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to mass selection effects because the more massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|E

25|$|Dentition, or {{the study}} of teeth, is an {{important}} area of study for archaeologists, especially those specializing in {{the study of}} older remains. Dentition affords many advantages over studying the rest of the skeleton itself (osteometry). The structure and arrangement of teeth is constant and, although it is inherited, does not undergo extensive change during environmental change, dietary specializations, or alterations in use patterns. The rest of the skeleton is much more likely to exhibit change because of adaptation. Teeth also preserve better than bone, and so <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> teeth available to archaeologists is much more extensive and therefore more representative.|$|E

40|$|There is {{variability}} in the estimation of an equating transformation because common-item parameters are obtained from responses <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> examinees. <b>The</b> most commonly used standard error of equating quantifies this source <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> error, which decreases as <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> size <b>of</b> examinees used to derive the transformation increases. In a similar way of reasoning, the common items that are embedded in test forms are also sampled from a larger pool of items that could potentially serve as common items. Thus, there is additional error variance due to <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> common items. Currently, common items are treated as fixed; the conventional standard error of equating captures only the variance due to <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>of</b> examinees.

At first, Dutch colonial country houses simply imitated the generous eaves of Javanese houses. By the beginning of 19th-century, Dutch Indies country houses resembles more like Javanese houses, due to its ability to counter the intense tropical heat and heavy rain while allowing air to flow into the interior. This style of Dutch colonial architecture, known as Indies Style (Dutch Indo Europeesche Stijl or Indische stijl), is a sample of complete assimilation of Dutch architecture into local indigenous Javanese houses. Unfortunately not so many houses of this type survived in Indonesia, and most surviving houses are deteriorating.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory was}} {{submitted}} that Princess Doe {{may have been}} a runaway and could have been an individual using false names while employed at a hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Six people have recently come forward with suspected identities of Princess Doe. In 2012, a sample of her hair and a tooth were examined through isotope analysis and indicated that the victim was most likely born in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> her hair indicated that she had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States. The tooth sample indicated she could possibly be from Arizona. It is also believed that the girl had spent {{a long period of time}} in Long Island, New York. After seeing images of the girl's clothing on a newspaper, a woman reported to officials that she remembered seeing a girl wearing the same clothing as Princess Doe on July 13, 1982, just two days before her body was found. The woman claimed that she was shopping with her daughter at a store across from the cemetery and observed the victim's unique clothing. The shirt and skirt themselves were traced to a manufacturer in the Midwestern United States, although the brand labels were missing. Three people reported that they bought similar clothes, after viewing photos, at a Long Island store, which is now closed. It is unknown if the store was specifically located in Long Island or possibly in other locations. The 2012 composite of the victim also generated new tips, as it resembled several missing girls from the country.|$|E
