40|$|AbstractIn PFBR, Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) {{is used to}} {{transfer}} heat from Primary Sodium to Secondary Sodium. A scaled down model of PFBR IHX has been designed as per design code rules of RCC-MR. In this scaled down model, main portion of IHX like <b>tube</b> <b>sheets,</b> <b>tubes</b> and down comer are designed innovatively. The ligament efficiency and radial & circumferential hole pattern are simulated for top & bottom <b>tube</b> <b>sheets.</b> A 2 D Axis-symmetric finite element model of the scaled down model has been made and detailed structural analysis {{has been carried out}} via software called CAST 3 M. Design and development of a scaled down model to simulate the deformation as well as stress distribution realistically, establishing the test setup and procedures for causing crack initiation and depicting the enhanced understanding of RCC-MR design procedures of <b>tube</b> <b>sheets</b> specific to heat exchanger are the novel features of this paper...|$|R

50|$|Several {{sections}} of the fire box have been cut away and replaced {{as well as a}} section of the rear <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> that was worn too thin to support the operating steam pressure. A new <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> section has been cut and using the heat and beat method has been molded into place. It is now in the contractor's shop to have the new holes drilled in it.|$|E
50|$|Tube Cutters- Tube Cutters {{are used}} to {{internally}} cut from the inside {{to the outside of}} the tube behind the <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> on one end. This lessens the force required to pull a tube. To eliminate tube cutting chips in the vessel, tubes should be scored and not totally cut through. The tube cutter needs to have sufficient reach to cut behind the <b>tube</b> <b>sheet.</b> Proper lubrication and cutting speed will increase cutting blade life.|$|E

Overall width was 144 in, so they were delivered without their cabs and the front, low-pressure cylinders and were assembled after arrival. The 48 in low-pressure cylinders (on 90 in centers) were the largest on any US locomotive; the cylinders had to be inclined a few degrees to provide clearance. The boiler was also the largest diameter of any locomotive; Railway Mech Engnr says [...] "the outside diameter of the largest course is 112+7/8 in."

5000|$|Many {{plumbers}} and steamfitters {{are aware}} of this phenomenon, which is called [...] "water hammer". A few ounce [...] "slug" [...] of water passing through a steam line at high velocity and striking a 90 degree elbow can instantly fracture a fitting that is otherwise capable of handling several times the normal static pressure. It can then be understood that a few hundred, or even a few thousand pounds of water moving at the same velocity inside a boiler shell can easily blow out a <b>tube</b> <b>sheet,</b> collapse a firebox, even toss the entire boiler a surprising distance through reaction as the water exits the boiler, like the recoil of a heavy cannon firing a ball.|$|E
50|$|At {{each end}} of the shell, a sheet of {{sufficient}} thickness usually made of stainless steel is provided, with holes for the tubes to be inserted and rolled. The inlet end of each tube is also bellmouthed for streamlined entry of water. This is to avoid eddies at the inlet of each tube giving rise to erosion, and to reduce flow friction. Some makers also recommend plastic inserts at the entry of tubes to avoid eddies eroding the inlet end. In smaller units some manufacturers use ferrules to seal the tube ends instead of rolling. To take care of length wise expansion of tubes some designs have expansion joint between the shell and the <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> allowing the latter to move longitudinally. In smaller units some sag is given to the tubes to take care of tube expansion with both end water boxes fixed rigidly to the shell.|$|E
50|$|In steam {{locomotive}} use, {{by far the}} most common form of superheater is the fire-tube type. This takes the saturated steam supplied in the dry pipe into a superheater header mounted against the <b>tube</b> <b>sheet</b> in the smokebox. The steam is then passed through a number of superheater elements - long pipes which are placed inside large diameter fire tubes, called flues. Hot combustion gases from the locomotive's fire pass through these flues just like they do the firetubes, and as well as heating the water they also heat the steam inside the superheater elements they flow over. The superheater element doubles back on itself so that the heated steam can return; most do this twice at the fire end and once at the smokebox end, so that the steam travels a distance of four times the header's length while being heated. The superheated steam, at the end of its journey through the elements, passes into a separate compartment of the superheater header and then to the cylinders as normal.|$|E
50|$|This domain {{is found}} in all tubulin chains, {{as well as the}} {{bacterial}} FtsZ family of proteins. These proteins are involved in polymer formation. Tubulin is the major component of microtubules, while FtsZ is the polymer-forming protein of bacterial cell division, {{it is part of a}} ring in the middle of the dividing cell that is required for constriction of cell membrane and cell envelope to yield two daughter cells.
