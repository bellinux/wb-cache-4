500|$|The episode {{centered}} on Kirk Acevedo's character Charlie Francis. Acevedo explained in an interview, [...] "Charlie goes {{out on this}} call, and he gets attacked by this mythological, genetically enhanced griffin. He fights for his life throughout the episode". Acevedo suggested that his wife, actress Kiersten Warren, play his character's wife Sonia, and the producers duly cast her. Acevedo explained his choice was because, [...] "to create intimacy with someone who you don't know is actually not going to work. So <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> real wife do it, then {{you can be a}} lot better on screen".|$|E

500|$|According to Yorke, {{the first}} verse — [...] "I'll drown my beliefs / <b>To</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> babies / I'll dress like your niece / And wash your swollen feet" [...] — {{addresses}} the [...] "difference between young and old", when people {{grow out of}} childish behaviour; the narrator is offering not {{to grow up to}} keep someone they love. The lines [...] "And true love lives / On lollipops and crisps" [...] were inspired by a story Yorke read about a child who was left alone by his parents for days and survived by eating junk food. The song features a [...] "pleading" [...] refrain: [...] "Don't leave, don't leave." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015, she was {{featured}} on a Canadian postage stamp along with teammate Kadeisha Buchanan commemorating the 2015 Women's World Cup hosted in Canada. On June 30, 2017, she {{was appointed to}} the Order of Canada. Of the honor she said, [...] "I am a very, very proud Canadian, I am proud of where I am from, and to be recognized in this nature is surreal. It's not something you can dream about happening to you. I can dream of winning a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal, and that's my job, but <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> country recognize you – I don't even know what to say." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} of the episode, Hader ad-libbed calypso scat singing, which series creator Loren Bouchard cited as an [...] "amazing [...] when a person comes in and ad-libs music." [...] Bouchard further stated: [...] "There's something so musical about it and he's clearly so talented, but it's also silly and in character. It's nice <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> cake and eat it, too." [...] Hader's singing is incorporated into a scene in the episode where Mickey sings while making a hole in Bob's basement wall, and is later reprised in the episode's end credits. The same scene sees Mickey attempting {{to cover up the}} hole with a Big film poster, which serves as a reference to the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E

500|$|The {{airing of}} the series had been stalled for a year, perhaps due to {{difficulties}} within the CBC. To get CBC to adopt the series, Peyton showed the company a commercial with the CBC logo in blood, remarking that [...] "It's been way too long that you've waited <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> logo covered in blood." [...] He had also said that What It's Like Being Alone was meant to attract university {{and high school students}} as an audience, and he felt that these people did not ordinarily watch the CBC. [...] CBC itself was looking for original material, and was enthusiastic about the series because it seemed to stand out among Canadian television productions. [...] Peyton's co-producer was Fred Fuchs, who later rose in the CBC staff; one critic believed Fuchs' promotion to be a reason why CBC adopted the series.|$|E
500|$|Hollywood actor Al Pacino {{enjoyed the}} film's promotion, {{saying that the}} promos and posters {{reminded}} him of The Godfather when business associate Barry Navidi showed him the theatrical trailer (Pacino portrayed Michael Corleone, son of Vito Corleone). Akshay Kumar said of Pacino's response: [...] "A touch of appreciation is always held dearly in an actor's arms, even if it's from the simplest of people like our beloved spot boys. But <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> work spoken of so kindly by the world's most admired gangster Al Pacino himself – I had goose-bumps thinking about him watching the promo! I was so humbled, not only as an actor but as a fan of his legendary work. I pray he enjoys the final piece {{as much as he}} enjoyed the promo!" [...] Actor Rishi Kapoor, on whom the original version of the song Tayyab Ali was picturized in Amar Akbar Anthony, praised Imran Khan's performance and the song after an impromptu meeting with Khan (who was concerned about comparisons between the versions) during a dubbing session for the film.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noted {{generally}} that natural justice is a fundamental element {{of the rule of}} law. In administrative law, the two principles of natural justice, which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights, are the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua, or [...] "no man a judge in his own cause") and the right to be heard (audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side"). In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd. & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd. (1978), the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of [...] "fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties." [...] Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999, MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice, which he described thus: [...] "atural justice requires essentially two basic principles. One is that {{you have the right to}} be heard and to explain your case, and, two, is the right to equal treatment. A right <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> case heard also means that there is a review." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the early}} {{release of the}} lyrics, it had {{garnered}} criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona, claiming that the usage of the terms [...] "chola" [...] and [...] "orient" [...] was offensive and derogatory. In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned {{the use of the}} term [...] "chola", asking, [...] "Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is your job and it is your duty as young people <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not stop, you must protest peaceably." ...|$|E
500|$|Certain {{elements}} {{gained a}} more mixed response. GameSpot felt that Sonic Advance lacked polish, and criticized the hard-to-master special stages. IGNs only criticism was {{the presence of}} problems from prior titles, such as [...] "an inviting stretch of roadway that begs <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> character blaze across it at top speed, only to have a spike strip jab you in the feet somewhere in the middle". Nintendo World Report thought the game was too short and criticized {{the exclusion of the}} Super Sonic replay mode from earlier games. Reception to SonicN was mixed; GameSpot criticized its choppy frame rate and encouraged readers to instead buy the superior GBA version. IGN agreed and felt the ported version was damaged by the N-Gage's vertical screen and omission of the multiplayer modes. Regarding the game as a whole, critics felt Sonic Advance was a solid entry in the Sonic franchise. Nintendo World Report felt the game was not perfect but was still a game that [...] "deserves a spot in your GBA case". IGN agreed, and stated the game successfully re-captured the spirit of classic Sonic gameplay while taking advantage of the GBA's capabilities. In 2009, Official Nintendo Magazine named it among the best games ever produced for a Nintendo platform.|$|E
500|$|Ross and O'Reilly {{soon came}} to the usual {{division}} of labor between the director and assistant: the director would handle public affairs and make policy decisions as needed, while the assistant dealt with the day-to-day business of the bureau. Ross undertook a heavy travel schedule, visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. [...] This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting director. The two women carried on a businesslike but warm correspondence during these times, with O'Reilly writing to Ross (who had embarked {{on a tour of}} the mints) [...] "I am so anxious <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> mind at ease about the office here [...] that I have resorted to rather frequent telegrams. [...] They are so much more direct and up to date than letters... my love to you and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions." [...] Scheer suggests that O'Reilly would have found Ross's reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts.|$|E

500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> son get shot in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E
