He is a crafty, cynical, {{sometimes}} bitter type, {{skeptical about}} the Soviet government, and often <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> his own good. He is sometimes portrayed as an otkaznik ("refusenik"): someone who is refused permission to emigrate to Israel.|$|E
500|$|Jenna tells Pete {{that she}} wishes to insert a music number called [...] "Muffin Top" [...] into the show, which she claims {{is a big}} hit overseas. As a prank, Frank and Toofer tell her that several {{people are going to}} be fired. Believing them, Jenna tries to seduce a NBC {{executive}} whom she sees talking to Jack. Liz later notifies Jenna that no one is going to be fired, and that the executive is actually an extra on the show. Jenna aims to get back at the pair, and although Toofer admits that he was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> Jenna's tactics, Frank is seen running around naked outside Jack's balcony. Jenna finally gets her chance to perform [...] "Muffin Top", unaware that the show has already ended and the number was scratched at the last moment, thanks to Liz.|$|E
500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, three deleted {{scenes from}} [...] "Beauty Pageant" [...] were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first 90-second clip, April seeks beauty contestant advice from Leslie, who tells her to act differently from her usual behavior. While awaiting the talent contest, April lists a number of her unusual talents, including inventing emoticons, convincing her mother she is adopted, instantly making security guards suspicious and determining if someone is fat or pregnant [...] "with 60 percent accuracy". In the second 1-minute and 15 second clip, Ann tries to explain to Mark she is not hinting at sex when she asks him to [...] "fix her shower", and Sanderson talks about his insecurities, including that Leslie might be <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> him. In the final 90-second clip, Tom expresses anger that the swimsuit competition {{has been removed from}} the contest, and tries to convince the judges to reinstate it during their deliberations.|$|E

She's <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> and advanced <b>for</b> my taste, but her people have some standing. It looks as if she were attracted by Sedgwick; she's undoubtedly gracious to him." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Fortwo has {{received}} much {{attention in the}} U.S. In its April 2008 issue, Men's Vogue raised the question, [...] "in a nation where your supersized car is your castle, is the <b>Smart</b> <b>too</b> mini <b>for</b> a man?".|$|R
5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to {{join their}} {{exhibition}} basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged {{by the fact that}} owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to speak with him, then he was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to play <b>for</b> Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|R
500|$|Justin Ravitz of PopMatters {{called the}} series a [...] "cleverly trashy postmodern soap" [...] and {{credited}} it for reviving {{the soap opera}} genre, which he felt had disappeared but still suited American culture. He compared the pilot to Sex and the City, declaring it [...] "could potentially replace the departed Sex as the TV Sunday ritual for women and gay men everywhere, although DH is the guiltier pleasure of the two." [...] However, he noted the contrasting tones and dynamics between the two series, and stated that the friendships between Desperate Housewives four leading women seemed [...] "tenuous," [...] opining, [...] "the sisterly, sugar-swapping connection between the surviving women is superficial, and clearly vulnerable to shifting alliances, acts of betrayal and crowd-pleasing cat-fights." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety called the pilot [...] "oodles of fun." [...] He complimented the cast, stating that while Hatcher provides [...] "the emotional core" [...] of the series, [...] "nearly everyone is intriguing {{in one way or}} another," [...] and predicted that Eva Longoria would become the show's breakout star. However, Lowry noted that Desperate Housewives may be [...] "a little <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> its own good" [...] and expressed concern over the series' [...] "soapy elements." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post praised the pilot, assessing, [...] "In visual style, witty language, borderline surrealism and overall mad attitude, [...] stands on a mountaintop all its own, the best new drama of the season and perhaps the best new comedy, too." [...] He complimented Cross and Hatcher's performances, as well as the writing for the Mary Alice character's narrations. The Futon Critic selected the pilot as the 26th best television episode of 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} favourably {{reviewed}} in other places, among them such American newspapers as the Los Angeles Times, Monsters and Critics, USA Today, Seattle Times, Chicago Sun-Times and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. However, some reviews were critical; Kirsten Garrett suggested in her review that, The Book of General Ignorance [...] "is {{in danger of}} being <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> its own good. In fact, a bit smart-arse." [...] She also noted that [...] "It's a disgrace that in a book of this kind there is no index. It's not possible to look up a subject about which you are ignorant".|$|E

5000|$|Galdikas's {{conservation}} efforts have extended well beyond advocacy, largely focusing on {{rehabilitation of the}} many orphaned orangutans turned over to her for care. Many of these orphans were once illegal pets, before becoming <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> and difficult <b>for</b> their owners to handle. [...] Galdikas's rehabilitation efforts through Foundation International (OFI) also include the preservation of rainforest. Although one Canadian author in the late 1990s [...] was critical of the rehabilitation methods, the ongoing birth of new orangutans among the formerly-rehabilitated adult orangutans at Camp Leakey {{is part of what}} makes it the longest continual study of a single species.|$|R
5000|$|... "Frank Sinatra" [...] is {{credited}} as an electroclash and techno song, and is {{noted for its}} use of deadpan. In the song, Miss Kittin discusses having sex in limousines. According to Terry Sawyer of PopMatters, [...] "In a deadpan cadence done in the accent of Ilsa the She-Wolf of The SS, Miss Kittin ..., created decadent club music for people <b>too</b> arch and <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> typical white label fare. It was a deader and more desolate take on tired convention of the house beat and unknown diva repeating a pithy chorus ad nauseum sic, an alleged elevation of cliché through the detachment of kitsch.|$|R

5000|$|The {{mayor of}} the village {{attempts}} to recruit volunteers to help rescue their villagers, but realize the situation is hopeless because Sylvester is <b>too</b> fast and <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> them. Then, one of the mice suggests calling on Speedy Gonzales {{to help with the}} rescue effort. After realizing that he is on vacation in Guadalajara, another mouse comments that Speedy [...] "would come all the way from Guadalajara to visit my seester Carmella." [...] With that, Carmella is recruited to place a long-distance call to Speedy; seconds after the call is placed, Speedy races to the village to begin the rescue effort.|$|R
5000|$|Mother {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, and holds a 90% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 41 reviews. Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave Mother 3.5 stars {{out of a}} possible 4, writing that while the premise seemed like the setup for a cheap sitcom, Brooks [...] "is much <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> to settle <b>for</b> the obvious gags and payoffs. ... The dialogue in [...] "Mother" [...] is written so carefully that some lines carry two or three nuances." [...] The audience laughter wasn't a reaction to obvious punchlines, wrote Ebert, [...] "but the laughter of recognition, of insight, even sometimes of squirmy discomfort, as the truths hit close to home." ...|$|R
5000|$|A fourth film, Damsels in Distress, was {{released}} in 2011, premiering out of competition as the closing film at the 68th Venice International Film Festival. The Guardian in 2012 compared Stillman to Terrence Malick, another filmmaker who has [...] "come to owe {{a good part of}} their mystique to the very paucity of their oeuvre ... the lengthy gaps in between films have created expectations that are hard to fulfil, and admirers have been inclined to overestimate their achievement." [...] A reviewer at Salon opined that the reason for the long gaps between his films is that [...] "Stillman is sometimes simply <b>too</b> damn <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> his own good. You can't always tell at whom he's poking fun, or why, and it becomes unfortunately easy to typecast him as the WASP answer to Woody Allen and conclude that his movies are insufferably irritating documents of privilege. He himself is aware of that possibility the whole time, and bastes his entire worldview in a rueful, ironic-romantic glaze." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] said Adam; [...] "you're not accountable. Looks as if {{the other}} fellow was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> both of us; but I had a feeling I'd better stick to tinto and siphon. You can {{generally}} taste anything suspicious in that mixture and I've been doped before. But, as I'm an American citizen and American influence is powerful, I didn't expect they'd be bold enough to get after me." ...|$|E

I've got traps set for him, but he's been <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> me so far. He's a big feller, and his skin will grade No. 1 prime. If we can get him the thieves are welcome to all the rest of our furs." ...|$|E
60|$|Aunt Dahlia, who {{was sitting}} with a bevy of the local nibs in the second row, sighted me as I entered and waved to me to join her, but I was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> that.

The essence of strategy on these occasions is to be as near the door as possible.|$|E

As for the other wounds, they are strapped up and bandaged, and he said that unless they inflamed badly, they would be best let alone for a time. So sit down quietly, and let me hear the news." ...|$|R

6000|$|Jordan {{knew what}} she meant, though he could not grasp her purpose in {{pressing}} the point. [...] "It wouldn't be business if I did.

If another man tries to get the things you want you naturally have to fight, but it's wiser to grin and bear it when he's <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>for</b> you.
