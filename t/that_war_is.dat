25|$|Orwell wrote a {{critique}} of George Bernard Shaw's play Arms and the Man. He considered this Shaw's best play and {{the most likely to}} remain socially relevant, because of its theme <b>that</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> not, generally speaking, a glorious romantic adventure. His 1945 essay In Defense of P.G. Wodehouse contains an amusing assessment of Wodehouse's writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not really make him a traitor. He accused The Ministry of Information of exaggerating Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.|$|E

One of the town's leading minds, 'Nathaniel Nye' is recorded as testing a Birmingham cannon in 1643. Nye also experimented with a saker in Deritend in 1645. From 1645 he became the master gunner to the Parliamentarian garrison at Evesham and in 1646 he successfully directs the artillery at the Siege of Worcester, detailing his experiences and in his 1647 book The Art of Gunnery, believing <b>that</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> as much a science as an art.|$|E

[...] Multiple Hugo-award winner Poul Anderson also defended some of the novel's positions, arguing [...] "Heinlein has recognized the problem of selective versus nonselective franchise, and his proposed solution does merit discussion." [...] Heinlein also received some complaints {{about the lack of}} conscription in Starship Troopers. When he wrote the novel, the military draft was still in effect in the U.S.|$|E

[...] Bennett also claimed that former President George W. Bush personally told him at the Kennedy Center in December 2005 that he felt he had made a mistake invading Iraq, to which a Bush spokesperson replied, [...] "This account is flatly wrong." [...] Following bad press resulting from his remarks, Bennett clarified his position, writing: [...] "There is simply no excuse for terrorism and the murder of the nearly 3,000 innocent victims of the 9/11 attacks on our country. My life experiences, ranging from the Battle of the Bulge to marching with Martin Luther King, made me a life-long humanist and pacifist, and reinforced my belief that violence begets violence and <b>that</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> the lowest form of human behavior." ...|$|E

During his time in combat, Benedetto narrowly escaped death several times. The experience made him a pacifist; he would later write, [...] "Anybody who thinks <b>that</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> romantic obviously hasn't gone through one," [...] and later say, [...] "It was a nightmare that's permanent. I just said, 'This is not life. This is not life.'" [...] At the war's conclusion he was involved in the liberation of a Nazi concentration camp near Landsberg, where some American prisoners of war from the 63rd Division had also been held.|$|E

2500|$|Disappointed by McClellan's {{failure to}} destroy Lee's army, Lincoln named Ambrose Burnside as {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac. Burnside ordered an attack across the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia. Delays in bridging the river allowed Lee's army ample time to organize strong defenses, and the Union frontal assault on December 13, 1862 was a disaster. There were 12,600 Union casualties to 5,000 Confederate; {{one of the most}} one-sided battles in the Civil War. After this victory, Lee reportedly said [...] "It is well <b>that</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> so terrible, else we should grow too fond of it."

[...] The book praises the faith {{of a group of}} former warriors who took an oath of complete pacifism, refusing to take arms even to defend themselves and their people. However, 2,000 of their descendants, who had not taken the oath of their parents not to take up arms against their enemies, chose to go to battle against the Lamanites, and it states that in their battles the 2,000 men were protected by God through their faith and, though many were injured, none of them died.|$|E

2500|$|According to Neil DeVotta (an Associate Professor of Political Science), the mytho-history {{described}} in the Mahavamsa [...] "justifies dehumanizing non-Sinhalese, if doing so is necessary to preserve, protect, and propagate the dhamma (Buddhist doctrine). Furthermore, it legitimizes a just war doctrine, provided <b>that</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> waged to protect Buddhism. Together with the Vijaya myth, it introduces the bases for the Sinhalese Buddhist belief that Lord Buddha designated the island of Sri Lanka as a repository for Theravada Buddhism. It claims the Sinhalese were the first humans to inhabit the island (as those who predated the Sinhalese were subhuman) and are thus the true [...] "sons of the soil". Additionally, it institutes {{the belief that the}} island's kings were beholden to protect and foster Buddhism. All of these legacies have had ramifications for the trajectory of political Buddhism and Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism." ...|$|E
