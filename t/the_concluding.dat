5|$|England and France were in <b>the</b> <b>concluding</b> {{stages of}} the Hundred Years War. The French {{did not wish to}} lose their {{advantage}} in the fight by sending knights and the English were in no position to do so. Spain was in the final {{stages of the}} Reconquista.

Further fighting among the German princes and the Hussite wars seriously reduced the willingness of most to perform a crusade.

5|$|More than 200 Upanishads are known, {{of which}} the first dozen or so are {{the oldest and most}} {{important}} and are referred to as the principal or main (mukhya) Upanishads. The mukhya Upanishads are found mostly in <b>the</b> <b>concluding</b> part of the Brahmanas and Aranyakas and were, for centuries, memorized by each generation and passed down orally. The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, five of them in all likelihood pre-Buddhist (6th century BCE), down to the Maurya period. Of the remainder, 95 Upanishads are part of the Muktika canon, composed from about the last centuries of 1st-millennium BCE through about 15th-century CE. New Upanishads, beyond the 108 in the Muktika canon, continued to be composed through the early modern and modern era, though often dealing with subjects which are unconnected to the Vedas.|$|E
