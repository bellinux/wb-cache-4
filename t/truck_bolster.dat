50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident was {{the failure of the}} 18th rail car to properly negotiate a curve because of the inadequate side bearing clearance of the B-end truck assembly, likely due to a broken side bearing wedge plate attachment bolt, which caused a wheel to climb the rail, which derailed the car. Contributing to the derailment was (1) the undesirable contact of the <b>truck</b> <b>bolster</b> bowl rim with the car body center plate and (2) the hollow worn wheels on the 18th car, which further diminished the steering ability of the truck assembly.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{problem of}} {{determining}} the residual life of frame bogie elements of locomotives is a great importance for predicting their work safely and avoidance potential failures on the track. This especially concern cases when such elements have creep-fatigue cracks which grow under action of cyclic loading with excerpts T 1 in the cycle and reach their critical size. Here {{the question of the}} propagation of such defects (cracks) arises, their kinetics and about the period of subcritical cracks growth. The aim is to develop a calculation model for determination the period of subcritical creep-fatigue cracks growth in the bogies frames of electric locomotive. The model takes into account the basic parameters of load, geometry of the construction element and cracks. Methodology. The calculation model for determination the period of subcritical creep-fatigue cracks growth in structural elements of frame under conditions of variable load time has been formulated. It is based on the first law of thermodynamics concerning to mechanics of solids slow fracture at low temperature creep and variable loadings. It is assumed that the period of unsteady creep dominates here (the first section of the creep curve). Low-temperature creep is creep of materials at temperatures T 0 < 0, 5 Tmp, where Tmp − the melting point of the material. Findings. The analytical formula for the determination of the stress intensity factor of <b>truck</b> <b>bolster</b> with technological hole has been obtained. It is shown that by experimentally established constants of the material using the proposed analytical relations can easily determine residual resource of the bogie frame elements. Originality. The new mathematical model for describing the kinetics of creep-fatigue cracks growth in the frames bogies of electric locomotive under variable in time loadings with various time excerpts and on this base the period determination of subcritical crack growth has been proposed. Practical value. Formulated model can serve as a basis for engineering calculation methods to determine the residual life of structural elements with cracks, working on joint action of cyclic loading and unsteady creep...|$|E
50|$|Logging <b>bolster</b> <b>trucks,</b> with a <b>bolster</b> trailer, {{were used}} to carry long loads like logs, poles, and bridge sections. When {{unloaded}} the trailer could be loaded onto the truck. There were no <b>bolster</b> <b>trucks</b> in the M939 series.|$|R
50|$|The {{redesigned}} <b>trucks</b> <b>bolstered</b> sales, with 400,000 sold during 2001-2002 {{and nearly}} 450,000 sold during 2002-2003, {{a new high}} point for the Ram name. At the same time, both Ford and GM trucks were increasing in sales from a 2001 peak over 850,000 to the 900,000 range. But with 400,543 Rams sold that year, the Ram's sales could {{not keep up with}} the eleventh-generation F-150 in 2004. The primary reason was that Dodge did not manufacture a true crew cab to compete with Ford and other manufacturers.|$|R
25|$|Even {{after the}} GOH program, several NYCTA-operated R44s were retired due to various mishaps. Cars 5319 and 5402 were retired after {{separate}} fire-related incidents. Cars 5282-5285 {{were involved in}} a derailment north of 135th Street, resulting in the whole set being placed out of service; however, 5284 was later repaired using parts from other cars and returned to service until retiring along with the other NYCTA R44 cars in 2010. Car 5248 was taken out of service in 2004 due to cracked <b>truck</b> <b>bolsters.</b> While 5282 and 5319 were completely destroyed and subsequently scrapped in the late 1990s, the other cars were stored out of service for parts until they were scrapped in 2013 {{with the rest of the}} NYCTA-operated cars.|$|R
50|$|The company's main {{products}} are {{special purpose vehicles}} such as dumpers, short loggers, timber trucks, pipe <b>trucks</b> and <b>bolsters,</b> as well as wheels for cars, trucks, trolleybuses, trailers and semi-trailers and for heavy hauler and road construction machinery. In addition, the company produces forgings and presses used in manufacture of pipeline armature, cars and trucks, special-purpose equipment, vehicles, railway transport.|$|R
50|$|Powered {{by a pair}} of 16 {{cylinder}} ALCO 251C diesel engines, and {{rated at}} , it was ALCO's answer to the EMD DD35 and the GE U50. The C855 rode on four two-axle trucks, grouped in pairs linked by span bolsters, giving a wheel arrangement of B+B-B+B. The <b>trucks</b> and <b>bolsters</b> were similar to those under UP's earlier turbine locomotives. Only two A units and one B unit were built, all for Union Pacific Railroad, which had also requested double-engined locomotives from EMD and GE in order to replace the turbines, which had become uneconomical to operate.|$|R
5000|$|The U50 rode on four two-axle trucks, grouped {{in pairs}} linked by span bolsters, giving a wheel {{arrangement}} of B+B-B+B. The <b>trucks</b> and <b>bolsters</b> were re-used from scrapped UP turbine locomotives built by GE during the 1950s. The U50 {{was built in}} response to the Union Pacific Railroad's requirement, issued in the early 1960s, for a [...] 3-unit locomotive intended to replace the turbines. The design was effectively two U25B locomotives on a single frame; each diesel engine and generator powered only the two trucks at the same end. Three were delivered to the UP in October 1963, and three to the Southern Pacific Railroad in May and June 1964. Other locomotives built to this requirement were the EMD DD35 and the ALCO Century 855.|$|R

500|$|The E60s began {{arriving}} in November 1974, {{when they became}} the first locomotives to carry Amtrak's Phase II livery. Problems soon developed, as the locomotives yawed sideways when accelerating, stressing the rails. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation after a derailment at Elkton, Maryland on February 24, 1975, revealed problems with the <b>truck</b> and <b>bolster</b> design. The Federal Railroad Administration restricted the maximum speed of the E60s to [...] While Amtrak accepted the locomotives and publicly expressed [...] "confidence" [...] {{that they would be}} cleared for [...] operation, it also arranged for a trial of the Swedish-built four-axle Rc4 electric locomotive. The problems with the E60 persisted into 1977, at which point Amtrak developed the specification for a locomotive based on the Rc4 design. In 1977–78 Amtrak ordered the first of 53 EMD AEM-7s, a twin-cab B-B electric locomotive produced by Electro-Motive Division.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the <b>truck</b> (bogie) <b>bolster,</b> its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur gearing, in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|R
50|$|Brazil {{has some}} of the {{heaviest}} iron ore trains in the world, and these run on the metre gauge track of the EFVM railway, these trains are pulled by a fleet of specially built locomotives that utilize 4-axle trucks or two pairs of 2-axle <b>trucks</b> with span <b>bolsters.</b> The first model of locomotive built specially for this duty was the DDM45, created by EMD in 1970. 83 examples were delivered to the EFVM. Later, in the early 1990s the EFVM also ordered BB40-8M models from General Electric and continues to order further BB40-9W models, also from GE.|$|R
